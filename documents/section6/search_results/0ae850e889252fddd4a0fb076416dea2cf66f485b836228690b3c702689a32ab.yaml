    Abstract The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations Agenda
    2030 represent an ambitious blueprint to reduce inequalities globally and achieve
    a sustainable future for all mankind. Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated
    approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and
    stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society.
    To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario-based
    approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences
    in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural,
    technical, and social dimensions of human-water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology
    has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable
    understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human
    systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scientific
    challenges to strengthen the field and broaden its scope. These include engagement
    with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust,
    cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which
    people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development
    of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation
    of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing
    sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward
    meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time.
    Key Points The crises that humanity faces over access to a clean water supply
    are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity Sociohydrology researchers

    the range of solvable problems Advances in sociohydrology research are progress

    Goals Plain Language Summary Water crises that humanity faces are increasingly
    connected and are growing in complexity. As such, they require a more integrated
    approach in managing water resources,which involves all actors and stakeholders
    and considers how water resources link different sectors of society. Yet, water
    management practice is still dominated by technocratic approaches, which emphasize
    technical solutions. While these approaches may work in the short-term, they often
    result in unintended consequences in the long-term. Sociohydrology is developing
    a generalizable understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between natural,technical
    and social processes, which can improve water management practice. As such, advancing
    sociohydrology can contribute to address the global water crises and meet the
    water-related targets defined by the United Nations'' Sustainable Development
    Goals. 1 Introduction: Water Crises, SDGs, and SocioHydrology In the Anthropocene
    era, increasing attention is given in hydrologic science and water management
    to notions of nonstationarity (e.g., stationarity is dead; Milly et al., 2008)
    and change (e.g., hydrology for a changing world; Wagener et al., 2010). Yet,
    in the context of human influences on climate and hydrology, neither nonstationarity
    nor change is new. As early as 2,500 years ago, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher
    Heraclitus (circa 535–475 BCE) gained prominence for his emphasis on change as
    the fundamental essence of the universe. To express the concept that nothing is
    permanent except change, Heraclitus metaphorically referred to the change in the
    symbiotic relationship between water and people using the words No man ever steps
    in the same river twice, for it''s not the same river and he''s not the same man.
    The prescient insight of Heraclitus can equally well serve as a metaphor for many
    of the water-related issues humanity is currently facing worldwide. Millions of
    people around the world are affected by water crises manifesting at different
    scales, such as increasing drought severity and flood risk, groundwater depletion,
    ecological degradation, poor sanitation, water pollution, and its impact on human
    health (Srinivasan et al., 2012). A survey among water experts was recently carried
    out by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) to identify
    global hot spots of water crises (Figure 1). The results of the survey highlighted
    that most water crises are understood by experts as the result of lack of understanding,
    or neglect, of wider, economic, and socio-cultural perspectives (by scientists,
    policy makers, and water resource managers). This supports the case that the global
    water crisis is a governance crisis and thus political, economic, and cultural
    in nature (Castro, 2007). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Global hot
    spots of water crises identified by the IAHS Panta Rhei survey across water scientists
    and experts. The figure shows the social, technical, and hydrological factors
    identified by the respondents as main drivers of the six types of water crises
    around the world. IAHS = International Association of Hydrological Sciences. In
    the spirit of Heraclitus, therefore, the water crises can be deemed the intended
    and/or unintended consequences of long-term changes (i.e., slow evolution) of
    social norms and values (or, more broadly, culture), ideology or political systems,
    which are not typically anticipated or accounted for in coping with water-related
    issues. It is for this reason, and inspired by Heraclitus himself, that the global,
    decadal (2013–2022) initiative of the IAHS was titled Panta Rhei-Everything Flows
    (McMillan et al., 2016; Montanari et al., 2013) and focuses on change in both
    hydrology and society. Sociohydrology engages with these principles (Sivapalan
    et al., 2012, 2014), by examining the outcomes of water management and governance
    processes, that is, both successes and failures, themselves as subjects of scientific
    study. Sociohydrology studies the two-way feedbacks between human and water systems
    that result in a wide range of phenomena that arise in different places around
    the world and in different contexts (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Gober & Wheater,
    2015; Pande & Savenije, 2016; Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2015; Srinivasan, 2015; Srinivasan
    et al., 2012; Troy, Pavao-Zuckerman, & Evans, 2015). Work in sociohydrology has
    built upon a long history of work in three related fields. The first (1) is water
    resources systems (WRS) analysis that started with the Harvard Water Program in
    the 1960s (Brown et al., 2015; Kasprzyk et al., 2018) where the focus has mainly
    been on decision support by following a normative (optimization) route. The second
    (2) is integrated water resources management (IWRM), which was introduced in the
    1990s and was more geared to actual implementation (Global Water Partnership,
    2009) by (i) involving integration across the entire hydrological cycle; (ii)
    accommodating different water users and including engineering, economic, social,
    ecological, and legal aspects; while (iii) accounting for multiple spatial scales,
    such as upstream/downstream perspectives. The third (3) is the more recent development
    of interdisciplinary frameworks exploring the mutual shaping of society and nature
    (including water), such as social-ecological systems, coupled human-nature systems,
    and complex systems science (e.g., Adger, 2006; Cosens et al., 2018; Folke, 2006,
    2010; Folke et al., 2010; Gohari et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2007; Loucks, 2015;
    Ostrom, 2009; Walker et al., 2004; Werner & McNamara, 2007). While building on
    these fields, sociohydrology is different from them. WRS (1) analysis is focused
    on optimization. The goal is to combine hydrology and economics to design and
    operate optimal infrastructure projects. In contrast, the focus of sociohydrology
    is on understanding why certain water management outcomes arise rather than proposing
    actual management solutions. Similarly, IWRM (2) prescribes how to manage water
    resources in specific contexts, while sociohydrology analyzes actual water management
    processes and outcomes to develop generalizable understanding. Unlike social-ecological
    systems and coupled human-nature systems (3), sociohydrology has a more explicit
    focus on water, and on the specifics of the hydrologic cycle in space and time
    (Konar et al., 2018), including the role of water infrastructure (Di Baldassarre,
    Kemerink, et al., 2014; Di Baldassarre, Kreibich, et al., 2018). Over the past
    6 years, sociohydrology has pursued understanding of several classes of emergent
    phenomena, which are actual outcomes, paradoxical dynamics, or unintended consequences
    that arise from water management in the context of human-flood, human-drought,
    and human-environment interactions (Pande & Sivapalan, 2017; Sivapalan & Blöschl,
    2015). This paper argues that the development of generalized understanding of
    socio-hydrological phenomena has an important role to play in informing policy
    processes and in assisting communities, governments, civil society organizations,
    and private actors as they mobilize to meet the United Nations Agenda 2030 and
    its Sustainable Development Goals, hereafter SDGs (United Nations, UN, 2015).
    The SDGs represent an ambitious blueprint to achieve a sustainable future for
    humanity, and address global challenges related to, among others, poverty, inequality,
    climate change, environmental degradation, and water (Death & Gabay, 2015; Fukuda-Parr,
    2016). Achieving the SDGs is urgent, and 193 nations have committed to meet the
    targets set by the United Nations by 2030. The SDG 6, ensuring availability and
    sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is probably the greatest
    challenge we face in water resources management (UN Water, 2018). However, water
    plays a key role in several of the other SDGs as well and, therefore, water management
    must account for these multiple interrelated objectives (either in synergy or
    in conflict), not just focusing on clean water and sanitation. SDG 6 (and other
    related SDGs) is strongly committed to the IWRM paradigm (UN Water, 2016). This,
    it is argued, requires governments to consider how water resources link different
    parts of society and how decisions in one sector may affect water users in other
    sectors, as well as to adopt a participatory and inclusive approach by involving
    all actors and stakeholders, from all levels, who use and potentially pollute
    water, so that it is managed equitably and sustainably. (UN Water, 2018). Meeting
    the UN SDGs is, however, not straightforward. The targets set by the different
    SDGs are interrelated (UN Water, 2018), and they are sometimes fuzzy, contradictory,
    or challenging to implement (Sultana, 2018). For example, efforts to achieve the
    targets for clean water and sanitation can have unintended consequences on food
    and energy security and can contribute to environmental degradation. In the backdrop
    of these challenges, much of the current water management practice is still grounded
    on a strong techno-managerial culture, focused more on technocratic approaches
    than on addressing the socio-political and cultural dimensions underlying water
    crises, and the uneven distribution of costs and benefits (Hussein et al., 2018;
    Weststrate et al., 2018). Also, IWRM typically uses a scenario-based approach
    to account for human-water interactions (Savenije & Van der Zaag, 2008), which
    can work in the short term but in the long term can result in unintended consequences
    of only partially accounting for the coevolutionary dynamics of coupled human-water
    systems (Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al.,
    2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Gohari et al., 2013; Sivapalan et al., 2012,
    2014; Srinivasan et al., 2012). We posit that the field of sociohydrology has
    the potential to bridge the gap between the broad SDGs and the more specific IWRM/WRS
    set of principles and methodologies by seeking to gain insights that are both
    generalizable and actionable. Sociohydrology has an important role to play by
    emphasizing the need to broaden the conversation concerning water-related issues
    so that they are addressed (i) holistically and inclusively, considering broader,
    socio-cultural, and socio-political perspectives; and (ii) by considering both
    short-term and long-term consequences of shifts in water governance. This paper
    surveys the scientific challenges faced by sociohydrology toward addressing the
    complex water management challenge identified above. We start by documenting and
    synthesizing socio-hydrological phenomena explored to date and the generalized
    understanding gained so far. Next, we discuss and highlight the scientific and
    methodological challenges that remain, and the opportunities toward integrating
    the social and hydrological sciences. This is essential for strengthening the
    field of sociohydrology, and broadening its scope to underpin IWRM and support
    policy makers, governments, communities, and private sector organizations toward
    meeting the SDGs, which looms as a major societal grand challenge of the 21st
    century. 2 The Role of SocioHydrology in Conceptualizing the Water Implications
    of the SDGs 2.1 Classification of Phenomena Humans have significantly influenced
    the hydrological regime (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2008; Vörösmarty et al., 2013),
    deliberately or not (Blöschl et al., 2013; Savenije et al., 2014). Meanwhile,
    hydrological change tends to shape human society (Di Baldassarre et al., 2017),
    which responds to water crises, droughts, and floods in multiple ways, formally
    or not (Adger et al., 2013). The bidirectional feedbacks between human and water
    systems generate patterns across places or even across different contexts, which
    are the phenomena of interest to sociohydrology. These phenomena are actual outcomes,
    paradoxical dynamics, or unintended consequences that arise from water management
    to achieve a desired societal objective. They can result from the prevailing of
    political, commercial, or financial interests that might exacerbate social inequalities
    and ineffectiveness in water management. In this sense, they might be considered
    as manifestations of mismatch of governance with the (time, space, or organizational)
    scale of the coupled human-water system being governed (Cash et al., 2006) or
    of governance processes thick with politics (Castro, 2007). Such ignorance and
    mismatch can arise when governance is based on myopic, reductionist, or one-size-fits-all
    thinking. Sociohydrology aims to understand the feedback mechanisms generating
    these phenomena and the power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive
    biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to,
    changing hydrological regimes. The ultimate goal is to prevent mismatches of governance,
    in the first place, or at least overcome their adverse effects. Much of sociohydrology
    research has focused on the explanation of phenomena that have arisen in the context
    of floods (Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013,Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al.,
    2013, Di Baldassarre, Kemerink, et al., 2014,Di Baldassarre, Yan, et al., 2014;
    Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Viglione et al., 2014; Grames et al., 2016; Ciullo
    et al., 2017; Barendrecht et al., 2019), droughts (Garcia et al., 2016; Srinivasan
    et al., 2017; Gonzales & Ajami, 2017; Di Baldassarre et al., 2017; Di Baldassarre,
    Kreibich, et al., 2018,Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al., 2018; Treuer et al., 2017;
    Breyer et al., 2018), groundwater exploitation (Marston & Konar, 2017; Noël &
    Cai, 2017), water quality degradation (Chang et al., 2014; Giuliani et al., 2016),
    land degradation (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016), farming and agriculture development
    (Fernald et al., 2015; Pande & Savenije, 2016), and water resources development
    (e.g., Chen et al., 2016; Kandasamy et al., 2014; Mostert, 2018; Srinivasan et
    al., 2012). Several studies have attributed the collapse or dispersal of ancient
    civilizations to unintended effects in water management or governance (e.g., Dermody
    et al., 2014; Kuil et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013; Pande & Ertsen, 2014). Many
    of the phenomena studied to date manifest in the time domain. However, there is
    increased interest in phenomena that manifest in the space domain or in space-time
    (Breyer et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2016), as also highlighted in the recent review
    by Konar et al. (2018). Much can be learned by comparing and contrasting phenomena
    that arise in different places and in different contexts, and by seeking common
    explanations. This can be done by organizing them into groups of similar behavior,
    as was earlier done in terms of syndromes by Srinivasan et al. (2012) in the context
    of water resource development. We next present several classes of socio-hydrologic
    phenomena (Table 1) that have been explored over the last 6 years, providing the
    diversity of causes and contexts with which to generate understanding of coupled
    human-water system dynamics and to help meet several water-related SDG targets
    (see Figure 2). Table 1. Overview of Socio-Hydrological Phenomena and Implications

    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Water plays a key role in several specific
    targets of the SDGs, which are interconnected with socio-hydrological phenomena.
    The SDGs thus provide further motivation and the necessity to broaden the scope
    and strengthen the foundation of sociohydrology, which requires integration of
    hydrological and social science perspectives. SDGs = Sustainable Development Goals.
    According to the United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction 2017 annual
    report (United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction, UNISDR, 2018), capturing
    disaster risk dynamics is essential to achieve several SDGs. Shocks and stresses
    caused by disasters are likely to frustrate development achievements, and, in
    turn, bad development determines risk accumulation. Several SDGs are concerned
    with challenges that are related to risk accumulation, such as poverty (SDGs 1),
    reduction of inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), and peace, justice,
    and strong institutions (SDG 16). Sociohydrology has undertaken much work to understand
    feedbacks between society and hydrological extremes, such as droughts and flood.
    This work has advanced our understanding of the safe-development paradox or levee
    effect. This phenomenon describes instances in which protection measures, such
    as levees, generate a false sense of security (Ludy & Kondolf, 2012) and build
    up social vulnerabilities in risky areas (Burton & Cutter, 2008). As a result,
    paradoxically, risk can even increase after building such structural protection
    measures (Di Baldassarre, Kreibich, et al., 2018). Considering this phenomenon
    is crucial to meet numerous SDGs (Figure 2). The levee effect, for example, shows
    that the target of reducing fatalities caused by water-related disasters, such
    as floods (Target 11.5), cannot be achieved by merely building or reinforcing
    flood protection structures, but it requires a combination of nonstructural measures
    aiming to reduce vulnerabilities, including building codes or early warning systems
    (Kreibich et al., 2017). The safe-development paradox was first identified by
    Gilbert White as early as the 1940s (White, 1945), who criticized heavy reliance
    on structural flood protection in the United States. A recent example is the case
    of New Orleans, where a self-reinforcing process of raising levees to protect
    a growing urban environment has taken place over many decades (Kates et al., 2006).
    This has led to extreme, low-probability flooding, with catastrophic consequences,
    which are not evenly distributed across space and social groups. Masozera et al.
    (2007), for instance, analyzed the impact of flooding in New Orleans and found
    that preexisting socio-economic conditions played a major role in the inability
    of particular social groups to respond to the disaster and to cope with the flooding.
    Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al. (2018) recently discussed the corresponding reservoir
    effect in the context of responses to droughts, showing how the safe-development
    paradox can equally well apply to water supply reservoirs. These are often built
    to alleviate droughts and water shortages, but they can eventually worsen them.
    It is important to note that societies are not homogeneous and social stratification
    determines how and who are affected by hydrological extremes as well as who comes
    up with the strategies to cope with change at different scales, that is, how hydrological
    risks are distributed. This was recently demonstrated in the city of Austin, Texas,
    in the context of water restrictions imposed by the city in response to a severe
    drought (Breyer et al., 2018). Dams, reservoirs, or other types of water infrastructure
    are often built to cope with drought and water scarcity. In the short-term, these
    human alterations of water storage and fluxes are often beneficial, as they can
    increase water supply. Yet increasing water supply enables additional urban, agricultural,
    or economic growth that in turn generates higher demand, which can then offset
    the benefits of, for example, reservoirs as water supply sources. This phenomenon,
    known as supply-demand cycle (Kallis, 2010), is a self-reinforcing feedback, or
    vicious cycle, as the occurrence of a new drought will then likely favor further
    expansion of, for example, reservoirs to increase water supply (Di Baldassarre,
    Wanders, et al., 2018). Similar dynamics generated by water transfer projects
    in Iran have been described as fixes that can backfire (Gohari et al., 2013).
    It is important to acknowledge the role of social stratification and spatial distribution
    of water supply in terms of how and who makes decisions to build or expand water
    infrastructure, and who actually benefits from the increased water supply, as
    well as how the costs and benefits are distributed (Merme et al., 2014; Molle
    et al., 2009; Tiwale et al., 2018). This phenomenon has many implications for
    numerous SDGs (Figure 2), including the implementation of IWRM (Target 6.5). Humans
    respond and adapt to hydrological extremes through a combination of spontaneous
    processes and deliberate strategies (Loucks et al., 2006, 2008) that can lead
    to, for example, changing the social contract (Adger et al., 2013). Adaptive responses
    can take place at the individual, community, or government level. They might lead
    to the emergence of the adaptation effect, that is, the negative impact of an
    extreme event tends to be lower if such an event occurs shortly after a similar
    one (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Kreibich et al., 2017). For instance, the economic
    losses of the 1995 Meuse River flooding in Central Europe were remarkably lower
    than those of 1993, even though the magnitudes of the two events were similar
    (Wind et al., 1999). Similarly, adaptation effects and decreasing flood fatalities
    have been observed in Bangladesh over the past decades (Kreibich et al., 2017;
    Mechler & Bouwer, 2015). While the adaptation effect is often associated with
    desirable outcomes, it can also have adverse consequences. Adaptation to drought
    conditions can exacerbate the negative impacts of floods, and vice versa (Di Baldassarre
    et al., 2017). For instance, changing reservoir operations to cope with drought,
    such as keeping the reservoirs as full as possible to buffer low flow conditions,
    can prevent required flood attenuation if heavy rainfall occurs during drought
    termination. This was seen, for example, during the catastrophic 2011 flooding
    in Brisbane that occurred shortly after the Millennium Drought in Australia or
    the extreme heavy rainfall causing the Oroville spillway collapse during the termination
    of the last multiyear drought in California (Mallakpour et al., 2019). Di Baldassarre
    et al. (2017) suggested that human migration from drought-affected areas, as seen
    for example in Somalia (World Bank, 2018), can lead to more people living in riparian
    areas and therefore more exposed to flooding. Many communities (be they agricultural
    or urban) that rely on river flow and/or groundwater to advance their economic
    livelihoods have been observed to swing between water extraction for food production
    or water control for urban development in the early stages, followed by efforts
    to mitigate and reverse degradation of the riparian environment, resulting from
    reduction of streamflows or depletion of groundwater. This is variously known
    as pendulum swing. This phenomenon was observed in the Murrumbidgee River basin
    in eastern Australia (Kandasamy et al., 2014), Lake Toolibin basin in Western
    Australia (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016), and the Tarim basin in western China
    (Liu et al., 2015). In all three cases, increased water extraction, land clearance,
    and construction of water infrastructure are equally accompanied and driven by
    population growth and economic gain. In the short and intermediate terms, as per
    capita economic gain increases, the basin presents an attractive lifestyle proposition,
    causing human migration into the basin. In the long term, however, human actions
    that advance economic prosperity continue until the quantity or quality of water
    resources and the state of environment begin to impede further growth through
    the cost of environmental degradation and reduced productivity (Kandasamy et al.,
    2014). As the degradation of the environment continues, economic growth will naturally
    become constrained and communities will be compelled to act in efforts to reverse
    the negative threat to their livelihoods and well-being. In many arid regions
    of the world, water shortage most severely restricts socio-economic development.
    Under such circumstances, developing highly efficient agriculture through water-saving
    technology is regarded as an effective method to expand the economy, conserve
    water, and protect the environment. A range of technologies to increase irrigation
    efficiency and save water has proven successful at the farm scale. Yet, in the
    absence of appropriate governance measures, the increased efficiency often presents
    a paradox when assessed at larger scales because the saved water is often reallocated
    to irrigating an expanded land area or transferred to other uses (e.g., industrial
    or municipal water use), thus only to increase water consumption and deprive ecosystems
    of much needed flows. These are the unintended consequences arising from the push
    toward technological solutions without consideration of broader socio-cultural
    behaviors and their consequences. This is known as the irrigation efficiency paradox
    and can be seen as a facet of an economic rebound effect or Jevons paradox (Alcott,
    2005; Jevons, 1866). Increasing the efficiency of irrigation often leads to higher
    consumption of water, because farmers switch to more profitable and water-consuming
    crops (Dumont et al., 2013). An example is the coupled use of water and energy
    in Mexico, where efficient and subsidized electricity supplied to pump groundwater
    for irrigation had the unintended effect of increasing the pumping, thus speeding
    up aquifer depletion (Scott, 2011; Scott et al., 2013). Similarly, in the Xinjiang
    Uygur Autonomous Region in western China, total water consumption continued to
    increase even as irrigation efficiency dramatically improved through the application
    of water-saving technology (e.g., plastic mulching). However, the securing of
    additional freshwater resources through increased efficiency only encouraged farmers
    to expand the land area brought under irrigation, negating much of the water savings
    obtained through mulching (Liu, 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). This phenomenon is
    connected to numerous SDGs (Figure 2). Its emergence clearly complicates, for
    example, the goal of upgrading infrastructure to increase resource use efficiency
    (Target 9.4). Other socio-hydrological phenomena include what we term here as
    the aggregation effect and institutional complexity. The former relates to a mismatch
    of outcomes at the aggregated level of decisions taken at the individual level.
    A key example is known as collective action problem in the social sciences, which
    refers to situations where all individuals would be better off by jointly acting
    toward a common goal but fail to do so because of their self-interest (Olson,
    1965). This paradox originates from the common-pool resource nature of water resources
    and the public good nature of water infrastructure and the combination of individual
    rationality and difficulties associated with coordination of large groups (Kollock,
    1998). If overlooked, this issue can lead to outcomes such as overuse of groundwater
    and under provision of water infrastructure. To cope with this issue, rules and
    norms that regulate individual behavior need to be endogenously developed by the
    community or imposed on it endogenously (Ostrom, 1990). However, whether and how
    such governance arrangements can be achieved is itself a major challenge. Ostrom
    herself suggested in recent work (see, for instance, Van Laerhoven & Ostrom, 2007)
    that furthering common property resource management requires dealing with the
    uncertainty and complexity of institutional processes. Concurrently, over the
    past two decades, critical institutionalism has highlighted how the dynamic relationship
    between individuals, society, and natural resources is shaped by power relations
    and constant renegotiations that fuse socially embedded norms with new arrangements
    through a process of bricolage (Cleaver & De Koning, 2015; Rusca et al., 2015).
    Getting institutions right and development by design are, therefore, likely to
    lead to unintended outcomes (Cleaver, 2017). Feedbacks among the states of water
    resources, individual behavior, and change in governance arrangements can generate
    dynamics that are difficult to understand by treating water and human systems
    separately. Socio-hydrological studies dealing with this phenomenon include the
    management of water infrastructure in relation to flooding (Yu, Sangwan, et al.,
    2017), irrigation (Muneepeerakul & Anderies, 2017; Yu et al., 2015), and groundwater
    exploitation (Madani & Dinar, 2012; Müller et al., 2017). Aggregation effects
    could also produce perverse outcomes. These, for instance, occur when desirable
    outcomes at a larger scale conceal inequalities and, as such, distributional injustices
    at the local scale (Zwarteveen et al., 2017). A study on drinking water by Tiwale
    et al. (2018) found that additional reservoirs built to supply water for the underserved
    or unserved population of Lilongwe (Malawi) ended up improving continuity of supply
    for those who were already served, rather than quenching the thirst of the growing
    urban population. While at the urban scale water availability had improved, inequalities
    in access between different neighborhoods had increased. This example illustrates
    the limits of focusing on average values, while overlooking distribution across
    space and social groups. To determine whether anyone is left behind, as called
    for by the SDGs, requires disaggregated data, spanning from socio-economic status,
    gender, age, and geographic location (Satterthwaite, 2016a, 2016b; Stuart & Woodroffe,
    2016). As further elaborated below, sociohydrology can contribute to address important
    questions of equity by examining how development of large water infrastructure,
    such as reservoirs, and access to extra water intersects with gender, race, and
    socio-economic status. These effects are also central to the three paradoxes identified
    in the most recent World Water Development Report (UN Water, 2019): (1) supplying
    the bulk of food and yet poor and hungry; (2) substantive investments in water
    infrastructure in rural areas and yet the rural poor lack access to water; and
    (3) small-holder farmers being water productive and yet overlooked. The institutional
    complexity effect relates to the trade-off between resilience and efficiency of
    human-water systems (Muneepeerakul & Anderies, 2017) generated by increased complexities
    of shared water infrastructure and related governance arrangements. Measures that
    increase performance and stability are preferred by managers. As such, coupled
    human-water systems often evolve in ways that add more complex infrastructure
    and governance arrangements to reduce hydrological variability and increase system
    performance (Anderies, 2015). However, historical events showed that such complexities
    are often associated with hidden vulnerabilities to other types of disturbances,
    which are revealed through catastrophic failures (ibid). This line of inquiry
    has mostly focused on endogenous growth in the Indus and Hohokam civilizations
    (Pande & Ertsen, 2014) and virtual water trade in the Roman Empire (Dermody et
    al., 2014). Complex systems literature refers to this phenomenon as robustness-fragility
    trade-off (Csete & Doyle, 2002). Overall, the phenomena discussed above provide
    significant insights into human-water interactions at different temporal and spatial
    scales. These phenomena have clear implications for SDGs and can inform policies
    and strategies to achieve water-related targets (Figure 2). 2.2 Explanation of
    the Phenomena One of the main goals of sociohydrology is to explore the feedback
    mechanisms that may have caused the emergent phenomena. The driving logic of scientific
    discovery in sociohydrology is if these feedback mechanisms operate, here is the
    phenomenon it can produce as well as if this phenomenon happens, here are the
    feedback mechanisms that might explain it (Elster, 2007). A suite of different
    methods has been utilized in various studies to provide these explanations. One
    common approach adopted in the social sciences is the use of statistical analysis
    of empirical research data, obtained through surveys and interviews (Brown, 2007;
    Daniel et al., 2018; Sanderson et al., 2017), some of which is qualitative. In
    this context, a set of interesting methods has been developed that combine the
    strengths of qualitative and quantitative data (Driscoll et al., 2007; Jick, 1979).
    An example is the work by Leong (2018) to convert narratives of perceptions of
    floods in Assam, India, to quantitative forms, similar to water volumes and prices,
    using the so-called Q methodology. A second approach to explain phenomena, especially
    in the absence of long time series of observations, which has gathered increased
    momentum, is agent-based modeling (Du et al., 2017; Noël & Cai, 2017). These models
    operate by prescribing rules on how individuals and/or institutions (the agents)
    interact, obtained through field surveys and interviews of people in real places,
    and thus allow the heterogeneous individual (or group) behavior to be accommodated.
    They help to compute the interactions at the microlevel between agents and allow
    describing social behaviors at the macrolevel or to interpret observed behavior
    at these higher levels and attribute them to both microscale and macroscale factors
    (Gilbert, 2008; Gilbert & Terna, 2000). A third common approach, called system
    dynamics modeling (e.g., Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013; Garcia et al.,
    2016; Gohari et al., 2013; Srinivasan, 2015) is adopted in the presence of long
    time series of natural or water system behavior (e.g., hydrology, water use, and
    ecology) and social system behavior (e.g., demographics, economics, industries,
    and technology). The approach is guided by a limited number of hypotheses about
    fundamental natural and social processes and their interactions driving the overall
    behavior of the system, as illustrated by a stylized model for an urban socio-hydrological
    system of Chennai, India, developed by Srinivasan (2015). More commonly, though,
    these hypotheses are explicitly formalized (in mathematical terms) using a set
    of coupled differential equations. Di Baldassarre et al. (2015) argue that the
    strength of this method is its transparency, flexibility, and ability to capture
    the dynamics emerging from interacting processes. Most early models of sociohydrology
    have been based on the system dynamics approach; see Blair and Buytaert (2016)
    and Troy, Pavao-Zuckerman, & Evans, 2015, Troy, Konar, et al., 2015) for comprehensive
    reviews of recent socio-hydrological models. These have been proposed as explanatory
    hypotheses about feedback mechanisms generating one or more observed classes of
    phenomena. The explanatory model depicted in Figure 3a, for example, is a (generic)
    system dynamics model, based on coupled differential equations (Di Baldassarre,
    Viglione, et al., 2013), that aims to explain, in a stylized manner, phenomena
    often observed in flood risk studies, that is, the aforementioned safe-development
    paradox and adaptation effect. In the same way, Figure 3b depicts a (place-based)
    conceptual model of the human-water dynamics in the Murrumbidgee River basin in
    eastern Australia, including the competition between humans and the environment
    (Van Emmerik et al., 2014) that underlies the pendulum swing phenomenon. Similar
    place-based models have been developed for the pendulum swing phenomena documented
    in Western Australia (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016) and Tarim basin in western
    China (Liu et al., 2015). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Examples of
    socio-hydrological models as hypotheses about the feedback mechanisms generating
    one or more phenomena: (a) generic conceptualization of human-flood interactions
    (Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013) and (b) coupled human-water dynamics
    in Murrumbidgee River basin (Van Emmerik et al., 2014). The endogenization of
    human agency is the key to explain emergent phenomena (Pande & Sivapalan, 2017).
    To this end, different hypotheses have been proposed in sociohydrology. Di Baldassarre,
    Viglione, et al. (2013); Di Baldassarre et al. (2015) and Viglione et al. (2014),
    for example, built upon the concept of social memory (Folke et al., 2005) and
    explained the safe-development paradox as resulting from a decay of flood memory
    during prolonged periods IN which flooding does not occur. In the same spirit,
    Van Emmerik et al. (2014), Liu et al. (2013), and Liu et al. (2015) explained
    the pendulum swing as the result of a competition between an economic productive
    force that favors human livelihoods and an environmental restorative force that
    favors the environment. As in Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al. (2013), it was
    proposed that this competition was mediated by another social state variable,
    which Van Emmerik et al. (2014) termed an environmental awareness, and was later
    generalized by Elshafei et al. (2014) as community sensitivity. These social variables
    (e.g., social memory, community sensitivity) therefore played a central role in
    the development of associated coupled socio-hydrological models. Elshafei et al.
    (2014), and subsequently Elshafei et al. (2016), provided an avenue for generalization
    of community sensitivity by connecting it to broad socio-economic and socio-cultural
    factors (e.g., human development index and corruption perception index). Roobavannan
    et al. (2017) further enhanced the power of community sensitivity by making it
    a function of the structure of the regional economy. The resulting suite of system
    dynamics models using either social memory or community sensitivity as a key state
    variable to explain the emergence of socio-hydrological phenomena in effect have
    helped to endogenize human behavior and the feedbacks with the water system through
    deterministic human response relationships. For example, the migration of people
    out of, or toward, the Murrumbidgee River basin to or from other parts of eastern
    Australia was inspired by a law similar to Fick''s law of dispersal (i.e., migration
    flux is proportional to negative gradient of unemployment), while community sensitivity
    itself was defined as a trade-off between environmental health and economic well-being.
    Migrants are often driven by their expectation of improved employment or earnings
    (Mabogunje, 1970; Todaro, 1969). Aspirations of better lives are based on household
    level decisions to either maximize expected income or minimize risk that the household
    is exposed to by diversifying the portfolio of income generating activities (Massey
    et al., 1993; Akay et al., 2012). Yet the decisions to migrate are often limited
    by substantial social and economic barriers (Bryan et al., 2014). As a result,
    it is often the individuals whose income is above average that migrate (Knight
    & Gunatilaka, 2010). The effect of natural hazards such as droughts and flooding
    can therefore be ambiguous (Chen et al., 2017; Gray & Mueller, 2012). On the one
    hand, it can reduce migration by removing resources necessary for migration to
    overcome set up costs or increasing labor demand in originating areas, while in
    some other cases it may reduce all income generating possibilities, pushing migrants
    en masse out of affected areas (Chen et al., 2017). Therefore, while migration
    may appear to respond to unemployment gradient (Roobavannan et al., 2017), it
    is much more complex phenomenon that deserves closer scrutiny. There have also
    been early efforts to generalize from conclusions based on place-based studies.
    One of the ways to achieve this is to invoke (either explicitly or implicitly)
    existing economic or sociological theories to propose alternative hypotheses about
    the feedback mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of socio-hydrological
    phenomena. For example, Roobavannan et al. (2018) compared the outcomes of a socio-hydrologic
    model of community sensitivity (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016) with an independent
    analysis of proxy data (i.e., references to concerns about the environment appearing
    in Australian newspapers over a 100-year period) carried out by Wei et al. (2017).
    Based on this analysis they argued that the concept of community sensitivity is
    consistent with the values beliefs norms theory widely adopted in sociology. Other
    socio-hydrological modeling studies have postulated human behavior as one that
    maximizes a livelihood objective. Pande et al. (2011), for example, modeled basin-scale
    water allocation based on profit maximization in agricultural production. Pande
    and Ertsen (2014) and Pande et al. (2014) provided an interpretation of the rise
    and dispersal of societies using endogenous growth theory, wherein actions of
    humans in maximizing their well-being result in the formation of grander coalitions
    (i.e., rise of civilizations) and technological progress that accelerates both
    growth and environmental degradation. Grames et al. (2016) provided an economic,
    albeit profit maximizing interpretation of the safe-development paradox. While
    these models assumed that humans are consistently able to compare and contrast
    alternative bundles of goods and services and maximize their well-being based
    on it (i.e., that they are rational), other approaches have been recently used
    to model apparently irrational behavior at individual and collective levels. Di
    Baldassarre et al. (2017), for instance, developed a system dynamics model by
    capturing cognitive biases at individual level in the management of droughts and
    floods, inspired by the idea of the availability heuristic in behavioral economics
    (Gal, 2018; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Yu et al. (2017) used evolutionary game
    theory to model the evolution of informal rules or norms of a community and associated
    collective action dynamics related to levee maintenance. Their model captures
    the social dilemma of how individually rational behavior can lead to collectively
    irrational outcome of poor levee maintenance as well as how the removal of short-term
    flooding can lead to erosion of people''s compliance to informal rules that regulate
    the social dilemma and, ultimately, erosion of community resilience to floods.
    Finally, Gunda et al. (2018) investigated the water stress response of the Valdez
    acequia in New Mexico (a community-managed irrigation system) by linking a hydrological
    model to the system dynamics model of an acequia developed by Turner et al. (2016).
    They focused on the role that community social structure, in particular mutualism,
    plays in the ability of the acequia to maintain its functionality. They found
    that, while agricultural productivity declined, the community was able to maintain
    its functionality under streamflow declines due to adaptations like shifting crop
    selection. The engagement with existing sociological and economic theories, and
    the development of new ones specific to sociohydrology, to provide explanations
    of observed socio-hydrologic phenomena is important to ascertain whether these
    are exceptional dynamics occurring in particular places or are generic ones that
    can be extrapolated to other places or circumstances. However, they take on added
    significance in the context of the SDGs since, in the absence of previous history,
    we will be expected to drive policy choices within which water resource development
    can be kept in the safe operating space for humanity (Rockström et al., 2009).
    Since coupled human-water systems are complex systems that involve dynamics at
    multiple levels of human organization (Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2015), multiple levels
    of theories are likely to be needed to more fully understand socio-hydrological
    phenomena. At individual level, promising theories of human behavior that remain
    insufficiently exploited in sociohydrology are the expected utility theory (Neumann
    & Morgenstern, 1944), protection motivation theory (Rogers, 1975), prospect theory
    (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), game theory (Morrow, 1994), path dependency (Mahoney,
    2000), and rebound effect or Jevon''s paradox (Alcott, 2005). At collective level,
    applicable theories for explaining social change include collective action theory
    (Olson, 1965), institutionalist thinking (Cleaver, 2017; Ostrom, 1990; Van Laerhoven
    & Ostrom, 2007), and cultural evolution (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Finally, at
    systems level, relevant theories could include resilience thinking (Walker et
    al., 2004), complex adaptive systems (Mitchell, 2009), metabolism theory (Banavar
    et al., 2002), and feedback control system theory (Doyle et al., 1990). 2.3 Reconceptualizing
    Water and Society Relations in the Context of SDGs According to several scholars
    working across disciplines, the United Nations SDGs mark a paradigm shift in the
    way nature and society relations are understood and addressed in human development.
    First, the SDGs promote the notion of coupled human-nature systems in which poverty
    reduction and planetary health are seen as intrinsically intertwined (Bello, 2013;
    Death & Gabay, 2015; Griggs et al., 2013; Langford, 2016; McMichael, 2017; Schleicher
    et al., 2018). It is argued that their transformative potential can only materialize
    if trade-offs and the relation between poverty and environmental degradation are
    made explicit (Schleicher et al., 2018). Second, the three dimensions of sustainability
    have been presented as an indivisible whole and scholars warn that a fragmented
    implementation would generate perverse outcomes (Morton et al., 2017; Nilsson
    et al., 2016). The nexus and trade-offs within the SDGs, however, have only been
    superficially explored in the past. If on the one hand enhancing policy coherence
    for sustainable development is a key concern in the SDGs project (Target 17.14.1),
    on the other hand most complex and politically contentious trade-offs have been
    glossed over in the international negotiations (Nilsson et al., 2016). Consequently,
    the multiple ways in which goals and dimensions of sustainability are interdependent
    are not explicitly discussed (Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018). As aptly illustrated
    by Alcamo (2019: 126), acting on synergies and trade-offs requires not only political
    will but also knowledge about their origin and characteristics. The risk, therefore,
    is that policy makers and bureaucrats end up working in vertical silos rather
    than through horizontal integrative approaches (Nilsson et al., 2016; Vandemoortele,
    2011). Increasingly, scholars call for enhancing empirical knowledge on trade-offs
    and synergies that can inform SDGs implementation processes. The UN''s report
    Mainstreaming of the three dimensions of sustainable development throughout the
    United Nations system (UN Economic & Social Council, 2016) places water as a key
    integration force and highlights the relationship between multiple goals. Sociohydrology
    can play an important role in conceptualizing SDG trade-offs and feedback loops
    in the context of water-society relations at different temporal and spatial scales.
    In section 3 we have shown how the body of literature that relates to sociohydrology
    has already theorized several phenomena that are relevant to the implementation
    of the SDGs. In the section that follows, we discuss opportunities to enrich sociohydrology
    by broadening its scope to address other water management dimensions relevant
    to the SDGs. 2.4 Expansion of Socio-Hydrologic Phenomena: Broadening the Scope
    of SocioHydrology Socio-hydrologic phenomena taken up for study over the last
    6 years have mostly examined human-flood, human-drought, and human-environment
    interactions and feedbacks. Yet the role of water in SDGs extends well beyond
    these. For example, water resources are connected to food and energy production.
    Excessive exploitation of water to produce food and energy contributes to environmental
    degradation in some places. Hence, in addition to competition for water between
    humans and the environment, managing water in a broader context requires decisions
    about different human-water uses (e.g., water vs food vs energy), or between different
    water hazards (e.g., floods vs droughts), both in time (e.g., short- vs long-term
    considerations) and in space (e.g., upstream vs downstream and urban vs rural).
    Below, we focus on three examples: water pollution and human health, water-energy-food
    nexus, and transboundary water management. 2.4.1 Water Pollution and Human Health
    Globally, population growth and economic development have contributed to increased
    contamination (e.g., heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and fecal matter)
    of water supplies and of health risks related to waterborne diseases (Bain et
    al., 2014; Liu, Zhang, et al., 2017; Ternes et al., 2015). Although research on
    drinking water has overwhelmingly focused on use and access, a number of studies
    have examined contamination and its societal consequences and feedbacks at different
    scales. Work on the effects of coupled human-water systems on drinking water quality
    includes research on the arsenic crisis in South East Asia and Bangladesh, respectively,
    analyzing hydrology of geogenic arsenic groundwater and health implications (Winkel
    et al., 2008; Michael & Voss, 2008; Sultana, 2011), and the role of power and
    gendered relations in shaping access to contaminated water (Sultana, 2006). Another
    example is recent research on intermittent water supply, which has demonstrated
    how Escherichia coli contamination is more likely to occur in areas where supply
    is not continuous (Agathokleous & Christodoulou, 2016; Kumpel & Nelson, 2013).
    Over 300 million people globally are served by intermittent water supply, and
    those who live in areas with inadequate sanitation are at higher risk of drinking
    contaminated water (Kumpel & Nelson, 2016; Sarpong Boakye-Ansah et al., 2016).
    Risks of contamination are further exacerbated by storage practices adopted by
    residents to cope with discontinuity (Burt & Ray, 2014; Rusca et al., 2017). Improved
    sources are, thus, not necessarily free of pathogens and parasites and can cause
    waterborne diseases (Bain et al., 2014; Ercumen et al., 2015; Shaheed et al.,
    2014; Tosi Robinson et al., 2018). Although these studies have identified technical
    challenges and household coping strategies that might lead to contamination and
    the health implications thereof, in the context of the SDGs more work can be done
    to unravel the interplay between the political economy of water and sanitation
    services, water contamination at different scales, and distribution of its risks.
    A growing body of literature proposes that safe water has become a commodity and
    calls for examining the relation between deterioration of water quality, class,
    gender, race, and indigenous rights to water (Rusca, Alda-Vidal, et al., 2017,Rusca,
    Boakye-Ansah, et al., 2017; Dodman et al., 2017; Vandewalle & Jepson, 2015). These
    studies suggest that there is a trend of vulnerable and marginalized communities
    suffering the most from exposure to unsafe drinking water. Sociohydrology can
    contribute by capturing more explicitly the dynamics generated by the interweaving
    of human and water-quality transformations and the uneven distribution of risk
    through research on feedback loops between wastewater/sludge flows and society,
    including the economic, cultural, engineering, and human behaviors surrounding
    its mitigation and production at different scales. The recent water crisis in
    Flint (Michigan, USA), for instance, mostly affected urban dwellers of more economically
    depressed background. The study by Butler et al. (2016) importantly shows the
    relationship among urbanization, economic development, inequalities, politics
    of water management, and water contamination. Flint developed mostly because of
    a thriving motor industry, while toxic industrial effluents contaminated the Detroit
    River. The ending of industrial activities left the city impoverished and, more
    recently, under emergency management to deal with the economic hardship. When,
    in order to reduce costs, the water supply was temporarily switched from Lake
    Huron to the Detroit River, residents were exposed for over 18 months to lead
    contaminated water, which caused elevated blood lead levels in residents, with
    irreversible impacts on children (Hanna-Attisha et al., 2016; Liu, Zhang, et al.,
    2017). As for the pendulum swing phenomenon discussed above, economic and industrial
    development in the short term caused surface water contamination and environmental
    degradation in the long term. Ultimately, human actions led to contamination of
    drinking water, which compromised the health of residents. One promising approach
    to capture sociohydrology of unsafe drinking water and its uneven distribution
    is developing interdisciplinary case studies that account for both the hydrological
    and social dimensions of water-quality transformations. The aforementioned study
    by Rusca, Boakye-Ansah, et al. (2017), for instance, drew attention to the interdependencies
    between socio-political processes and microbiological and physiochemical contamination
    of drinking water and proposes a methodological approach to capture these (see
    also Boakye-Ansah et al., 2016). Concurrently, sociohydrology may further understandings
    of risk perception in relation with water contamination and how extreme events
    may influence it. For instance, polls following the Flint water crisis show approximately
    half of the American population distrusts their tap water (Baum et al., 2016).
    These perceptions may, in turn, affect the way in which people access and consume
    water. All together these lines of inquiry have the potential to contribute to
    advancing SDG 6, as well as SDG 3 on good health and well-being, especially ending
    waterborne diseases by 2030 (Target 3.3). Last, synergies and trade-offs involving
    water quality extend well beyond Goal 6. Alcamo (2019) points to some important
    and less explored trade-offs: the expansion of conventional agriculture may contribute
    to Goal 2 (Zero hunger) but is likely to increase water pollution downstream;
    on the other end, high-saline-polluted water is inadequate for irrigation. Wastewater
    treatment is an energy intensive activity and will negatively impact Goal 7 (affordable
    and clean energy, see also Yillia, 2016). Today, at least one third of the rivers
    in Africa, Latin America, and Asia is polluted by untreated wastewater (United
    Nations Environment Program, UNEP, 2016). Wastewater treatment is, therefore,
    likely to have a major impact on the conservation, restoration, and sustainable
    use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems (Target 15.1). Last, as good
    water quality is a prerequisite of subsistence, it plays an important role in
    targets such as slum upgrading (Target 11.1) and reduction of inequalities (SDG
    10) (Alcamo, 2019). 2.4.2 Water-Energy-Food Nexus Water plays a key role in several
    SDGs (as seen in Figure 2), and therefore, water management must account for these
    multiple interacting objectives, not just focusing on clean water and sanitation
    (UN Water, 2018). For example, water is at the heart of current research in the
    water-energy-food nexus across all spatial scales of analysis (Cudennec et al.,
    2018; D''Odorico et al., 2018; Lant et al., 2018; Liu, Yang, et al., 2017). A
    study by Yillia (2016) reveals the multiple trade-offs and interconnections within
    this nexus. He suggests that interdependencies between water and energy have mostly
    focused on how few elements interact, rather than taking a more holistic and comprehensive
    approach. The interactions, she argues, are multiple and take place at different
    scales. These range from the use of water (SDG 6) to extract and transport energy
    sources, produce and convert energy, irrigate crops for biofuel production, and
    water intensive renewable energy (SDG 8). Energy is needed for treatment, distribution,
    and transport of drinking water and desalination (SDG6), as well as for irrigation
    (SD2). Last, as mentioned above, wastewater treatment is an energy intensive activity
    that plays a key role in ensuring water quality (SDG 6) and ecosystem protection
    (SDG 15). Much research has been devoted to evaluating the vast water resources
    virtually embedded in internationally and regionally traded commodities, including
    food and energy (Allan, 2011; Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012; Konar et al., 2011; Marston
    et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). Future sociohydrology research may strive to
    represent these virtual flows of water in order to understand the full producer-consumer
    chain of economic goods that require water (Konar et al., 2016). This will enable
    consumers to identify the water resources infrastructure that is supporting their
    food and energy receipts, enabling better accounting across SDGs. Critically,
    resolving these flows will enable consumers to better assess the exposure of their
    supply chains to water stress and shocks. During the 2008 annual meeting of the
    World Economic Forum, participants called for a better understanding of the relationship
    between economic growth and (virtual) water flows (WEF Water Initiative, 2011).
    Causal inference research in economics has shown that international trade leads
    to increased economic growth (Frankel & Romer, 1999). Virtual water flows are
    essentially a rescaled metric of international commodity trade (typically provided
    in mass [tons] or value [$] units). It is therefore likely that virtual water
    trade also drives economic growth, though future research is to confirm this.
    Relatedly, recent causal inference work by Dang and Konar (2018) has shown that
    trade openness reduces the amount of water that the countries use in agriculture,
    with no impact to the industrial or total water use of nations. This research
    shows the average impact of trade on water use. Future research may explore the
    implications of trade for water use in specific settings and time domains. This
    work by Dang and Konar (2018) highlights the interconnected nature of food-energy-water
    systems and illustrates that policies in one system may have spillover effects
    to another (e.g., economic trade policy has unintended consequences for water
    use in agriculture). Similarly, recent research by Deryugina and Konar (2017)
    employed causal inference methods to understand the impact of crop insurance on
    water use. They find that crop insurance leads to more irrigation withdrawals
    in agriculture, mainly due to farmers deciding to grow more water-intensive crops.
    Thus, these studies highlight that policies that are supposedly unrelated to water
    (e.g., trade and crop insurance) can have unexpected consequences in terms of
    water consumptions. Similarly, the International Water Management Institute highlights
    how working to achieve the food SDG can have spillover effects for water (International
    Water Management Institute, 2018). This indicates that the SDGs are interrelated,
    and efforts to work toward the goal of one SDG may have unintended consequences
    for other SDGs. Future sociohydrology research should aim to better understand
    the complex interactions that exist in the food-energy-water nexus to enhance
    our ability to address all SDGs. 2.4.3 Transboundary Water Management Different
    SDGs give rise to different fundamental questions. Underlying questions concerning
    international basins is, as illustrated by Petersen-Perlman et al. (2017, p. 13),
    the idea that being part of a transboundary basin makes a user interconnected
    with the rest of its users. For example, specific measures to promote economic
    growth (SDG 8) in a given place, for example, building large water infrastructure
    for food or energy production, can jeopardize other objectives in other places,
    such as reducing inequalities (SDG 10) or protecting and restoring water-related
    ecosystems (SDG 15). In this perspective, cooperation in transboundary rivers
    (SDG6) can be also seen as one of the major environmental challenges of the century
    (Song & Whittington, 2004). This is particularly true in transboundary rivers
    that flow across political boundaries (De Stefano et al., 2017; Grey & Sadoff,
    2003). The riparian states usually value water differently, leading to differences
    in water management regime, priorities, and culture. Consequently, transboundary
    river systems are characterized by both conflict and cooperation (Petersen-Perlman
    & Wolf, 2015; Yoffe et al., 2003; Zeitoun & Mirumachi, 2008). Conflict and cooperation
    in transboundary rivers can be seen as socio-hydrological phenomena driven by
    the interplay of hydrological, technical, and social processes. They remain widely
    underresearched and not well understood. For example, it was found that no single
    indicator, be it climate, water scarcity, government type, or water demand, could
    explain the emergence of either conflict or cooperation (Yoffe et al., 2003).
    Hence, sociohydrology can contribute to a better understanding of cooperative
    and noncooperative responses by interpreting them as outcomes of long-term coevolution
    (Pande & Ertsen, 2014), or as the effect of single events, such as the construction
    of the large dam or the occurrence of a climatic shock (Gleick, 2014). Therefore,
    taking a socio-hydrological approach to transboundary water management can help
    to unravel the feedback mechanisms that explain these phenomena (Mianabadi et
    al., 2015) and, in turn, to meet water and environment-related SDGs. 3 Scientific
    Challenges in Integrating the Social and Hydrological Dimensions As sociohydrology
    strives to make headway toward improved understanding of the phenomena reviewed
    in sections 2 and 3 and broadens in scope to cope with a wider range of phenomena,
    including new phenomena that are likely to arise in the process of aiming to meet
    the SDGs, new methodological challenges arise. This section presents these challenges
    and outlines possible ways forward toward confronting these challenges. 3.1 Mechanisms
    and Phenomena Across Temporal and Spatial Scales One of the major challenges for
    sociohydrology is that the interplay of human and water systems involves both
    hydrological processes and social processes (and institutions) operating at multiple
    spatial and time scales (Figure 4). Capturing how these processes interact across
    time and space scales, for example, how short-term processes affect longer term
    processes, and vice versa can provide important insights on the possible short-
    and long-term impacts of implementing the SDGs and on spatial distribution of
    these impacts. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Temporal and spatial
    scales in (a) hydrological processes (Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995) and (b) institutions
    (Gunderson & Holling, 2001). 3.1.1 Temporal Dynamics and Time Scale Interactions
    Many of the phenomena discussed in section 2, such as the safe development paradox
    and the pendulum swing, tend to operate over long (decadal or centennial) time
    scales, but they often involve short-term processes, such as the seasonal cycle
    of irrigation, or flood inundation and defense activities that happen within hours.
    Flood formation is coupled with event scale precipitation and seasonal soil moisture
    as well as with soil, vegetation, landscape, and climate evolution occurring over
    centuries to millennia (Gaál et al., 2012). Similarly, in human-water systems,
    natural resources will slowly degrade if overused by human activities, such as
    water extraction or land use changes that do not allow for recovery (Ward et al.,
    2018). For example, large-scale deforestation in Western Australia for agriculture
    caused shifts to the water balance, leading to slowly rising water tables and
    extensive land and stream salinization, which contributed to a decline in agriculture
    and reduction of human population (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016). The infrastructure
    system, typically, follows a slow evolutionary path linked to innovation through
    the interplay between technology and society (Geels, 2005; Pande et al., 2014).
    Technology includes infrastructure development to exploit water resources (e.g.,
    irrigation) or improved water use efficiency in agriculture (Kandasamy et al.,
    2014), or river training and construction of levees to protect cities from flooding
    (Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013). However, infrastructure develops in response
    to accumulated effects of human-water interactions that occur at short time scales,
    for example, frequent flooding in urban communities can lead to raising or strengthening
    levees, likewise frequent water shortages in agricultural communities can lead
    to expanding water storage via reservoirs. Depending on what time scales are considered,
    different feedbacks may become relevant (Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995). If short
    time scales are considered, slow processes will not change much and so can be
    assumed as fixed boundary conditions, while this is no longer the case over a
    longer time frame. This notion was recognized as early as 1890 by economist Marshall
    (1890). He considered a market period (hours) where goods produced for sale on
    the market, for example, in a fish market prices are taken as given, but quickly
    adjust to clear markets; over longer periods industrial capacity is taken as given
    but outputs, employment, and inputs of raw materials fluctuate; at even longer
    periods the stock of capital goods, such as factories and machines, will fluctuate;
    when looking at even longer time frames, technology, population trends, habits,
    and customs are all likely to change. 3.1.2 Legacy Risks For long-term processes
    related to hydrological, technical, or social parts of the system, a long-term
    perspective becomes extremely relevant, particularly if it is difficult (or expensive)
    to reverse any decisions that are made. Some of the phenomena (Table 1) make it
    difficult for actors to reverse decisions when lock-in situations occur. Such
    lock-in situations may be economically, politically, or culturally driven. For
    example, due to the safe-development paradox, or levee effect, once people have
    moved into floodplains it may be politically and economically difficult to relocate
    them to safer ground. Due to the irrigation efficiency paradox or economic rebound
    effect, a lock-in situation occurred in India, where smallholders pumped groundwater
    at no cost as a result of subsidized energy. This measure is difficult to reverse
    as it enhances the stability of the elected provincial government (Shah et al.,
    2012). The supply-demand cycle may result in lock-ins due to high investment costs
    and may make societies dependent on expensive infrastructure, such as reservoirs
    for drought management (Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al., 2018; Kuil et al., 2018,
    2019), and eventually may result into a negative spiral toward peak water limits
    (Gleick & Palaniappan, 2010). The importance of decisions over long time frames
    for these types of processes is reflected in the concept of legacy risk, which
    is the expected cost of decisions made today carried over a very long time frame.
    Traditionally, the concept of legacy risk originated in the domains of nuclear
    waste and mining as these are processes that may linger over very long time periods
    (Pepper et al., 2014; Russell, 2000). The concept, however, applies to a range
    of processes, including environmental management (Winiwarter et al., 2016). The
    idea is to put particular emphasis in today''s planning on those decisions that
    may have enormous adverse effects for generations to come and will be difficult
    to reverse. The choice is a difficult one as legacy risks the nation chooses not
    to bear cannot be separated from the opportunity costs (benefits given up elsewhere)
    it willingly incurs in reducing them. Both risks and costs are defined by inhabitants''
    values and preferences (and thus culture) and are not restricted to narrow, objective
    measures (Russell, 2000, p. 4). Over and above this, there is also the issue of
    equity in relation to intergenerational and intragenerational distribution of
    risks and costs of these developments, as well as equity between different sectors
    of society (Zwarteveen et al., 2017; Zwarteveen & Boelens, 2014). 3.1.3 Spatial
    Processes and Space-Scale Interactions Water-related issues have a spatial component,
    which shapes trade-offs, compromises, and negotiations between conflicting interests
    in different parts of the river basin (Loucks et al., 2005). In the water system,
    the spatial component arises because of spatial linkages of the water cycle. These
    linkages occur at all spatial scales, from the hillslope (through later surface
    and subsurface flow) right to the continental scale (through routing of water
    in river systems), and even globally (through atmospheric water transport) (Pringle,
    2003; Savio et al., 2015; Van der Ent et al., 2010; Western et al., 1998). These
    spatial hydrological connectivities are relevant in terms of water quantity, such
    as upstream water uses that reduce downstream discharge; upstream flood retention
    that reduces downstream floods; water quality, that is, groundwater contamination
    affecting water quality further down the aquifer; and ecologically, such as in
    wetlands or at the river system scale. These linkages also shape institutions,
    which interact at all spatial scales, from individuals to governments. Social
    stratification, power relationships, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases
    strongly influence the way in which different social groups can (or not) alter,
    perceive, and adapt to hydrological change. These heterogeneous elements also
    determine how water governance unfolds and, in turn, how water is managed at different
    scales (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2017). As suggested by Zwarteveen
    et al. (2017), water governance is inherently political and concerns decisions
    on where and to whom water flows to and the institutions, norms, and beliefs underlying
    these decision-making processes (see also Wei et al., 2017). Moreover, humans
    are diverse, interpretive creatures who frequently disagree about values, means,
    and ends (Castree et al., 2014: p.765; Massuel et al., 2018; Hulme, 2010). Most
    phenomena discussed in section 2 can have a spatial component. For example, the
    pendulum swing manifested itself as a spatial process in the Kissimmee River basin
    in Florida (Chen et al., 2016). Severe flooding in the rural part of the catchment
    in the 1950s led to river training, which, however, degraded the local wetlands.
    The community in the urban part of the catchment valued the environment more than
    flood mitigation (as the latter did not concern them directly) resulting in river
    being remeandered and the wetlands being restored. The safe-development paradox,
    or levee effect, very often has a spatial component when the construction of polders
    upstream of the floodplains under risk is considered. The irrigation efficiency
    paradox or rebound effect often has a spatial component in transboundary river
    management when water use increases due to regional water transfers (Dell''Angelo
    et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2016). Socio-hydrological entities are interconnected
    in today''s highly connected world. The space-time linkages are not only within
    each scale but also across scales and can lead to emergence of diverse phenomena
    such as large-scale droughts. Trade networks spread knowledge and can bring in
    sudden changes in land use policies such as rapid deforestation in the Amazon
    or even changes in how resources are governed. The understanding of dynamic patterns
    of interconnectedness through trade and the global hydrological cycle is therefore
    critical to the assessment of long-term water resource availability at global
    and local scales. This demands an extension of systems with endogenous human agency
    to space and to space-time. A natural extension is therefore to endogenize the
    boundary conditions themselves, for example, of trade or rainfall, just as sociohydrology
    has endogenized scenarios in the time domain, for example, of population growth,
    through bidirectional feedbacks. This requires us to understand additional processes
    that connect socio-hydrological entities in space, with the goal of explaining
    why aggregated, macroscopic behavior emerges from heterogeneous components. 3.2
    Evaluating the Implications of the SDGs: Integrating Quantitative and Qualitative
    Data One scientific challenge in sociohydrology is integrating qualitative reporting
    and case studies to provide in-depth, context specific, critical descriptions
    of human-water interactions at different scales (Massuel et al., 2018; Mostert,
    2018; Sexsmith & McMichael, 2015; Weststrate et al., 2018). This approach can
    contribute to widen the parameters used to examine the effectiveness of SDGs and
    ensure aspects related to human psychological, physical, and emotional well-being
    are taken into consideration. A second reason for integrating quantitative and
    qualitative data is to deepen the analysis of phenomena and processes that may
    enable or constrain the success of SDGs. This also entails critically examining
    the implementation of the water-related SDGs by questioning the underlying political,
    ideological, and economic logics. Several authors have warned that no long-term
    prosperity is possible without changes in the current economic system and that
    the new targets will not be effective if structural processes that perpetuate
    poverty are not addressed (Bello, 2013; Death & Gabay, 2015; Langford, 2016; Liverman,
    2018). This interpretation shared by the UN report of the high-level panel of
    eminent persons on the post-2015 development, co-chaired by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
    (at the time President of Indonesia), Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (at the time President
    of Liberia), and David Cameron (at the time Prime Minister of the United Kingdom),
    recognizes that it is unrealistic to think we can help another one billion people
    to lift themselves out of poverty […] without making structural changes in the
    world economy and calls for new models (United Nations, UN, 2013: p.5). Vandemoortele
    (2011, p. 13), one of the architects of the Millennium Development Goals, claimed
    that they have been misappropriated to reaffirm the conventional view of development.
    SDGs need to propose a new vision and a new understanding of sustainability, economic
    growth, and the environment, recognizing that the global economy services society,
    which lies within Earth''s life-support system (Griggs et al., 2013: 305; see
    also Bello, 2013). In other words, this requires a transformative change in the
    ways that economic development is conceived (sustainability) and financed (accountability
    and priority setting) and the benefits thereof are distributed (equity, Mawdsley,
    2018; Mawdsley, 2017; Sexsmith & McMichael, 2015). A productive engagement between
    sociohydrology and critical resource geography may produce relevant insights on
    the relation between financial flows, power, and hydrological flows in the implementation
    of the water-related SDGs at different temporal and spatial scales, as well as
    on how the benefits and costs of these developments are distributed between societal
    groups and across spaces. In doing so, sociohydrology has the potential to contribute
    more effectively also to goals focusing on poverty (SDG 1) and equity (SDG 10).
    These examinations, we argue, require both integrating qualitative approaches
    alongside quantitative analyses and within modeling exercises to better understand
    the current socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts in different locations
    and how these contribute to co-shape SDG outcomes. Given its theoretical paradigm,
    sociohydrology is well positioned to play a catalytic role in integrating qualitative
    and quantitative data, yet this endeavor entails major scientific challenges.
    A first challenge in doing this is offered by different epistemologies, research
    strategies, and axiologies of qualitative and quantitative approaches (Mostert,
    2018; Romagny & Cudennec, 2006; Wesselink et al., 2016). To preserve the richness
    and epistemological perspective of qualitative approaches, Mostert (2018) suggests
    developing case studies on the multiple ways in which humans alter hydrology in
    specific contexts and carefully selecting cases for comparative analysis and,
    possibly, for generalization of some patterns (see, for instance, Robinson, 2016).
    In their study on drinking water quality in the city of Lilongwe, Rusca, Boakye-Ansah,
    et al., 2017; Rusca, Alda-Vidal, et al., 2017) propose a case study design that
    accounts for both the complexity of the human dimension(s) and material and quantitative
    variables of the hydrological system. This approach allows retaining central themes
    of scholars in critical water studies and political ecology such as the role of
    ideology, power, class, gender, culture, and everyday practices in controlling
    and directing water flows in rural, urban, and regional landscapes and the uneven
    distribution of costs and benefits thereof (Alda-Vidal et al., 2018; Ekers & Loftus,
    2008; Swyngedouw, 1997; Tiwale et al., 2018; Truelove, 2011; Truelove, 2016),
    and relating these to changes to the hydrological system. A second specific challenge
    with integrating quantitative and qualitative data concerns how to capture aspects
    that are (i) heterogeneous (i.e., diverse for different social groups), (ii) typically
    described in a qualitative way, and (iii) rarely collected in a systematic fashion.
    For instance, by looking at the five variables of the loop diagram presented earlier
    in Figure 3a, one can see that while some of these variables can be easily quantified
    and are often available as systematic time series (e.g., flooding, expressed as
    high water levels above a datum; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013,Di Baldassarre,
    Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015), others are more qualitative
    and typically not systematically available over time (e.g., flood memory, expressed
    as the level of risk awareness in a community; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al.,
    2013; Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015). Moreover,
    flood memory is heterogeneously accumulated in different individuals or social
    groups, and these various individuals or social groups have different capacities
    to influence the decision-making process and to feed back on the hydrological
    system. In socio-hydrological modeling, the most common approach has been to turn
    qualitative information into quantitative using some proxies, such as flood insurance
    coverage as an analog of the level of flood risk awareness (Di Baldassarre et
    al., 2017), or using social media coverage, newspaper articles, or Google trends
    (Roby et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2017). Yet these short-cut methods raise numerous
    concerns, such as limited representativeness and their unavoidable inability to
    describe the heterogeneity of human society. Thus, there remains a need to better
    integrate social and hydrological sciences as well as qualitative and quantitative
    information for the study of human-water interactions. 3.3 Exploiting Socio-Hydrologic
    Understanding to Enable Improved IWRM Practice The advances expected to be made
    in socio-hydrologic understanding raises the question as to how these can help
    advance water management practice, notably IWRM, in the context of the UN SDGs.
    Sociohydrology can play a role in working toward societal water goals in two major
    ways. First, sociohydrology aims to provide scientific insights that can be used
    to inform IWRM. This is the detection and understanding of phenomena that exist
    in water resources management (see above; sections 2 and 3). Both sociohydrology
    and IWRM aim to help achieve SDGs (Figure 5), particularly the water-related targets
    highlighted in Figure 2. Second, sociohydrology is well-suited to scientifically
    evaluate the consequences of IWRM implementation. For example, sociohydrology
    can integrate understanding from the policy evaluation community (e.g., causal
    inference) to assess whether or not water management or policy had the intended
    outcome. In this way, sociohydrology and IWRM should strive to inform one another
    and learn from each other in a two way street of information exchange (see Figure
    5). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Conceptual framing of the relationships
    between sociohydrology, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), and the
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Both sociohydrology and IWRM strive to achieve
    the SDGs. It is imperative that sociohydrology and IWRM communicate with each
    other and learn from one another to this end. As discussed in section 2, several
    emergent phenomena have been established through sociohydrology research. These
    phenomena have clear implications for IWRM. In Table 1, we map how a better understanding
    of socio-hydrological phenomena can provide useful insights to improve IWRM and
    help lead to desirable societal goals set forth by SDGs. For instance, through
    a better understanding of the rebound effect, we show that implementing drip irrigation
    alone will not lead to reduced water use, but, rather, may actually lead to increased
    water use. This means that IWRM should consider implementing counteracting measures,
    such as water basin use caps, along with irrigation efficiency technologies. It
    is essential to evaluate whether an IWRM intervention actually leads to the desired
    outcome. For example, does installing improved sanitation in a local community
    actually lead to reductions in waterborne diseases and diarrheal outbreaks? Sociohydrology
    can lead the way in evaluating whether or not IWRM interventions have the desirable
    impacts. Sociohydrology can do this through the adoption of novel techniques from
    the policy evaluation and econometrics fields. In fact, this increased interaction
    between sociohydrology and economics was recently called for by Müller and Levy
    (2019). The tools of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and causal inference
    using natural experiments in empirical information can be exploited to properly
    determine whether or not IWRM interventions are leading toward the desired societal
    goals or the SDGs. When possible, RCTs should be used to determine the outcome
    of an intervention. For example, to address the question about improved sanitation
    implementation discussed above, it would be best to install improved sanitation
    facilities randomly in some locations and not install them in others and then
    assess the outcomes (Null et al., 2018). The key is that the treatment (e.g.,
    improved sanitation) must be randomly assigned in order to determine its causal
    impact on the societal outcome of interest (e.g., diarrhea). RCTs are the gold
    standard for assessing the impact of a treatment. For this reason, whenever possible,
    randomization of IWRM management techniques or interventions would be the preferred
    course of action. Unfortunately, it will often not be feasible to perform an RCT
    to evaluate IWRM action. This is because they are expensive, time consuming, and
    may sometimes be unethical. For this reason, exploiting naturally occurring data
    (i.e., nonexperimental) that has some attributes that can help us to distinguish
    that causal impact of the treatment on the outcome of interest is critical. This
    is the aim of causal inference in econometrics. Causal inference has recently
    been applied to understand how human interventions impact water resources, such
    as for crop insurance (Deryugina & Konar, 2017) and international trade (Dang
    & Konar, 2018). Going forward, it will be of continued importance for sociohydrology
    to employ causal inference tools to assess the performance of IWRM in helping
    us meet the SDGs. 3.4 Addressing a Societal Grand Challenge: Managing Trade-Offs
    Between SDGs and Overcoming Legacy Risks The water crises that humanity faces
    are increasingly multifaceted, complex, and intertwined. This is clearly reflected
    in the fact that many of the United Nations SDGs may affect or are affected by
    the quantity and quality of water resources (Figure 2). Linear and short-term
    approaches to fix one problem in isolation often trigger new problems. Failure
    to anticipate and comprehensively address emergent water-related risks of floods,
    droughts, and water-quality degradation holistically and inclusively can cause
    economic decline and can lead some communities into a poverty trap, an emergent
    phenomenon highlighted by Borgeomo et al. (2018) based on work in Bangladesh.
    This shows how, at a broader level, water management is intimately tied to SDG
    1, which aims at eradicating poverty. Managing water-related issues comprehensively
    and holistically thus requires nontrivial decisions about what to prioritize (e.g.,
    drinking vs sanitation vs food), who pays to address these issues and how much,
    how the benefits and the costs of these measures are distributed (rich vs poor,
    upstream vs downstream, and urban vs rural), and how to balance benefits and costs
    (economic vs environmental vs social). It is essential to fully integrate water
    resources management across the entire socio-hydrological cycle; different water
    users including engineering, economic, social, ecological, and legal aspects;
    and spatial scales, including, for example, upstream/downstream perspectives.
    While technical measures can work in the short term, the absent (or limited) involvement
    of society-at-large (i.e., the beneficiaries) often leads to adverse consequences
    such as resistance to (or nonacceptance of) introduced policies. Recognizing the
    nonlinear nature of human-water systems and pursuing broader and long-term perspectives
    are key steps to craft more robust decisions (Haasnoot et al., 2013) and tackle
    the current and future water challenges in a more sustainable way. Figure 6 illustrates,
    in a simple and schematized way, the variation over time of the performance in
    addressing societal challenges. It can be seen, for example, as a composite value
    of various indicators for the achievement of the SDGs. For the sake of simplicity,
    we consider only two of them (i) the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
    (SDG8, Indicator for target 1.1); and the extent of wetlands over time (SDG 6,
    Indicator for target 6.6). In Figure 6a, we see that Path 1 gets closer than Path
    2 to the composite target by 2030, which is the year in which SDGs are expected
    to be achieved. A short-term approach would therefore favor policies associated
    with Path 1. However, Path 2 is more sustainable, and it is more effective than
    Path 1 in the longer term (Figure 6a). Figures 6b and 6c decompose these two paths
    and exemplify how short-term perspectives can become unsustainable in the long
    term. Path 1 relies on fast economic growth but with unsustainable environmental
    costs, that is, degradation of wetlands and aquifer depletion. In the long term,
    not only does this narrow approach prevent further growth but it also leads to
    increasing poverty (Figure 6b). Path 2, instead, is promoting economic growth
    but without compromising the environment, depleting water resources, and compromising
    future generations. In the long term, this broader approach results more sustainable
    (Figure 6c). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Addressing a societal grand
    challenge, for example, performance in achieving the SDGs. Conceptual drawings
    illustrating: (a) short-term (Path 1) versus long-term (Path 2) perspective. Path
    1 gets closer than Path 2 to the composite target by 2030, which is the year in
    which SDGs are expected to be achieved, but Path 2 is more sustainable and more
    effective than Path 1 in the longer term. (b and c) Decompositions of Path 1 (short-term)
    and Path 2 (long-term) exemplifying how short-term perspectives can become unsustainable
    in the long term. Path 1 relies on fast economic growth but with unsustainable
    environmental costs, that is, degradation of wetlands and aquifer depletion. (d
    and e) Possibility space and decision trees for Path 1 (constrained) Path 2 (unconstrained).
    These two panels show that water policies and management decisions are typically
    updated over time (dots in the diagrams). The possibility space of Path 1 becomes
    constrained (Figure 6d) once that water resources are depleted, as environmental
    degradation and economic decline are essentially irreversible. The possibility
    space of Path 2 remains unconstrained (Figure 6e), that is, policy and decision
    makers can keep influencing the trajectory over time and therefore adjust and
    adapt to, for example, climatic and socio-economic changes. Indeed, all of the
    socio-hydrological phenomena discussed previously in section 2 can be seen as
    a legacy: the result of a coevolution between hydrological, technical, and social
    systems, which influence or constrain today''s decision. As the past was a legacy
    to the present, the present is a legacy for the future. This implies that water
    policies and management decisions have a legacy risk. Short-term fixes based on
    linear thinking can have negative repercussion in the long term, which might be
    difficult, if not impossible, to reverse, that is, a lock-in condition. To cope
    with legacy risks, we need to look at future trajectories and exclude decisions
    that cannot be reversed, that is, not to constraining the future possibility space.
    Thus, understanding how the interactions and feedbacks between social, technical,
    and hydrological processes generate legacy in water management is crucial to reducing
    legacy risk. Figures 6d and 6e illustrate these concepts. Path 1 and Path 2 are
    represented using decision trees in the possibility space. This illustration reflects
    the fact that water policies and management decisions are typically updated over
    time. In the example of Figure 6d, the possibility space of Path 1 becomes constrained
    once that water resources are depleted, as environmental degradation and economic
    decline are essentially irreversible. Instead, the possibility space of Path 2
    remains nonconstrained. Policy and decision makers can keep influencing the trajectory
    over time and therefore adjust and adapt to, for example, climatic and socio-economic
    changes. The concept of legacy risk ties in well with the precautionary principle.
    In its strongest formulation, the precautionary principle calls for absolute proof
    of safety before allowing new technologies to be adopted (Foster et al., 2000).
    It is an important component of much of the environmental legislation in the western
    world. The reasoning is similar to that of legacy risk, that is, to err on the
    side of least consequences. In fact, the concept of legacy risk can be interpreted
    as a dynamic version of the precautionary principle. When in doubt, the decisions
    we make must try to avoid those development paths that potentially have irreversible
    effects resulting from the types of phenomena discussed in this paper. The generalized
    understanding of phenomena that may lead to lock-in situations, be they economically,
    politically, culturally, or environmentally driven, will provide guidance as to
    what extent the principle should be weighed against quantitative evidence, cost-benefit
    analyses, and discretionary judgment. Work on time-space scale interactions, the
    opportunities of using both qualitative and quantitative information, and setting
    up a more integrated interdisciplinary collaboration process will help in making
    progress in understanding generalizable phenomena. The levee effect, supply-demand
    cycles, and the irrigation efficiency paradox are all reflections of coupled human-water
    processes that may or may not constrain future decision making. 4 Conclusions
    In this paper, we examined the role of sociohydrology in addressing the societal
    grand challenges posed by the SDGs. We argued that sociohydrology is an appropriate
    analytical framework to conceptualize and evaluate the water implications of the
    SDGs. First, sociohydrology can act as an interface between the SDGs and IWRM
    principles. In conceptualizing water challenges, sociohydrology considers socio-cultural
    and socio-political dimensions as well as short-term and long-term impacts of
    water governance processes. As such, it provides both actionable and generalizable
    insights on short- and long-term impacts of the strategies adopted to meet the
    SDGs targets. Second, sociohydrology has focused on the explanation of a wide
    range of phenomena that may enable or constrain the success of water-related SDGs.
    There is considerable scope for applying these insights to strategies developed
    by different countries to meet the SDGs. Last, in the coming years sociohydrology
    will critically examine the implementation of the water-related SDGs to monitor
    their short- and long-term sustainability. Concurrently, the paper identified
    a series of research directions to further sociohydrology and enhance its contribution
    to the SDGs. We propose a research agenda that widens the range of phenomena—including
    water pollution and health-related challenges, the water-food-energy nexus, and
    transboundary water governance—and explores and tests innovative methodologies
    to trace water-society interactions at different temporal and spatial scales.
    To achieve the United Nations SDGs, there is a need to (i) capture the complex,
    multifaceted nature of human-water systems and (ii) explore long-term dynamics
    associated with alternative policies. These two aspects have been the very essence
    of socio-hydrological research over the past 6 years. However, it is no longer
    adequate to investigate, after the fact, the causes of water crises in different
    contexts and frame them theoretically as the unintended consequences of water
    resources management or governance. Increasingly, sociohydrology must aspire to
    assist communities involved in IWRM to frame water-related issues in broader terms
    and develop models capable of generating likely alternative futures under various
    policy options (Bai et al., 2016). This will empower communities, and in particular
    the IWRM community, to make more informed decisions for sustainable development
    and management of water resources. This requires a broadening of the theoretical
    foundations and methodological diversity of sociohydrology, going beyond individual
    phenomena, and toward mapping out the safe operating space for humanity to manage
    their water resources sustainably. By being open to face up to these scientific
    challenges, sociohydrology is well placed to help communities to meet the SDGs,
    the societal grand challenge of our time. Acknowledgments This work was developed

    We conceptualize social-ecological systems (SESs) as complex adaptive systems
    where public policy affects and is affected by the biophysical system in which
    it is embedded. The study of robustness of SESs combines insights from various
    disciplines including economics, political science, ecology, and engineering.
    In this paper we present an approach that can be used to explore the implications
    for public policy when viewed as a component of a complex adaptive system. Our
    approach leverages the Institutional Analysis and Development framework to provide
    a platform for interdisciplinary research that focuses on system-wide outcomes
    of the policy process beyond just policy change. The main message is that building
    robustness can create new vulnerabilities. Fail-free policies cannot be developed,
    and instead of a focus on the “right” policy, we need to think about policy processes
    that stimulate experimentation, adaptation, and learning. Introduction Public
    policy processes are complex, dynamic phenomena. Understanding such dynamic phenomenon
    requires some sort of strategy for simplification—some way to isolate key system
    components and relationships among them that can be generalized to understand
    how the system structure defined by these components and relationships relates
    to policy outcomes across various contexts. There has been steady development
    of improved policy theory (Sabatier, 1999, 2007) focusing on better understanding
    of how actors, problems, solutions, and decision opportunities interact to generate
    policy change. Such theories often focus on explaining policy change within a
    given organizational context that defines decision venues, restricts how agents
    interact, determines costs and benefits of interactions and particular outcomes.
    Given the notion of a policy cycle (the feedback from policy change back into
    the policy process in Figure 1A) or some period for a policy change of interest
    to play out, it is often reasonable to assume that key elements of the policy
    context remain stable. The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) (Sabatier, 1988)
    makes this explicit by defining “relatively stable parameters” that frame the
    policy process: (i) basic attributes of the problem area; (ii) basic distribution
    of natural resources; (iii) fundamental socio-cultural values and social structure;
    and (iv) basic constitutional structure (Sabatier & Jenkins-Smith, 1993) that
    are assumed to remain stable for approximately 100 years or more. Figure 1 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint (A): The Policy Process as a Flow-Through System in
    which Policy Challenges Generated in a Fixed Policy Context Are Processed and
    Produce Policy Change. (B): The Policy Process as Part of a Dynamic, Self-Organizing
    Feedback System. There are situations, however, in which the assumption of a stable
    policy context begins to break down. Recent work suggests that some policy contexts
    exhibit the capacity to rapidly transform from one stable configuration to another
    (Brock, 2006; Brock, Carpenter, & Scheffer, 2008; Scheffer & Carpenter, 2003;
    Scheffer, Carpenter, Foley, Folke, & Walker, 2001). In these instances, the policy
    context remains stable for long periods then, often due to policy choices themselves,
    rapidly shifts under the feet of the policy process (Brock et al., 2008). In such
    cases, we need to link the notion of the policy process to the policy context
    and provide a systematic approach to understand the dynamic interaction between
    the two. Here we present a framework intended to forge this link; the additional
    loop pictured in Figure 1B. The intent of the framework is to embed the policy
    process in a dynamically evolving policy context driven by the feedbacks between
    biophysical processes and policy processes. Viewed in this way, the policy process
    can be understood as an emergent property of a dynamic, underlying social-ecological
    system. The framework is based on ideas from institutional rational choice and
    an extension of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, familiar
    to many policy scholars. The key contribution of this article is to provide ideas,
    language, and tools to move from the conception of the policy process shown in
    Figure 1A to that in Figure 1B. The framework presented here pushes beyond the
    extension of the IAD framework to better accomodate biophysical context. Ostrom''s
    (2009) social-ecological system (SES) framework already accomplishes this, and
    many policy scholars will no doubt be familiar with it. The SES framework provides
    a mechanism to systematically parse a system composed of a set of actors (resource
    users), a governance structure, and a resource system into its component parts
    for the purpose of studying the sustainability of a particular SES. Here we focus
    on understanding fundamental principles of feedback systems like that in Figure 1B
    that transcend the specific details of a particular SES. Specifically, we explore
    how the fit1 between different elements of SESs affects their robustness characteristics.
    The robustness characteristics of a SES are intimately related with its capacity
    to cope with uncertainty and change. Although the SES framework acknowledges dynamics
    and feedbacks, it provides no systematic methodology to study them. For this,
    we need another set of ideas. The Robustness Framework we discuss here, like the
    SES Framework, is an extension of the IAD Framework. Unlike the SES Framework,
    the Robustness Framework provides an additional layer of ideas to more explicitly
    address subtleties that arise from nonlinear dynamics and feedback (Anderies,
    Rodriguez, Janssen, & Cifdaloz, 2007) in SESs and how they may be accounted for
    in the policy process. Our approach views SESs as complex adaptive systems whose
    attributes are continuously evolving and adapting at different scales and levels
    of organization.2 Humans experiment with new institutional arrangements and may
    copy and adjust institutions that seem to work in other situations through an
    evolutionary process of institutional change. The long-lasting SESs studied by
    Ostrom and her colleagues are the results of this process playing out over several
    decades or centuries. The aim of this paper is to present the framework that underpins
    our transdisciplinary approach to a policy studies audience. Our conception of
    public policy is very much informed by our work on small-scale communities who
    self-organize their institutions within a nested system of institutional arrangements
    and biophysical dynamics rather than formal policy processes at the national scale.
    However, our approach that draws on both the SES Framework (see Figure 4) and
    Robustness Framework (see Figure 3) is easily extensible to broader classes of
    problems of interest to policy scholars. To allay the reader''s fear of “framework
    overload,” we note that the Robustness and SES frameworks are, in fact, closely
    related (Ostrom being involved in the development of both) and we use them together
    in the approach presented here. Changing Scales and New Public Policy Theory Both
    conceptions of the policy process shown in Figure 1 are perfectly reasonable.
    Which one to choose is a matter of the relative social, biophysical, and temporal
    scales relevant to the problem of interest. These relative scales determine the
    degree of connectedness between different components of policy subsystems and
    the policy context. Note, in the ACF, the policy context is assumed to be constant
    over periods on the order of a century (Weible & Sabatier, 2007). This implies
    that the feedback through the biophysical system is very slow compared with the
    feedback from policy change back into the policy process itself. Often, this is
    a reasonable assumption, and Figure 1A is the appropriate view. It may be necessary
    to shift to the representation in Figure 1B when the feedbacks through the biophysical
    system begin to operate on timescales that approach that on which the policy process
    occurs. This may occur when the policy process slows down (e.g., climate negotiations),
    the dynamics induced by positive feedbacks speed up (e.g., melting of Greenland''s
    ice sheets, rapid social movements), or both. It is important to distinguish between
    variation in a fixed policy context and dynamic change in coupled SES. A “fixed
    policy context” may involve considerable variation as long as that variation exhibits
    a stable structure. Public policy has long been addressing this type of variation,
    typically manifest in conceptions of “risk.” The Code of Hammurabi, for example,
    deals with very specific types of risk: If a landlord lets his land for fixed
    rental fee, if bad weather destroys the harvest, the code specifies that the injury
    falls upon the tenant. In rental contracts based on harvest shares, on the other
    hand, the landlord and tenant share the risk of crop loss (and the potential benefit
    of a bumper crop). The numerous references in Hammurabi''s code to risk and environmental
    variability are a testament to how long public policy has had to address environmental
    variability. Further, the focus on assignment of risk and emphasis on clear delineation
    of social roles (position rules sensu, Ostrom, 1990, 2005) suggests that part
    of the challenge for public policy in early societies may have been the smooth
    functioning of society in the face of ever-present environmental variation. In
    some sense, this type of policy was focused at a small spatial scale—on the tight
    connection between the individual and local biophysical context. In this case,
    Figure 1A is a good representation of the system: The policy context is fixed,
    delivering a reasonably stable distribution of exogenously driven weather events
    (shocks). These shocks impacted individuals who likely had reasonable information
    about expected payoffs and could choose appropriate contracts. Here, public policy,
    or the code, is a constraint regarding what types of contracts are allowed for
    spreading risk, reducing conflict, and promoting social stability. It is interesting
    to note that the discourse on societal collapse tends to focus on the interaction
    of the inner policy feedback and the outer biophysical context feedback. Tainter
    (1990) invokes the increasing complexity of infrastructure necessary to solve
    increasingly difficult problems that occur on ever larger regional or continental
    scales as societies grow. Eventually, this complexity collapses under its own
    weight, perhaps triggered by a series of decisions occurring on the inner, faster
    feedback loop. Butzer (2012) details how a series of slower (centennial scale)
    biophysical process on the outer loop such as agricultural soil and pastoral degradation
    combine with slower economic and social processes such as loss of economic networks,
    productivity, and persistent poverty to set the preconditions for collapse. Collapse
    may be precipitated by processes (e.g., intrainstitutional conflict, polarization
    of elites) or averted by processes (rallying of elites, social transformation)
    on the inner feedback loop on faster (decadal) time scales. In both these cases,
    slow feedbacks through the biophysical system cause the policy context to change.
    Much like in these historical examples of collapse, the types of environmental
    challenges we face today cannot be treated as exogenous shocks, i.e., in terms
    of risk. The scale of the human enterprise has reached a point where human actions
    affect the biophysical environment at such a scale and speed that irreversible
    effects can be observed in a human''s life span. We now, for example, measurably
    impact global biogeochemical cycles (Schlesinger, Cole, Finzi, & Holland, 2011;
    Vitousek et al., 1997). In such circumstances, individual human actions add up
    to generate impacts that fundamentally change the nature of the policy context
    itself. There are two key questions that arise in this regard: (i) Can the policy
    process, which often plays out on the order of decades, possibly function when
    the policy context changes rapidly?; and (ii) When the policy process and policy
    context involving a dynamic biophysical system co-evolve as a coupled feedback
    system depicted in Figure 1B, under what circumstances does infrastructure (socio-technical
    structures) emerge that makes the system flexible and robust versus rigid and
    vulnerable in the face of novel change? These questions are critical for public
    policy in the modern context in which globalization and global environmental change
    are generating a highly connected global-scale system in which decisions at small
    scales are influenced by and will influence processes at the global scale in unpredictable
    and novel ways (Adger, Eakin, & Winkels, 2009). Will public policy (and societies
    themselves) be able to respond to the sheer pace at which social and natural systems
    are currently changing? If faced with one of either natural or social change,
    perhaps the answer is yes. However, in the face of simultaneous impacts of global
    environmental change and globalization (O''Brien & Leichenko, 2000), they may
    not be able to cope. How do we conduct the public policy process in coupled SESs
    when the temporal and spatial scales of both human activity and our impacts on
    biophysical dynamics have fundamentally changed, and when the traditional approach
    of providing the best option to a concrete problem is insufficient? Here we describe
    a set of ideas and tools designed to analyze dynamic feedback systems of which
    the classes of SESs depicted in Figure 1B are examples. To do so, we will briefly
    define SESs and present the Robustness and SES frameworks to analyze how systems
    deal with disturbances and stress. We will illustrate the use of this collection
    of tools to examine the fit between institutional arrangements and ecological
    dynamics. The idea of “fit,” explored in detail next, is realized by characterizing
    trade-offs in the capacity of the SES to cope with different types of shocks.
    These trade-offs arise as a result of a fundamental property of feedback systems—conservation
    of fragility (or vulnerability). Put simply, this implies that it is not possible
    to design public policy for a given ecological (environmental) context—i.e., achieve
    a fit between policies and the biophysical context so that the SES is robust to
    all possible shocks. Thus, one aspect of the public policy process is effectively
    navigating trade-offs between performance and robustness and choices between different
    vulnerabilities. We will discuss possible approaches to this policy challenge
    with reference to ideas from robust control that emphasizes system properties
    such as modularity, diversity, and redundancy; and through reflections on the
    polycentric approach of Ostrom. The Robustness and SES Frameworks The idea of
    a “coupled social ecological system” emerged in response to what was seen as failed
    resource management policy from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Several scholars
    recognized that in most cases, management policies resulted in unintended consequences
    because they neglected the coupling between social and ecological systems. Early
    collaborations between mathematical biologists and theoretical ecologists extending
    ideas from systems theory (feedback systems like that in Figure 1B) focused on
    how “fast” and “slow” processes interact to generate cycles of change in ecological
    systems. The big message was that ecological systems do not tend toward a stable
    “climax” state (Clements, 1916) characterized by stable distributions of species
    such as an old growth forest that management policy should seek to maintain. Rather,
    management policy, and by extension, public policy, must be designed to manage
    complex cyclical dynamics and acknowledge the potential for abrupt regime shifts
    (Gunderson, Peterson, & Holling, 2008; Holling, 1973, 1978, 1979; Holling & Gunderson,
    2002; Ludwig, Walker, & Holling, 1997; Ludwig, Jones, & Holling, 1978). A regime
    shift occurs when the key drivers in a system fundamentally change. A well-known
    example is when key drivers that affect the dynamics of phosphorus concentration
    in the water column in a lake change and the water shifts from clear blue (oligotrophic)
    to green and turbid (eutrophic). Examples of regime shifts in the social domain
    are easy to imagine. One interesting example relates to footbinding in Taiwan
    (Brown & Feldman, 2009). Footbinding was practiced by Han Chinese who settled
    in Taiwan but not by Taiwanese aborigines. This difference in custom strongly
    influenced marriage patterns between the groups. When footbinding was banned by
    the government in 1915 (an exogenous shock to public infrastructure), marriage
    patterns and social roles changed drastically (a social regime shift). This newly
    emerging view of how ecosystems function began to be connected with social and
    economic systems through the resource management literature—especially the work
    of C. S. Holling and his collaborators. Holling''s observations of repeated resource
    management failures led him to define what he called the “command and control
    pathology of natural resource management” (Holling & Meffe, 1996) in which managers
    respond to erratic or surprising ecosystem behavior with increased top-down control
    in an attempt to reduce this variation. This reduction of natural variation leads
    to a loss of resilience of the ecological system which, in turn, leads to crises
    when the system experiences an exogenous shock. At the same time, Elinor Ostrom
    was also questioning the rationality of top-down, command-and-control governance
    structures (Ostrom, 1990) from a very different perspective. Ostrom''s argument
    was very powerful: Small groups of people can effectively manage complex resource
    systems without top-down governance structures. In fact, she suggested that top-down
    interventions could have pathological effects on social systems, reducing their
    capacity to solve problems and deal with change, similar to the way in which Holling
    envisioned the impact of top-down control on ecosystems. Fortunately, these research
    trajectories converged (Berkes, Colding, & Folke, 2003) and the concept of SESs
    was formalized. Through her collaborations with ecologists, economists, and dynamical
    systems theorists in the resilience research community, Ostrom worked for over
    a decade to connect her groundbreaking work on the IAD framework for institutional
    and public policy analysis to features of the biophysical context in which they
    operate. The result was the SES framework (Ostrom, 2007, 2009). The development
    of the SES framework was motivated, in part, by the need to understand governance
    in complex ecological contexts like those emphasized by resilience theorists—the
    potential for dramatic regime shifts—i.e., lakes that flip from oligotrophic to
    eutrophic conditions (Carpenter, Ludwig, & Brock, 1999) and policy choice in the
    face of potential catastrophic regime shifts (Brock et al., 2008). Resilience
    theorists emphasized nonlinear feedbacks and the interaction of processes occurring
    on different time scales. Although the IAD Framework (Figure 2) was likely not
    originally designed to address such problems, it, in fact, does provide the essential
    components. It explicitly contains the two feedback loops from Figure 1B, and
    has always recognized the importance of feedback. Further, the IAD is an example
    of a “feedback controller” of the type studied by controls specialists in electrical
    engineering. The entities on the left, the biophysical conditions, community,
    and rules, constitute a “plant” whose behavior reacts to feedback generated by
    applying evaluative criteria to outcomes (this is what a “controller” does in
    engineered systems). An essential question for policy analysis is when what the
    IAD framework refers to “external variables” can actually be treated as such.
    We argue that as the scale of the human enterprise grows, they almost never can.
    Most, if not all, spatial and temporal scales must be endogenized in the policy
    process. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The IAD Framework (Adapted

    external drivers and embedding were not specified in the original framework but

    First-Generation SES Framework (Adapted from Ostrom, 2007). The original framework
    did not include the numbers 7 or 8 on the links between exogenous drivers and
    the system in question. These have been added to show the correspondence between
    the SES Framework and the Robustness Framework in Figure 3. The color coding illustrates
    the rough correspondence between entities in the frameworks. To address the policy
    challenges we face today, we cannot consider only the feedback between policy
    outcomes and a fixed action situation through sequential policy cycles (inner
    loop in Figure 1B and Figure 2). We must fully consider the impacts of policies
    on more slowly changing (but potentially subject to rapid regime shifts) variables
    that structure action situations. Policy scholars recognize this, of course, and
    have written about various aspects of “long-run” feedbacks between policy choice
    and the biophysical context (e.g., Jaffe & Stavins, 1995; Kline, 2001) and between
    policy choice and the attributes of the community (e.g., Soroka & Wlezien, 2004;
    Soss & Schram, 2007). However, work in this area is underdeveloped, especially
    regarding issues of interest in this paper: the impact of uncertainty in feedback
    systems like those represented by the IAD Framework and how to effectively address
    it in our governance structures. Given the focus of the concepts of robustness
    and robust feedback control on feedback systems with uncertainty, they were a
    natural place to begin to extend the IAD Framework. This led Anderies, Janssen,
    and Ostrom (2004) to work on developing a framework to study the robustness of
    SESs from an institutional perspective (Figure 3). The Robustness Framework emphasizes
    the dynamic interactions between the “external variables” in the IAD framework
    that structure dynamically evolving action situations. The framework distinguishes
    between actors (shown in ovals) and infrastructure (shown as rectangles) and the
    relationship between those who use the resource, and those who may control it
    (public infrastructure providers), i.e., link 2 in Figure 3. Public policy enters
    the framework with public infrastructure. Public policy—the output of the public
    policy process—is a type of public infrastructure (e.g., legal systems) that in
    the case of resource management affects the relationship between resource users
    and the resource itself (link 1) through link 5. A simple example is a regulation
    such as an effort quota: Resource users can only harvest from the resource so
    many days per year—a common public policy measure in fisheries in the recent past.
    Also included with public infrastructure is hard infrastructure—bridges, roads,
    irrigation canals—also the subject of public investment, and thus of public policy.
    Link 6 highlights the importance of coproduction, the direct involvement of resource
    users that is often essential in the provision of public infrastructure (Ostrom,
    1996; Parks et al., 1981). As discussed earlier, the emphasis of this framework
    was not on the performance of particular policies per se. Rather, the focus was
    on the basic structure of relationships 1–6 and how they might enable SESs to
    cope with environmental shocks (arrows 7) such as floods (impact on public infrastructure)
    or drought (impact on resource) and social, political, economic shocks (arrows
    8). We refer to the structure of these relationships as the “fit” between the
    biophysical conditions, actors, and rules, as discussed below. The first-generation
    SES Framework pictured in Figure 4 is similar to the Robustness Framework conceptually,
    but returned its focus to understanding targeted public policy questions in the
    context of natural resource management. The methodological basis for the framework,
    which Ostrom referred to as “a multitier framework for analyzing a SES,” was based
    on a diagnostic approach, motivated by the analogue of diagnosis in the medical
    field. The systems that medical professionals work with are extraordinarily complex,
    and medical professionals have steadily moved away from simple panaceas—the simple
    remedies of the past. Ostrom argues that some policy practitioners have not come
    as far and still rely too much on panaceas (privatization, cap and trade). Each
    particular resource system has special characteristics that require careful policy
    design. Resource systems (or any system composed of human-made natural infrastructure)
    require a tailored policy cure, analogous to personalized medicine. Ostrom''s
    initial multitier framework (which later became the SES Framework) provided a
    tool to diagnose the problem and find a cure. It is clear by comparing Figures 3
    and 4 that the SES Framework is a special case of the Robustness Framework. The
    exogenous drivers of resource dynamics (arrow 7) were assumed to be quite general
    in the Robustness Framework. In the SES framework, these were replaced by related
    ecosystems. Likewise, the exogenous drivers impacting the resource users (RUs),
    public infrastructure providers (PIPs) (arrows 8), and the public infrastructure
    (PI) itself (arrow 7) have been instantiated as social, economic, and political
    settings in the SES Framework. In the Robustness Framework, the “Governance System”
    was conceptualized as the dynamic interaction among RUs, PIPs, PI via links 2,
    3, and 6. In this view, PI includes both “soft” and “hard” infrastructure necessary
    to govern a system. In the SES Framework in Figure 4, PI and PIPs are replaced
    with “Governance System” (GS). Finally, the resource system (RS) in Figure 4 was
    conceptualized as one aspect of exogenous drivers (arrow 7) or impact of infrastructure
    (arrow 4) on Resources in Figure 3. The resources in Figure 3 are the equivalent
    of resource units (RUs) in Figure 4. The policy process as conceptualized by policy
    studies scholars is captured explicitly in the Robustness Framework by link 3.
    This link refers to the dynamic interaction between PIPs (policy actors) and PI
    (the organizations and rules governing collective action in which the policy process
    plays out). Obviously, resource users who are affected by policy change through
    links 5 and 6 will enter into the policy process in a number of ways, e.g., as
    advocacy coalitions attempting to influence decisions of PIPs, if they are allowed
    to do so either through link 2 or 6. The Robustness Framework does not specify
    the dynamics of the policy process. More precisely, further delineation of the
    nature of links 2, 3, and 6 can generate a garbage can model (Cohen, March, &
    Olsen, 1972), its more refined cousin—the multiple streams framework of Kingdon
    (1984), or the ACF (Sabatier & Jenkins-Smith, 1993). What distinguishes the SES
    Framework from the Robustness Framework is that it provides a more systematic
    articulation of framework elements the relationships 1–8. Specifically, Ostrom
    identified second-tier variables associated with the top-tier variables depicted
    in Figure 4. Table 1 provides some examples of such variables. The text in bold
    indicates to what elements and relations in the Robustness Framework the variables
    relate. Analogous to linkages in the Robustness Framework, the second-tier variables
    are an entry point for a more specific articulation for how the policy process
    plays out. In fact, we are now at a point to begin to understand how policy studies
    intersect with the Robustness and SES frameworks. Specifically, we can explore
    how particular models of the policy process perform when coupled with particular
    classes of biophysical dynamics and uncertainties and in Figure 1B. Here, the
    aim is not to explain the policy process but, rather, to explore how different
    possible policy processes might function in a dynamic policy context. For instance,
    a garbage can policy process may be well suited to explore complex environments
    but may be very slow in developing appropriate policy for pressing problems, thus
    trading off short-term adaptive capacity for long-term learning. Likewise, an
    ACF policy process may perform well in quickly identifying alternative approaches
    to problems, but may crowd out exploration as actors join coalitions and build
    cases for particular points of view—a rather narrow type of learning. In the remainder
    of the paper we will attempt to illustrate how both the Robustness and SES frameworks
    can contribute to a collection of essential tools for public policy and governance
    for complexity (SES) and change (Robustness). Together, these frameworks provide
    a platform for interdisciplinary research that focuses on system-wide outcomes
    of the policy process beyond just policy change. They provide a more focused lens
    and systematic structure for studying the articulation between policy and the
    biophysical system elements in which it is embedded. Table 1. Examples of Second-Level

    Governance for Complexity and Change Using the basic elements presented in Figures 3
    and/or 4 along with Table 1, it seems reasonable to assume that policy designers
    have enough machinery at hand to generate reasonably good policies for reasonably
    well-bounded policy problems. Once reasonable policy options have been identified,
    our understanding of how policy processes unfold would then enable the implementation
    of those policies. However, what if the policy problem space is not reasonably
    well bounded? What if there is massive uncertainty about the links between actions
    and outcomes? What if the problem space encompasses a very large number of interacting
    elements? Such are the problem spaces we face in the environmental policy domain:
    biodiversity and resource management, climate change, and a globally interlinked
    economic system of spiraling complexity. Here we reflect on key challenges and
    opportunities for governing such systems. We note that Ostrom began applying concepts
    from work on institutions to this problem almost 20 years ago with her work on
    “designing complexity to govern complexity” (Ostrom, 1995, 1998). This work stressed
    the importance of “complex, nested systems of governance” (Ostrom, 1995, p. 34),
    comprised of “quasi-autonomous units operating at quite small up to extremely
    large scales” (Ostrom, 1998, p. 149). Ostrom suggests that the institutional design
    principles, derived from her work on self-governing SESs, provide some guidance
    as to how to design complexity to govern complexity. Although the design principles
    were derived from a research program whose emphasis was not on dynamics and change,
    they do establish collective choice processes that address dynamics on the time
    scale of the policy process. For example, they emphasize the creation and changing
    of rules, conflict resolution mechanisms, and monitoring and enforcement processes
    required to reach a policy equilibrium and maintain a governance regime. The challenge
    is to connect the dynamics occurring at the policy process level (relatively fast—e.g.,
    days, months) to those occurring at the SES level (relatively slow—e.g., years
    to centuries). Ostrom''s recognition of the need for additional tools to make
    this connection inspired her to develop the frameworks presented here. In the
    next section, we discuss two elements of SESs that are critical to governing changing,
    deeply uncertain systems: (i) the notion of “fit”; and (ii) fundamental properties
    of feedback systems. Following that we reflect on the associated set of design
    principles for such systems. Key Challenges The Fit between Institutional Arrangements
    and Ecological Dynamics The development of frameworks to study the interactions
    between social and ecological systems aims to provide a systematic way to analyze
    diverse and complex case studies. Although we know resource users are able to
    overcome collective action problems to share common-pool resources (CPRs) and
    provide public goods, there is increasing interest in addressing the “problem
    of fit”: the interplay between institutional arrangements and ecological dynamics
    (Folke, Pritchard, Berkes, Colding, & Svedin, 2007; Young, 2002). The importance
    of fit is greatest regarding operationalizing governance structures which requires
    translating de jure rules into rules-in-use. The core elements enabling this translation
    are monitoring, sanctioning, and conflict resolution (Ostrom, 2005). Thus, a “good
    fit” is one that leverages biophysical and social structures to reduce the costs
    of monitoring, sanctioning, and managing conflict (or its complement of maintaining
    fairness). Studies of long-lasting SESs such as fisheries, pastoralist and transhumance
    systems, irrigation systems, and forests, show that institutions developed by
    those systems are mainly based on where, when, and how to harvest, not how much
    to harvest (Ostrom, 2005; Schlager, 1994; Wilson, Acheson, Metcalfe, & Kleban,
    1994). This suggests that an understanding of the fit between institutions and
    ecology needs to incorporate how human activities can match the temporal and spatial
    dynamics of the specific resource. In the end, this match may have the effect
    of regulating the amount of resources withdrawn, but the fit, i.e., the linkages
    between the governance system and the resource being governed, will not be predicated
    on measuring harvest amounts—typically because this is too costly to monitor.
    For example, local resource users can be very effective in monitoring the use
    of a common-pool resource, especially due to their local knowledge and stake in
    the sustainability of the ecosystem. Paid guards from outside the local community
    can be effective as they may have access to better technology, especially if they
    are paid well (but this is costly). However, they may not have a stake in the
    SES, and thus may be prone to rent-seeking behavior and may see bribes as a source
    of income. The spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological systems affect the
    ability of monitors to observe resource use. When fishers harvest fish from a
    large territory, farmers withdraw water from a long irrigation canal, or villagers
    harvest from a large forest, it is almost impossible for them to see what everyone
    else is currently doing. Rules on who, where, when, and how to harvest are easier
    to monitor and enforce than a quota, and if there is more confidence that people
    are following the rules, others will follow them too. Could such a general principle
    to frame policy in terms of who, what, and when questions rather than how much
    questions improve public policy process outcomes? For example, policy based on
    science and its associated measurement protocols (very costly) may make policy
    change impossible as attention is focused on debatable human constructs and protocols
    (generates rather than resolves conflict), and are thus prone to being “poor fits,”
    regardless of the biophysical context. Policies with “good fits,” rather, tend
    to rely on more practical principles where measurement equates to common-sense,
    easily observable attributes of the biophysical context that are simple enough
    to not be debatable. Finding such practical principles many not be possible for
    all policy problems, but a focus on practical principles and common-sense measurement
    may still be a useful design principle for many situations. A governance regime
    that begins to rely on complex models and precise data that is costly to obtain
    is likely a “poor fit” in almost any context. Many farmer-managed irrigation systems
    allocate a particular time to a specific farmer depending on location along the
    canal and size of farm (and resulting contributions to maintenance of the system)
    (Burns, 1993; Maass & Anderson, 1978; Shivakoti & Ostrom, 2002). The frequent
    routine is to allocate a certain time block to a farmer in a specific order either
    from the head-end to the tail or from the tail-end to the head of the system (Meinzen-Dick,
    2007; Tang, 1992). In either case, that means that when the water transfers from
    Farmer A to Farmer B, both will be at their distribution point so that Farmer
    A gets as much water as possible but Farmer B is able to start watering crops
    on time. This system illustrates important linkages among public infrastructure,
    public infrastructure providers, and resource users (links 2 and 3 in Figure 3).
    Specifically, the nature of public infrastructure, both physical (an irrigation
    system) and institutional (appropriation rules based on the Spanish tanda system—i.e.,
    timed withdrawals), coupled with the fact that the resource users are, in fact,
    the public infrastructure providers for monitoring and enforcement of rules, generates
    an endogenous feedback system. This arrangement brings the two most important
    actors for ensuring that the rule is enforced to the correct monitoring point
    on the canal at the correct (same) time. This is an effective way to enable two
    key participants to monitor what is happening locally and to enforce any observed
    rule infractions. Further, this example of an excellent fit between soft infrastructure
    (rules) and hard infrastructure (the canals) solves the second-order collective
    action of who is monitoring the monitors. The “goodness of fit” is expressed in
    the fact that the incentives of the resource users and public infrastructure providers
    are very neatly aligned (attribute of link 2) and eliminate the second-order collective
    action dilemma. In some systems, such as fisheries, the state of the system (e.g.,
    location and number of fish) is much more costly (perhaps impossible) to measure.
    This affects the ability of agents in the system to collect information to feed
    back into the governance system. Not only is the state of the ecology difficult
    to determine, it might be that the behavior of resource users is difficult to
    monitor in some systems. If a fisher fishes on the open sea on his own and returns
    to port with his catch, there is only limited information that can be observed
    relating to the actual harvesting practices employed by that fisher. An important
    example is bycatch which is often not reported (Baker et al., 2006; Read, Drinker,
    & Northridge, 2006). As a consequence of the difficulties with monitoring fishers,
    some fisheries include an official monitor on each vessel (e.g., Alaska Fisheries
    Science Center, 2011). Other fisheries have strict gear restrictions that are
    easy to check in the harbors. This is yet another example of an institutional
    arrangement that fit the biophysical conditions: It is very easy to assess fishing
    gear and almost impossible to measure fish stocks. Given these and many other
    examples of how different types of infrastructure and actors are tightly linked
    and interact in subtle ways to produce successful governance outcomes, we are
    tempted to ask if there are general lessons that can be ported from successful
    SES governance structures to the context of the policy process. In their attempts
    to understand the complexity associated with the sheer number of variables, relationships,
    and feedbacks represented in Figures 3, 4, and Table 1, CPR scholars have naturally
    gravitated toward studying simpler, local CPRs. This begs the question of whether
    the SES and Robustness frameworks can be used to analyze modern, more complex
    policy situations. It is unlikely that any analytical framework will ever be able
    to cope with actual levels of complexity in real systems. We must, therefore,
    rely on design principles derived from the study of simple systems that remain
    reasonably effective as system complexity (i.e., number and diversity of agents,
    relationships, etc.) increases. That is, we need to learn to govern systems we
    can never fully understand. In fact, this is the very essence of robust control—a
    field that focuses on the construction of regulatory feedback networks to do just
    this. The strategy is based on the fact that networks of simple feedbacks can
    evolve to produce, for example, extraordinarily complex life-forms. Feedback is
    an extremely powerful tool to cope with complexity and uncertainty. Policymaking
    processes based on robust feedback control might embrace complexity and provide
    mechanisms to respond to failure like robust systems that are either designed,
    or have evolved, to do. For example, rather than finding the “correct” operational
    rules for a given SES, policy might focus on constructing effective collective
    choice rules that leverage feedback on both time scales in Figure 2 to change
    operational rules that do not work. The challenge is using feedback wisely; it
    is very powerful indeed, but generates its own set of problems. Using Feedback
    to Cope with Complexity, Disturbances, and Stress The discussion of “fit” in the
    previous section focused on reducing the cost of governance activities. In this
    section, we consider another aspect of fit: How do policies affect the ecological
    system to which they are applied? Do they amplify or dampen natural variation?
    Do they restructure certain ecological relationships? Consider a situation in
    which there is a clearly defined problem to be solved and in which the linkages
    between actions and outcomes is perfectly understood. In such a situation, it
    is possible in theory to generate a control system to achieve any particular policy
    outcome within the space of possible outcomes conditioned by the biophysical and
    social constraints. In such “perfect information” cases, policies can be made
    to literally run like clockwork, i.e., we can achieve a perfect fit between the
    control system and the system to be controlled. Very few real systems behave like
    this—even precisely designed ones. There are at least three reasons for this:
    We never have perfect information about the state of the system (e.g., we can
    never know the actual stock level in a fishery), we never fully understand the
    causal relationships that generate dynamics in SESs, and there are always exogenous
    disturbances and stresses impinging upon the system of interest. How can we design
    policy processes for such situations? It turns out that all complex biological
    systems (of which SESs are examples) must cope with uncertainty, stress, and disturbance.
    As such, complex biological systems with the capacity to adapt to these difficult
    circumstances have a common feature: They are composed of complex regulatory feedback
    networks. These distributed, multiscale networks make the maintenance precise
    biological processes possible. They also enable the control of uncertain systems,
    and are used extensively in engineered systems that must function in spite of
    disturbance and stress (e.g., modern passenger aircraft in the face of air turbulence—see
    below). A moment''s reflection reveals that SESs are feedback systems. Specifically,
    policies, in the broadest sense, are rules (institutions sensu, Ostrom, 1990,
    2005) that translate information about a system (e.g., state of the environment,
    demographics, etc.) into action that feeds back into the system. Thus, enacting
    a policy that affects the way humans interact with an ecological system can be
    (and often is) equivalent to adding a feedback loop to a SES. Feedback is an extremely
    powerful tool to create and maintain complexity. Given a particular set of disturbances,
    agents in SESs can construct policies (feedback controls) to increase performance
    (output) and robustness (minimize the sensitivity of the system to disturbance
    and stress). Over time, SESs can become extremely well adapted to a particular
    biophysical context, including the disturbance and stress associated with it,
    as well as critical policy processes required to implement policies under stress.
    Consider the case of the tramos in Diaz Ordaz, Mexico studied by Downing (1974)
    where conflict resolution mechanisms and water rights change from riparian to
    prior appropriations with the level of environmental stress. More generally, the
    process through which policy change can occur should likely be adaptive to exogenous
    stress and disturbances. There is one drawback to such fine-tuning: Feedback systems
    are known to exhibit inherent robustness-fragility trade-offs (Csete & Doyle,
    2002). Irrigation systems provide an important example: Human societies can build
    large-scale physical infrastructure (canals, reservoirs) and social infrastructure
    (rules for water allocation, canal maintenance) to eliminate sensitivity of food
    supply to interannual variation in local water supplies. However, in so doing,
    societies become much more vulnerable to low frequency variation in rainfall (the
    100-year flood that destroys the irrigation system) and social upheaval. That
    is, building robustness to certain classes of disturbances and increasing narrowly
    focused efficiency (e.g., agricultural yield) introduce fragilities in the system.
    Worse yet, such fragilities typically are hidden from the user by virtue of good
    design (Csete & Doyle, 2002), and are only exposed through failure. An irrigation
    system may work extremely well for a century, and no one is thinking about the
    100-year flood and subsequent famine until it happens. There is an increasing
    body of work suggesting that the capacity of systems to cope with stress and disturbance
    using feedback regulatory networks (policy networks) faces a hard limit (Chandra,
    Buzi, & Doyle, 2011; Rodriguez, Cifdaloz, Anderies, Janssen, & Dickeson, 2011).
    Thus, navigating such performance-robustness, robustness-fragility trade-offs
    through policy design and policy processes involving learning and exploration
    are an essential element of public policy. Public Policy Design Principles Given
    the challenges outlined above, what are the practical tools we can use to cope
    with change and disturbances? How do we extend the basic ideas that we have learned
    about the importance of “fit” between rules, actors, and biophysical context that
    increase the effectiveness of governance regimes? What principles should we employ
    to exploit the power of feedback to govern systems we do not (and can never fully)
    understand? How do we scale up lessons learned in applying the Robustness Framework
    from a small-scale irrigation system in Nepal with 120 households (e.g., Cifdaloz,
    Regmi, Anderies, & Rodriguez, 2010) to a large-scale, modern context like the
    Colorado River Basin with millions of households? Doing so requires that we address
    two questions: What general features of SESs transcend scales (system size)? For
    example, water for agriculture and development in the Phoenix Basin can be seen
    as a two-stage collective action problem with three common-pool resources, the
    Colorado River watershed; the combined Salt, Verde, and Gila River watersheds;
    and the groundwater system. First, the stakeholders provide the immense public
    (hard) infrastructure consisting of multiple dams, canals, pumps across an enormous
    spatial scale. Second, they provide the soft infrastructure to attempt to solve
    the coordination problem of the common-pool resource that this public infrastructure
    provides, e.g., the Colorado River Compact and the Arizona Groundwater Management
    Act of 1980. The fundamental features of this system are the same as the small-scale
    counterpart in India or Nepal: provisioning and coordination. How does complexity
    matter? Is the Colorado River system really more complex than its small counterpart
    in India or Nepal? Does the mere fact that there are four orders of magnitude
    more resource users add meaningful complexity? Probably not. The Robustness Framework
    suggests that meaningful complexity differences likely reside in relationships
    1, 2, 5 and exogenous drivers 7 and 8. Specifically, resource users are almost
    completely disconnected from public infrastructure provision. This weakens link
    2. Link 5 suppresses natural variation in water supply and creates an illusion
    of abundance, weakening link 1. Divergent social and economic drivers (8) create
    a very heterogeneous group of resource users who place very different values on
    the resource (e.g., developers, farmers, energy producers, commercial interests,
    residents). Finally, the Colorado System likely experiences shocks to the resource
    and infrastructure (7) over a much wider range of frequencies than a small-scale
    system. Once we systematically address these questions, we can tackle challenges
    that both small and large systems face using the ideas of fit and feedback that
    we have been discussing. We must choose the correct puzzle pieces (system modules)
    and cut the edges (design feedbacks) so they fit together well. In the language
    of institutional analysis and our frameworks, the system modules are polycentric
    governance units, ecosystems, and infrastructure systems. The feedbacks are the
    soft infrastructure—the rules, norms, and shared strategies that form the protocols
    by which the system modules interact. The study of simpler irrigation systems
    (which are to SESs as the fruit fly is to evolutionary biology) helps understand
    the micro-level details of fit. The study of large systems helps us identify which
    aspects of fit are robust to system size and those that are not. Through the iterative
    study of a range of systems of different sizes and types, we can begin to develop
    methods to address what we see as the essential public policy design question:
    how to choose polycentric governance units and the appropriate feedbacks to link
    these units to biophysical system modules in order to achieve a good fit for robust
    performance of the SES in question. We are not aware of a systematic design methodology
    to do this—it is more likely an art. Having said this, there are a number of practical
    insights from a comparative analysis of various types of social and biological
    systems (Janssen & Osnas, 2005) that can help guide the policy design process.
    Diversity (a multiplicity of different types of regulatory feedback mechanisms),
    redundancy (many regulatory mechanisms perform similar functions), and modularity
    (some regulatory feedback mechanisms are allowed only limited connectivity with
    others) have been shown to be system characteristics that enhance robustness and
    adaptive capacity. Redundancy of components, information, tasks, and connections
    enables a system to maintain its function when a component is lost and the redundant
    component takes over the function. Redundancy is common in engineered infrastructure
    systems (both hard and soft) and biological systems. The engineered system of
    a Boeing 777, which has 150,000 different subsystem modules, can continue to fly
    when many modules have been knocked out (Csete & Doyle, 2002). This high-level
    redundancy is necessary to achieve extreme robustness (at great financial expense):
    The ability of the Boeing 777 to continue to function when modules fail is crucial
    because the cost of overall system failure is so high. This is not the case for,
    say, a coffee machine whose failure has far less impact on our lives. Coffee machines
    can be developed at a much lower cost, but with much less robustness. An example
    of redundancy in institutions is the concurrent use of informal and formal rules
    for resource management (Low, Ostrom, Simon, & Wilson, 2003). If informal rules
    (subsystem modules) fail, progressive layers of formal institutional arrangements
    (higher-level, more costly subsystem modules that perform a similar function)
    are activated. Perhaps the most important example of redundancy in biological
    systems is related to genes. Experiments show that deleting a gene in an organism
    often has little phenotypic effect due to the existence of duplicate genes (subsystem
    module) or compensation by alternative metabolic pathways (higher-level subsystem
    module performing a similar function) (Gu et al., 2003). Modularity provides a
    system with different functional parts or modules that can evolve somewhat independently.
    The modules might be loosely linked with each other, but a failure in one module
    does not severely affect the others, as would happen if they were tightly linked.
    Sufficient links between modules are required as modules might learn from the
    activities occurring within other modules. Within the social sciences this has
    been referred to as polycentricity. Ostrom, Tiebout, and Warren (1961) identified
    a polycentric metropolitan area as having many centers of decision making that
    were formally independent of each other, but one could learn from experimentation
    in the other various centers (McGinnis, 1999). A third general factor is diversity
    in agents or connections. In organizations, a diverse set of connections is important
    for the creation of a diverse portfolio of knowledge or shared organizational
    mental models (Staber & Sydow, 2002). In systems with low diversity, there are
    fewer chances of creating new ideas, components, or connections. A population
    of organisms with the same ability to initiate an immune response will be hit
    hard when a harmful new disease enters the population. Genetic diversity provides
    the capacity to create novel antibodies, so at least a few individuals in the
    population might be able to resist the new disease. Tinkering, mutations, and
    making errors are essential to generate new components and links in a system (Kirschner
    & Gerhart, 1998). Importantly, in a modular system, such novelty can be tested
    without severely disturbing other modules—i.e., experimentation can occur locally
    without impacting overall system function. If the innovation is beneficial, it
    might be replicated. In the case of a novel disturbance such as a disease, it
    is essential that a system is able to generate new responses. Although there are
    several examples of designed and evolved systems in which these key properties
    confer robustness, it is challenging to operationalize them in a policy context.
    It is clear that the notion of polycentricity is important for the creation and
    maintenance of redundancy, modularity, and diversity in policy contexts. The challenge
    lies in defining what a “module” is and exactly where redundancy and diversity
    lie. In a genetic system, the module is a collection of phenotypic traits that
    vary together and do not vary with other phenotypic traits (Wagner & Altenberg,
    1996). Redundancy lies in genetic codes that perform the same function (code for
    the same proteins), and diversity lies in the variation of genes in a population.
    In the policy context, the module may be one of many centers of authority and
    control in a polycentric system. Although reasonable in theory, in practice it
    is difficult to define boundaries of polycentric units. For example, when policy
    problems involve multiple ecological services with different spatial and temporal
    dynamics, incentives and regulatory constraints may conflict across ecosystem
    services and stakeholder groups generating a situation in which there is no way
    to naturally define a polycentric unit and its boundary. Diversity, on the other
    hand, may be easy to define by simply noting the variation across polycentric
    units. But in what dimensions do these centers of control vary? Do they vary across
    the policy processes they employ, the range of policies they implement, or the
    knowledge they possess? Which combination of these might enable polycentric units
    to achieve a better fit with the ecological and social dynamics they control?
    Likewise, redundancy may be manifest in multiple centers of authority that perform
    similar functions using slightly different policy processes. Such redundancy in
    a governance system would be very expensive, limiting the number of polycentric
    units. Given this limited number, is it possible to achieve redundancy and diversity
    goals? These are all difficult and important questions for policy scholars to
    address as we seek to “design complexity to govern complexity” (Ostrom, 1995).
    Conclusions In this paper, we have argued that the increasing scale and interconnectedness
    of human activities have important implications for the policy process. Specifically,
    we can no longer treat the policy context as fixed on the time scale on which
    the policy process plays out. Rather, the dynamic feedback between policy and
    the biophysical context depicted in Figure 1B will become increasingly important
    as the process of globalization proceeds. This calls for new tools and theories
    to better understand and inform the public policy process. Here we have presented
    two related theoretical frameworks with the potential to contribute to this understanding.
    Most of Ostrom''s work on theoretical frameworks focuses on policies as rules
    and their functioning in different social and ecological contexts. The policy
    process of interest to most readers of this journal is not addressed explicitly
    in either framework discussed here (Figures 3 and 4). However, the policy process
    is implicit in the institutional rational choice framework in general, and thus
    in the robustness and SES frameworks in particular: It is an emergent property
    of a system of actors and rules. Complex notions of advocacy coalitions, learning,
    beliefs, etc., are difficult to address explicitly in the SES and Robustness frameworks,
    but they certainly would be observable patterns given a collection of agents,
    rules, and resources. Thus, the policy process itself is an example of an SES,
    where the “ecosystem” is mostly human made as in the well-developed concept of
    “industrial ecosystems.” The question is how useful it is to think of the policy
    process as an SES embedded in broader social, economic, and political settings
    and related ecosystems as depicted in Figures 3 and 4. For many policy questions,
    these frameworks may not add value. However, we suggest that there is at least
    one specific instance where they can: when public policy must cope with deep uncertainty
    and change in the policy context that occurs on the same time scale as the policy
    process itself—i.e., sufficiently fast. The main lesson from applying the Robustness
    Framework in particular is the notion that one can cope with uncertainty and change,
    but this will have a price. Developing policies to increase robustness of SESs
    requires an explicit decision about robustness of what system properties and aspects
    of performance to what types of exogenous shocks. Once the choice about which
    vulnerabilities are to be addressed, building robustness requires navigating trade-offs
    between short-term efficiency and long-term robustness. Finally, and most importantly,
    even if these complex trade-offs can be successfully navigated in a policy process,
    there remains a final trade-off about which agents have little choice: Increasing
    robustness to one type of known disturbance necessarily increases vulnerability
    to other types of disturbances (Chandra et al., 2011; Csete & Doyle, 2002). Worse
    yet, these emergent vulnerabilities are largely hidden, revealed only by a system-level
    failure. A key message for policy scientists is simply the importance of the acknowledgment
    that such fundamental robustness-vulnerability trade-offs exist. The acceptance
    that policies may, and eventually must, fail immediately follows. Given that fail-free
    policies cannot be developed, we need to shift thinking away from coalitions advocating
    for the “right” policy to policy processes that stimulate experimentation, adaptation,
    and learning. In a world of continuous change, policies that are appropriate for
    some contexts may reveal new vulnerabilities in another context. Such robustness-vulnerability
    conflicts are one reason why it can be so much more difficult to deal with both
    social and environmental change simultaneously than with either one in isolation
    (Rodriguez et al., 2011). Policies should therefore be seen as experiments that
    require systematic, ongoing monitoring and evaluation as elements of regulatory
    feedback networks. Decentralized experimentation would allow for innovation and
    increase the probability of achieving a fit between policies and local conditions
    (modularity and diversity). Governance at higher levels may stimulate a process
    of information exchange to facilitate learning from local-level experimentation.
    A robust SES may exist in the form of a polycentric system where higher levels
    provide coordination, monitoring, and synthesis, but hold local level units accountable
    to reach certain policy outcomes. At the local level there is a certain degree
    of freedom to craft policies that may lead to desired outcomes, and those policies
    might be tailored to local conditions. When local governance fails, as it must,
    higher levels provide support based on knowledge gained from other local conditions
    (redundancy and diversity). The challenge in terms of policy processes is twofold.
    First, do local-level governance regimes necessarily exhibit more efficient policy
    processes? Second, what policy processes are used to determine policy outcomes
    at the next level? How is it decided what policy outcomes are demanded of the
    local level? Which actors from across different levels of governance participate
    in this process? Whether or not such an idealized polycentric system can be implemented,
    the main lesson from studies of robustness is that successes from the past do
    not guarantee success in the future. Policy processes must have the capacity to
    adapt rapidly. Studies of SES, and feedback systems more generally, suggest that
    multilevel, polycentric governance regimes are essential to match institutions
    to challenges at the right temporal and organizational scale. What is needed is
    a “meta” policy process that connects governance regimes across levels to cope
    with cross-scale interactions that are sure to become more prevalent as the process
    of globalization plays out over the coming decades. Notes We acknowledge financial

    elements of a system fit well together much like puzzle pieces fit well together.
    We do not use the term in the sense of evolutionary “fitness.” 2 Some readers
    may be familiar with the resilience literature and some distinctions between the
    terms resilience and robustness. We use the term robustness in a very specific
    sense relating to regulatory feedback systems which we make clear as we develop
    the framework. For a detailed discussion of the relationship between resilience
    and robustness, see Anderies, Folke, Walker, and Ostrom (2013). Biographies Dr.

    Abstract Global warming and price volatility are increasing

    uncertainty for the future of agriculture. Therefore, agricultur-

    al systems must be sustainable not only under average condi-

    tions, but also under extreme changes of productivity, econo-

    my, environment and social context. Here, we review four

    concepts: stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience.

    Those concepts are commonly used but are sometimes diffi-

    cult to distinguish due to the lack of clear boundaries. Here,

    we clarify the role of these concepts in addressing agronomic

    issues. Our main findings are as follows: (1) agricultural sys-

    tems face different types of perturbations, from small and

    usual perturbations to extreme and unpredictable changes;

    (2) stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been

    increasingly applied to analyze the agricultural context in or-

    der to predict the system response under changing conditions;

    (3) the four concepts are distinguished by the nature of the

    system components and by the type of perturbation studied;

    (4) assessment methods must be tested under contrasted situ-

    ations; and (5) the major options allowing system adaptation

    under extreme and unpredictable changes are the increase of

    diversity and the increase of the adaptive capacity.

    1 Introduction

    Farming activities are regularly exposed to unpredictable

    perturbations, i.e. changes in environmental or socio-

    economic constraints which cannot be anticipated. Facing

    uncertainties, farmers have to deal not only with urgent

    and short-term tactical issues (e.g. protecting a crop from

    pests or taking advantage of sowing opportunities) but also

    with more strategic decisions driven by their medium- to

    long-term objectives (Rodriguez et al. 2011). In general,

    the predominant approach to mitigate the impacts of exoge-

    nous changes on cropping and livestock systems is based on

    controlling environmental conditions (ten Napel et al. 2006).

    Modern intensive farming, which relies heavily on pesti-

    cides, antibiotics, mineral fertilizers and irrigation in order

    to control system conditions, has proven to be a successful

    approach to maximize productivity per production unit and

    increase agricultural production in the world. The most il-

    lustrative example of this approach is greenhouse production

    where fruits and vegetables are grown in a highly standard-

    ized and controlled environment. Nevertheless, evidence of

    drawbacks of this approach is accumulating: despite a strong

    artificialization of agricultural landscapes and intensive use

    of chemical inputs, crops and livestock around the world are

    still exposed to various types of exogenous perturbations,

    such as outbreaks of infectious diseases in animal production

    and development of pest and pathogen resistances to pesti-

    cides in crop production. Moreover, negative environmental

    impacts of intensive farming systems are evident, such as air

    and water pollution and loss of biodiversity (Millennium

    Ecosystem Assessment 2005).

    In recent years, social and political pressure for more sus-

    tainable agricultural systems showed up the need for

    implementing more sustainable production systems and led

    to the emergence of various methods and indicators to quan-

    tify the sustainability of farming activities. These methods

    generally include economic, environmental and societal pil-

    lars and are usually based on multicriteria approaches address-

    ing these different issues (Bockstaller et al. 2009). However,

    these methods are generally focused on the assessment of

    average agricultural outputs (i.e. under conditions that are

    considered as “normal”) and do not consider performance

    changes in time and space, particularly when exogenous per-

    turbations occur. Thus, scientists and stakeholders are current-

    ly reconsidering agricultural system design in order to better

    take into account the variability of environmental conditions

    (Naylor 2008). As part of this new vision, changes and adap-

    tations are recognized as essential elements: the ability to con-

    tinue to achieve goals despite the occurrence of perturbations

    is becoming a central issue in the assessment of agricultural

    sustainability (Tendall et al. 2015). This concern is generally

    expressed through a paradigm shift, from maximizing average

    productivity in a stable environment towards reducing

    performance changes in an environment subject to greater

    variation (Milestad et al. 2012). However, this transition re-

    quires new knowledge and expertise to characterize and assess

    the ability of agricultural systems to maintain high levels of

    agricultural outputs in a non-stable environment (Fig. 1).

    In the face of this challenge, different concepts such as

    stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been

    developed in recent decades. Despite conceptualization from

    different discipline backgrounds, these four concepts all focus

    on the ability of diverse systems to maintain or recover their

    functionalities in a challenging environment. An increasing

    number of review articles illustrate the growing interest of

    scientists from different disciplines in these concepts (see,

    for example, Mumby et al. (2014) for a review of resilience,

    robustness and vulnerability applied to marine ecosystems;

    Gallopín (2006) for a review of vulnerability and resilience

    applied to socio-ecological systems; and Mens et al. (2011) for

    a review of robustness, resilience and vulnerability applied to

    flood risk management). These concepts have also been used

    in agricultural sciences, either as equivalent terms (National

    Research Council 2010) or as concepts to be combined for a

    more comprehensive and integrative approach (Callo-Concha

    and Ewert 2014). Due to fuzzy boundaries between these four

    concepts, we have noticed the difficulty for some scientists in

    agricultural sciences in defining them correctly and under-

    standing their differences and potential uses. Furthermore, a

    clear analytical framework associated with each concept is

    still lacking and hence limits their usefulness to assess the

    ability of agricultural systems to cope with perturbations.

    In the present paper, we aim to clarify the potential of

    stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience as opera-

    tional concepts to assess the ability of agricultural systems

    to deal with a context of increasing uncertainty. In the

    following sections, the paper will first introduce agricultural

    systems and their exposure to exogenous changes (Sect. 2).

    Then, we will review different strands of literature to define

    more clearly each concept and assess their differences and

    respective uses in agricultural sciences (Sect. 3). Based on

    recent papers, we will discuss operational methods avail-

    able to characterize and quantify the ability of agricultural

    systems to cope with various types of perturbation

    (Sect. 4). Finally, the paper will outline some key levers

    to improve the ability of agricultural systems to deal with a

    more changeable environment (Sect. 5).

    2 Agricultural systems facing a more changeable

    environment

    In order to explore the position of each concept regarding the

    assessment of agricultural performance in a variable environ-

    ment, we start by clarifying what agricultural systems are and

    what are their interactions with external drivers.

    2.1 Agricultural systems

    Agricultural systems are socio-ecological systems, compris-

    ing biotechnical and social factors, and dedicated to the pro-

    duction of productive, economic, environmental and social

    outputs (Renting et al. 2009). On the one hand, biotechnical

    factors consist of biological and technical components linked

    through feedback mechanisms (ten Napel et al. 2011).

    Biological components comprise not only domesticated plant

    and animal species but also non-domesticated species like

    pests and pollinators of crops. Technical components consist

    of engineering elements designed to optimize agricultural out-

    puts (e.g. irrigation system and decision support tools). On the

    other hand, social factors refer to farmers’ actions and atti-

    tudes and in which may be considered separately the psycho-

    logical make-up of the farmer and the characteristics of the

    farm household (Edwards-Jones 2006).

    According to this basic conceptual scheme, the agricultural

    outputs of a farm are highly influenced by the interaction

    between the different components that constitute biotechnical

    and social factors. However, agricultural systems are also em-

    bedded in larger systems such as food, institutional or social

    systems. Hence, they are also influenced by external drivers

    which can be a source of unpredictable changes for farmers.

    2.2 A more changeable environment

    External drivers of agricultural systems encompass bio-geophys-

    ical, social, economic and political environments that determine

    how agricultural activities are performed. These drivers can vary

    significantly in time and space and therefore can affect

    agricultural systems positively or negatively. Depending on the

    frequency, duration and predictability of these changes, Maxwell

    (1986) distinguished four different types of perturbations that

    affect agricultural systems: noise when perturbations occur on a

    regular basis and are usually expected by farmers, shocks when

    perturbations are unusual and difficult to anticipate, cycles when

    the variation is due to cyclical changes, and trends when the

    change is gradual over time.

    In terms of trends, global warming is expected to impact

    agricultural activities gradually in the future: by the end of the

    twenty-first century, temperature is projected to rise by 1.4 to

    5.8 °C while atmospheric CO2 concentration could reach three

    to four times the pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2014). In Europe,

    simulations of future climate have suggested an increase of

    average temperature and a slight decrease in rainfall (Trnka

    et al. 2011). Livestock systems may also be impacted by glob-

    al warming, directly by the effects of heat on animal health,

    growth and reproduction and, indirectly, for herbivores,

    through impacts on the productivity of pastures and forage

    crops (Maracchi et al. 2005). Climate change is also expected

    to increase the risk of potential pest pressure in agriculture by

    providing more suitable environmental conditions for exotic

    pests to adapt across areas which were previously detrimental

    for their survival (Lamichhane et al. 2014). In this context of

    gradual changes, farmers and researchers can partly anticipate

    the impacts on agricultural activities through mitigation and

    adaptation programs (Olesen et al. 2011; Reidsma et al. 2010).

    For example, many research and implementation projects are

    currently dealing with adaptation strategies using local knowl-

    edge and low inputs for soil protection and water management

    in the context of climate change (Meynard et al. 2012).

    Beyond average trends, agricultural systems are also ex-

    posed to less predictable perturbations, such as climatic or

    economic shocks. These perturbations, exhibiting various in-

    tensities and durations, can also heavily impact agricultural

    activities. For example, climate variability is considered to

    explain part of wheat yield stagnation in Europe since the

    middle of the 1990s (Brisson et al. 2010; Moore and Lobell

    2014), while food price volatility has negatively impacted

    farmers’ income stability in recent years (Huchet-Bourdon

    2011). In addition to these individual perturbations, local is-

    sues may also interact with global economic issues and further

    increase overall perturbations. For example, due to the speci-

    ficities of the world agricultural market (inelastic demand for

    agricultural products, high seasonality and relatively long pro-

    duction period coupled with a short shelf-life for many agri-

    cultural products), a severe climatic shock, such as drought on

    grain production in an exporting country, may have significant

    repercussions on international, national and local markets and,

    therefore, on food security and political stability on local and

    global scales (Sternberg 2012).

    Furthermore, the relationship between agricultural systems

    and their external drivers requires that the intrinsic sensitivity

    of agricultural systems to exogenous perturbations be taken

    into account. For example, the impact of market volatility

    Fig. 1 Agricultural systems are facing multiple and unpredictable

    perturbations. The impact on a sunflower field of salted sea water

    flooding induced by Xynthia storm in 2010, in Rochefort area (France).

    during the period 2007 to 2009 was particularly severe in

    Europe as the progressive change of CAP policies more di-

    rectly exposed farmers to commodity price volatility (Enjolras

    et al. 2014). Moreover, there is also increasing evidence that

    the trend towards specialization and homogenization of genet-

    ic diversity across agricultural landscapes (Hoisington et al.

    1999) is increasing the sensitivity of many agricultural sys-

    tems around the world to various types of perturbation. In

    cropping systems, for example, genetic and crop uniformity

    over large areas tends to amplify pest invasions and outbreaks

    (Altieri and Nicholls 2004), while in animal husbandry, re-

    gional specialization of agricultural activities can increase san-

    itary risks by facilitating the spread of animal diseases Fèvre

    et al. (2006).

    In this context and in order to get a better under-

    standing of the overall context in which agricultural

    systems are implemented, researchers have developed

    and used several concepts that deal with the response

    of agricultural systems when facing perturbations. In the

    next section, we introduce these different concepts, their

    historical backgrounds and their main differences ac-

    cording to how the relationship between agricultural

    systems and perturbations is expounded.

    3 Conceptual frameworks

    We focus on four different concepts: stability, robustness, vul-

    nerability and resilience. These four concepts are character-

    ized by having a highly multidimensional nature and have

    been used in various papers related to agricultural systems.

    At first glance, they may appear to be linked by fuzzy bound-

    aries and to be suitable in various contexts. Depending on

    authors, there is a call for more stable (Mishra and Sandretto

    2002), more robust (ten Napel et al. 2006), less vulnerable

    (Schröter et al. 2005) or more resilient (Naylor 2008) agricul-

    tural systems and sometimes a combination of all of these (de

    Goede et al. 2013; Tendall et al. 2015).

    In order to clarify the specificities of each concept and

    based upon the existing literature, we will present in this

    section their historical backgrounds and their main

    differences according to how they are used in papers related

    to agricultural systems. More precisely, each concept is

    discussed separately in order to highlight in which context it

    proved to be the most useful. As already pointed by Carpenter

    et al. (2001) concerning resilience, these multidimensional

    concepts acquire significance only if the studied object (the

    system and its boundaries), the type of output to be maintained

    and the nature of the perturbations are precisely defined. Thus,

    we will answer simple but essential questions when assessing

    each concept: what kind of system is studied, what kind of

    output is targeted and against what kind of perturbation?

    Table 1 summarizes the main elements for each concept

    and includes some examples from agricultural sciences. It

    may help readers to choose the most suitable concept accord-

    ing to the nature of their research questions.

    3.1 The concept of stability

    The word stability originates from the Latin stabilis, meaning

    to stand firm or steady. It has been widely used in several

    scientific disciplines (mathematics, engineering, economic,

    social and natural sciences) to express the ability of an object

    to maintain equilibrium. In natural sciences, the concept of

    ecological stability was first defined as the constancy of a

    given attribute, regardless of the presence of disturbing factors

    (Justus 2008). For example, stable ecological communities

    were those with relatively constant population sizes and com-

    positions (MacArthur 1955). Later, the definition of ecologi-

    cal stability has been expanded to describe other properties of

    ecosystems, such as the ability to maintain ecological func-

    tions despite disturbances (Turner et al. 1993) or the ability to

    return to the initial equilibrium state (Ives and Carpenter

    2007). This led to multiple definitions and interpretations of

    stability (Grimm and Wissel 1997) and sometimes to the feel-

    ing that it is defined in many ways depending on how scien-

    tists wish to look at the problem (Lin et al. 1986).

    In agricultural sciences, the concept of stability has been

    mainly used with the original meaning of ecological stabil-

    ity, i.e. as a criterion to measure the spatial or temporal

    constancy of specific features of agricultural systems

    (Fig. 2a). For example, the stability of genotypes has been

    widely used in plant breeding programs in order to identify

    genotypes that maintain specific features (e.g. yield or pro-

    tein content in the grain) over a wide range of environments

    (Brancourt-Hulmel 1999; Sabaghnia et al. 2012). Based on

    genotype × environment interactions, two types of stability

    are sometimes distinguished: (i) static stability which refers

    to a genotype for which variance is small between different

    environments and (ii) dynamic stability which refers to a

    genotype for which the response to various environments

    is correlated to the mean response of all genotypes in the

    trial (Annicchiarico 2002). In other terms, the first type of

    stability focuses on constancy regardless of the variability in

    system environments whereas the second type of stability

    includes these environmental differences.

    Even though analysis of yield stability has been largely

    confined to multienvironment trials for comparing spatial sta-

    bility of crop cultivars, stability analysis has also been applied

    to compare the temporal stability of different agronomic treat-

    ments in long-term experiments. For example, Berzsenyi et al.

    (2000) and Govaerts et al. (2005) implemented stability anal-

    ysis to evaluate the effect of diverse crop rotations, fertiliza-

    tion treatments or tillage management techniques on crop

    yield stability.

    15

    Page 4 of 15

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    Considering these first elements, it appears that the

    concept of concept has been applied in agricultural stud-

    ies with a meaning relatively close to ecological con-

    stancy, i.e. as the stability of agricultural outputs in time

    or space but without explicitly referring to the external

    drivers of change and to the occurrence of perturbations.

    Moreover, the concept of stability has been mainly ap-

    plied to individual components (e.g. genotypes) or out-

    puts (e.g. yield or income) of agricultural systems rather

    than through a more integrated approach. Hence, it may

    show a low potential for describing and explaining the

    behaviour of complex agricultural systems in a context

    of unpredictable changes.

    3.2 The concept of robustness

    The word robustness comes from the Latin robustus,

    meaning strong. Widely used in statistics to refer to

    methods that are not affected by small deviations from

    model assumptions (Maronna et al. 2006), robustness also

    emerged in recent years as a major concept for analyzing

    the response of diverse objects facing perturbations.

    Industrialists and engineers first mobilized this concept in

    the early 1950s in order to optimize the manufacturing

    design of various devices and reduce their sensitivity to

    variation over which makers have little or no control

    (Taguchi and Clausing 1990). Subsequently, robustness

    theory was applied to various engineering processes, such as

    information networks, electronic circuits or flight control sys-

    tems, in airplanes in order to make them capable of operating

    under a wide range of constraints (Fowlkes et al. 1995).

    More recently, the concept of robustness has also been used

    by biologists to describe the ability of living systems to main-

    tain specific functionalities despite unpredictable environmen-

    tal or genetic perturbations (Kitano 2004). For example, bio-

    logical robustness can be illustrated by the ability of genomes

    to compensate for the loss of function in one gene by means of

    other copies of this gene (Gu et al. 2003). Based on these

    observations from engineering and biological sciences, ro-

    bustness has been described as an intrinsic property of com-

    plex adaptive systems (Carlson and Doyle 2002) and as an

    important trait for the species’ capacity to evolve through

    natural selection (Wagner 2008).

    Comprising both technical and biological domains, agricul-

    tural systems can also be defined as complex and adaptive

    systems. Hence, the robustness concept was recently intro-

    duced into agricultural sciences and has been used in an in-

    creasing number of scientific papers to represent the complex

    interactions between the biotechnical factors of agricultural

    systems and external drivers of change (de Goede et al.

    2013; ten Napel et al. 2006; Verhagen et al. 2010). In these

    papers, robustness has been mainly defined as the ability to

    minimize the variability of specific agricultural outputs despite

    the occurrence of explicitly defined perturbations (Fig. 2b).

    A large part of the literature recently devoted to this subject

    deals with robustness as a key breeding goal for animal farms

    (Knap 2005; Sauvant and Martin 2010; Star et al. 2008). The

    aim is to select animals that achieve a high production level in a

    wide diversity of environmental conditions, including stressful

    conditions. These stressors can be disease challenges, extreme

    temperatures, low-quality feed or challenges due to changes in

    housing or management (Merks et al. 2012). However, robust-

    ness has also been discussed in the context of cropping systems

    exposed to climatic or biotic perturbations. For example,

    Sabatier et al. (2013) compared the robustness of two contrast-

    ing types of management strategies for a cacao agroecosystem

    in Indonesia facing pest outbreaks and pesticide changes.

    Applied to agricultural systems facing an environment sub-

    ject to perturbations, two forms of robustness are frequently

    distinguished and sometimes called, respectively, passive and

    active robustness: (i) resistance, i.e. the withstanding or toler-

    ance of perturbations, and (ii) flexibility, i.e. the ability to

    adapt the configuration of the system in order to limit damage

    (ten Napel et al. 2006). For example, robustness on a pig farm

    level can include genetic components of heat stress tolerance

    in pigs (passive robustness) and temperature control systems

    to adjust indoor conditions in real time (active robustness).

    To conclude, we might say that robustness is a concept that

    goes further than stability through a more precise description

    of the interactions between agricultural systems (and their

    different components) and changes in environmental condi-

    tions. Due to its history, robustness appears to be a concept

    that better integrates biological and technical aspects of agri-

    cultural systems than stability. However, it rarely takes into

    consideration the social aspects of agricultural systems.

    3.3 The concept of vulnerability

    The term vulnerability originates from the Latin word vulnus,

    meaning injury. Vulnerability thus refers to a state of fragility, a

    disposition to be hurt. This concept started to be used in the

    1970s by geographers and social scientists in risk management

    issues to describe the fragility of certain communities or coun-

    tries facing severe environmental or socio-economic risks,

    such as earthquakes (Blaikie et al. 1994) or food exchange

    crises (Watts and Bohle 1993). In the decade after 2000, the

    use of the vulnerability concept increased sharply with its

    adoption by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

    (IPCC) to assess the potential impacts of global warming at

    regional and global levels (Mc Carthy et al. 2001). As a result,

    vulnerability recently became a very central focus of the global

    change science research community for discussing and defin-

    ing adaptation and mitigation plans (Downing et al. 2005).

    Based on the seminal work by IPCC, the vulnerability con-

    cept benefits from a highly operational framework to describe

    the relationship between the studied system and its environ-

    ment (Adger 2006; Luers et al. 2003; Paavola 2008; Turner

    et al. 2003). This framework usually distinguishes between

    three distinct elements (Fig. 2c): (i) the level of exposure

    (i.e. the frequency, intensity and duration of perturbations af-

    fecting the studied system), (ii) the level of sensitivity (i.e. the

    degree to which the studied system is affected by exposure to

    perturbations) and (iii) the adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of

    the studied system to deal with perturbations and increase the

    extent of variability that it can cope with).

    This operational framework of vulnerability has allowed its

    use in several fields, including agriculture for which it has

    been applied at various spatial scales (from farms to countries)

    but with an emphasis on the regional level (Reidsma and

    Ewert 2008; Simelton et al. 2009). The vulnerability of agri-

    cultural systems has mainly been studied with regard to the

    exposure to climatic perturbations, such as temperature chang-

    es (Luers et al. 2003), drought (Simelton et al. 2009) or floods

    (McLeman and Smit 2006; Silva and Lucio 2014). It has also

    been used to describe the response of agricultural systems

    exposed to diverse socio-economic changes, such as market

    fluctuations (Luers et al. 2003) or land use changes (Metzger

    et al. 2006). Sensitivity level generally refers to biotechnical

    or socio-economic factors that are intrinsic to agricultural sys-

    tems and interact with external perturbations to amplify or

    reduce their impacts. For example, the level of sensitivity of

    a crop to drought depends to a high degree on soil character-

    istics and access to irrigation (Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). At

    regional level, the level of sensitivity of Indian farmers to

    international trade has been evaluated as a function of crop

    productivity and distance to major ports (O’Brien et al. 2004).

    The third factor of vulnerability, the adaptive capacity of

    agricultural systems, is usually described as the system’s ability

    to design and implement effective changes so as to reduce the

    impacts of harmful perturbations. In practice, adaptive capacity

    represents the set of natural, financial, institutional or human

    resources that agricultural systems can mobilize for coping

    with constraints and overcoming them (Brooks and Adger

    2005). Hence, the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems

    encompasses both internal and external factors that can be

    used to deal with a changeable environment. For example,

    Tengö and Hammer (2003) analyzed the role of both manage-

    ment practices and the institutional framework for promoting

    the adaptive capacity of northern Tanzanian agro-pastoralists.

    Thus, vulnerability can be seen as a concept mainly focused

    on the assessment of the potential impacts of perturbations and

    on the target measures needed to reduce them. Compared to the

    concepts of stability and robustness, vulnerability appears to be

    a broader concept that encompasses the biotechnical and social

    factors of agricultural systems. It benefits from an operational

    framework that simplifies its use in various agricultural con-

    texts, including institutional, social and financial determinants.

    3.4 The concept of resilience

    The word resilience comes from the Latin resilio, meaning to

    rebound. Resilience was originally used in material and psy-

    chology sciences to describe the resistance of materials to

    physical shocks (Winson 1932) and the ability of individuals

    to cope with adversity, trauma or other significant sources of

    stress (Murphy 1974), respectively. In ecology, Holling

    (1973) popularized this term by defining the resilience of eco-

    logical systems as a measure of their persistence when

    confronted by unpredictable perturbations and of their ability

    to absorb change. Subsequently, the concept of resilience has

    been increasingly adopted as a generic approach to describe

    social-ecological systems as complex entities which are con-

    tinually transforming themselves through cycles of change

    (Carpenter et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2010; Holling 2005).

    Based on extensive literature from various scientific back-

    grounds, resilience has been variously characterized as a

    loosely organized cluster of concepts (Carpenter and Brock

    2008), a collection of ideas (Anderies et al. 2006) or a way

    of enabling exchanges across disciplines (Brand and Jax

    2007). A first part of this literature mainly focuses on the

    “specific” meaning of resilience and is relatively close to the

    concepts of robustness and vulnerability. In such cases, resis-

    tance to perturbations and rate of recovery after their

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    Page 7 of 15

    15

    occurrence are considered as key aspects of resilience

    (Holling 1996). Specific resilience has been used, for exam-

    ple, on vegetative systems to study the rate of recovery after a

    fire (Lavorel 1999) or other natural hazards (MacGillivray and

    Grime 1995). Accordingly, it has been discussed for particular

    aspect of socio-ecological systems and for well-characterized

    perturbations, such as storms, earthquakes, floods and fires,

    for which existing knowledge provides a basis for building

    specified resilience (Carpenter et al. 2012). Another part of

    recent literature was more oriented towards the “general”

    meaning of resilience, i.e. the capacity of socio-ecological

    systems to adapt and transform in response to unfamiliar, un-

    expected and extreme shocks (Holling 2005). In such papers,

    general resilience is studied through the way that socio-

    ecological systems persist and innovate when facing unknown

    perturbations (Walker and Salt 2006). This second aspect of

    resilience is more difficult to apprehend because it refers to

    potential changes outside the scope of experience. For exam-

    ple, it has been used to study how socio-ecological systems

    are transforming themselves in order to continue to achieve

    specific goals, to better anticipate critical transitions in the

    future (Scheffer et al. 2012) and improve conservation plans

    (Standish et al. 2014).

    Resilience thinking, referring both to specific and general

    aspects of resilience, has been applied to a wide variety of

    social-ecological systems, such as everglades (Gunderson

    et al. 2002), marine ecosystems (Mumby et al. 2014) and

    forests (Parrott and Meyer 2012) but less frequently to agri-

    cultural systems. This might be explained by marked differ-

    ences between agricultural and other socio-ecological sys-

    tems, such as a smaller spatial scale, a high controllability of

    the ecological structure and processes on the farm by human

    activities, and the strong influence of economic drivers to

    ensure both the short-term and long-term economic survival

    of agricultural systems (Darnhofer 2010). Moreover, despite

    some extreme examples such as the Dust Bowl period in the

    1930s in North America, after which farmers fundamentally

    changed their practices and adopted planting and plowing

    methods that ensured a better conservation of the soil, critical

    transformations of agricultural systems are not easy to ana-

    lyze, particularly over short time periods.

    Nevertheless, despite these differences, the resilience con-

    cept has recently been applied to several studies dealing with

    the behaviour of agricultural systems facing various kinds of

    perturbation. Reflecting the contrasting understandings of this

    concept, the resilience of agricultural systems has been used in

    several ways: sometimes to measure the degree of resistance

    to shock in the face of economic (Abson et al. 2013) or cli-

    matic perturbations (Keil et al. 2008), but more frequently as

    the ability of agricultural systems to preserve their intrinsic

    functions through flexibility (Astigarraga and Ingrand 2011;

    Carlisle 2014) and plasticity (Rodriguez et al. 2011). In these

    cases, resilience is mainly used to discuss the factors that build

    the ability of agricultural systems to respond to changes, to

    reorganize their structure, to anticipate future changes and to

    take advantage of new opportunities (Folke et al. 2002).

    Resilience is probably the broadest concept among the four

    discussed in this paper. Applied to agricultural systems, it ap-

    pears to be a heuristic framework that is most relevant on a

    long-term basis in order to describe and understand farm trans-

    formations over periods of time marked by significant eco-

    nomic, environmental or sanitary crises (van der Leeuw and

    Aschan-Leygonie 2000). It embeds both a timescale approach

    and a recovery process (Fig. 2d). Hence, contrary to the con-

    cept of vulnerability which focuses on the direct impacts of

    specific perturbations on a given feature of the system, the

    resilience concept mostly focuses on the consequences of one

    to several perturbations, including unpredictable ones, on the

    overall trajectory of the system (Mathevet and Bousquet 2014).

    4 From concepts to assessment in agricultural

    systems

    Based on review literature concerning stability, robustness,

    vulnerability and resilience, it appears that the research com-

    munity has produced an insightful and extensive literature in

    recent years to describe and understand better the behaviour of

    various systems, including agricultural systems, in a context

    of unpredictable change. However, operationalization of these

    concepts into empirical assessments remains limited due to

    their multidimensional nature and because they are not direct-

    ly observable phenomena (Callo-Concha and Ewert 2014).

    The situation is even more complicated when assessments

    are extended from time-limited events, such as drought, to

    gradual perturbations such as climate change. Hence, there is

    an urgent need to have a better knowledge of the models and

    metrics available to quantify the ability of agricultural systems

    to cope with various types of perturbation.

    In this section, we review existing approaches that have

    been used in empirical studies to quantify the stability, robust-

    ness, vulnerability and resilience of agricultural systems.

    These approaches are classified in three categories according

    to the system level at which they were used: (i) approaches

    focusing on the variability of agricultural outputs regardless of

    the context of perturbations, (ii) approaches focusing on the

    relationship between agricultural outputs and perturbations

    and (iii) approaches including a broader scale and taking into

    consideration the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

    We illustrate and discuss these different approaches through

    the description of some case studies.

    4.1 Variability of agricultural outputs

    The first approach, and probably the simplest one, quantifies

    the ability of agricultural systems to cope with a changeable

    15

    Page 8 of 15

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    environment by characterizing agricultural outputs and their

    variability across large environmental (time, space, manage-

    ment practices) series. This approach has been used in various

    studies and can be carried out using different statistical

    methods. A first method is to quantify the statistical deviation

    of agricultural outputs from the average or median and can be

    undertaken using common indices of statistical dispersal (e.g.

    standard deviation, coefficient of variation, interquartile

    range). For example, Abson et al. (2013) used the coefficient

    of variation of economic returns to study the impact of land-

    scape diversity on economic “resilience” in the UK between

    1996 and 2010.

    Other methods focus more on the behaviour of agricultural

    systems facing rare but extreme perturbations. These methods

    are mainly used in risk assessment studies (Iglesias and Quiroga

    2007; Luo et al. 2009) and are usually based on the analysis of

    output anomaly distribution. For example, Cernay et al. (2015)

    analyzed the yield anomaly distribution of diverse grain le-

    gumes over the period 1961–2013 in order to compare variabil-

    ity in legume yields across Europe and the Americas. More

    precisely, they used value at 10th percentile risk as a measure

    to assess in which countries legume yield losses have been the

    largest over this period. Lastly, other methods focus on the

    probability of achieving farmers’ goals and can be measured

    as the probability that agricultural outputs remain above a

    certain threshold. For example, Sabatier et al. (2015) used a

    stochastic model of grassland dynamics to measure, for various

    grazing strategies, the likelihood of fulfilling the feeding re-

    quirements of grazing animals. They quantified it as the per-

    centage of weather sequences for which the grass resource was

    sufficient to feed the herd present on the grasslands every day.

    Finally, this first approach is relatively close to the stability

    concept because it does not explicitly characterize and take

    into account the intensity and variability of perturbations that

    affect agricultural systems. It only describes a part of the abil-

    ity to cope with an environment subject to perturbations, and it

    does not deal satisfactorily with the ability of agricultural sys-

    tems to resist and adapt to specific perturbations.

    4.2 Relationship between agricultural outputs

    and perturbations

    This second approach focuses on the response of agricultural

    systems to specific perturbations and has been used in various

    studies, referring both to robustness (Mosnier et al. 2009) and

    vulnerability frameworks (Simelton et al. 2009). More pre-

    cisely, this approach is associated with the notion of resistance

    that is frequently used in those two frameworks to refer to a

    low sensitivity of agricultural outputs to environmental system

    conditions. As a result, resistance is measured with respect to

    specific perturbations affecting agricultural systems. Indeed,

    this approach requires the characterization and quantification

    of the intensity of perturbations that affect agricultural systems

    (Li et al. 2009; Wu and Wilhite 2004). For example, Simelton

    et al. (2009) measured a drought index to assess the resistance

    of agricultural production in China to water deficit. The

    drought index was quantified as a negative rainfall anomaly,

    i.e. by the ratio between average amount of rainfall between

    1960 and 2011 and the actual amount of rainfall for each year.

    In livestock systems, perturbations can refer to changes in

    environmental conditions. For example, the variation in the

    herd environment of dairy cows (Windig et al. 2006) and

    breeding sows (Herrero-Medrano et al. 2015) has also been

    studied to measure the resistance of these livestock systems to

    changes in environmental conditions.

    Once perturbations have been characterized and quantified,

    the resistance of agricultural outputs to changes in environ-

    mental conditions is usually assessed through regression

    methods. This method has been used by various authors to

    study the relationship between agricultural outputs and pertur-

    bations which are highly correlated, such as yield and drought

    (Luers et al. 2003) or farmers’ income and price volatility. For

    example, Mosnier et al. (2009) studied the sensitivity of

    farmers’ incomes to climatic and economic perturbations in

    France on a panel of 55 farms. Using multiple linear regres-

    sions, they identified the influence of stocking rates and length

    of production cycles on the sensitivity of livestock systems to

    weather and beef price variation. In Nicaragua, Holt-Giménez

    (2002) has studied the resistance of more than 800 farmers

    after Hurricane Mitch. He discriminated “conventional” and

    “agroecological” farms in order to study, under different levels

    of storm intensity, the differences of response on several indi-

    cators (e.g. erosion or economic returns). He showed that pat-

    terns of resistance are not easy to describe and include com-

    plex interactions and thresholds. However, the differences in

    favour of agroecological plots tended to increase with increas-

    ing levels of storm intensity, increasing slope and increasing

    years under agroecological practices.

    Despite its potential to assess quantitatively the response of

    agricultural outputs to specific changes in the system environ-

    ment, this approach remains limited to biotechnical compo-

    nents of agricultural systems. In particular, social components,

    including adaptive capacity, of agricultural systems are diffi-

    cult to consider in this approach.

    4.3 Multiscale and adaptive capacity assessment

    of agricultural systems

    In order to integrate the different components of agricultural

    systems, a third approach is frequently used. Contrary to the

    two previous ones, this approach focuses on the description of

    internal system features through a set of proxy indicators more

    than on the variability or resistance of agricultural outputs.

    This indicator-based approach is applicable to multiple scales

    and can include the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems

    (Darnhofer et al. 2010). Consequently, this approach has

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    Page 9 of 15

    15

    mostly been used for assessing and measuring vulnerability

    (Gbetibouo et al. 2010) and resilience (Quinlan et al. 2015) of

    agricultural systems rather than their stability or robustness.

    In this approach, indicators are generally chosen to de-

    scribe key aspects of biotechnical and social components

    that are supposed to increase or decrease the ability of

    agricultural systems to cope with various perturbations. For

    example, Cabell and Oelofse (2012) compiled 13 behaviour-

    based indicators which cover different properties of agricul-

    tural systems, such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity

    across landscapes and the human resources available on

    farms. Systems in which these 13 indicators are positively

    evaluated are supposed to better resist and adapt to

    perturbations, while a negative evaluation of these indicators

    points to a need for intervention. Based on the vulnerability

    framework, Wiréhn et al. (2015) reviewed indicators of expo-

    sure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The latter ones describe

    socio-economic factors that can assist agricultural systems to

    adapt and rebound better after perturbations (e.g. farm income,

    farm size, crop diversification). Altieri et al. (2015) used indi-

    cators of soil conservation practices, crop diversity and food

    self-sufficiency to describe the adaptive capacity of various

    agroecological farms in Latin America. These indicators are

    frequently aggregated and their results displayed in geograph-

    ic representations to improve the identification of the most

    vulnerable, or less resilient, areas within a territory (O’Brien

    et al. 2004; Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). This indicator based-

    approach has proven to be valuable for monitoring trends but,

    as reported by Wiréhn et al. (2015), is limited in its applica-

    bility by considerable subjectivity in the selection of variables

    and their relative weights and by the difficulty of testing and

    validating the different metrics.

    To conclude this section, it appears that various approaches

    are available to study the behaviour of agricultural systems in

    a more changeable environment. Despite their differences,

    these approaches can provide additional details and improve

    visibility of what improves the ability of agricultural systems

    to cope with unpredictable changes. In particular, they can

    provide complementary findings at different scales. In the next

    section, we review the main elements that emerge from re-

    searches completed to date.

    5 Key levers for improving the ability of agricultural

    systems to cope with perturbations

    Based on previous sections, it appears that various concepts

    and methods have been mobilized in recent years to charac-

    terize and quantify the ability of agricultural systems to cope

    with a changeable environment. Despite fuzzy boundaries,

    these concepts have specific historical backgrounds and have

    been applied to describe different features and behaviours of

    agricultural systems.

    Based on literature focusing on conceptual definitions and

    empirical assessments in agricultural studies, some key levers

    are emerging as important properties for a transition towards

    more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more resilient ag-

    ricultural systems. These generic elements are summarized in

    two categories: first, increasing the intrinsic diversity of agri-

    cultural systems and, second, increasing their adaptive capacity.

    5.1 Increasing diversity at different levels

    Based on recent literature, many authors have emphasized the

    potential of increasing diversity in its various forms to im-

    prove the behaviour of agricultural systems when facing var-

    ious perturbations (Altieri et al. 2015; Lin 2011; Naylor 2008;

    Østergård et al. 2009). This assumption relies on the hypoth-

    esis that implementing more diversity at different levels pro-

    vides greater functional redundancy, i.e. system components

    and organization with overlapping functions to buffer year-to-

    year changes. However, diversification can be implemented in

    a variety of forms and at a variety of scales, allowing farmers

    to choose a strategy that both increases their ability to cope

    with perturbations and provides economic benefits Lin (2011).

    Among biological components, increasing genetic diversi-

    ty through cultivars and animal breeds characterized by dif-

    ferent agronomic features (e.g. diversity in earliness for culti-

    vars; diversity in disease resistance for animal breeds) is sup-

    posed to spread the risks of failure by reducing the overall

    exposure to perturbations (Di Falco and Perrings 2003;

    Tooker and Frank 2012). Increasing breeding of cultivars

    and animals with distinctive traits is therefore becoming a

    research priority to allow farmers to choose biological com-

    ponents adapted to various contexts and perturbations

    (Casadebaig et al. 2014; Knap 2005). Similarly, increasing

    diversity at the species level by using crops characterized by

    different exposure periods and sensitivity features allows the

    spreading of risks through the entire cropping rotation (Lin

    2011). Following seminal work by Hector et al. (1999),

    Tilman et al. (2006) showed that greater complementary and

    functional diversity among grassland species were able to sta-

    bilize annual plant production. As reported by Huyghe et al.

    (2014), the use of mixtures of grasses and legumes has been

    largely implemented in grasslands worldwide.

    Increasing diversity is also feasible by changing the nature

    of crop rotations and introducing perennial tree crops into

    annual cropping systems. Based on complementarities be-

    tween annual crops and trees, agroforestry systems are char-

    acterized by a strong structural complexity (Jose 2009). These

    systems have demonstrated their capacity to provide a better

    protection for annual crops not only from habitual climatic

    perturbations (changes in temperature and precipitation), but

    also from extreme perturbations such as hurricanes (Lin

    2011). At a larger scale, increasing diversity through regional

    landscape diversity is also a strategy for minimizing the

    15

    Page 10 of 15

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    impacts of perturbations on agricultural systems: Reidsma and

    Ewert (2008) showed that diversity in farm size and intensity

    (e.g. cultivar choice, fertilizer and pesticide use) reduces the

    regional vulnerability of wheat production to climate change.

    Abson et al. (2013) also found that land use diversification in

    the UK was positively correlated with the resilience of agri-

    cultural returns in the face of uncertain market and environ-

    mental conditions. Furthermore, preserving or increasing the

    diversity of agricultural systems can also maintain or stimulate

    various resources (technology, information and knowledge) at

    the territorial level that can be used by farmers in order to cope

    with current or future challenges (Nelson et al. 2007). In that

    sense, increasing diversity of agricultural systems can also

    improve their adaptive capacity.

    5.2 Increasing the adaptive capacity of agricultural

    systems

    Cited mainly in robustness, vulnerability and resilience litera-

    ture, adaptive capacity refers to the ability of agricultural sys-

    tems to transform their nature or structure to cope with an

    ever-changing environment (Milestad et al. 2012). It focuses

    on ensuring sufficient room for manoeuvre, identifying tran-

    sition capabilities and extending the degrees of freedom of

    agricultural systems. More often emphasized in livestock than

    in cropping systems (Blanc et al. 2010), adaptive capacity can

    be improved at different levels and in biological, technical and

    organizational components.

    Applied to biological components, adaptive capacity has

    been widely discussed in robustness literature as a key breed-

    ing goal for animal breeding (Knap 2005). It refers to the

    ability of animals to adjust their behaviour to exogenous con-

    straints. For example, the adaptive capacity of dairy cows may

    refer to their ability to mobilize body reserves during specific

    periods in order to support milk production. Blanc et al. (2010)

    showed that animals in extensive livestock systems are fre-

    quently adjusting their behaviour and physiological responses

    to cope with low-feed-intake periods. Such ability to adjust

    their behaviour varies between breeds and highlights their abil-

    ity to produce and maintain their reproduction in an unstable

    environment. Various research programs have focused on in-

    creasing these properties in various plants and animals (Knap

    2005; ten Napel et al. 2006), but some authors have underlined

    a potential trade-off between intrinsic adaptive capacity and the

    productivity of livestock systems (Sabatier et al. 2015).

    On a larger scale, improving the adaptive capacity of agri-

    cultural systems can be based on improvements in the design

    of agricultural systems and the implementation of technical

    components designed to help farmers to adjust day-to-day

    operations. For example, design can rely on the choice of

    renewable materials, such as bedding material, feeder type

    for livestock and new fertilizers and decision support tools

    in crops to prevent abiotic or biotic risks. Several tools are

    already available to inform farmers about pest outbreaks, soil

    water availability or nitrogen nutrition index, and farmers can

    opportunistically respond to variability by adjusting pesticide,

    irrigation or fertilizer uses (Mulla 2013). In livestock systems,

    increasing adaptive capacity can also refer to organizational

    management and to the adaptation in time and space of feed

    management to secure feed supply, especially in grassland

    systems that can be highly sensitive to drought periods

    (Mosnier et al. 2009; Tichit et al. 2004). By introducing more

    flexibility in agricultural systems, these technical and decision

    making components emerge as important characteristics of

    agricultural systems which consciously or automatically ad-

    just options to reliable clues from the environment in which

    they operate (Rodriguez et al. 2011).

    Beyond farm scale, adaptive capacity can also be improved

    through collective actions between stakeholders that voluntar-

    ily share their goals and production tools. Ireland and

    Thomalla (2011) showed that collective action between farms

    can promote the establishment of social networks and enhance

    the ability of local stakeholders to cope with a changeable

    environment. It may also increase their financial resources

    which can be used during times of hardship. These new forms

    of cooperation between farms are also helping them to estab-

    lish new relationships with downstream industries and to

    adapt better to changes in market context.

    6 Conclusion

    The context of increasing uncertainty induces major chal-

    lenges for agricultural systems. The need for more sustainable

    agricultural systems in an increasingly changeable environ-

    ment implies a shift from the aim of maximizing agricultural

    outputs in a non-disturbed environment to the aim of main-

    taining desired levels of outputs in a context of unpredictable

    perturbations. For agronomists, it entails the need for a better

    characterization and quantification of the ability of agricultur-

    al systems to cope with unpredictable changes. A literature

    review of stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience

    highlighted several differences and complementarities be-

    tween these four concepts. Depending on the system’s scale,

    the type of agricultural output studied and the kind of pertur-

    bation, each concept can be meaningful and provide insights

    to better characterize agricultural system behaviour in the face

    of perturbations. This literature review also provided insights

    into the various methods available to quantify these properties

    in agricultural systems, from the analysis of the variability and

    resistance of agricultural outputs to multiscale and indicator-

    based assessments. Based on this literature, increasing diver-

    sity and adaptive capacity of agricultural systems emerge as

    key drivers for increasing the ability of agricultural systems to

    cope with different types of perturbation. However, further

    empirical studies are still needed to test and validate these

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    methods and results in various contexts and across various

    spatial and temporal scales. Further research is needed to work

    out to what extent and based on which value judgements the

    urge for more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more

    resilient agricultural production systems is moving research

    towards a course of breeding stable cultivars, towards breed-

    ing robust cows, towards protection and exposure avoidance

    or towards resilience and adaptation. Of particular interest are

    the trade-offs involved.

    TOOLS SHARE Abstract Sociohydrology was launched as the science dealing with feedbacks
    between coupled human and water systems. Much of the early work in sociohydrology
    involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins) dealing with
    phenomena that involved emergent patterns in the time domain, with a focus on
    formulating and testing hypotheses about how they arise. The papers collected
    in this Special Section “Sociohydrology: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Coupled
    Human-Water Systems” illustrate that the scientific scope of sociohydrology has
    broadened over the last few years, with a rich diversity of phenomena studied
    and an expansion of the knowledge foundations and methodologies applied. These
    Special Section papers now incorporate methodologies and approaches from a wide
    range of social science disciplines, including anthropology, complex systems,
    economics, and sociology. The major themes tackled by these papers are understanding
    (i) water metabolism—the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans
    and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and floods; and (iv) the role
    of human institutions, policy, and management. These collected papers provide
    a foundation for future research that strives to understand how to achieve water
    resources sustainability (society to water) and reduce the risk of hydrological
    hazards in society (water to society). Going forward, we suggest that the development
    of a common sociohydrology framework will be paramount for research development
    and student training. Additionally, increased engagement with the broader water
    management communities will enhance sociohydrology understanding and impact. Key
    Points The foundation of sociohydrology are the many emergent phenomena that arise
    during the practice of water resources management Sociohydrology studies benefit
    from the concepts and methodologies drawn from a wide range of natural and social
    science disciplines Increased engagement with the broader water management communities
    and the development of common frameworks represent important issues for sociohydrology
    going forward 1 Introduction The premise of sociohydrology is that our understanding
    of water systems is incomplete without the explicit inclusion of people (Srinivasan
    et al., 2016). Understanding and predicting processes in integrated human-water
    systems are challenging. This is because different disciplines, vocabularies,
    and perspectives must be synthesized (Troy et al., 2015; Wesselink et al., 2017;
    Xu et al., 2018). Bringing frameworks, theories, and models from different disciplines
    together is particularly challenging, as they typically operate at different scales
    (i.e., household vs. watershed), focus on different outcome variables (i.e., streamflow
    vs. welfare), and incorporate different scientific principles (i.e., mass balance
    vs. general equilibrium). Further, methods are grounded in different epistemologies
    and require distinct sets of prior knowledge for implementation. The papers collected
    in this Special Section contribute to this ongoing dialogue concerning the synthesis
    and a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology by showing how concepts and methods
    from different disciplines can be applied to study coupled human-water systems.
    In many respects, this is an exciting time for researchers involved in sociohydrology,
    as this movement toward consolidation and synthesis will likely open up more new
    avenues for thinking about and studying coupled human-water systems. 1.1 Sociohydrology
    to Date Much of the early work on sociohydrology has involved studies in spatially
    isolated domains (e.g., river basins), focused on phenomena expressed in the form
    of emergent patterns in the time domain. The analyses involved formulating and
    testing hypotheses on why these patterns arise. Examples include the levee effect
    as it applies to flooding in urban environments (Di Baldassarre et al., 2013)
    and the pendulum swing in water abstractions for human use in agriculture as opposed
    to water needed by the environment (Kandasamy et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014).
    The adopted approach is to frame these systems in terms of system dynamics models
    involving coupled differential equations that depict the two-way feedbacks between
    human impacts on hydrology and hydrological impacts on human wellbeing (of some
    kind) and in this way are able to reproduce or reconstruct the observed emergent
    patterns. The key advance in these early modeling studies was the introduction
    of a social variable that reflected the mediating role played by human society
    in the two-way feedbacks. In the case of the levee effect, this was a social memory
    of floods (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015), and in the case of the pendulum swing,
    it took the form of environmental awareness (van Emmerik et al., 2014) or community
    sensitivity to the environment (Elshafei et al., 2014). Subsequent work has helped
    to broaden the theoretical foundations of sociohydrology. For example, Sivapalan
    and Blöschl (2015) helped to frame sociohydrology in the context of co-evolution
    of human and water systems (in the time domain), with explicit inclusion (i.e.,
    endogenization) of human agency in the form of changing human norms and values
    and more generally culture. They proposed a study approach of emergent phenomena
    based on narratives, causal loops, and the development and testing of models using
    available time series data. This opened the way for a diversity of studies organized
    by process sociohydrology, historical sociohydrology, and comparative sociohydrology.
    It was envisaged that a plurality of studies would thus be undertaken in a variety
    of contexts. The early place-based studies (in the temporal domain) were also
    accompanied by several commentaries and critiques that sought to broaden the scope
    and foundations of sociohydrology. There was criticism that much of the early
    work was dominated by hydrologists, using mostly hydrological (or natural science)
    methods, and that sociohydrology can benefit from tools and methodologies found
    in socioecological systems and complex systems literatures (Blair & Buytaert,
    2016; Troy et al., 2015). There were also critiques that warned that the field
    was moving toward theoretical studies divorced from real places involving real
    people. It was argued that instead of inferring the nature of human-water system
    feedbacks from historical (time series) data, these can also be obtained through
    field studies, through surveys, and other forms of data collection, with the goal
    of understanding human behaviors at a fundamental, empirical level (Mostert, 2018).
    There were calls for place-based studies in real places, with a greater involvement
    of social scientists in sociohydrological studies so as to expand the foundations
    of sociohydrology (Wesselink et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018). Human-water systems
    occur at multiple spatial scales and operate in time (Sivapalan et al., 2014).
    As such, sociohydrological phenomena arise not just in the time domain but they
    can also arise in the space domain or in space-time (Chen et al., 2016). Pande
    and Sivapalan (2017) argued that the endogenization of human agency in terms of
    changing human norms and values must be extended to space and to space-time, as
    demonstrated already by Chen et al. (2016), since this is an essential prerequisite
    for water sustainability. Along the same lines, Konar et al. (2016) made the case
    for a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology toward the regional and global
    scales. They argued that sociohydrology extended to the global scale can serve
    as the blueprint to track both water withdrawal and consumption (which may be
    different in a globalized world), which helps toward the assignment of responsibility
    for the stewardship of water resources and the advancement of global water sustainability.
    The growth of the field of sociohydrology is also accompanied by calls for consolidation
    and synthesis that might lead to more general frameworks that would apply to a
    wide range of problems. This requires that sociohydrological studies be framed
    in the context of broad theoretical frameworks, such as water security and resilience.
    This would bring sociohydrology more aligned to and as a special case of older
    frameworks such as socioecological systems and thus benefit from the broad literature
    in coupled human-nature systems. The need for such generalization has long been
    felt, going all the way back to the very inception of the field (Srinivasan et
    al., 2012). There have been several recent commentaries proposing alternative
    frameworks to bring about such synthesis and generalization (Srinivasan et al.,
    2017; Lu et al., 2018; Sanderson, 2018). 2 Contributions of the Papers in the
    Special Section on Sociohydrology The last 6 years have been a period of rapid
    growth of the field, partly in response to these commentaries and critiques. This
    special section brings together more than 30 papers that reflect significant advances
    in our understanding of coupled human-water systems. In particular, they reflect
    a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology, not only in terms of the type of
    studies undertaken but also in terms of the disciplines involved. A wide range
    of methodologies is represented in this collection of papers, including the use
    of systems dynamics and agent-based models, multiple regression analyses, and
    field surveys. This indicates a certain broadening and maturing of sociohydrology,
    as also evidenced by a recent assessment of the co-authorship network in sociohydrology
    (Figure 1). In this section, we present a summary of the 31 papers appearing in
    this special section, organized under four categories: (i) water metabolism—the
    economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions
    between humans and floods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and
    management. This is followed by perspectives on the way forward, guided by previous
    commentaries and conclusions drawn by the studies appearing in this Special Section.

    background. Figure reproduced with permission from Xu et al. 2.1 The Water Metabolism
    (Use) of Humanity Water is a key input to the economic production that underpins
    modern society (Marston et al., 2018). The papers in this special issue elucidate
    the important role that water plays in our society across a range of scales. At
    the smallest spatial scale, several papers evaluate the decision making of individual
    water users (Kuil et al., 2018; Mason et al., 2018). This grows in scale to papers
    that focus on urban water use (Chini et al., 2017; Worland et al., 2018) and to
    papers that explore water use at the national scale (Dadson et al., 2017; Dang
    & Konar, 2018). These papers highlight that the issue of scaling that has been
    the focus of much research in physical hydrology (e.g., Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995)
    will continue to be an issue to consider in sociohydrology research. In addition
    to natural watershed boundaries, sociohydrology research must explicitly account
    for political boundaries. Mason et al. (2018) examine how hydroclimatic variability
    impacts the decision making of water supply operators. They incorporate a concept
    from cognitive psychology—the “availability bias”—into their modeling framework.
    Model results compare well with synthetic reservoir operation data for flood control
    and water supply. Their model successfully captures the operator''s preference
    selection across objectives and the dynamic evolution of extreme wet and dry situations.
    Kuil et al. (2018) present a sociohydrological model that captures a farmer''s
    crop choice and water allocation given his/her perception of water availability.
    They find that different farmer perceptions may lead to different crop patterns
    but also that similar, near-optimal crop patterns can emerge. The framework is
    consistent with the theory of bounded rationality, which assumes humans with limited
    cognitive abilities and imperfect information adopt satisficing behavior. The
    model by Kuil et al. (2018) also captures the rebound effect; that is, as crop
    water efficiencies improve, the newly available water will be reallocated on the
    farm instead of flowing downstream, since farmers will adjust their behavior to
    take advantage of the new water conditions. Worland et al. (2018) explore the
    drivers of municipal water use in the United States. Their results indicate that
    the most important explanatory variables are average precipitation, number of
    people per household, partisan voting, water price, and regional price parity.
    However, they find that the environmental, economic, and social controls on water
    use are not uniform across the country. Counties in the Northeast and Northwest
    climate regions are more sensitive to social variables, whereas counties in the
    Southwest and East North Central climate regions are more sensitive to environmental
    variables. This statistical analysis helps us to understand the current drivers
    of water use in cities of the United States and make better predictions about
    future water use trajectories. Chini et al. (2017) quantify the direct and indirect
    water use of urban areas in the United States. Their values could be used to inform
    future efforts to benchmark the use of energy and water resources in urban areas.
    In fact, they show that conservation opportunities exist for water and energy
    resources in both the direct and indirect supply chains of cities. Water embedded
    in the food supply chain of cities is the dominant indirect use of water and may
    represent a future opportunity to reduce the consumption water footprint of cities.
    Dang and Konar (2018) show that trade leads to lower national water use. To do
    this, they employ causal inference methods to determine that trade does not impact
    the total or industrial water use of nations but that it does reduce the agricultural
    water use of nations. They find that trade openness reduces water use in agriculture
    primarily through the intensive margin or producing more crop value per unit of
    water. Dadson et al. (2017) develop a system dynamics model that combine both
    the productive and harmful roles of water in the economy. This model shows the
    link between national wealth, water-related productivity, and losses from water-related
    hazards. Wealthy countries with minimal water-related hazards likely will not
    need significant investment in water resources infrastructure. However, wealthy
    countries that face significant water-related hazards should probably expect to
    spend a significant fraction of national wealth on water infrastructure. Poor
    countries with poor water endowments and extreme hydrological variability are
    most likely to descend into a low-level equilibrium or poverty trap, the location
    of which is controlled by local social and environmental factors. Their conceptual
    modeling approach provides important insights for the design of robust policies
    for investment in water-related productive assets and risk management. 2.2 Interactions
    Between Water Use and Drought Human activities from land use change and irrigation
    to dam building and water abstraction alter the propagation of drought through
    the hydrological cycle (Van Loon et al., 2016). In turn, drought impacts human
    activities, driving water conservation, shifting withdrawals from surface to groundwater,
    and prompting creative policy and infrastructure responses (Gonzales & Ajami,
    2017; Gonzales et al., 2017; Marston & Konar, 2017; Nelson & Burchfield, 2017).
    The papers in this Special Section characterize and quantify both drought propagation
    and response and the influence of climatic and social factors in shaping these
    processes. Apurv et al. (2017) assess the role of climate characteristics in drought
    propagation and the interactions of these processes with drought response. They
    test the impact of seasonality, the phase shift between precipitation and evaporation
    cycles, and aridity on the relationships between meteorological drought, hydrological
    drought, and groundwater drought. They find that the relative differences in meteorological
    and hydrological drought are explained by climate aridity and the timing of precipitation
    relative to potential evapotranspiration and that low interannual precipitation
    variability is associated with greater risk of drought resulting in groundwater
    depletion (Apurv et al., 2017). While Apurv et al. (2017) assess the climatic
    controls on drought propagation, Nelson and Burchfield (2017), Marston and Konar
    (2017), Gunda et al. (2018), and O''Keeffe et al. (2018) evaluate the influence
    of social factors in agricultural systems during drought. Both Nelson and Burchfield
    (2017) and Marston and Konar (2017) investigate responses to the 2012–2014 drought
    in California''s Central Valley. Nelson and Burchfield (2017) developed a spatiotemporal
    Bayesian model to assess the effect of water rights structures on agricultural
    production during drought. They find that watersheds with more senior water rights
    are associated with higher productivity during drought but that while junior water
    rights are more likely to fallow, their production is less sensitive to drought.
    This indicates that junior water rights holders have adapted to periodic reductions
    in surface water. One way they have adapted is groundwater well construction,
    confirmed by the work of Marston and Konar (2017). Marston and Konar (2017) investigate
    how the California drought''s agricultural impacts propagated through the global
    food trade system (see Figure 2). They found that while harvested area was reduced
    (due to fallowing), the water footprint grew due to rising temperatures and cropping
    changes. The reduction of harvested area led to reduced food commodity trade from
    the Central Valley. Surface water transfers also fell during this period, but
    groundwater transfers nearly doubled, strengthening the relationship between food
    trade and groundwater depletion. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Percent

    rest of the world over the course of the 2011–2014 drought. Maps indicate the

    relative to size. Volumes are provided for the largest links. Red arrows indicate
    a reduction in virtual water transfers; blue arrows signify an increase. Figure
    reproduced with permission from Marston and Konar (2017). Gunda et al. (2018)
    and O''Keeffe et al. (2018) also focus on agricultural systems, investigating
    water stress response dynamics of an acequia community in New Mexico and farmers
    in Uttar Pradesh, India. Gunda et al. (2018) couple an acequia model, developed
    by Turner et al. (2016), to a hydrological model to assess the impact of upstream
    hydrological changes and downstream demand changes on crop production and migration.
    A unique feature of their study is that they evaluated the role of mutualism in
    sustaining the acequia during drought. They model mutualism as a function of community
    participation, which is in turn shaped by employment effects, parcel size, fallow
    land percentage, and the addition of newcomers to the community. They find that
    adaptive measures such as shifting crop selection allows the community to adapt
    to reductions in streamflow but that downstream pressures to reduce water use
    lead to decreased agricultural profitability. Parallel to the articles in this
    issue on flood dynamics (Leong, 2018; Sung et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2017), Gunda
    et al. (2018) demonstrate the importance of community dynamics in influencing
    community drought response behavior. O''Keeffe et al. (2018) presents the development,
    in a bottom-up manner, of a coupled sociohydrological model that captures observed
    farmer irrigation practices in the State of Uttar Pradesh, India, including two-way
    feedbacks between environment and farmer behavior. In particular, by including
    these feedbacks between the behavior of water users, irrigation officials, and
    agricultural practices, the work highlighted the importance of directly including
    water user behavior in policy making and operational tools to achieve water and
    livelihood security. Gonzales and Ajami (2017), Gonzales et al. (2017), and Breyer
    et al. (2018), in turn, investigate drought responses in urban areas. Gonzales
    and Ajami (2017) adapt a water demand model from Garcia et al. (2016) to assess
    the impact of changing scarcity awareness on water demand in three San Francisco
    area water utilities. The three utilities selected differ by average income, percent
    residential, and average per capita water use. They find that these socioeconomic
    factors help explain differences in drought response and postdrought rebound.
    Similarly, Gonzales et al. (2017) observe that the ease and cost of conservation
    may vary significantly. This motivates them to introduce a water conservation
    trading scheme and apply the scheme to utility members of the Bay Area Water Supply
    and Conservation Agency in California. Under conservation trading, utilities that
    do not meet their targets may purchase credits, and utilities that exceed targets
    sell credits in an auction. Gonzales et al. (2017) find that trading can reduce
    the costs of conservation by 20% and that coordinate decision-making increases
    the benefits for the utilities. Breyer et al. (2018) ask how water conservation
    impacts urban hydrological cycle in a study of Austin, Texas. They use multiscalar
    statistical analysis to demonstrate that the outdoor water conservation policies
    can cascade upward to the watershed scale or downward to the submunicipal scale.
    Together these studies highlight the importance of considering both feedbacks
    from drought to human action and from human response to hydrological cycle. 2.3
    Interactions Between Human Actions and Floods An important research topic for
    human-flood interaction is how human behavior and cultural traits evolve in response
    to flood events and how the resulting social change leads to shifts in hydrologic
    components that either mitigate or exacerbate floods (Loucks, 2015). Of special
    interest is understanding the feedback mechanisms that might explain emergent
    phenomena arising from human-flood interaction, for example, the levee and adaptation
    effects (Merz et al., 2015). An influential work in this direction is that of
    Di Baldassarre et al. (2013). Using a system dynamics model, the authors propose
    feedback mechanisms that can generate the qualitative patterns of levee and adaptation
    effects. This work has stimulated much interest and discussions in the field.
    One salient issue in these discussions is how to model the response of social
    system to the physical process of flooding. The papers in this theme focus on
    this linkage to provide alternative and complementary views to the approach used
    by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013, 2015). Yu et al. (2017) presents a system dynamics
    model of how an agricultural community mobilizes collective action for levee repair
    in the face of hydroclimate variability and nonfarm job opportunities. An important
    concept from the field of political economy is introduced in this work—institutional
    arrangements (rules and norms) for governing people''s collective action (e.g.,
    Ostrom, 1990). Institutional arrangements, which are rules and norms that humans
    devise to govern their behavior, can play a critical role in reducing uncertainty
    in complex, uncertain situations (North, 1990). Inclusion of institutional arrangements
    into sociohydrology modeling helps to unpack underlying processes of social response
    into (1) rules and norms, (2) behavioral choice toward such institutional arrangements
    (e.g., abide vs. oppose), and (3) situational factors that influence the decision
    making (e.g., social memory). Sung et al. (2018) explores how different societal
    policies on flood control influence long-term trajectories of human-flood interaction.
    The model by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013) considered only two policies from a
    myriad of possible ones: green society (no structural flood control) and technological
    society (raising of levees whenever flooding occurs). Sung et al. (2018) go beyond
    these two control policies by exploring the effects of several adaptive policies
    on community maintenance of levees. In doing this, Sung et al. (2018) apply control
    theory from engineering to conceptualize how a human society learns from flood
    events and adjusts its flood control policies (Figure 3). The same application
    was made in the field of social-ecological systems to analyze how a farmer-managed
    irrigation system dynamically adapts its water distribution and cost-sharing rules
    through learning by doing (Yu et al., 2016). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    A generic block diagram control system theory (a) is applied to conceptualize
    a human-flood system governed by adaptive flood control policy (b). The symbols
    di and do represent internal problems and external forcing, respectively. The
    circle C represents comparison between the current system state (current flood
    protection level) and desired set point (target flood protection level) for computing
    the error value. Inner-loop process involves control activities that are done
    to minimize the error. Outer-loop process involves updating of the desired set
    point. Situational factors such as social memory, community attributes, and climate
    change can influence the dynamics of such inner- and outer-loop processes in human-flood
    systems. Adapted from Sung et al. (2018) and Yu et al. (2016). Leong (2018) in
    this special section provides a more nuanced perspective on the levee and adaptation
    effects. The author goes beyond the dichotomous view of these two phenomena by
    arguing that (1) a heavy dependence on structural flood protection measures may
    not always lead to the levee effect and that (2) little use of structural measures
    and frequent exposure to flooding may not always lead to the adaptation effect.
    Leong (2018) exposes these possibilities by collecting and analyzing the narratives
    of people in several floodplain villages of India. Girons Lopez et al. (2017)
    and Du et al. (2017) focus on flood warning and evacuation behavior of people.
    Girons Lopez et al. (2017) developed a conceptual model to examine how the efficiency
    of flood warning is influenced by social preparedness, which is defined as the
    knowledge and capacities of a social system to proactively respond to a disaster
    (United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, 2009). This work
    uses social memory of flood risk as a proxy for social preparedness. The model
    results show that a high social preparedness can affect the efficiency of flood
    warning system; that is, even if the warning system is inaccurate and the traffic
    network is congested, a high level of social preparedness can compensate for these
    weaknesses and mitigate flood-related losses. Du et al. (2017) developed an agent-based
    model to understand the coupled dynamics of public opinion and flood evacuation
    processes and how these dynamics are influenced by multiple information sources
    (global casting of flooding, social media, and observation of neighbors) and transportation
    system states. A key distinction of this work is reflecting the fact that individuals''
    evacuation behavior is not only influenced by the flood warnings from emergency
    managers but also by peer-to-peer communication through social media and observation
    of neighbors'' behavior. The model results show that social media can make evacuation
    processes more sensitive to changes in flood warning and neighborhood observation.
    Thompson et al. (2017) in this special section focuses on the link from human
    modifications of water resources to the physical process of flooding. This work
    uses a theoretical approach to investigate how the development lowlands affects
    the flooding of lowland environments and water balance partitioning. The model
    results show that modifications such as building levees and changing land cover
    can generate trade-offs among flood occurrence, flood duration, and total evaporation.
    Finally, MacVean et al. (2018) extended the work of Thompson et al. (2017) to
    reconstruct the hydrology of the 1850–1920 period for California''s Central Valley
    by synthesizing newly reconstructed time series of precipitation, basin inflows,
    land use change, and levee construction, using a parsimonious and semidistributed
    version of the model presented earlier by Thompson et al. (2017). Within the limitations
    of the reconstructed time series, their detailed analyses with the use of the
    model suggested that levee construction, rather than land-use change, had the
    greatest impact on the hydrology and that the decreases in annual delta outflows
    accelerated after 1920. 2.4 Human Institutions, Policy, and Management of Water
    Water management is the point at which human systems and water systems intersect,
    blurring the line between “human/social” systems and “natural” systems. The papers
    in this theme draw upon sociohydrological frameworks to provide insights into
    the institutions and decision-making processes that co-evolve with water system
    process to mutually shape water management. Water management may be informed by
    models, and traditionally, the focus of these models has been hydrological dynamics.
    Of growing importance, however, is how to more rigorously incorporate the human
    element into management of sociohydrological systems. Massuel et al. (2018) argue
    that traditional approaches to hydrology must become more open, and sensitive,
    to the human sciences. The social dynamics of human systems should be conceptualized
    as rigorously as the hydrological dynamics, but crucially, they contend that this
    will involve taking much more seriously the context-specificity of human systems.
    Their analysis of the Wadi Merguelil watershed and the downstream Kairouan Plain
    in central Tunisia shows that a conventional water budget modeling framework was
    not able to account for the many social factors that influence irrigation withdrawals.
    Instead, an approach recognizing the key role of cultural values allows researchers
    to better grasp the qualitative aspects of how humans interpret and make sense
    of sociohydrological systems. Their approach is skeptical of generalizable knowledge
    because of the site-specific dynamics that emerge from local interactions and
    that are contingent upon local cultural values. Because generalization continues
    to be a goal in sociohydrology, there is a real need to develop empirical frameworks
    that span time and space, while recognizing the context-specificity of human systems.
    Sanderson et al. (2017) take a step in this direction. Situated at the individual
    level, this paper develops a social-psychological model to explain policy choices
    among citizens in a semiarid agricultural region in the Central U.S. Great Plains.
    Here, again, values are important. Their analysis reveals how cultural values
    underlie belief formation and normative support for water management. Their model
    allows comparisons of culture-based decision-making processes among both farming
    and nonfarming populations in the watershed. These explicit comparisons enable
    researchers to identify areas of potential value-based conflict and consensus
    in water management. Another social aspect receiving greater attention recently
    is that of social position or, more broadly, the degree of stratification in a
    social system (Sanderson, 2018). Haeffner et al. (2018) explicitly investigate
    this question in the northern region of Utah, USA. Using a mixed methods approach
    involving interviews and surveys, they find that city leaders and the public differ
    in their concerns about water issues: leaders were more concerned about water
    infrastructure, and the public was more concerned with water availability and
    financial costs. Especially noteworthy is the finding that perceptions of water
    quantity and quantity are not merely shaped by the built structures and natural
    systems but instead are mediated by social structures—values, norms, beliefs,
    gender roles, and occupational structures. William et al. (2017) lend further
    support for the proposition that social position matters for modeling the human
    component of sociohydrological systems. This paper uses cooperative game theory
    to evaluate stormwater management approaches in the Gwynn Falls watershed, a highly
    urbanized watershed in West Baltimore, MD, USA. Among the key findings is that
    municipal-level regulation results in the largest reductions in pollutant loadings,
    but, again, context matters. The effectiveness of a regulatory approach depends
    on many socially contingent factors such as political, financial, and again, the
    distribution of actors'' positions within spatial stormwater networks. Taking
    the context seriously means considering it as an issue related to the scale of
    sociohydrological systems. Schifman et al. (2017) propose a framework for sociohydrology
    that attempts to enhance the adaptability of these systems by optimizing multiple
    functions and outcomes, including ecosystem services, spanning various institutional
    scales. They apply the framework to green infrastructure initiatives in Cleveland,
    OH, USA and Atlanta, GA, USA. The results demonstrate the model''s potential utility
    beyond these cases, while avoiding the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all approach.
    Along these lines, Voisin et al. (2017) integrate a regional integrated assessment
    model with an Earth system model to better understand the effects of sectoral
    human actions on spatial patterns in water resources, focusing especially on feedbacks
    between the human and natural systems. The impacts of water management depend
    on scale, and sectoral human actions influencing groundwater use and water use
    recycling shape spatial patterns in streamflows and water deficits. Roobavannan
    et al. (2017) incorporate several of the key elements discussed under this theme.
    This paper assesses the pendulum swing hypothesis in the Murrumbidgee River Basin
    in east Australia. Economic diversification emerges as the key variable, reshaping
    cultural values and norms over time and shifting the balance of preferences away
    from agricultural production and economic growth toward environmental restoration
    and sustainability. The paper sheds light on how scale, social structure, cultural
    values, and water resources interact over time, co-evolving through feedbacks
    to generate emergent outcomes. Wescoat et al. (2018) use historical geographic
    and statistical methods to gain context-specific understanding of how and why
    measurements of water flows have been done in the ways they have in the Indus
    River Basin of Pakistan. They do their analysis in three levels of water channels:
    basin, canal, and local distributary levels. The paper demonstrates that the combined
    use of historical geographic and statistical methods can be a viable approach
    for conducting sociohydrology research. Treuer et al. (2017) in this special section
    provides a rich context specific analysis of how urban water utilities can transition
    toward more sustainable water management practices. Using a case of Miami-Dade
    County, Florida, they demonstrate that a better understanding of such a transition
    requires a data-narrative approach that systematically synthesizes quantitative
    and qualitative data sources, including local knowledge of practitioners and archived
    documents. Their analysis shows that the alignment of certain biophysical, regulatory,
    financial, and political conditions likely have contributed to the region''s transition
    toward improved water sustainability. One unique aspect of the study is the use
    of institutional analysis (analysis of rules and norms) based on government documents
    to understand regulatory factors influencing such a transition. Finally, Bijl
    et al. (2018) presented a model for freshwater scarcity assessment that integrated
    the impacts of future population growth, agricultural production patterns, energy
    use, economic development, and climate change on the global freshwater cycle.
    With such integration between hydrology and economy, the model was able to generate
    greater understanding of the competition dynamics between the different freshwater
    users and different allocation mechanisms, at the basin and grid scales. In this
    way, the application of the model enabled broad conclusions to be made about the
    effects of climate change and variability and water use efficiency improvements
    in irrigated agriculture on global water withdrawals and deficits. 3 Going Forward
    The papers in this Special Section employ diverse disciplinary perspectives and
    methods to advance our understanding of coupled human-water systems. In so doing,
    they have also contributed to a broadening of the scope and foundations of sociohydrology.
    However, a few major threads of research remain for the future. Our review of
    the papers suggests the following questions yet to be addressed: (1) How will
    people adapt to future water scarcity? (2) How can we better anticipate the hydrological
    impacts of human activity across scales? (3) What policies or infrastructure investment
    can best protect communities from flooding and drought? (4) What policies can
    promote water security and when is unsustainable water use “ok”? (5) How does
    the socioecological context shape the success or failure of these policies? These
    questions will be increasingly important to address in our era of global change.
    Challenges also remain in connecting sociohydrological science to practice, developing
    generalizable knowledge of coupled human water systems, and training the next
    generation of practitioners and scholars. 3.1 Connecting Sociohydrology With Practice
    Increasingly, it will be important for sociohydrology to engage with the broad
    community of water resources managers. One avenue to potentially accomplish this
    goal is by explicitly evaluating the uncertainty and sensitivity inherent in the
    modeling of the sociohydrology system of interest. As in any model, the relevant
    variables and mechanisms included depend on the research question and scope of
    the problem. Recent sociohydrology work aims to make all relevant sources of uncertainty
    explicit in a structured way (Westerberg et al., 2017). This assessment of uncertainty
    in system outcomes can help to structure dialogue with water resources managers
    and planners, as well as engage them in the development and process of the research
    (Westerberg et al., 2017). However, we also recognize that the nature of sociohydrological
    systems implies a different split between epistemological and aleatory uncertainties
    than pristine hydrological systems (Srinivasan et al., 2016). Engaging stakeholders
    in model development through structured dialogue, communication, and understanding
    about system uncertainty strengthens the research aspects of the model and also
    better integrates interdisciplinary communities and research with practice (Wesselink
    et al., 2017). While traditional hydrology or water resources management make
    predictions of future events based on past observations, sociohydrology addresses
    the prediction of novel phenomena to understand system dynamics and limits (Levy
    et al., 2016). Methodologies to account for uncertainty in sociohydrology should
    respond to the nature of prediction in sociohydrology (Srinivasan et al., 2016),
    and therefore, uncertainty assessments should focus on the evaluation of model
    structural adequacy and the ability to reproduce observed patterns and signatures.
    Sociohydrology and water resources system science are similar in that they consider
    both water and people and their mutual importance. The key distinction is that
    while water resources management focuses on how water resources can be better
    managed to benefit both society and nature by using multidisciplinary and participatory
    approaches (Kasprzyk et al., 2018), sociohydrology focuses on the complexity and
    emergent outcomes of human and water interactions (Sivapalan et al., 2012). Water
    resources management based on the assumptions of static human and water components
    (thus, insufficient recognition of the complex and adaptive nature of coupled
    human and water systems) can fail to deliver desired management goals (Vogel et
    al., 2015). Indeed, many of the phenomena that have been the subject of analysis
    in sociohydrology, and reviewed here, have arisen in the normal course of water
    resource management, as failures or unintended consequences (Gohari et al., 2013),
    due to some long-term feedbacks between humans and water systems not being fully
    accounted for. Thus, introducing and applying sociohydrology insights into water
    resources management can potentially be very useful. Similarly, insights from
    water resources professionals can help research to identify system constraints
    (in modeling) and real-world problems to tackle, making the research more impactful.
    This calls for more engagement between the sociohydrology and water resource management
    communities than has been demonstrated thus far. A parallel has, in fact, occurred
    in the fields of natural resource management and social-ecological systems research.
    Realization of the complexity and nonlinearity of interactions between social
    systems and natural systems that sustain them has challenged conventional natural
    resource management worldwide and led to the widespread acceptance of the concept
    of the social-ecological system into the field of natural resource management
    (Folke, 2006). As sociohydrology rapidly expands in the next few years, we expect
    to see a similar convergence to take shape between sociohydrology and the field
    of water resources management. Improvement of water management practices through
    a broadening to include multiple social, economic, and cultural perspectives,
    assisted by sociohydrology, takes on added importance in the context of the United
    Nations Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2018). 3.2 Developing Generalizable
    Knowledge of Coupled Human Water Systems Going forward, it is likely that sociohydrology
    will interface with other nexus issues. Water is at the heart of many grand challenges
    for society, making it likely that water resources researchers may contribute
    to the intersection of water and food security, economics, energy, and/or biodiversity
    (Bierkens, 2015). In fact, a growing number of large-scale hydrologic models have
    incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle in recent decades (Wada et
    al., 2017). Yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models
    remains challenging and may prove to be a key opportunity for sociohydrology engagement.
    Questions also remain as to what features make sociohydrology unique compared
    to other interdisciplinary approaches and what sociohydrology might learn from
    these other approaches and vice versa. Further, challenges and opportunities remain
    in the development of common frameworks and general theories for sociohydrology.
    Frameworks usually specify a general set of variables, and relationships among
    them, that a researcher should consider when analyzing a case. A key benefit of
    a common sociohydrology framework would be that it will allow a structured and
    consistent comparative analysis of diverse case studies across contexts, thereby
    facilitating the discovery of generalizable patterns. A general sociohydrology
    theory can provide generalizable understanding of such patterns by clarifying
    how different case studies relate to one another in terms of causal processes,
    especially multilevel and multiscale processes associated with a sociohydrological
    phenomenon. Although most sociohydrology studies are already based on established
    theories that explain particular processes (e.g., rainfall runoff and expected
    utility theory), general theories that provide insights into common system-level
    aspects and multilevel and multiscale dynamics across different place-based studies
    are relatively scarce and should be pursued in the future as the field matures.
    Nevertheless, the papers in this Special Section take some initial steps in this
    direction. For example, Dadson et al. (2017) present a framework that connects
    water use and risk into an economics framework. Kuil et al. (2018) applied the
    theory of bounded rationality to analyze farmer crop choice and water allocation
    decision making, and Treuer et al. (2017) applied Triple Exposure Theory in their
    assessment of transitions to sustainable water management. Further, papers (Roobavannan
    et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017) in this Special Section test and refine existing
    hypotheses such as the levee effect and the pendulum swing, contributing to theory
    development. Early sociohydrology studies focused on system dynamics modeling
    as the primary methodology. The papers in this Special Section highlight the breadth
    of methods that can be applied to address sociohydrological questions. Leong (2018)
    collects stakeholder narratives to illustrate how cases can illustrate aspects
    of both the levee effect and adaptation effect. Treuer et al. (2016) construct
    narratives and pair them with quantitative metrics to enable cross case comparison
    without losing the nuance of case context. Identifying feedback relationships
    across temporal and spatial scales is key to advancing sociohydrology (Thompson
    et al., 2013). The complex, hierarchical and co-evolutionary nature of sociohydrological
    problems requires careful selection and interpretation of data analysis methods.
    For example, while correlation-based methods (e.g., OLS regression, granger causality,
    and Bayesian inference) can identify linear couplings and their timescales, they
    cannot unambiguously identify the direction when relationships are asymmetric
    (Ruddell & Kumar, 2009). In this issue, the authors apply a range of statistical
    methods such as structural equation modeling (Breyer et al., 2018), hierarchical
    Bayesian modeling (Nelson & Burchfield, 2017), and regression with instrumental
    variables (Dang & Konar, 2018) to address these challenges. While Gunda et al.
    (2018), Dadson et al. (2017), Sung et al. (2018), and others continue the tradition
    of applying system dynamics modeling to gain qualitative understanding of system
    behavior, they advance this approach through their application of human system
    dynamics. One critique of system dynamics approach in sociohydrology is that the
    diversity of actors is not accounted for. Du et al. (2017) address this challenge
    by developing an agent-based model of flood warning and evacuation behavior. Collectively,
    the articles in this issue demonstrate the potential to synthesize multiple methods
    to increase the robustness of sociohydrological findings—critical to applying
    insights in practice. However, to address societal challenges, scientific findings
    must be salient as well as robust. Codevelopment of research aims and coproduction
    of research products can be an effective way to increase research salience but
    also introduce new challenges (Tidwell & Van Den Brink, 2008; MacKenzie et al.,
    2012). Multiple papers in this special issue solicit stakeholder input as data
    or use stakeholder feedback to refine analyses (e.g., Gunda et al., 2018; Leong,
    2018; Treuer et al., 2017). While past sociohydrology work has addressed knowledge
    transfer (e.g., Gober et al., 2014), no papers in this issue focus on knowledge
    transfer or research codevelopment, and more work remains to ensure that research
    efforts in sociohydrology can be applied in practice. Additionally, proper characterization
    of the uncertainties and sensitivities that exist in sociohydrology models must
    be explored to inform stakeholders. In this way, policymakers can be engaged to
    manage uncertainty—rather than reduce it—in a sociohydrology system (Gober et
    al., 2017). 3.3 Training the Next Generation of Practitioners and Scholars Future
    education and training of scholars and practitioners equipped to tackle outstanding
    questions in this field will be critical. A key question for the field is to determine
    if the training of researchers should shift or broaden to tackle sociohydrological
    challenges or if the training should emphasize teamwork and communication skills
    to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration. Another key question is the relationship
    between sociohydrology and water resource managers. As sociohydrology is an emerging
    science, it will engage more directly with water managers—as stakeholders, along
    with the general public—as it develops. Indeed, these interactions will be necessary
    in order to incorporate insights from managers and “ground truth” sociohydrological
    models. Tackling sociohydrological challenges will require knowledge of water
    resources science as well as the social sciences, with the precise skill sets
    varying by the scientific questions pursued. A key question for mentors and advisers
    is to what degree individual researchers should be trained in this skill set versus
    preparing researchers to collaborate across disciplines. However, a core body
    of knowledge will remain essential so that scholars can interface and communicate
    with one other easily. Programs of study will grapple with what this fundamental
    body of knowledge is and should be. We suggest that several strategic skills to
    develop include methods in data science, complex systems science, coupled human
    and natural systems modeling, and causal inference. Going forward, science communication
    training will be an increasingly important skill set to develop, since this will
    enable work across disciplines, with policymakers, water managers, and the broader
    public. References Citing Literature Volume55, Issue2 February 2019 Pages 874-887

    G. Evans, W. M. Iversen, Y. Kim Keywords:   Decision support, Water management,
    Automation, Adaptive control systems, Irrigation controls, Sprinkler irrigation,
    Wireless networks, Sensors The development of site-specific water management systems
    for sprinkler irrigation will be a major factor in future efforts to improve the
    various efficiencies of water-use and to support a sustainable irrigated environment.
    The challenge is to develop fully integrated management systems with supporting
    elements that accurately and inexpensively sense within-field variability and
    then optimally control variable-rate water application systems in ways that account
    for the spatial variability affecting water use. Recent advances in sensor and
    wireless radio frequency (RF) technologies have enabled the development of distributed
    in-field sensor-based irrigation systems to support site-specific irrigation management.
    Thus, integration of a decision-making process with a distributed wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and providing real-time input to site-specific controls is a viable
    option. This presentation reviews research on the implementation of in-field micrometeorological
    information that was fed from a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) and
    displayed on a geo-referenced field map in a computer base station. Low-cost Bluetooth
    wireless RF communications from both a distributed WSN and the machine controls
    monitoring of sprinkler status and global positioning system (GPS) location were
    interfaced with a computer base station for processing by a decision support program,
    which updated the instructions to the variable rate irrigation controller for
    real-time site-specific control. The decision support was optimized to adapt changes
    of crop type, irrigation pattern, and field location for instructions for individual
    sprinkler heads on how much water to apply and where. A graphical user interface
    (GUI) with a simple click-and-play menu was used, which allowed growers to remotely
    access field conditions and irrigation status at the home or office via wireless
    RF communications. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 14 Share Facebook X

    \ possible automated irrigation scheduling using\ndecision-support tools. These\
    \ tools help farmers to make better decisions in the management of their\nirrigation\
    \ system, thus increasing yields while preserving water resources. The aim of\
    \ this study\nis to evaluate in a commercial plot an automated irrigation system\
    \ combined with remote-sensing\ntechniques and soil mapping that allows the establishment\
    \ of regulated deﬁcit irrigation (RDI)\nstrategies. The study was carried out\
    \ over 3 years (2015–2017) in a commercial hedgerow olive\norchard of the variety\
    \ ‘Arbequina’ located in Alvarado (Extremadura, Spain). An apparent electrical\n\
    conductivity (ECa) map and a normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI) map\
    \ were generated\nto characterize the spatial variability of the plot and classify\
    \ the zones in homogeneous areas.\nThen, reference points were selected to monitor\
    \ the diﬀerent irrigation sectors. In 2015, the plot was\nirrigated according\
    \ to the farmer’s technical criteria throughout the plot. In 2016 and 2017, two\
    \ diﬀerent\nareas of the plot were irrigated applying an RDI strategy, one under\
    \ expert supervision and the other\nautomatically. The results show that in a\
    \ heterogeneous plot the use of new technologies can be useful\nto establish the\
    \ ideal location for an automatic irrigation system. Furthermore, automatic irrigation\n\
    scheduling made it possible to establish an RDI strategy recommended by an expert,\
    \ resulting in the\nhomogenization of production throughout the plot without the\
    \ need for human intervention.\nKeywords: apparent electrical conductivity; NDVI;\
    \ water use eﬃciency; precision irrigation;\ncapacitive sensors\n1. Introduction\n\
    The olive (Olea europaea L.) tree has traditionally been cultivated in low-density\
    \ orchards under\nrainfed conditions due to the drought tolerance capacity of\
    \ this evergreen species [1]. However, growth\nand yield may be aﬀected by the\
    \ decrease in the photosynthetic rate of olive cultivars under rainfed\nconditions\
    \ [2]. Since the 1970s there has been a steady increase in the land area occupied\
    \ by irrigated\nolive orchards, which was accelerated by the appearance of super-high\
    \ density plantations (SHD,\n1500–2000 trees/ha) in the 1990s. The main advantage\
    \ of highly mechanized SHD systems is the\nreduction in labor costs during pruning\
    \ and harvesting. However, such systems require speciﬁc\nagronomic techniques\
    \ and are very costly to set up [3]. Irrigation is very important in SHD olive\n\
    groves to ensure high productivity, as the trees have a limited root volume, a\
    \ high leaf area index and,\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526; doi:10.3390/s20092526\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 2526\n2 of 23\nin consequence, high water demands [4,5]. However,\
    \ the application of excessive amounts of water\ncan lead to uncontrolled vigor,\
    \ the need for severe pruning to adapt the hedgerow to the operation\nof the mechanical\
    \ harvester, and low lighting in the fruiting areas, producing an imbalance between\n\
    growth and productivity [6].\nFurthermore, water is a scarce resource [7]. According\
    \ to the Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO) of the United Nations, agriculture\
    \ is responsible for over 70% of worldwide water consumption,\nand it is estimated\
    \ that the amounts used for irrigation will rise by 14% in the next 10 years [8].\n\
    Therefore, to cope with water scarcity and to improve the proﬁtability of SHD\
    \ olive groves, water\nsavings irrigation strategies must be used in order to\
    \ control hedgerow vigor, as canopies with greater\nproductive eﬃciency are key\
    \ to increasing the viability of these systems [9]. RDI is a management\nstrategy\
    \ that imposes water deﬁcits in phenological stages less sensitive to drought\
    \ in order to restrain\nvegetative growth while not negatively impacting yield\
    \ and fruit quality [10,11]. The phenological stage\nthat is least sensitive to\
    \ water deﬁcit in the olive tree is the period from pit hardening to veraison\
    \ [12,13].\nIrrigation scheduling requires decision-making with respect to when\
    \ and how much irrigation\nshould be applied according to crop type, crop development\
    \ and environmental conditions. The soil\nwater balance (WB) method is widely\
    \ used to determine the irrigation needs of a crop, where the\nwater inputs to\
    \ the soil-plant system must be balanced with the expected outputs. The most important\n\
    component of the WB is the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) value, which is the crop\
    \ water need that\nconsiders both evaporation from the soil and transpiration\
    \ from the plants. The ETc is estimated as\nthe product of the evapotranspiration\
    \ of a reference crop (ETo) and a crop coeﬃcient, Kc, in the form\nETc = ETo ×\
    \ Kc [14]. In this relationship, ETo represents the demand imposed by the meteorological\n\
    conditions while Kc integrates the physical and biophysical diﬀerences between\
    \ the reference crop\nand the crop which is to be estimated for evapotranspiration\
    \ [14]. Irrigation scheduling based on WB\npresents the advantage of anticipating\
    \ crop water requirements at certain times during the growing\nseason and the\
    \ possibility of planning irrigation accordingly [15]. However, this method presents\
    \ the\ndisadvantage that predicted ETc values could be inaccurate because of changes\
    \ in annual weather\npatterns and diﬀerences in the production practices for which\
    \ the Kc was developed [16]. An alternative\nto the WB-based method is to use\
    \ soil moisture sensors to help plan irrigation scheduling. This method\nconsiders\
    \ the soil as a water reserve for plant growth, and the idea is to ensure the\
    \ reserve always\nhas a suﬃcient amount of water available to the plant. Irrigation\
    \ control is based on the monitoring\nand measurements of soil water content or\
    \ water potential. Various types of these sensors have been\nused to determine\
    \ soil water content [17]. In addition to the problem of having to weigh up the\
    \ pros\nand cons of the diﬀerent sensor types, the appropriate placement of sensors\
    \ to accurately reﬂect the\nconditions experienced by the plant can be challenging\
    \ [18]. Consideration needs to be given to the\nfact that soil water content patterns\
    \ in the root zone are dynamic and inﬂuenced by soil hydraulic\nproperties, spatial\
    \ heterogeneity, crop characteristics and the irrigation system, among others.\
    \ In drip\nirrigation, the local application of irrigation water results in even\
    \ higher spatial variability in the soil\nwater content patterns formed under\
    \ the emitters [19]. In general, given the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\nthe WB-based\
    \ and soil water content monitoring methods, combining both approaches seems the\
    \ best\nway in the future to improve irrigation eﬃciency in agricultural systems:\
    \ i.e., determine the irrigation\ndose from a WB model and then adapt that dosage\
    \ through the use of sensors to the real situation of\neach plot. For this purpose,\
    \ an interactive software-based decision support system (DSS) can be used\nto\
    \ help decision-makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data,\
    \ documents and\npersonal knowledge. This information can then be deployed to\
    \ identify and solve problems, and make\noptimized decisions. The simplest DSS\
    \ designed to carry out automated irrigation consists of activating\nor deactivating\
    \ irrigation when the sensor measurements are above or below predeﬁned threshold\n\
    values [15,20–23]. A more complex proposal is a DSS which combines the WB method\
    \ with soil or\nplant sensors to readjust the ETc [24–27]. Millán et al. [28]\
    \ used a DSS that executed a pre-established\nirrigation scheduling in which RDI\
    \ was applied without human intervention in a plum crop.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n\
    3 of 23\nOne aspect that complicates the eﬃcient irrigation management of crops\
    \ is plot heterogeneity,\nwhich depends on factors such as plot size, soil characteristics,\
    \ orography, previous plot uses, etc. If the\nproblem of soil spatial variability\
    \ is not taken into account, an irrigation design may not be eﬃcient [29].\nWork\
    \ on experimental plots rarely addresses these problems, which require the use\
    \ of specialist tools\nto characterize spatial variability. Remote sensing and\
    \ soil mapping are tools that can be used for\nagronomic crop management, allowing\
    \ characterization of the development of the vegetation cover\nand the large-scale\
    \ water status of the crop. Very interesting results have been obtained for olive\
    \ groves\nwith such tools [30]. Using data related to the electrical properties\
    \ of the soil and multispectral images,\neasily available at high resolution,\
    \ can be the best option to delineate diﬀerent homogeneous zones.\nFor instance,\
    \ Pedrera-Parrilla et al. [31] and Moral et al. [32] used soil electrical data\
    \ for zoning purposes,\nand Hall and Wilson [33] and Martínez-Casanovas et al.\
    \ [34] utilized vegetation indices computed\nfrom multispectral images. The use\
    \ of satellite data to evaluate changes in vegetation properties aimed\nat applications\
    \ in precision agriculture has also been investigated [35,36]. Coarse resolution\
    \ satellite\nimages are useful tools to describe the phenology of the vegetation\
    \ [37]. Crop monitoring oﬀers direct\ninformation for the analysis of the spatial\
    \ variability of the crop area. On the basis of such information\nmanagement actions\
    \ can be taken to improve production practices. The information can be used to\n\
    adjust and direct fertilization, determine crop development, adapt irrigation\
    \ to the needs of the crop,\nand schedule the harvest. One way to determine crop\
    \ development is based on the use of reﬂectance\nmeasurements, which diﬀer depending\
    \ on the type of surface and, in the case of plants, the species,\ncultivar, and\
    \ plant status [38]. From this information, the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\
    \ index\n(NDVI) can be computed (ratio of the diﬀerence of the values of reﬂectance\
    \ in the near infrared and\nred bands and their sum). It is known that NDVI is\
    \ a good indicator of the state of development of\nvegetation and, in consequence,\
    \ can be used to detect canopy diﬀerences within a ﬁeld [39].\nThe objectives\
    \ of this study were to test the technical feasibility and to evaluate the productive\n\
    response of a heterogeneous plot in an SHD olive grove cv. ‘Arbequina’ when using\
    \ a DSS to carry out\na fully automated irrigation scheduling and implementing\
    \ RDI strategies based on the information\nobtained through remote sensing and\
    \ soil monitoring.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Site Description and Experimental\
    \ Design\nThis work was performed over the course of three years (2015–2017) in\
    \ a 9.31 ha commercial hedgerow\nolive grove (Olea europaea L.) planted with cv.\
    \ ‘Arbequina’. The farm is located in the municipality of\nAlvarado, about 16\
    \ km east of Badajoz in southwestern Spain (38◦49′27.15” N, 6◦46′ 18.39” W, datum\n\
    WGS84). The trees were planted in autumn 2007 at a density of 1.852 olive trees/ha\
    \ (4 × 1.35 m), with a\nnorth-south orientation and trained to a central axis.\
    \ The predominant soil in this field was classified as a\nHaplic Fluvisol according\
    \ to the FAO (2006). Soil maintenance involved the practice of non-tillage and\
    \ the\napplication of herbicides to ensure it remained free of weeds. The climate\
    \ of the area is Mediterranean with a\nmild Atlantic influence, with a dry season\
    \ from June to September (summer) and a wet season from October\nto May (winter)\
    \ in which 80% of total precipitation falls. Average ETo and precipitation p-values\
    \ in the area\nwere 1188.25 mm and 503.56 mm, respectively, for the 2007–2017\
    \ period. For the same period, the average\nmaximum and minimum air temperature\
    \ values were 23.49 ◦C and 9.56 ◦C, respectively. The hottest\nmonths are July\
    \ and August. Maximum temperatures of over 40 ◦C are recorded nearly every year,\
    \ with\npeak values rarely over 45 ◦C. The coolest months are December and January.\
    \ Temperatures below 0 ◦C\nare recorded every year, with minimum values rarely\
    \ below −5 ◦C. The meteorological information was\nobtained from a weather station\
    \ located in the same study plot at a height of 3 m above ground level (in\nline\
    \ with a tree row).\nTrees were irrigated daily using a drip system with a single\
    \ lateral line per tree row located close\nto the base of the tree, with pressure-compensating\
    \ drippers spaced at 0.67 m and with 1.6 L h−1\ndischarge rates. The plot is described\
    \ in more detail in Millán et al. [40].\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n4 of 23\n2.2.\
    \ Characterization of Spatial Variability of the Plot, Selection of Control Points\
    \ and Soil Analysis\nOne very important aspect, which complicates the eﬃcient\
    \ irrigation management of crops, is plot\nheterogeneity. When establishing an\
    \ automatic irrigation system it is, therefore, important to know the\nspatial\
    \ variation in soil and crop development. A satellite image and a Dualem-1S non-contact\
    \ sensor\n(Dualem, Inc., Milton, ON, Canada) were used to evaluate the heterogeneity\
    \ of the plot. The NDVI\nmeasurement was provided by the Sentinel-2A (European\
    \ Space Agency, ESA) satellite with an image\ntaken in August of 2015 with no\
    \ cloud cover. The image was processed and analyzed in QGIS 2.18\n(https://www.qgis.org)\
    \ using DOS1 atmospheric correction.\nThe Dualem-1S sensor was used to measure\
    \ apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and was\nequipped with a global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) antenna. The sensor comprised a transmitter\noperating at a frequency\
    \ of 9 kHz and two receivers with diﬀerent orientations. There was a 1 m\nseparation\
    \ between the transmitter (Tx) and the two receivers (Rx). The ECa was measured\
    \ at 0–0.50 m\nand 0–1.50 m depths. The sensor was introduced into a 3 m long\
    \ polyvinyl chloride (PVC) structure\nwhich was transported by a pickup truck\
    \ traveling at an average speed of 9 km h−1. Due to the height\nof the vehicle,\
    \ ECa readings were carried out of the 0–0.40 m and 0–1.40 m soil layers, assuming\
    \ that the\nECa of the air is zero. In this study, we used the ECa measurements\
    \ of the top layer (0–0.40 m). The ECa\nmeasurements were taken in August 2015\
    \ along diﬀerent parallel transects that were approximately\n4 m apart. The Dualem-1S\
    \ was programmed to register measurements each second, and a total of\n3313 ECa\
    \ measurements were obtained in the plot. Ordinary kriging was used to develop\
    \ the ECa map.\nFigure 1a shows the soil ECa map and Figure 1b the NDVI map. ECa\
    \ is related to diﬀerent soil\ncharacteristics that directly or indirectly inﬂuence\
    \ the availability of water for cultivation. The map\nwas made in August when\
    \ the water content was mostly from irrigation. These served as the basis\nfor\
    \ determining the control points in the study plot. As seen in Figure 1a, the\
    \ values classiﬁed as\nlow, medium and high (because the ECa values may change\
    \ with diﬀerent water contents in the plot)\nallowed identiﬁcation of areas with\
    \ diﬀerent ECa values in the plot. The highest ECa values were\nfound in the southwestern,\
    \ northwestern and eastern areas of the experimental ﬁeld, corresponding to\n\
    a higher water retention capacity. Soil texture was one of variables considered\
    \ in the geostatistical\nanalysis for identifying the management zones in the\
    \ plot [40]. Analysis of the satellite image (Figure 1b)\nallowed identiﬁcation\
    \ of the areas with highest and lowest canopy crop development. The NDVI\nshowed\
    \ the highest values to be in the northern and central areas of the ﬁeld. These\
    \ intra-ﬁeld ECa and\nvigor diﬀerences are due to a complex interaction of biological,\
    \ agronomic, edaphic, anthropogenic,\ntopographic and climatic factors [32].\n\
    With the information obtained from Figure 1a,b, a new map was generated (Figure\
    \ 1c) using the\nmap algebra tool (raster calculator) in QGIS 2.18. As can be\
    \ seen in Figure 1c, three diﬀerent zones\nwere established:\n•\nZone 1 (T1):\
    \ where the ECa and NDVI values were medium or high. The sampling points 1 and\n\
    2 were found in this zone.\n•\nZone 2 (T2): where the ECa and NDVI values were\
    \ low. The sampling points 3 and 4 were found\nin this zone.\n•\nZone 3 (CR):\
    \ where the ECa values were low and the NDVI values were medium or high.\nThe\
    \ sampling control points CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4 were found in this zone.\nThe\
    \ maps made during the ﬁrst year served as a basis to establish in the following\
    \ seasons in situ\ncontrol areas. Each control area consisted of 3 rows of 6 trees\
    \ each. The various measurements that\nwere subsequently taken were made in the\
    \ 4 central trees of each control area.\nThe DSS-managed automatic irrigation\
    \ system was established in Zone 3. This had the most\nunfavorable conditions\
    \ for the hedgerow olive grove and corresponded to places with medium or high\n\
    vigor and low ECa values. In this zone, three control points were selected CR1,\
    \ CR2, CR3 (2016 and\n2017) (Figure 1) and in 2017 one more control point, CR4\
    \ (Figure 1), was added to check the system in\ndiﬀerent soil and crop conditions\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 2526\n5 of 23\nZones 1 and 2 were used to compare the irrigation\
    \ scheduling carried out in Zone 3. These two\nﬁrst zones were irrigated according\
    \ to the expert technical criteria. In both zones, two sampling points\nwere selected,\
    \ in Zone 1 (T1) points 1 and 2, and in Zone 2 (T2) points 3 and 4 (Figure 1).\
    \ At these\npoints, irrigation volumes were recorded daily using digital water\

    \ irrigation, the DSS comprised two components: (a) sensors\ninstalled in the\
    \ ﬁeld and (b) IRRIX, a web platform whose algorithm is based on a combination\
    \ of the\nwater balance with soil moisture sensor feedback adjustment mechanisms.\n\
    (a)\nSensors installed in the ﬁeld: to monitor the soil moisture, 10 HS capacitive\
    \ moisture sensors\n(Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) were installed at\
    \ diﬀerent positions (position A\nand position B) (Figure 2) in the diﬀerent control\
    \ points selected (CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4).\nTwo drippers were monitored at each\
    \ control point. Four moisture sensors were placed under\neach dripper in the\
    \ position A, two at a depth of 0.30 m and the others at a depth of 0.60 m.\n\
    In addition, one measure sensor was situated between the two drippers in the position\
    \ B at a\ndepth of 0.30 m (Figure 2). These 5 moisture sensors were installed\
    \ in each of the control points\n(CR1, CR2 and CR3) in 2016, making a total of\
    \ 15 sensors. In 2017, the number of soil moisture\nsensors was increased from\
    \ 15 to 20, as a new control point was added (CR4). When an error was\ndetected\
    \ in any of the sensors that had been installed, that sensor was automatically\
    \ replaced\nwith another in the same position.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n7 of 23\n\
    Figure 2. Sensor location.\nA solenoid valve (Rain Bird Europe SCN, Aix-en-Provence,\
    \ France) and pulse water meter\n(Lab-Ferrer S.L., Cervera, Lleida, Spain) were\
    \ also installed at each control point to measure and\nmonitor each irrigation\
    \ event. An air temperature sensor (CS2015, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan,\n\
    UT, USA) was also installed in a central point of the zone. All sensors were connected\
    \ to a datalogger\n(CR1000, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA) via cables.\
    \ In addition, a voltage regulator\n(BlueSolar PWM-Pro, Vitron Energy BluePower,\
    \ The Netherlands) and a relay module (SMD-CD16AC,\nCampbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan,\
    \ UT, USA) were also connected to the datalogger to control the\nopening and closing\
    \ of the solenoid valves according to the programming established by the system.\n\
    The program used in the datalogger was written in CR Basic (Campbell Scientiﬁc\
    \ Inc., Logan, UT,\nUSA) and implemented the functionalities of an irrigation\
    \ automata. All data were stored each 5 min.\nThe data was downloaded to an IRRIX\
    \ server four times a day.\nThe distance between the diﬀerent control points for\
    \ automatic irrigation was limited by the\nmaximum possible cable distance to\
    \ maintain the electrical signal with suﬃcient quality. With this\nlimitation,\
    \ it was decided to locate the control points in the same area, the most disadvantaged\
    \ one,\nwhich required more precise control of the irrigation (sandier texture\
    \ and more vigorous trees).\n(b)\nIRRIX is a cloud-hosted web platform that carries\
    \ out the following daily tasks:\n1.\nData collection of sensors installed in\
    \ the ﬁeld (Figure 3). IRRIX downloads sensor data at periodic\nintervals throughout\
    \ the day and at the user’s request.\n2.\nAnalysis of all data and calculation\
    \ of irrigation water volumes. Once a day, IRRIX analyses\nthe set of data to\
    \ determine the irrigation dose using the information provided by the moisture\n\
    sensors. To achieve this, this tool integrates an algorithm which combines a WB-based\
    \ estimation\nof crop water needs (feed-forward control) with readjustment based\
    \ on sensor readings (feedback\ncontrol). [25,28,44]\n3.\nIrrigation scheduling.\
    \ IRRIX sends the updated irrigation doses to the datalogger. Then, this\ndevice\
    \ orders the activation of the rest of the equipment (solenoid valve or pumps,\
    \ etc.) to apply\nthe required irrigation doses.\n4.\nInteraction with users.\
    \ IRRIX is an autonomous system whose main objective is to free the user\nfrom\
    \ work. The main function of the user is to check that the system has worked correctly.\n\
    Logically, if there is any anomaly in the system it has to be resolved by the\
    \ user.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n8 of 23\nFigure 3. Tasks carried out by IRRIX.\n\
    Before starting the irrigation campaign, the user must input to IRRIX a plan that\
    \ provides a rough\nestimation of how the water will be distributed throughout\
    \ the campaign. This seasonal plan is drawn\nup by an expert who determines the\
    \ guidelines that the irrigation must follow, in this case taking into\naccount\
    \ the deﬁcit periods. This plan represents the cumulative irrigation water amount\
    \ throughout\nthe campaign. In order to adapt to the conditions of each year,\
    \ upper and lower limits are set to this\nbaseline. For this, a set of curves\
    \ has to be deﬁned, with the automated control system positioned\nbetween those\
    \ curves in such a way that the system must be between a maximum and a minimum\n\
    cumulative irrigation value.\n2.4. Irrigation Scheduling\nThe irrigation carried\
    \ out on the plot in the diﬀerent years was the following:\n•\nIn 2015, all the\
    \ plot zones were irrigated according to the criteria of the farmer.\n•\nIn 2016,\
    \ all the plot zones were irrigated according to expert technical criteria [45].\
    \ In the T1 and\nT2 zones, the irrigation scheduling was under human control (non-automatic\
    \ irrigation scheduling,\nNAIS). Irrigation was controlled by solenoid valves\
    \ operated by a commercial automaton, Agronic\n4000 (Sistemes Electrònics Progrés,\
    \ Palau d’Anglesola, Lleida, Spain), which was programmed\nremotely, every Monday,\
    \ using the desktop application provided by the manufacturer. The CR1,\nCR2 and\
    \ CR3 control points were irrigated automatically through the IRRIX system (automatic\n\
    irrigation scheduling, AIS), without human intervention. The scheduled irrigation\
    \ dose was\nindependent at each control point. The irrigation criterion was the\
    \ same in both cases: a light RDI\nto preserve oil yield.\nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ was adjusted according to measurements of midday stem water potential\n(Ψstem)\
    \ made in T1 and T2:\n#\nPhase I, from sprouting (early in March) until the beginning\
    \ of the olive pit hardening stage\n(beginning of July) [45]. The threshold established\
    \ for Phase I was −1.4 MPa [12], which means\nthe implementation of only a slight\
    \ water deﬁcit.\n#\nPhase II, from the beginning of the hardening of olive pit\
    \ until the beginning of veraison\n(mid-September) [45]. The threshold established\
    \ for Phase II was −2.0 MPa [12].\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n9 of 23\n#\nPhase III,\
    \ from the end of Phase II until harvest [45]. The threshold established for Phase\
    \ III was\n−1.6 MPa [12].\nFor T1 and T2, the ETo was calculated according to\
    \ the formula of Penman and Monteith [14],\nmodiﬁed using the data obtained through\
    \ an external meteorological network (REDAREX, http:\n//redarexplus.gobex.es),\
    \ and weekly Ψstem measurements were used to adjust irrigation.\nIn the case of\
    \ CR1, CR2 and CR3, the ETo was estimated daily from the air temperature sensor\n\
    using the Hargreaves equation [46] and Ψstem values were not used to adjust irrigation.\
    \ To carry out\nirrigation at these points through the DSS, the olive irrigation\
    \ expert [45] provided a modiﬁed Kc (Kc\nmod.) that took into account the deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation strategy. This Kc mod., which has to be introduced\ninto IRRIX at\
    \ the beginning of the irrigation campaign (Figure 4) for the preparation of the\
    \ seasonal\nplan, was established on the basis of technical experience in the\
    \ same plot with a view to attaining the\ntarget Ψstem for each of the previously\
    \ described phases. At the CR1, CR2 and CR3 points, irrigation\nscheduling was\
    \ carried out independently and aimed to simulate the irrigation that was carried\
    \ out in\nT1 and T2.\n•\nIn 2017, irrigation scheduling was similar to that of\
    \ the previous year, but one more control\npoint was added (CR4) where automatic\
    \ irrigation was also carried out. As in the other CR\npoints, the CR4 irrigation\
    \ scheduling was carried out independently. The CR1 and CR2 automatic\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling was carried out in the DSS on the basis of the information provided\
    \ by\nthe sensors located in CR2. In accordance with the evolution of Ψstem, a\
    \ series of adjustments\nwere made in 2017 in relation to the seasonal plan (due\
    \ to the fact that this year was unusually\ndry) and the soil comfort zone in\
    \ relation to the sensor readings. This soil comfort zone speciﬁes\nto the control\
    \ system the acceptable range for the soil moisture sensor measurements and their\n\
    pre-established boundaries were empirically readjusted to ﬁt with the observed\
    \ range.\nFigure 4. Crop coeﬃcient (Kc) values according to the physiological\
    \ state of the olive grove. Kc was\nadjusted to the crop conditions of Extremadura\
    \ and was calculated with the Orgaz et al. [47] method\nusing the 10-year average,\
    \ and Kc mod. was adapted to the deﬁcit irrigation strategy.\nA summary of the\
    \ irrigation scheduling followed in this study is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2.\

    \ Canopy Volume\nThe Ψstem was measured once a week with a pressure chamber (Model\
    \ 3005, Soil Moisture\nEquipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). One shaded-leaf\
    \ per tree was selected near the base of the\ntrunk and covered with aluminum\
    \ foil at least two hours before the measurements [48]. This selection\nwas carried\
    \ out between 12:00 and 13:00 h solar time. Determinations were made in four trees\
    \ per\ncontrol point. The average Ψstem value was used to calculate the irrigation\
    \ correction in T1 and T2.\nThis average was compared with the threshold value\
    \ and the deviation was calculated.\n2.5.2. Yield Data and Oil Content\nIn 2015,\
    \ yield measurements were made for the T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3 sampling points.\n\
    The yield control points were increased by one (CR4) in 2017. At each control\
    \ point, 4 olive trees were\nhand harvested when the trees reached a maturity\
    \ index (MI) of approximately 2.5. A weekly sampling\nwas carried out in every\
    \ control point from the beginning of veraison. On each occasion, a sample of\n\
    one hundred olives was classiﬁed in eight color groups, and the MI was calculated\
    \ according to the\nprocedure described in [49]. The yield of each tree was weighed\
    \ separately, and subsamples of 100 olive\nfruits from the total harvest of the\
    \ four trees were collected to determine the average weight of the fruit\nand\
    \ the number of fruits per tree. All subsamples were weighed fresh. Oil content\
    \ was measured for a\n1 kg sample of the four trees by Soxhlet extraction in accordance\
    \ with EEC Regulation 2568/1991 [50].\nFor this, the sample was crushed and dried\
    \ in a DryBig 250 oven (Borel Fours Industriels and Etuves,\nS.A., Neuchâtel,\
    \ Switzerland) at 105 ◦C. In this study, the trees were harvested in late October\
    \ and\nearly November.\n2.6. Statistical Analysis\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA)\
    \ was used for the statistical analysis of the data. When signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerences\
    \ were detected, a comparison of means was made applying Duncan’s test at p <\
    \ 0.05.\nThe statistical package IBM SPSS version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp.\
    \ Armonk, NY, USA) was used.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Climatic Conditions\n\
    Table 3 shows the mean temperature (Tmean) and mean relative humidity of the air\
    \ (RHmean)\nfor each of the three phases in the three study years as well as the\
    \ annual mean values, and the\ncumulative rainfall, ETc and ETo (calculated using\
    \ the Penman–Monteith (ETo-PM) and Hargreaves\n(ETo-H) methods) values for each\
    \ of the three phases in the three study years as well as the annual\ncumulative\
    \ values. The highest Tmean and lowest RHmean values were observed in 2017. The\
    \ highest\nTmean values were reached in Phase II (summer months) in all years,\
    \ and the lowest in Phase III in\n2015 and 2017 and in Phase I in 2016. Cumulative\
    \ rainfall in the experimental period amounted to\n181 mm in 2015, 152 mm in 2016\
    \ and 76 mm in 2017. Annual cumulative rainfall ranged from 475 mm\n(2016), the\
    \ rainiest year, to 265 mm (2017), the driest year as well as the year with the\
    \ highest annual\nETo values. The annual ETo-PM was very similar in the three\
    \ years of study, with higher values in\nPhase I. The ETo-H followed the same\
    \ seasonal trend as ETo-PM, although with slightly higher values.\nThe ETo-H overestimated\
    \ the ETo-PM by 7% on average. The annual ETc was 834 mm, 861 mm and\n894 mm for\
    \ 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n11 of 23\nTable\

    \ Water\nTable 4 shows the irrigation amounts supplied in each phase in the three\
    \ study years. It should be\nnoted that 2017 was unusually dry, and so the amount\
    \ of applied irrigation water was higher due to\nthe low rainfall and high ETo.\
    \ Comparing the diﬀerent control points in each zone, it is possible to\nobserve\
    \ how in 2015 the irrigation applied was very similar in all cases for each Phase\
    \ and in total.\nIn 2016, the AIS zones received less water than T1 and T2, mainly\
    \ in Phase II with 16% less, with a\nconsequent total water saving of 24%. It\
    \ should be noted that at sampling point 4 (in T2) there was an\nirrigation system\
    \ failure during Phase II and, therefore, the water applied in that phase was\
    \ lower\nthan for points 1, 2 and 3 in T1 and T2. In 2017, AIS applied more water\
    \ in Phase I in CR1, CR2 and\nCR3 points and less water in Phases II and III than\
    \ the amounts applied at the T1, T2, T3 and T4 points.\nIt is observed that the\
    \ AIS emulates the expert scheduling and obtained a 6% reduction in applied\n\
    water compared to the NAIS system. The DSS schedules irrigation independently\
    \ at each of the points\nin accordance with the particular conditions that exist\
    \ in each zone.\nThe ability of the automatic system to respond diﬀerently in\
    \ each of the control points may,\ntherefore, respond to diﬀerences in soil water\
    \ reserves which depend on soil texture and crop water\ndemand at each particular\
    \ point. This information is provided continuously by the frequency domain\nreﬂectometry\
    \ (FDR) sensors. However, the greater or lesser presence of roots in the area\
    \ where the\nsensors are located also needs to be taken into account. In addition,\
    \ it is important to consider the\nsize of the roots as this can aﬀect the readings\
    \ of the FDR sensors, with an increase in root system size\nresulting in increasingly\
    \ larger underestimations of the true volumetric water content, presumably\nbecause\
    \ of the water in the roots [51]. With regard to the (rain + irrigation)/crop\
    \ evapotranspiration\nrelationship (Table 4), the crop received less water in\
    \ relation to its needs in 2015, when irrigation was\ncarried out at the farmer’s\
    \ discretion.\nFigure 5 shows cumulative irrigation at the NASI and AIS points\
    \ in 2016 and 2017. The irrigation\namount was lower in 2016 than in 2017, as\
    \ 2017 was a drier year. In 2016, the water applied until early\nJuly was very\
    \ similar in all points but, after this date, more water began to be applied at\
    \ T1 and less\nwater at CR1. In 2017, the irrigation season started a month earlier\
    \ and the initial irrigations diﬀered at\nthe diﬀerent points until converging\
    \ in August. From that date onwards, more water was applied at\nCR3 than the rest\
    \ of the points until the end of the irrigation campaign. As water volumes were\
    \ higher\nin 2017, the maximum and minimum limits are also higher as they were\
    \ established as percentages\nof the campaign schedule. The irrigation pattern\
    \ was diﬀerent at each CR point, with the greatest\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n12\
    \ of 23\ndiﬀerences observed in Phase II in the case of CR1, CR2 and CR3. In the\
    \ case of CR4, the pattern was\ndiﬀerent from the rest: more water was applied\
    \ in Phase II and less in Phase III. In summary, the water\napplied generally\
    \ followed the same pattern in the diﬀerent control points in 2016, while in 2017\
    \ there\nwas a change in trend during Phase II.\nTable 4. Irrigation supplied\

    \ Soil Water Content\nWith respect to soil water content, Table 5 speciﬁes the\
    \ high and low reference values of each of\nthe moisture sensors during the years\
    \ 2016 and 2017. IRRIX establishes two parameters for each sensor:\na high reference\
    \ (ﬁeld capacity, FC) and a low reference (in deﬁcit irrigation conditions). The\
    \ high\nreference represents the value recorded by that sensor under soil FC conditions,\
    \ and this value can\nbe obtained out of season after rain. The low reference\
    \ is determined for each sensor at the driest\nvalue recorded every day. A more\
    \ detailed description can be found in Millán et al. [28] of how IRRIX\ndetermines\
    \ the high and low reference for each sensor. These high and low reference values\
    \ serve to\nreduce the variability between the sensors and to obtain homogeneous\
    \ reference points for the diﬀerent\nsensors. It can be seen in Table 6 that the\
    \ high reference value of each sensor was higher in 2016 than in\n2017, with the\
    \ exception of sensors 1 (S1) and 3 (S3) located in CR1 and sensor 10 (S10) in\
    \ CR2. As for\nthe low reference, the values are lower in 2016 than in 2017 except\
    \ for the sensors that are located\nin position A at 0.60 m in CR1 and CR2 and\
    \ sensor 12 (S12) in CR3. The references established for\neach sensor changed\
    \ every year, as IRRIX is a dynamic system that adapts to the conditions of each\n\
    campaign and even to changes during the campaign itself.\nTable 5. High and low\

    \ conditions of deﬁcit irrigation. The high and low\nreference values of each\
    \ of the sensors correspond to the beginning of the irrigation campaign in the\
    \ diﬀerent years.\nThe temporal evolution of soil water content (SWC) is presented\
    \ in Figure 6 for control point\nCR2 in 2017. With respect to the position under\
    \ dripper (A) at 0.3 m depth (Figure 6a,b), the sensors\nfollowed the same overall\
    \ pattern. These sensors are very sensitive to irrigation, responding quickly\n\
    even to low volumes of rain or irrigation. Furthermore, these sensors had a very\
    \ marked response\namplitude between minimums before irrigation and maximums at\
    \ the end of irrigation. It can be seen\nin Figure 6b that, in Phase II, sensor\
    \ 8 (S8) presented a diﬀerent behavior to sensor 6 (S6) (Figure 6a),\nas the S8\
    \ responded to applied irrigation during a certain period of time. This result\
    \ may be attributable\nto the place where the emitter was located because of the\
    \ spatial variability of the moisture distribution\nin the soil.\nProbes located\
    \ at 0.6 m depth (Figure 6c,d) showed less diﬀerence between the maximum and\n\
    minimum and also responded quickly to small amounts of rain as did the probes\
    \ located at 0.3 m.\nThe two sensors (S7 and S9) showed diﬀerent behavior throughout\
    \ the study period. Normally, sensors\ninstalled in the same position follow the\
    \ same pattern but, as sometimes these sensors show a totally\ndiﬀerent behavior,\
    \ consideration needs to be given to sensor-to-sensor variability. This variability\
    \ is\ngreater in the case of localized irrigation, since wet bulbs are formed\
    \ around the emitters while the rest\nof the soil may be only slightly aﬀected\
    \ or not at all by the irrigation. Due to the existence of spatial\nvariability,\
    \ sensor variability can be aggravated in the case of woody crops since the moisture\
    \ sensors\nneed to be installed in the area of the bulb where there may be more\
    \ roots [25,28]. Kang et al. [51]\nindicated that the size of the root can aﬀect\
    \ the readings of FDR sensors. A careful interpretation is\ntherefore required\
    \ when FDR sensors are used to determine soil moisture content. Sensor variability\n\
    can also be due to changes that occur in the dielectric properties of the soil\
    \ [52] or other soil properties,\nespecially bulk density and the existence of\
    \ macropores.\nThe sensors installed in position A at 0.3 m depth presented a\
    \ range of very diﬀerent measurements.\nFor example, the S6 had maximum values\
    \ of 0.447 m3/m3 with a measurement range (the measurement\nrange is the sensor\
    \ reading at the beginning and end of the irrigation season) of about 0.371 to\n\
    0.389 m3/m3 while the S8 presented maximum values of 0.385 m3/m3 with a measurement\
    \ range of\n0.331 to 0.334 m3/m3. At 0.6 m depth, the measurement ranges between\
    \ sensors located under the same\nposition also varied considerably. The S7 had\
    \ maximum values of 0.419 m3/m3 with a measurement\nrange of about 0.309 to 0.338\
    \ m3/m3 and the S9 presented maximum values of 0.394 m3/m3 with a\nmeasurement\
    \ range of 0.213 to 0.307 m3/m3. It must be considered that as sensor depth increases\
    \ the\npresence of water in the lower layers is greater, which may be due to the\
    \ arrival of water from other\npoints. In addition, soil moisture ﬂuctuations\
    \ decreased with depth. Mittelbach et al. [53] established\nthat 10HS sensors\
    \ do not capture the daily soil moisture content ﬂuctuations for moist conditions\
    \ and\nthat soil moisture ﬂuctuations are almost negligible at 0.25 m depth and\
    \ below.\nIn the position between drippers (B) at 0.30 m depth (Figure 6e), the\
    \ sensors responded to low\napplications of rain or irrigation. It can be seen\
    \ how sensor 10 (S10) was sensitive to small irrigation\namounts and showed a\
    \ greater amplitude between the maximum and minimum during the study\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 2526\n15 of 23\nperiod. In the case of S10, the values of the measurements\
    \ of the 10HS probes did not surpass\n0.371 m3/m3. This may mainly be due to the\
    \ creation of preferential channels in the soil and, because\nof this, the water\
    \ from one or more drippers moving to the place where the sensor is located.\n\
    It should be noted that Phase I corresponds to a period of mild stress, and a\
    \ slight decrease in the\namount of water in the soil is observed in Figure 6a,c,d\
    \ and a more pronounced decrease in Figure 6b.\nIn Phase II there is a clear decrease\
    \ in SWC in Figure 6a–d. In Phase III there is a delay in the response\nto the\
    \ increase in irrigation that coincides with the onset of rainfall.\nTable 6.\

    \ and Productivity\nFigure 7 shows the Ψstem evolution in 2015 (Figure 7a), 2016\
    \ (Figure 7b) and 2017 (Figure 7c) for\nall control points. A declining trend\
    \ of Ψstem can be seen in Phases I and II as the irrigation season\nadvanced,\
    \ followed by an increase in Phase III to the end of the irrigation campaign.\
    \ In 2015 (Figure 7a),\nwhen all the areas were irrigated according to the farmer’s\
    \ criteria, there was a marked diﬀerence in\nΨstem at the diﬀerent control points.\
    \ At all points, Ψstem was above the reference threshold value in\nall three phases\
    \ (shown by a horizontal dotted line in all the ﬁgures), except in zone T2 which\
    \ fell\nbelow it on several days in Phase II. The highest values, recorded in\
    \ Phase I at the beginning of spring,\nwere around −0.66 MPa, −0.87 MPa, −0.79\
    \ MPa, −0.70 MPa and −0.57 MPa for T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and\nCR3, respectively. The\
    \ minimum Ψstem was at mid-summer in Phase II with average values of −1.67,\n\
    −2.43 MPa, −1.12 MPa, −1.22 MPa and −1.67 MPa in T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3, respectively.\n\
    In 2016 (Figure 7b), when introducing the expert criteria for irrigation scheduling,\
    \ the differences\nin water status between the different control points throughout\
    \ the entire irrigation season decreased,\nbut especially in Phase II. Higher\
    \ Ψstem values were obtained in CR1 and CR2 than the other control\npoints throughout\
    \ the irrigation season, while CR3 presented the lowest Ψstem values of around\
    \ −2.36 and\n−2.69 MPa reaching the pre-established threshold in Phase II and\
    \ Phase III, respectively. T1 and T2 also\nremained above the pre-established\
    \ limits throughout the irrigation season, except for the days on\nwhich CR3 remained\
    \ below the pre-established limits in Phase II and Phase III, because there was\
    \ an\nirrigation failure.\nIn 2017, the AIS achieved a greater adjustment at CR1\
    \ and CR2 to the Ψstem targets. CR4 had\na similar evolution of Ψstem to the other\
    \ control points. Greater homogeneity in crop water status\nbetween the diﬀerent\
    \ points was achieved in 2017 than in 2016.\nThe Ψstem values where AIS was carried\
    \ out followed the same pattern as the Ψstem values in\nT1 and T2 (NAIS) in 2016\
    \ and 2017, despite the application of diﬀerent irrigation volumes, due to\ndosage\
    \ readjustment made by the IRRIX system with the information provided by the soil\
    \ probes.\nThe typical spring rainfall and the accumulation of water reserves\
    \ in the soil during autumn and winter\ncan make it diﬃcult to induce water stress,\
    \ and the Ψstem values can sometimes exceed the proposed\nthresholds during the\
    \ irrigation season [13,54–60]. In addition, the algorithm used in the areas where\n\
    irrigation was carried out automatically showed a good response to the RDI strategies.\
    \ While some\nresearchers have previously worked with a web platform whose algorithm\
    \ results from a combination\nof the water balance with feedback from soil moisture\
    \ sensors to perform automatic irrigation [24–26],\nthis is the ﬁrst time that\
    \ the algorithms used to establish the automated irrigation have been shown to\n\
    respond well to RDI in an olive grove, maintaining the water status of the plant.\n\

    \ day of the year.\nThe results for yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield\
    \ and water productivity (WP) for olives\nand for oil are presented in Table 6.\
    \ In 2015, signiﬁcant diﬀerences between diﬀerent control points\nwere found in\
    \ yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield and WP, with CR2 the least productive\
    \ and\nwith signiﬁcant diﬀerences with T2. In 2016, CR1 and CR3 showed no signiﬁcant\
    \ diﬀerences in yield\nwith respect to irrigation carried out with expert supervision.\
    \ However, CR2 had lower yield, number\nof fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield\
    \ and WP oil yield than the other control points, which could be\ndue to alternation\
    \ in crop yield between more and less productive years as is common in this cultivar.\n\
    With regard to 2017, yield increased in all control points, with CR2 the most\
    \ productive. In addition,\nthe WP yield and the WP oil yield also increased notably\
    \ compared to the previous two years, with\n52 kg of olives and about 8.5 kg of\
    \ oil produced per cubic meter of water provided in CR2. This can be\nattributed\
    \ to the lower crop load level in CR2 in 2015 and 2016. The number of fruits per\
    \ tree also\nincreased with respect to previous years, being signiﬁcantly higher\
    \ in CR1 and CR2. No statistically\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerences were found in oil yield\
    \ at the diﬀerent control points.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n19 of 23\nIntroducing\
    \ the strategy recommended by the expert led to an increase in yield and a tendency\
    \ to\nploy homogenization in 2017, especially with respect to oil production which\
    \ showed no statistically\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerences between the various control points.\
    \ Moriana et al. [12] previously demonstrated\nthat the RDI strategy used in this\
    \ experiment and for this crop presented signiﬁcant diﬀerences in yield\nor oil\
    \ yield with respect to a control treatment in which the trees were irrigated\
    \ with 100% ETc.\nThe heterogeneity of a commercial plot irrigated with the same\
    \ criteria causes diﬀerences between\nthe various plants on the plot. By characterizing\
    \ this variability and considering these diﬀerences for\nirrigation scheduling,\
    \ the use of RDI strategies has been shown to lead to greater plot homogenization.\n\
    This is of great importance for the use of automated irrigation systems where\
    \ the selection of the control\nzone(s) that will govern decision making is important.\
    \ Automatic irrigation has been shown to be\ncapable of simulating expert judgement\
    \ in the application of RDI strategies based on crop water status.\nThe system\
    \ improved its performance after the ﬁrst year of adjustment. Recent studies have\
    \ reported\nthat RDI strategies can be advantageous in SHD olive orchards in terms\
    \ of reducing water applications,\ndecreasing excessive tree vigor, improving\
    \ irradiance environments and increasing yield, oil quality\nand water-use eﬃciency\
    \ [1,6,61–63]. The results of the present study provide evidence that an RDI\n\
    strategy can be applied through a DSS in a plot of SHD olive orchards with no\
    \ negative eﬀects on yield,\nnumber of fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield or\
    \ WP oil yield, if there is prior spatial characterization\nand pre-established\
    \ criteria for decision making. Characterization of the spatial variability of\
    \ the plot\nis very important in the case of a hedgerow olive grove, since an\
    \ area with greater vigor is not always\nrelated to higher productivity [40].\
    \ In addition, a better irrigation management in an area with lower\nwater retention\
    \ capacity (sandy soil) allows more balanced vegetative growth, which is necessary\
    \ for\nhedgerow olive grove productivity [64]. Phase II is considered the most\
    \ important for an automatic\nirrigation system, and adjustment of the deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation dosages determined by a ﬁeld expert can be\nbetter controlled by\
    \ an automatic system analyzing crop water needs and soil moisture. During this\n\
    phase, plant water status can be better controlled in more unfavorable zones,\
    \ enabling all ﬁeld zones to\nenjoy the correct water status.\n4. Conclusions\n\
    This work aimed to evaluate and develop an automated irrigation protocol in a\
    \ hedgerow\nolive orchard using the IRRIX platform. In this case, the device had\
    \ to simulate a recommended\nirrigation strategy for this type of plantation that\
    \ included the use of regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\nThe characterization of the\
    \ spatial variability was useful to locate the control points.\nThe automatic\
    \ irrigation scheduling simulated the expert criterion, adapting to the speciﬁc\n\
    conditions of the control point where the soil sensors were installed. The total\
    \ amount of manually\nand automatically applied irrigation water was similar at\
    \ the various control points, but not its\ndistribution as the DSS estimated the\
    \ water needs by combining the water balance method with a\nfeedback mechanism\
    \ based on the moisture sensor readings. In addition, the DSS was able to establish\n\
    an RDI strategy which induced moderate-to-severe stress during Phase II of the\
    \ crop in the parts of the\nplot with the most unfavorable conditions for the\
    \ hedgerow (places with high vigor and low ECa).\nThe adoption of an appropriate\
    \ RDI strategy in an SHD olive grove enabled homogenization of plot\nyield, with\
    \ a tendency to increase production. The automatic irrigation allowed irrigation\
    \ management\nwith minimum human intervention.\nThe results obtained with the\
    \ system improved in the third year, when adjustments were made\nbased on the\
    \ information collected in the previous year. The automated irrigation has proven\
    \ to be\nable to adapt to the particular conditions of the place where it is installed\
    \ and to the diﬀerent growth\nstages of the crop, thus improving the key eﬃciency\
    \ parameters.\nAutomatic irrigation scheduling is of particular interest in the\
    \ case of olive groves. In this\ncrop, monitoring stem water potentials at commercial\
    \ level for crop phase dosage readjustment is\ncomplicated by the strongly negative\
    \ values that can be attained but which cannot be measured with a\npump-up pressure\
    \ chamber.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n20 of 23\nAlthough the results were encouraging,\
    \ further studies are required to improve certain aspects of\nthe system, particularly\
    \ relating to the integration of the NDVI and ECa measurements into the DSS.\n\

    system, China’s largest, is one of the world’s most important examples of sustainable
    agropolitan development, maintained by a relatively decentralised system of governance
    that minimises bureaucratic oversight and depends on significant local autonomy
    at many scales down to the household. At its historic core in the Chengdu Plain,
    the system has supported over 2000 years of near-continuously stable urban culture,
    as well as some of the world’s highest sustained long-term per-hectare productivity
    and diversity of grain and other crops, especially considering its high population
    density, forest cover, general biodiversity and flood management success. During
    the past decade, rapid urban expansion has turned the Chengdu Plain from a net
    grain exporter into a grain importer, and has radically transformed its productive
    functioning and distinctive scattered settlement pattern, reorganising much of
    the landscape into larger, corporately-managed farms, and more concentrated and
    infrastructure-intensive settlements of non-farming as well as farming households.
    Community-scale case studies of spatial-morphological and household socio-economic
    variants on the regional trend help to articulate what is at stake. Neither market-driven
    ‘laissez-faire’ rural development nor local state-driven spatial settlement consolidation
    and corporatisation of production seem to correlate well with important factors
    of resilience: landscape heterogeneity; crop diversity and food production; permaculture;
    and flexibility in household independence and choice of livelihood. Management
    of the irrigation system should be linked to community-based agricultural landscape
    preservation and productive dwelling, as sources of adaptive capacity crucial
    to the social-ecological resilience of the city-region, the nation and perhaps
    all humanity. Introduction As China urbanises, a key developmental policy debate
    centres on the question ‘who will till the land?’ (Hayward, 2017). On one side
    is a ‘grand narrative’ that favours agribusiness, based on economic models of
    urban agglomeration and various assumptions about the universal application of
    Euro-American techno-colonial developmental history. It envisions farm labour
    as wage-earning not land-owning; farm land as large in areal units; and farm ownership,
    investment and management as centralised in city-based firms. Opposed is a looser
    collection of positions that favour family farms or various cooperative arrangements
    and some form of local collective ownership. These positions share a concern to
    preserve peasants’ control over profits, land and their own labour; and point
    to the uniqueness of local places and histories. Related to this debate is the
    question: where will land be cultivated? The pursuit of agglomeration typically
    discounts the value of existing long-evolved, highly productive, tightly coupled
    urban–rural socio-ecosystems. However, even studies and policies that promote
    sustainability, social justice and food security tend to treat the loss of cultivated
    land to urban expansion as a challenge to increase the density and decrease the
    footprint of urban expansion, and/or to replace lost cultivated land with new
    cultivated land elsewhere (Angel, 2012; Webster, 2011). In China, the state’s
    presumed ‘ability to implement massive programs that can infiltrate every aspect
    of society rapidly’ is seen as key to achieving sustainability, by orchestrating
    on a large scale the necessary transfers of land use and applications of new green
    infrastructure technology (Liu, 2010: 50). This article suggests that the notion
    of agropolitanism, reinvigorated by the concept of resilience, provides an historically
    comparative way to relate local agro-ecologies to global urbanisation and the
    expansion of particular cities. Regionally specific spatial and historical details
    of a long-evolved tightly coupled human–natural environment challenge conventional
    definitions of both sustainable settlement form and efficient land use – especially
    in periurban areas with historically dense populations and traditionally high
    agricultural productivity. This functional approach to valuing historic features
    of settlement and landscape form focuses on agro-ecological communities’ spatial
    resilience (Cumming, 2011a, 2011b), to understand how specific morphological attributes
    at different scales have enabled systems to adapt and persist at particular moments
    of historical crisis or disturbance. The article presents a case of resilient
    agropolitanism in China: the Chengdu Plain in Sichuan and its associated Dujiangyan
    irrigation system. Morphologically, the landscape is distinguished by the irrigation
    system’s near absence of dams and levees, as well as a peculiar dispersed-but-densely-populated
    pattern of settlement, consisting of small clusters of forest-and-bamboo-shaded
    dwellings called linpan, rather than the nucleated villages typical of other densely
    populated, high-yield agricultural landscapes. The mechanisms of resilience in
    this system, and the historical crises that tested them, have been described by
    this author and his collaborators elsewhere (Whiting et al., 2019). This article
    frames the contemporary global significance of the case; focuses on the attributes
    that seem to have persisted; discusses how rapid urban expansion and agricultural
    land use restructuring now affects them; and finally reflects on what functions
    they may continue to serve at various scales of environmental and socio-cultural
    change, from the household to the region and perhaps beyond. Field research by
    the author and his local and international collaborators and students since 2010,
    as well as other published empirical studies simultaneously underway in the region,
    help to characterise the impacts of current development in the Plain. Original
    findings are drawn from collaborations led by the University of Washington and
    Sichuan University in coordination with the Chengdu Municipal Urban–Rural Planning
    Bureau’s Rural Planning Section in 2012–2014, and in coordination with the Sandaoyan
    Town government, Pidu District (formerly Pi County), in 2017–2018. The research
    involved: informal individual or small-group interviews and discussions with official
    planners at the municipal and town levels, governmental leaders at the town and
    village levels and with villagers themselves; surveys and mapping of land use,
    land cover and settlement form; household questionnaire surveys; academic planning
    and design studios to envision possible futures; and academic workshops with researchers,
    professionals, activists and officials. Rather than report this work comprehensively
    and in detail – much of it is described more fully in student theses and reports
    cited below – this article presents agropolitanism and resilience as a two-fold
    framework for interpreting the broad challenges and opportunities of urban expansion
    in China and other populous, long-settled and highly food-productive regions;
    and then highlights key findings from Chengdu to describe the socio-ecological
    significance of agrarian landscape and settlement morphology in those contexts.
    Agropolitanism, resilience and China: New and not-so-new challenges to urban agglomeration
    economies In 1985, John Friedmann himself ‘revisited’ the concept of agropolitanism
    he and Mike Douglass defined in 1978 as a countervailing vision to the dominant
    development strategy in the World Bank and Asian non-Communist nations, which
    concentrated investments in industry and urban ‘growth poles’ (Friedmann, 1979,
    1981, 1985; Friedmann and Douglass, 1978). Measured in GNP, this strategy succeeded,
    but it also exacerbated income disparities and unhealthy forms of political-economic
    dependency within and between nations, devalued and de-territorialised agricultural
    labour and led to increased population density and concentrations of poverty in
    rural areas, as well as widespread environmental degradation (Friedmann, 1985:
    177–183). The agropolitan alternative acknowledged the special problems of urbanisation
    in densely populated, intensively cultivated, agriculturally productive city-regions.
    It proposed to re-focus investment on rural communities and agriculture, under
    a decentralised system of self-governing territories and a greater degree of communal
    control over farmland. Counter to agglomeration economics, agropolis (‘city-in-the-fields’)
    emphasised domestic food self-sufficiency and protection of domestic small-scale
    labour-intensive and smallholder production against competition from international
    large-scale capital-intensive enterprise. It involved a re-balancing of ‘life
    space’ with ‘economic space’, and territorial values with globally integrative
    ones (Friedmann, 1988: Ch. 2), and envisioned: a system of governance and planning
    that is ecologically specific … in which effective power for decisions is devolved
    to agropolitan districts to enable them to take advantage of ecological opportunities
    where they exist (while being mindful of ecological constraints), to harness the
    richly personal, embodied learning of local inhabitants to the more formal, abstract
    knowledge of specialists … and to encourage a growing sense of identification
    of local people with the enlarged communal space of the agropolis. (Friedmann,
    1985: 184) Friedmann’s articulation of agropolitanism aligns with the concept
    of social-ecological resilience in the following respects: it advocated the appropriate
    matching of scales of decision-making and regulation to the environmental scales
    of their impact (Cumming et al., 2006; Ostrom, 1990); accommodating diversity
    and ensuring a degree of modularity at various scales (Scheffer et al., 2012);
    acknowledging the importance of buffers against disturbance (Walker and Salt,
    2006); and strengthening self-organisation, social learning and ‘tight’ feedback
    mechanisms (Scott, 2013). Since the 1980s, the ecological aspects of the agropolitan
    vision have only gained relevance due to the greater awareness of climate change,
    geohazards and loss of biodiversity, and overall area of agricultural land (Alberti,
    2016; Bren d’Amour et al., 2017; Cabell and Oelofse, 2012). China held a special
    place in the formation of the agropolitan vision. Up until the 1980s, a number
    of features of China’s development were particularly inspiring to agropolitanism’s
    proponents: the country’s long history of integrated governance of cities and
    countryside, and then the Maoist emphasis on multi-scaled self-reliance and local
    food supply, local collective ownership of rural land, and investments in agricultural
    production and rural industrialisation (Caldwell, 1977: 109; Friedmann, 1985:
    182–183, n. 116 and 117; Murphey, 1980; Salter, 1976; Whyte, 2010: 2–3; You, 1981).
    Even after Mao’s death, policies of the first decade of Reform and Opening (1978–1988)
    accorded with the agropolitan principle that ‘to modernize an economy requires,
    as a first step, a strengthened rural base’ (Friedmann, 1985: 166). The central
    government also continued the strict policy to preserve arable land for national
    self-sufficiency in grain. After the 1980s, however, the country’s development
    trajectory diverged from this agropolitan path, and pursued instead a hyper-urbanisation-led
    growth through the 1990s. The degree of planned-ness of such phenomenal development
    at the urban edge is one of China’s most exceptional features (Angel, 2012: 108).
    By the mid-2000s the resultant ‘three agricultural problems’ (sannong wenti) –
    the degradation of: (1) rural incomes and social conditions for farmers, (2) productivity
    and value of agriculture, and (3) health and vitality of rural environments –
    became a major concern of central government (Shen and Shen, 2018; Whyte, 2010).
    Still, over the past decade, despite policies and programmes to reduce rural taxation
    and redirect investments into the countryside, macroeconomic policy remains focused
    on maintaining industrial output, extending urban infrastructure, increasing domestic
    consumption of urban goods and services, centralising governance and ‘recasting’
    rural landscapes and residents as subjects of urban consumption and urban planning
    (Abramson, 2016; Bray, 2013; Chen et al., 2017; Rosenberg, 2013). The imperative
    to achieve quick, visible results for local leaders resulted in massive expenditures
    on demolition and construction, disrupting social relations, trapping all actors
    in webs of dependency and precarity and inhibiting participation in communal decision-making
    by the mass of rural residents (Looney, 2015; Lora-Wainwright, 2014). China has
    become as important a focus for research on urban agglomeration as it once was
    for articulating agropolitanism (Au and Henderson, 2006; Leman, 2005). Official
    support for the consolidation of farms and corporatisation of agriculture also
    remains strong, as part of the administration’s broader ‘new-type urbanisation’
    (xinxing chengzhenhua) policy (Looney and Rithmire, 2016), and as a result of
    the large-scale, broad-brush implementation of the nation’s grain self-sufficiency
    policy (Zhan, 2017b). Agribusinesses involving a wide range of landholding and
    labour arrangements challenge collective land control and smallholder farming,
    and raise the spectre of a new class of landless rural proletarians (Zhang and
    Donaldson, 2008). The national policy to preserve a gross minimum of cultivated
    land has also led to an overall shift of farming away from the most fertile, water-rich
    regions (mostly around the major population centres) to lower quality sites in
    hillier, formerly forested and semi-arid terrain, in order to accommodate urban
    expansion (Jiang et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2017; Zhan and Huang, 2017). The increase
    in built land cover, both in rural settlements and at the edge of expanding cities,
    also impinges on key sites of biodiversity (Güneralp et al., 2015). Afforestation
    efforts, while showing gains on a national scale after decades of deforestation,
    are largely viewed as incompatible with traditional small-scale pastoral or agrarian
    practices (despite evidence to the contrary), and have also largely focused on
    economically peripheral environments unsuitable for trees rather than on restoring
    previously forested areas (Ahrends et al., 2017; Trac et al., 2007; Urgenson et
    al., 2014). In response to these challenges, the Chinese political discourses
    of ‘new-type urbanisation’ and ‘ecological civilisation’ provide at least a rhetorical
    space to (re)articulate an agropolitan vision of human flourishing. To reflect
    global changes that have taken place since the 1980s, including problems which
    the original articulation of agropolitanism did not identify, such as deceleration
    of rural population growth and the ‘hollowing out’ of rural communities, the vision
    needs to account more for rural households’ increased spatial mobility and diversity
    of income sources. All manner of flows – capital, labour, information, goods and
    services – have accelerated. The tasks of balancing these flows with territorial
    governance, revaluing agricultural labour and products, accounting for ecosystem
    services and strengthening or building community relations have all become more
    urgent and difficult. Those aspects of the agropolitan vision that describe an
    adaptive but locally accountable system of governance are especially relevant
    to this dynamic situation. This is what agropolitanism looks like: The Chengdu
    Plain’s agroecosystem in global and national perspective The places that inspired
    the agropolitan vision, and which offer the most potential for maintaining the
    world’s rice supply (Smil, 2005), are the urbanising wet rice-growing alluvial
    plains and deltas of Monsoon Asia. The Sichuan Basin is the only one that does
    not include an estuary, and is therefore unaffected by changes in coastline or
    water salinity. It is also farther from the sea than any other comparably extensive
    and dense centre of settlement in the world. As in these other regions, the most
    agriculturally productive part of the Sichuan Basin has densities exceeding 30,000
    pop./km2 in its oldest urban centre, Chengdu, and more than 1000 pop./km2 in the
    surrounding countryside, which also includes a long-established network of secondary
    cities (Figure 1).1 Thanks to the feat of hydraulic engineering at Dujiangyan,
    there may be no better poster child of sustainability-as-abundance than the Chengdu
    Plain, long known in China as ‘the land of heavenly abundance’ (tianfu zhiguo)
    and the land whose ‘people are distant from floods and draughts, and know no famine’
    (shuihan congren, buzhi jijin). Figure 1. Map of China’s population density by
    county, 2006, in relation to the Heihe–Tengchong Line, Sichuan provincial boundary
    and location of the Chengdu Plain. This area, the West Sichuan/Chengdu Plain,
    is the flattest part of the basin, stretching in a north-east–south-west direction
    along the edge of the Himalayan massif, and sloping from the mountains towards
    the south-east at a gradient of 0.4 per cent. The Plain’s ability to support a
    large population is famously attributed to the delta-like Dujiangyan flood control
    and gravitation irrigation system, built around 256 BC, and still operating today
    in a much-expanded area of about 6700 km2, including the central part of the Plain
    and beyond. The greater area of all rural counties and urban districts that intersect
    with the Plain amounts to about 22,900 km2 – a length of 250 km and a width of
    85 km – with a population of about 17 million, of whom about 7.75 million are
    agricultural, working some 7540 km2 of cultivated land (Sichuan Sheng RenDa, 2011).2
    The most densely populated agricultural communities have over 1200 pop./km2, with
    household farms averaging only 0.20 ha of cultivated land. Historically, population
    densities in rural counties on the Plain were higher even than in the urban core
    county itself, and as cities grew during the 20th century the rural population
    also grew, approximately doubling, and farm size decreased accordingly (Buck et
    al., 1943; Li, 2007: 460, Table 3). The introduction of hybrid crop types and
    chemical pesticides and fertilisers allowed yields to keep pace with the population,
    especially for grain, which increased by the mid-1980s to a yield of six tons
    of rice and three tons of other grain per hectare (Chengdu Municipal Bureau of
    Statistics, 2014.; Bramall, 1993; Willmott, 1989: 144). However, even before 1950,
    long-sustained grain yields in the Plain were already a phenomenal 3 tons/ha,
    produced on less than 60 per cent of cropland that also grew rapeseed, market
    vegetables, tobacco, opium poppies and a diversity of other crops and forest products
    for market or home consumption (Buchanan, 1970: 173, Table 6; Buck et al., 1937:
    33, 209, 211; Guo, 1993: 421, Table 21; Wilson and Sargent, 1913: 109). Compared
    with the Yangzi and Pearl River deltas – China’s two other regions with comparable
    productivity, population density, efficient near-closed circles of inputs and
    surplus outputs of empire-wide importance – the Chengdu Plain both was older in
    these respects by at least 1000 years and also retained this status long after
    those other regions either experienced the diminishing returns of agricultural
    ‘involution’ or shifted resources to urban industrialisation (Ellis and Wang,
    1997; Elvin, 2004).3,4 Nationally, Mao-era rural production and ‘green revolution’
    technology reversed many late 19th- and early 20th-century losses in grain production,
    but this gain depended on less sustainable practices of water and industrial agrochemical
    use, and came at the expense of biodiversity. Total grain production peaked in
    1996, and rice has declined by more than 15% since 1998 (Liu et al., 2005). Today,
    all of the historically famous naturally abundant (tian fu) regions except the
    Chengdu Plain face crises of ecological health and rural livelihoods, including
    the Wei River valley around Xi’an, the central valley around Taiyuan, Shanxi and
    the Yangzi delta (Xu Hui, 2017). Among China’s current most productive agricultural
    regions – the Pearl and Yangzi River deltas, the North China Plain and the Manchurian
    Plain – the Sichuan basin remains exceptionally diverse and patchy in the mix
    of cropland and natural vegetation, and in the mix of single-, double- and triple-cropped
    land, even with the application there of some of the same productivity-boosting
    agrochemical practices seen elsewhere in the country (Bramall, 1995; Li et al.,
    2014). However, the past 15 years of rapid urban growth, plus increasing relative
    profit margins for non-grain crops, may finally have made the Chengdu Plain also
    a net importer of grain for the first time in its history (Shi Ju Zhi Ku et al.,
    2014).5 Urban built area in Chengdu municipality increased five-fold between 1986
    and 2011, and four-fold elsewhere in the Plain (Yuan and Yuan, 2013). Cultivated
    land accordingly decreased, by 3603 km2 between 1991 and 2011 across all the municipalities
    that occupy the Plain. Grain productivity in the municipality of Chengdu peaked
    in 1998 at over 9 tons/ha, declined to 8 tons/ha in 2008 and then dropped precipitously
    to 6 tons/ha by 2013. In order to reduce the loss of cultivated land to urban
    growth, as well as to manage better the impacts of that growth on rural communities,
    Chengdu municipality piloted a number of innovative Urban–Rural Coordinated Development
    programmes (Ye and LeGates, 2013). These included increasing social and infrastructure
    services to outlying towns, establishing a system of rural planning offices and
    eliminating the distinction between urban and rural hukou for all Chengdu residents.
    The municipality also established a grant programme to villages for infrastructure
    and environmental management projects, economic development and cultural programmes
    determined through participatory budgeting (Cabannes and Ming, 2013). The agropolitan
    tendencies of these programmes, however, have been offset by many of the agglomeration-focused
    tendencies and associated problems described above for the nation as a whole (Sorace,
    2014; Wilczak, 2017; Zhan, 2017a; Zhang and Wu, 2017a). The most celebrated of
    the programmes was a transfer-of-development-rights (TDR)-like system to conserve
    gross acreage of farmland. The system required developers seeking to build on
    farmland to bid for ‘quotas’ of such land that were available through the creation
    of new farmland in rural areas elsewhere in the municipality (Wang, 2011b). Rural
    households would relocate from existing housing to more compact settlements so
    that their former house plots could be converted to new farmland, which could
    then be sold in the form of development rights to an equal area of land in more
    marketable locations, usually on the urban edge. The price of the quotas would
    cover the cost of rehousing the rural residents. The programme thus provided a
    financing mechanism for realising two of the ‘three concentrations’: concentration
    of agricultural land use and of rural settlement, which is considered to be more
    efficient for service provision and for residents accessing non-farm work, and
    also less ecologically impactful (Huang et al., 2013; Peng, 2015; Zhang and Wu,
    2017b). Such considerations, however, have not taken into account either the Plain’s
    existing exceptional density (despite its scattered settlement form), or the variability
    of agricultural quality in land; quotas are a standard representation of simple
    land area (Xiao, 2014). It also quickly became evident that the benefits of the
    programme to rural communities depended on a highly speculative real estate market
    in order to cover their costs. Pi County planned to relocate nearly 200,000 people
    from scattered house plots on nearly 3000 ha to new more concentrated settlements
    on just over 1173 ha – thus clearing nearly 1800 ha of land for new cultivation
    and capitalisation through the quota market (Pi County People’s Government, 2011)
    (Figures 2 and 3). This was almost all to be complete by 2016 and, as of winter
    2012–2013, 45 new villages were already built or under construction, to re-house
    nearly 60,000 people (Ye and LeGates, 2013: 267).6 Figure 2. Existing conditions
    land use map of Pi County, 2012. Inset in upper-right shows the municipality of
    Chengdu and its sub-municipal jurisdictions (counties and districts). Large, darker
    shaded areas are urbanised county seat or town centre developments, including
    industry and urban housing. The built-up urban centre of Chengdu is in the lower-right
    corner and to the south-east. Smaller, lighter-shaded patches scattered across
    the landscape are rural housing clusters, mostly linpan (Pi County People’s Government,
    2011). Figure 3. Plan for farmers’ concentrated housing estates to replace nearly
    all linpan dwellings in Pi County, 2012. Loss of cultivated land to urban uses
    and construction is only one reason for Chengdu’s reduced food productivity, especially
    grain. In parallel with Urban–Rural Coordinated Development, the region pursued
    an increasingly globalised market in agricultural and industrial products (Taylor
    et al., 2016). Per capita grain production in Pi County dropped dramatically from
    67.7 tons in 1994 to 17.9 tons in 2012 as agricultural production shifted to less
    fertile peripheral counties, mirroring national trends at the metropolitan scale.7
    The programme to swap new urban construction land for new cultivated land may
    have accelerated this shift. Even where land remains cultivated, grain and other
    food crops have given way to planting that is more profitable in the short run,
    though at the cost of topsoil loss and changes to irrigation use and field division.
    Urban development across China created a new nation-wide market in the early 2000s
    for landscaping plants; the Chengdu Plain was an ideal hothouse-like environment
    for nurseries of trees and shrubs grown from seed or cuttings, or transplanted
    in their maturity from surrounding forests, to await further transplantation to
    cities near and far. Pi County became the prime location for nurseries, which
    require less labour input than rice and which have replaced many paddy fields.
    In 2010, Pi County also became the site for China’s westernmost factory of the
    Taiwan-based Foxconn corporation, the producer of Apple iPads and iPhones (Ngai
    and Chan, 2012). The factory and its associated Living Zone represented the largest
    foreign direct investment in Chengdu to that date, and required the demolition
    of 14 villages – a project actively promoted by higher-level government to spur
    further FDI. The Foxconn plant is emblematic of the kind of investment prize that
    growth poles are supposed to attract on their way to becoming world cities themselves:
    high-value, large-scale, capital-intensive manufacturing enterprises dependent
    on distant corporate control centres. Nevertheless, for another six years following
    the construction of the plant, Pi County remained a rural administrative territory.
    It was the closest county to the centre of Chengdu; neighbouring Wenjiang, whose
    agricultural fertility was historically considered second only to Pi County’s,
    had already been an urban district for seven years. In 2016, Pi County finally
    re-incorporated as Pidu District. For all these reasons, Pi County (hereafter
    referred to as Pidu District or Pidu) is the epicentre of the tension between
    the Chengdu Plain’s agropolitan and growth-pole functions. Pidu is the focus for
    the field research whose findings inform the following section, which examines
    at a smaller scale some of the impacts of recent developments on the Plain’s most
    essential elements of abundance and resilience. For our purposes, these include
    less the hydraulic system itself and more the downstream landscape of integrated
    water channels, fields and scattered woods-and-house-lot configurations. A clearer
    understanding of these impacts will help determine whether Chengdu’s Urban–Rural
    Coordinated Development policies reflect a drive primarily towards agropolis or
    metropolis, and if the latter, what opportunities exist to preserve, recover or
    reinvent agropolis in the Chengdu Plain. The Dujiangyan irrigation system and
    the linpan landscape as interconnected sources of resilience One of the great
    paradoxes of the Dujiangyan irrigated landscape is that it comprises China’s finest-grained
    land and water management system within its largest irrigation district. ‘Fine-grained’
    in this case means that a significant level of decision-making power is devolved
    onto individual households, even as collective decision-making and self-organisation
    exist at many levels matching the scale of decisions’ collective impact, as described
    by Ostrom (1990) for sustainable governance of common pool resources such as irrigation
    water. There are two components to land-water management in the Chengdu Plain:
    the flood-control and irrigation system itself, and the dispersed spatial form
    of agricultural settlement and production. The Dujiangyan system famously relies
    on dredging and guiding rather than dyking and damming, dispersing the water through
    a multi-levelled network of channels that ramify capillary-like across the plain
    – a ‘soft’ approach that correlates both with ancient Daoist philosophy and the
    most current flood-risk management thinking around the world (Needham et al.,
    1971: 249–250, 288–296; Wesselink et al., 2016).8 While the headworks and main
    branches required massive corvée labour and significant large-scale coordination
    at certain regular times of the year, most of the time the system can be maintained
    at highly local levels, even within a short distance of individual farmhouses
    (Wang, 2011a; Willmott, 1989; Yuan, 2016). Without levees to contain the water,
    moreover, localised flooding and the channels that feed the fields regularly recharge
    soil fertility with new silt (Richardson, 1945: 9). Most importantly, unlike dykes
    and levees, failures in the channelised system would not have widespread impacts.
    By comparison, the long-sustained successful dyke-and-polder-based systems of
    the Yangzi, Pearl and Red River deltas depended on a larger scale of mutual oversight
    and a deeper sense of unity, lest the negligence of one family bring disaster
    to many more (Elvin, 2004: 118). The communitarian solidarity required to maintain
    polders in the Yangzi and Pearl deltas is supported by the more nucleated spatial
    form of villages in those regions. In the Chengdu Plain, the more localised and
    distributed management appropriate to the channelised water system correlates
    with a more independent form of dwelling known as linpan or ‘wooded lot’ (Duan
    and Liu, 2004). The dwelling includes a U- or L-shaped house surrounding a courtyard
    for drying grain, which is surrounded in turn by part of a water channel and a
    grove of various trees and bamboo, each useful in a variety of ecological, microclimatic
    and productive ways. The bamboo, for example, provides shade and material for
    implements and construction, and through the accumulation of its fallen leaves
    over time it creates a small dyke around the home to protect against flooding.
    Linpan dwellings are as individually integrated with natural processes and the
    productive landscape as human habitation can be. They are sited in an infinite
    variety of arrangements, either singly or in clusters of various sizes, with usually
    not more than nine or ten households nearer the centre of the irrigated area in
    Pidu District, and gradually containing more households towards the edges of the
    system. They are sited at various distances, but usually among the fields rather
    than along roads, canals or around markets (Fang and Zhou, 2011). The linpan are
    thus essential elements of the Plain’s permacultural productivity: the lush biodiversity,
    patchy field mosaic and remarkable degree of forest cover that has impressed well-travelled
    visitors to the Plain for at least 150 years, even at a time when most of China’s
    densely populated landscapes suffered from severe deforestation (Bird, 1899; Shaw,
    1914; Von Richthofen, n.d.; Wilson and Sargent, 1913). The density of settlement
    overall in the Plain ensured that linpan dwellings were never far from each other
    or from markets, however dispersed. As Skinner (1977) described, social and economic
    life in the Chengdu Plain historically took the form of a spatio-temporal distribution
    of markets and multilateral networks of fraternal, temple and lineage organisations
    that integrated households with both the urban system as well as the natural ecology.
    Relative household autonomy derived from participation in the multiplicity of
    social organisations that balanced governmental power. This socio-ecological system
    contrasted sharply with the nucleated village systems of the North China Plain
    as well as the Yangzi delta (Huang, 1990; Huang et al., 1985: 64–66; Ruf, 1998:
    152). Although the Communist regime after 1949 eliminated most of the traditional
    non-governmental organisations that also played a role in land and water management,
    the fine grain of management that characterised the Plain’s agrarian communities
    has continued for most of the past half-century (Wang, 2011a). As throughout China,
    the size of administrative villages in the Chengdu Plain is determined primarily
    by the number of a village’s residents, not its territorial area, which varies
    depending on local ecological carrying capacity. Village populations are roughly
    consistent, mostly varying between 600 and 1000 households with 1500–3000 people,
    in 10–15 ‘villager small groups’ (cunmin xiaozu) or ‘agricultural associations’
    (nongye she), formerly the ‘production brigade’ (shengchan dui) of the Mao era.
    However, while these groupings in most intensively agrarian parts of China correspond
    with nucleated settlements, in the linpan landscape of scattered habitation, ‘village’
    is largely a governmental-administrative term. Village boundaries have little
    agro-ecological meaning; they do not correspond to watersheds, as is typical where
    topography is more pronounced, and they shift according to changes in higher-level
    bureaucratic–political organisation. The villager small group today is a more
    stable unit of collectivity than the administrative village. In the former Pi
    County at the heart of the historically irrigated part of the Plain, these groupings
    include 30–90 households, or 120–300 people, living on an average of 1.2 to 1.75
    mu (0.08–0.12 ha) per person, including all land for construction as well as cultivation.
    The exact size is determined by the numbers of population engaged directly in
    agriculture as opposed to other small enterprises, their households’ proximity
    to major roads and the configuration of fields, irrigation channels and linpan
    clusters themselves – but they generally reflect a consistent capacity for collective
    decision-making and hyper-local social leadership among families living with an
    unusual degree of spatial autonomy. Willmott, writing just before the region’s
    explosive urbanisation, suggested that bureaucracy and community in the Dujiangyan
    Irrigation District were not so easily distinguished as separate systems, but
    rather functioned in tandem resiliently because they were nested in scale and
    combined ‘centralized and decentralized political structures’ (Willmott, 1989:
    152–153). The scattered settlement pattern did not preclude large-scale collective
    effort, either for the traditional maintenance of the Dujiangyan headworks, or
    for the Mao-era construction of lateral canals and other projects that tripled
    the cultivated land area of the entire irrigation district, from 188,000 ha to
    588,667 ha, between 1949 and 1980 (Wu, 1983). The local planning policies to implement
    Urban–Rural Coordinated Development in Chengdu described above never recognised
    the interconnections between the linpan settlement form and the irrigation and
    flood control system. Governmental water management structure today essentially
    parallels practice over past centuries (Yuan, 2016). Management of the Irrigation
    District by the provincial Water Resources Department and its Bureau at Dujiangyan
    is a powerful operation that takes priority over many other affairs within the
    District, and is tightly coordinated with governance in local jurisdictions. The
    Community Party Secretary for each level of territorial administration is also
    the ‘river director’ (he zhang) for the section of each river and channel passing
    through his/her jurisdiction. The Dujiangyan headworks themselves have been protected
    as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site since 2000, even as they continue to
    be operated and maintained by the Water Resources Department’s Bureau there. The
    landscape of linpan dwellings downstream, however, does not have this dual status
    as cultural heritage and daily functional subject of governance. Preservation
    policy has lately treated linpan as characteristic of the region, but primarily
    in cultural and aesthetic terms. Despite official pronouncements urging linpan
    protection, policies and practices do not reflect their functional significance
    (Chengdu Municipal People’s Government, 2008). Some NGOs, most notably the Chengdu
    Urban Rivers Association (CURA), have been active in researching and publicising
    the relationship between traditional linpan-based ecoagriculture and the health
    of the water system overall. Official planners, however, generally view the scattered
    pattern of settlement as a hindrance to efficient infrastructure modernisation
    and farm consolidation, though they acknowledge vaguely that new village construction
    plans should reflect local conditions. The Chengdu Municipal Urban–Rural Planning
    Bureau’s Rural Planning Section therefore adopted a flexible principle of ‘concentrate
    where it is beneficial to concentrate; disperse where it is beneficial to disperse’
    (yi ju ze ju, yi san ze san). In order to help the Bureau understand quantitatively
    what ‘concentration’ and ‘dispersal’ mean in the context of the Plain, the author
    with students and collaborators undertook a comparative study in 2012–2014 of
    four broadly representative but sharply contrasting cases of agricultural settlement
    development in three administrative villages in different townships of Pidu District.
    The study proceeded in two phases: (1) a morphological survey in 2012–2013 of
    land use, land cover and settlement form characteristics broadly indicative of
    agroecological resilience (Kremen et al., 2012; Leitão, 2006; Tengö and Belfrage,
    2004; Van Apeldoorn et al., 2011), reported in Tippins (2014); (2) questionnaire
    surveys in 2014–2015 of household socio-economic conditions, reported in Xiao
    (2015). Additional perspective on these findings was obtained through field surveys
    and planning studio work in Pujiang County in 2013 at the hilly edge of the Plain,
    outside the Dujiangyan irrigated area but where the landscape is still characterised
    by linpan (Li, 2014), and through multiple subsequent visits and interviews each
    year since. In 2017, further morphological and household socio-economic case studies
    were conducted in an additional three villages in Sandaoyan, another township
    in Pidu. The quantitative data represent conditions only at one moment in time
    (the study was not longitudinal), and at a small scale (Table 1). In combination
    with qualitative data, however, they provide a relatively clear sense of trends
    and their determinants specific to these cases, and reveal important relationships
    between developmental projects and certain landscape and household conditions.

    households in Zhanqi and Qinggangshu villages do not cultivate village land and
    receive no direct income from agricultural production, which is almost entirely
    corporatised; instead they receive an annual share of farmland rent paid as the
    market cash value of 350 kg of rice and 350 kg of wheat. The four main study cases
    represented a spectrum of landscape reorganisation and degree of housing concentration,
    from least-intervened and most dispersed, to most intervened and most concentrated.
    On the most dispersed end were two cases: (1) a ‘laissez-faire’ case in Jiang’an
    Village where no planned reorganisation took place and households made conventional
    economic decisions on the basis of market signals and within the framework of
    their existing land rights and linpan landscape configuration; and (2) a case
    in Quanjia Heba, a riverside area within the administrative village of Anlong,
    where households engaged in organic urban–rural community-supported agriculture
    (CSA) partnered with CURA to actively preserve the linpan environment and restore
    traditional farming practices. At the opposite extreme of the spectrum was a case
    of village government-led corporatisation in Zhanqi Village, including demolition
    of all linpan and resettlement of all families in a single new concentrated housing
    estate, the reorganisation of villagers’ role in production as shareholders and
    employees of village enterprises and the enlargement and regularisation of fields
    to accommodate new technologies of cultivation and land use. The most extensive
    use of the reorganised village’s land was in rural tourism. In addition to concentrating
    residences into a smaller area, the new village’s design facilitated collective
    management and oversight. All the streets converged on a single entry plaza, with
    village government offices and services in a position of prominence. In contrast
    to either Jiang’an or Quanjia Heba, the leadership of Zhanqi village sacrificed
    traditional linpan household autonomy to pursue a collectivist form of ‘community
    capitalism’, as exemplified in the nationally-promoted model villages of Nanjie
    in Henan and Huaxi in Jiangsu (Hou, 2013).9 The project originated in the village
    leadership’s own initiative, and pre-dated the full roll-out of the municipality’s
    farmland quota market described above, though the village did take advantage both
    of that policy as well as regional policies for rebuilding after the 2008 earthquake
    in Sichuan (Abramson and Qi, 2011; Sorace, 2014). Between these extremes was a
    case of partial or ‘relative’ concentration in the rest of Anlong outside Quanjia
    Heba, where land rights and field divisions remained as before, but the village
    relied entirely on the quota market to relocate all families into multiple clusters
    of new, more compact housing on smaller footprints, and convert the abandoned
    linpan into new fields. The premise of redevelopment in this case was to keep
    households as the primary unit of production, but to concentrate residence as
    a way to improve infrastructure and social amenities. A complex relationship arose
    between Quanjia Heba and the rest of Anlong. The CSA’s fame at Quanjia Heba had
    helped to attract the attention and support of higher government levels to invest
    in the rest of the village, which initially was framed as a linpan preservation
    pilot project (Pi County People’s Government, 2007). However, the principle of
    concentrating housing, and dependence on the financial mechanism of the quota
    market, led instead to the replacement of actual linpan with a few aesthetically
    linpan-like larger housing clusters. Moreover, the project’s dependence on the
    quota market, and its high political profile, led supra-village leadership (the
    town and county governments) to take a larger role in the project, and village
    leaders played a more passive role in what was to became a showcase for the whole
    county. The initial spatial survey in these four situations suggests that, without
    the active efforts of the CSA and CURA, many of the land use and morphological
    features that have characterised the Chengdu Plain’s resilience over the long
    term are threatened (Tippins, 2014). In Zhanqi’s extreme concentration of housing,
    average field size (and therefore the distance between irrigation channels) was
    greater by about 400%, and the diversity of cropping, the ‘patchiness’ of land
    uses and the land and overall forest cover were significantly less. Even where
    concentration was only partial, in Anlong, non-nursery forest cover decreased.
    While extreme concentration did not necessarily mean significantly less cultivation
    of edible crops, only Quanjia Heba’s CSA grew grain along with vegetables and
    fruit, often in the same small fields. In the ‘laissez-faire’ case of Jiang’an,
    nearly all edible cultivation was replaced by nurseries, except for what families
    grew to feed themselves. In these two cases, the communities’ maintenance of the
    scattered dwelling pattern reflected a shared faith in the continued viability
    of household/family-based autonomy in economic and land-use decision-making. Even
    so, they differed sharply in the attitudes of peasant households towards markets.
    Jiang’an villagers pursued a conventional income-maximising strategy which led
    most families to grow higher-value and less labour-demanding plants, and to pursue
    wage-work for younger members outside the village, often at great distances. By
    contrast, CSA participants were willing to sacrifice some cash income to pursue
    an alternative ecological or ‘Buddhist-economic’ development model in conscious
    resistance to the pressures of urban agglomeration (Hale, 2013: Chapter 6; Hu,
    2015). Surveys of households in the four situations revealed that although household
    income was higher in both of the villages that underwent some degree of concentration,
    households experiencing partial concentration also incurred much higher expenses
    and debt, largely for furnishing the new houses. Among the two cases that left
    landscape morphology intact, incomes were lower and about equal, but in Jiang’an
    they were dependent overwhelmingly on ornamental plant sales (whose market value
    has subsequently dropped precipitously) and wages from labour in distant, low-skill
    jobs. Households in the CSA at Quanjia Heba tended to have more members who engaged
    in more than one type of work, diversifying their sources of income, and enjoying
    the most free time (Xiao, 2015). They had somewhat higher incomes than at Jiang’an,
    but also more expenditures, mostly for transportation and social activity related
    to the networking and product deliveries associated with their organic produce
    niche market. Such expenses represent a productive investment, reflected in their
    lower accumulated debt. Out-migration for wage-work among the CSA participants
    was at a lower level than in any of the other cases, including Zhanqi. The 2017
    surveys of morphological and socio-economic conditions in Sandaoyan compared two
    additional cases of ‘laissez-faire’ linpan preservation in Paotong and Qingta
    villages, and one case in Qinggangshu Village that combined Anlong’s semi-concentrated
    approach to new housing construction with Zhanqi’s more corporate approach to
    land use and its emphasis on tourism. Qinggangshu residents incurred significant
    deficits in order to outfit their new houses as nongjiale – independent rural
    tourism guesthouses – and had not yet seen a return on that investment. In the
    meantime they had given up all individual control over farm production. Paotong
    and Qingta, on the other hand, like Jiang’an, left the basic landscape structure
    intact and continued to use their land primarily for agriculture, but they maintained
    a more diverse mix of crops, including significant grain and food produce as well
    as ornamentals. Their household income profiles reveal further challenge to continuing
    resilience in the linpan landscape. Paotong villagers, relying almost entirely
    on food crops which they grew and marketed conventionally themselves, earned the
    lowest incomes. Qingta villagers, meanwhile, had gradually leased out much of
    their farmland to external enterprises; 80% of households had signed agreements
    to move out of their farmhouses whenever relocation housing could be built or
    found for them. How their original dwellings and linpan should then be used remains
    an open question. In terms of resilience, these findings suggest that the benefits
    of reorganising a community in the Chengdu Plain by destroying the linpan landscape
    will only accrue to its residents if the entire community undergoes a regime change
    – in this case, to become a shareholding corporation with all the administrative
    costs and loss of individual decision-making power that entails, as at Zhanqi.
    Also, these benefits – reflected primarily in higher household incomes and more
    convenient access to transportation and amenities such as natural gas and piped
    water – come with local and regional ecological costs and risks. Such costs have
    yet to be analysed, but the loss of fine-grained landscape heterogeneity must
    give pause, given its correlation with historically resilient levels of productivity.
    If, on the other hand, a community retains its traditional landscape and household
    autonomy only to pursue either fast-changing market signals or the most stable
    conventional markets, it risks increasing its vulnerability to external volatility
    and disturbance, or a gradual decline in earnings, as well as environmental degradation,
    as at Jiang’an and Paotong. The value of ornamental plants has dropped sharply
    throughout China since urban construction slowed after 2013, and yet converting
    nurseries back to paddy fields involves significant costs, including restoration
    of irrigation channels and replenishment of valuable topsoil lost when trees and
    shrubs are uprooted and sold. It would appear that some form of conscious intervention
    and social-ecological vision like the CSA’s and CURA’s at Quanjia Heba is needed
    to protect time-tested buffers and maintain flexibility in the face of such disturbances,
    as well as to build new social relations appropriate to the increasing scale of
    urban society – that is, in agropolitan terms, to ‘encourage a growing sense of
    identification of local people with the enlarged communal space of the agropolis’
    while maintaining multi-scaled autonomy (Friedmann, 1985: 184). Some recent changes
    in the policy environment of Chengdu appear to provide new time and space to achieve
    this balance in the surrounding Plain. As of April 2017, the municipality’s new
    Party Secretary Fan Ruiping declared a priority to prevent further urban expansion
    in the direction of Dujiangyan and redirect it to the south and east, towards
    the megacity of Chongqing (Zhang S, 2017). The prospect of a massive Chengdu–Chongqing
    conurbation to the east of the Plain presents new challenges to an agropolitan
    vision for the region. At the same time, the ‘Control the West’ part of current
    policy at least acknowledges long-term values in the historic heart of the irrigation
    district, between Dujiangyan and Chengdu. In August 2017, Pidu District announced
    an initiative to apply for Globally Important Agricultural Heritage status for
    its system of linpan and rotating wet–dry field cultivation (Zhang M, 2017). Since
    then, even touristic redevelopment in rural areas between Chengdu centre and Dujiangyan
    has been sharply curtailed, in the name of environmental protection and ‘ecological
    civilisation’. While still largely undefined, these initiatives at least suggest
    a more functionally meaningful direction for preservation and development policy
    in the Plain. Conclusion For all its dynamism, China’s urbanisation is taking
    place essentially in situ, at both local and national scales; Hu Huanyong’s Heihe–Tengchong
    line has hardly moved in over a century (Figure 1 and endnote 1). This means that
    the particular long-evolved social-ecological characteristics of each city-region
    are of special significance to the form those cities take as they expand. The
    spatial concentration of human settlement and the enlargement of land use patches
    is not necessarily the path to more efficient and sustainable production. The
    Chengdu Plain is certainly unusual. Such large and populous regions sustaining
    centuries of development are rare, especially on the basis of spatially distributed
    habitation and extremely fine-grained variability in land and water management.
    Nevertheless, it demonstrates that established forms of agropolitanism can persist
    and adapt, incorporating new forms of productive relations and values while maintaining
    function and identity. Residents of the linpan landscape today have abundant spatial
    and aspatial communicative access to urban amenities and economic opportunities,
    while maintaining local social interaction. Chengdu’s Urban–Rural Coordinated
    Development policies and programmes, including both the reform of hukou restrictions
    and investments in schools and healthcare infrastructure, have done much to reverse
    the previous half-century’s institutional barriers between rural and urban interaction.
    However, farming households still encounter discriminatory policies and market
    pricing that undervalue the abundant products of centuries of the world’s most
    efficient husbandry of soil fertility, water quality and diverse life forms. Without
    a pricing and regulatory system that accounts for these ecosystem services, reforms
    that regularise land rights and make them more fungible in a speculative market
    are likely to accelerate environmental degradation. Finally, the significance
    of ‘place’ extends well beyond a mere gathering of local ‘flavours’ touristically
    or speculatively attractive to a globally mobile talent and investment pool; it
    is rooted in a biophysical reality presenting a unique set of challenges and opportunities
    for human ingenuity, and a unique setting for spatial governance. Proponents of
    metropolitan agglomeration economies see ‘jurisdictional fragmentation’, of the
    kind that characterises the Chengdu Plain, as a governance challenge (Leman, 2005:
    26–28). However, effective governance for sustainable development is not simply
    a matter of ‘defragmentation’ of jurisdictions and ‘integration’ across them (Bren
    d’Amour et al., 2017; Güneralp et al., 2015). In rejecting the concentration of
    power inherent in urban agglomeration economics, the agropolitan approach does
    not by any means reject modernisation more broadly; rather, it pursues a modernity
    based in dialogue between scientific understanding of the biophysical implications
    of technological change, and ‘the richly personal, embodied learning of local
    inhabitants’, as Friedmann (1985: 184) put it. The Chengdu Plain’s long history
    of famine- and flood-free development suggests that a multiplicity of overlapping
    territorial jurisdictions, including those of both governmental and non-governmental
    but traditionally sanctioned organisations, and significant autonomy at the household
    level, contributes to resilience. Activities and organisations that link agricultural
    producers to urbanites at a personal level, such as those we observe at Quanjia
    Heba, need greater scope and government sanction to expand, replicate and participate
    in economic development and environmental management and planning. The key to
    sustainable land-use practices and decisions is not to exercise power at ever
    higher levels, but to strengthen mutual accountability and meaningful feedback

    ORCID iD Daniel Abramson https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5070-8619 Footnotes 1. The
    importance of ecology in determining the pattern of urbanisation at these densities
    is demonstrated by the famous ‘Heihe–Tengchong line’, discovered by the geographer
    Hu Huanyong (Figure 1). The line approximately divides 57% of the land but only
    4% of the population in the western mountains, deserts and grasslands, and 43%
    of the land but 96% of the population in the eastern water-rich hills and plains.
    That proportion has hardly changed since 1935, despite phenomenal urbanisation.
    Sichuan Province is in all these respects a microcosm of China as a whole, with
    its highest population density abutting the line, in the Chengdu Plain. GO TO
    FOOTNOTE 2. Note that the municipalities to which these counties and districts
    belong also include counties in more hilly areas around the plain. These statistics
    probably do not count migrant population. Adding up the census population for
    each of the counties and districts separately yields a total of nearly 21 million.
    ‘Agricultural population’ is the ‘registered’ residential (hukou-holding) village
    population, including those no longer engaged in agricultural work and/or ‘temporarily’
    migrated elsewhere, and it does not include in-migrating farm workers with outside
    hukou. GO TO FOOTNOTE 3. According to the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) census of
    the year 2 – ‘the earliest preserved census in the world’ (Bielenstein, 1987:
    14) – Chengdu was the second most populous urban prefecture in the empire, after
    the capital at Changan itself. Only the 10th most populous prefecture was in the
    Yangtze delta: Pengcheng, or Suzhou today – and it had only slightly more than
    half of Chengdu’s population (Modelski, 2003: 214–215). Chengdu has also remained
    remarkably stable in its rank among Chinese cities over time; none of the largest
    Han-dynasty cities remain among China’s 10 most populous city-regional centres
    today except Chengdu, at seventh place today, and Chang’an (Xi’an), which has
    dropped to ninth place. GO TO FOOTNOTE 4. The Yangzi delta began to import rice
    from other provinces, including Sichuan, as early as the late 18th century – long
    before any significant urban expansion (Elvin, 1973; Huang, 1990). GO TO FOOTNOTE
    5. Due to gains elsewhere in China, Chengdu’s share of total national grain production
    declined over a longer period, 1949–2012, from 1.13% to 0.43%, even though its
    population today is about 1% of China’s. Chengdu’s share of all agricultural output
    declined in the same period less dramatically, from 0.9% to 0.74% (Liang, 2015:
    21). These statistics are for the Municipality of Chengdu, not the entire Plain,
    but they are broadly representative. See below for intra-Plain agricultural shifts.
    GO TO FOOTNOTE 6. Further research is needed to know the current status of this
    plan. Interviews with village leaders and township planners revealed that even
    before the first phase of projects was complete, some villages declined to participate.
    The reasons given were that by summer 2014, a combination of overbuilding at the
    city’s edge and the central government’s new anti-corruption drive depressed real
    estate values, leaving villagers and local governments shouldering unanticipated
    debts after they had borrowed for construction on the expectation of receiving
    quota funds. GO TO FOOTNOTE 7. As a share of Chengdu’s total grain output, Pi
    County’s dropped from 8.29% in 1962 to 3.64% in 2012, while that of outlying counties
    Dayi, Pujiang and Jintang grew from about 6%, 3% and 8% respectively to 8%, 4.7%
    and 13.42%. Similar but more extreme trends characterised rapeseed production
    and pig-farming. GO TO FOOTNOTE 8. For more detail on the ingenious engineering
    design and maintenance requirements of the Dujiangyan headworks, see Jones (1954)
    and Zhang et al. (2013). GO TO FOOTNOTE 9. GAO Demin, Zhanqi Village Party Secretary,
    interviewed by research team member Yuan Shang, 7 September 2014, made specific
    reference to these villages as models for his own vision for Zhanqi. GO TO FOOTNOTE

    RESEARCH\nThe central role of national programme \nmanagement for the achievement\
    \ of malaria \nelimination: a cross case-study analysis of nine \nmalaria programmes\n\
    Cara Smith Gueye1*, Gretchen Newby1, Jim Tulloch2, Laurence Slutsker3, Marcel\
    \ Tanner4,5 \nand Roland D. Gosling1\nAbstract \nBackground: A malaria eradication\
    \ goal has been proposed, at the same time as a new global strategy and imple-\n\
    mentation framework. Countries are considering the strategies and tools that will\
    \ enable progress towards malaria \ngoals. The eliminating malaria case-study\
    \ series reports were reviewed to identify successful programme manage-\nment\
    \ components using a cross-case study analytic approach.\nMethods: Nine out of\
    \ ten case-study reports were included in the analysis (Bhutan, Cape Verde, Malaysia,\
    \ Mauritius, \nNamibia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Turkmenistan). A conceptual\
    \ framework for malaria elimination programme \nmanagement was developed and data\
    \ were extracted and synthesized. Findings were reviewed at a consultative \n\
    workshop, which led to a revision of the framework and further data extraction\
    \ and synthesis. Success factors of \nimplementation, programme choices and changes,\
    \ and enabling factors were distilled.\nResults: Decentralized programmes enhanced\
    \ engagement in malaria elimination by sub-national units and com-\nmunities.\
    \ Integration of the malaria programme into other health services was also common.\
    \ Decentralization and \nintegration were often challenging due to the skill and\
    \ experience levels of newly tasked staff. Accountability for \nprogramme impact\
    \ was not clarified for most programmes. Motivation of work force was a key factor\
    \ in maintaining \nprogramme quality but there were few clear, detailed strategies\
    \ provided. Different incentive schemes targeted vari-\nous stakeholders. Training\
    \ and supervision, although not well described, were prioritized by most programmes.\
    \ Multi-\nsectoral collaboration helped some programmes share information, build\
    \ strategies and interventions and achieve \na higher quality of implementation.\
    \ In most cases programme action was spurred by malaria outbreaks or a new \n\
    elimination goal with strong leadership. Some programmes showed high capacity\
    \ for flexibility through introduc-\ntion of new strategies and tools. Several\
    \ case-studies described methods for monitoring implementation quality and \n\
    coverage; however analysis and feedback to those implementing malaria elimination\
    \ in the periphery was not well \ndescribed. Political commitment and sustained\
    \ financing contributed to malaria programme success. Consistency of \nmalaria\
    \ programmes depends on political commitment, human and financial resources, and\
    \ leadership. Operational \ncapacity of the programme and the overall health system\
    \ structure and strength are also important aspects.\nConclusions: Malaria eradication\
    \ will require adaptive, well-managed malaria programmes that are able to tailor\
    \ \nimplementation of evidence-based strategies, founded upon strong sub-national\
    \ surveillance and response, with \nadequate funding and human resources.\n© 2016\

    Smith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \nBackground\nGlobal goals for malaria\
    \ control, elimination and even-\ntual eradication have evolved rapidly in the\
    \ last year. A \nglobal goal of malaria eradication by 2040 was recently \nproposed\
    \ [1], and at the same time, a new Global Tech-\nnical Strategy for Malaria (GTS)\
    \ was launched by WHO \nin 2015 and endorsed by all member states, providing the\
    \ \noperational framework for achievement of elimination \nand stating an elimination\
    \ goal of 35 countries by 2030 \n[2]. The overarching implementation and action\
    \ frame-\nwork, Action and Investment to Defeat Malaria (AIM) by \nRoll Back Malaria,\
    \ was also launched in 2015 [3]. Many \nmalaria programmes around the world are\
    \ considering \nor committing to malaria elimination and are working to \nintegrate\
    \ the GTS and AIM principles into their national \nmalaria programme strategy\
    \ and framework. It is also \nlikely that during this process, countries are consider-\n\
    ing the internal and external factors that may propel or \nimpede progress towards\
    \ elimination.\nThere are important challenges to address for both the \nlong-term\
    \ goal of global malaria eradication, as well as \nnational elimination efforts.\
    \ As highlighted in the GTS, \ncountries must ensure political commitment and\
    \ financ-\ning, and address major technical challenges, such as drug \nand insecticide\
    \ resistance [2]. An overarching challenge \nat the national level is the inadequate\
    \ performance of \nhealth systems. Deficiencies in health system structure \n\
    may take the form of weak surveillance, inadequate tools \nfor diagnosis and treatment,\
    \ poor management of supply \nchains, an unregulated private health sector, weak\
    \ moni-\ntoring and evaluation, and lack of adequate technical and \nhuman resource\
    \ capacity. Ensuring that national malaria \nprogrammes have personnel with the\
    \ appropriate level \nof programme management skills and tools to supervise \n\
    and coordinate high quality implementation and evalua-\ntion is essential to achieving\
    \ elimination, and, ultimately, \neradication [2].\nToday’s eradication goal is\
    \ not the first effort to rid \nthe world of malaria. The first attempt was made\
    \ dur-\ning the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP) \n(1955–1970). However,\
    \ there are some major differences \nbetween that programme and present day efforts.\
    \ The \nGMEP was based on vertical, time-limited interventions \ndeployed through\
    \ mainly centralized health systems, \nwhere authority was held mostly at the\
    \ national level. \nIn contrast, today’s health systems are mainly decen-\ntralized\
    \ and malaria programmes are integrated into \nvector-borne disease control programmes\
    \ [4]. While \nverticality brought some benefits, such as greater control \nand\
    \ potential for motivation of staff, it also meant that \nactivities were often\
    \ not integrated with broader com-\nmunicable disease activities, and lacked a\
    \ clear, strategic \ncomponent of surveillance with effective response pack-\n\
    ages, which created major challenges for achieving effec-\ntiveness and sustainability.\
    \ Attrition of professional staff \nwas increasingly a problem as GMEP progressed;\
    \ the \nwork became rote and routine and less about problem-\nsolving. Without\
    \ strategies in place to maintain motiva-\ntion, trained staff left country programmes\
    \ [4]. In some \ncases, national programmes following GMEP guidance \ndid not\
    \ adequately build up systems in country for cap-\nturing epidemiological data\
    \ that could identify changing \ntransmission patterns, or failed to evaluate\
    \ the impact of \ninterventions, leading to campaigns that became unable \nto\
    \ reorient or adapt to changing contexts [4]. In addition, \nthere was no agenda\
    \ for research and development to \naccompany the GMEP. Therefore, as technical\
    \ challenges \nsuch as drug and insecticide resistance arose, solutions \nwere\
    \ not forthcoming [5]. As financing for malaria eradi-\ncation was withdrawn in\
    \ the 1970s and 1980s, progress \ntoward eradication stalled.\nThe lessons from\
    \ the GMEP, as well as the framework \nof the GTS and the AIM and the new eradication\
    \ goal, all \nspeak to the importance of strong programme manage-\nment as a central\
    \ component for the success of countries \naiming to achieve malaria elimination.\
    \ The Eliminat-\ning Case-Study Series by the WHO Global Malaria Pro-\ngramme\
    \ and UCSF Global Health Group was developed \nto detailed comparatively describe,\
    \ analyse and discuss \nexamples of national malaria programmes that are cur-\n\
    rently eliminating or have eliminated malaria. Thus, \nthe case studies series\
    \ offered an opportunity to review \nprogramme management strategies and contexts\
    \ across \ncountries to identify success factors along the road to \nelimination.\
    \ In this paper, the authors report the findings \nof this cross case-study analysis,\
    \ which is the first of its \nkind to examine countries in different socio-economic,\
    \ \npolitical and ecological contexts. This analysis focuses \non the way in which\
    \ countries have implemented elimi-\nnation programmes, have developed and adapted\
    \ their \nmalaria elimination strategies, and how they have oper-\nated within\
    \ the context of different political, financial and \nhuman resources.\nMethods\n\
    This cross case-study review included nine of the 11 case-\nstudies in the malaria\
    \ elimination case-study series, pro-\nduced through a collaboration between the\
    \ WHO Global \nKeywords: Malaria elimination, Program management, Case-study\n\
    Page 3 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \nMalaria Programme and\
    \ the Global Health Group, Uni-\nversity of California San Francisco. Case-studies\
    \ were \nincluded in the cross case analysis if they were in final \nEnglish language\
    \ draft at the time of analysis (November \n2014). Case-studies included in this\
    \ cross case analysis \nare Bhutan [6], Cape Verde [7], Malaysia [8], Mauritius\
    \ \n[9], Namibia [10], Philippines [11], Sri Lanka [12], Turkey \n[13], and Turkmenistan\
    \ [14]. Case studies from La Reun-\nion and Tunisia were not included in this\
    \ review because \nthe report from La Reunion was not finalized nor trans-\nlated\
    \ into English at the time of analysis, and a draft of \nTunisia was not yet available\
    \ by the time the analysis was \nunderway. Three of the nine case-studies represented\
    \ \ncountries in the prevention of reintroduction phase \n(Table 1), which have\
    \ reached zero locally acquired cases \nand are actively preventing reintroduction\
    \ of malaria \n[15].\nAn initial conceptual framework for programme man-\nagement\
    \ in malaria elimination was developed to pro-\nvide structure for the cross case\
    \ analysis (Additional \nfile 1). This framework was based on a document review\
    \ \nof malaria elimination guidelines, reports, consultations \nand manuals to\
    \ identify historical and current policy and \nresearch on management strategies,\
    \ tools, and opera-\ntional research. The document review took place in 2013 \n\
    and 2014. The documents reviewed for the development \nof the initial conceptual\
    \ framework were found using \nthe following search terms: “program management,”\
    \ \n“supervision,” \n“decentralization,” \n“vertical,” \n“integra-\ntion,” “health\
    \ systems,” “incentives,” “training,” “financ-\ning,” “costs,” “human resources”\
    \ and “malaria,” “malaria \ncontrol,” “malaria elimination” in Pubmed and Google\
    \ \nScholar (English only). A list of these documents can be \nfound in Additional\
    \ file 2. The framework was formatted \nin Excel as a matrix (Additional file 1).\
    \ Using the frame-\nwork components, two researchers (CSG, GN), reviewed \neach\
    \ case study report for information (e.g., examples, \nsynthesis or analysis)\
    \ on program experience for each \nconcept. If there were examples for a given\
    \ concept, the \nexperience was summarized in detail in the correspond-\ning matrix\
    \ cell. If there were no examples, the cell was left \nblank. After reviewing\
    \ a given report across all concepts, \na summary of the experience with a note\
    \ as to how strong \nof an example it was (by subjective assessment) was writ-\n\
    ten into the cell. After all of the reports were reviewed \nand cells filled in,\
    \ main challenges and weaknesses of \neach programme experience were summarized\
    \ by the \nresearchers.\nA two-day workshop was held in 2014 to review the \n\
    matrices on programme management and other themes. \nMalaria elimination researchers\
    \ and experts con-\nducted an in-depth review of case-study reports. Each \nreviewer\
    \ read two reports and compared the information \npresented in the reports against\
    \ the qualitative descrip-\ntions of experience, synthesis and analysis entered\
    \ into \nthe programme management matrix and summaries \nby CSG and GN to ensure\
    \ that the data captured in the \nmatrix were comprehensive, and to debate the\
    \ lessons \nlearned across the case-study experience. One of the \nresults of\
    \ the workshop was consensus that the frame-\nwork needed revision to better capture\
    \ the available \ndata and draw firmer conclusions of major programme \nstrengths\
    \ and weaknesses. CSG combined the inputs \nfrom the workshop and additional documents\
    \ collected \n(see Additional file 2) and re-reviewed to develop the new \nframework.\
    \ The final conceptual framework for the anal-\nysis can be seen in Fig. 1. The\
    \ framework was structured \nas follows: (1) Implementation-how malaria elimina-\n\
    tion is made to happen; (2) Malaria programme choices \nand changes; (3) Enabling\
    \ factors, and how these factors \naffect the consistency of implementation. Using\
    \ this new \nframework, CSG conducted a second round of in-depth \nreview of the\
    \ nine case-study reports, data extraction, \nsummary and analysis. Ministry of\
    \ Health, malaria pro-\ngramme personnel or other stakeholders were not inter-\n\
    viewed for this analysis; however, data collection for the \noriginal case-study\
    \ reports was based on extensive key \ninformant interviews in addition to the\
    \ quantitative data \ncollection.\nResults\nImplementation\nThe ways in which\
    \ malaria programmes were imple-\nmented were defined by several factors, including\
    \ the \nlevel of decentralization and integration of the malaria \nprogramme,\
    \ the health system in which the malaria pro-\ngramme operated its organizational\
    \ structure and the \naccountability of the programme.\nDecentralization is defined\
    \ as the transfer of author-\nity or dispersal of power and responsibility in\
    \ public \nplanning, management and decision making from the \nnational level\
    \ to subnational levels [16]. Most general \npublic health programmes operated\
    \ within a centralized \nstructure until the early 1980s, when budget crises and\
    \ \nrecognition of inefficiencies led to widespread reforms \n[17].\nMost of the\
    \ malaria programmes in the case-studies \noperated within an integrated national\
    \ health system. \nIntegrated, or horizontal, programme service delivery \nis\
    \ the delivery of services through the system of general \nhealth services [18,\
    \ 19]. Vertical programmes, in contrast, \nare “directed, supervised and executed,\
    \ either wholly or \nto a great extent by a specialized service using dedicated\
    \ \nhealth workers”, an example of which is national smallpox \neradication campaigns\
    \ [18]. Most malaria programmes \nwere integrated into curative health services\

    \ were \ndiagnosed and treated in the national network of pri-\nmary health care\
    \ facilities. However the management \nand operations of the other malaria programme\
    \ activities \nwere often less clear. Some programme elements, such as \nsurveillance\
    \ and response approaches or prevention strat-\negies through vector control,\
    \ were conducted in a semi-\nvertical fashion by sub-national malaria-only units\
    \ run by \nmalaria regional officers or malaria technicians in basic \nhealth\
    \ units. In other countries, integration with other \nvector-borne diseases translated\
    \ to sub-national offices \nthat coordinated vector control for all vector-borne\
    \ dis-\neases, using the same funding and personnel to conduct \nvector control\
    \ for dengue, malaria and other diseases. \nRefer to Table 2 for a summary of\
    \ the key learnings from \nimplementation of malaria elimination programmes.\n\
    Table  3 shows the type of organization and level of \nintegration of disease\
    \ control within each country with \nestimated time frame of when these processes\

    \ within each malaria programme, which \nwas an assessment based on the information\

    sion-making, and funding flow structure of each malaria \nprogramme.\nIn addition\
    \ to the role of integration, decentralization \nand accountability, implementation\
    \ was also impacted by \nthe motivation package for malaria workers, structure\
    \ of \nincentives, training programmes, and supervisory struc-\nture offered by\
    \ malaria control programmes. The role \nof intersectoral collaboration and its\

    \ \nhealth offices and communities\n• Most programmes were integrated, where malaria\
    \ programme services were delivered through the system of general health services.\
    \ Integration \nwas overall a negative experience for most malaria programmes\
    \ because staff were often given too many roles and responsibilities that were\
    \ not \nclearly defined\n• During the early period of transition to decentralized\
    \ and/or integrated programs, challenges were faced in maintaining quality and\
    \ execution of \ninterventions\n• Accountability for programme impact was not\
    \ clear for most programmes\n• Motivation is important to maintain quality of\
    \ interventions and different groups are and can be incentivized in different\
    \ ways\n• Sustained capacity building and strong supervision are key to successful\
    \ elimination\n• Working with other sectors to share information and develop and\
    \ implement interventions has led to greater effectiveness in surveillance, preven-\n\

    \ contribution \nto increases in incidence during the transition period \nwhen\
    \ decentralization was first implemented. However, \nonce in place, and roles\
    \ and responsibilities were clearly \nassigned, in most cases decentralization\
    \ increased local \nlevel capacity of the malaria programme as well as com-\n\
    munity access to health services. Across the case-studies, \nvertical programmes\
    \ operating in a centralized health \nsystem (such as Turkey and Turkmenistan)\
    \ appeared to \nhave the clearest lines of accountability and assignment of \n\
    roles and responsibilities, as there was one level respon-\nsible for both elimination\
    \ strategy development and \noutcome measurement. However, in more complicated\
    \ \nsettings, some case-studies clarified well which office or \nperson was ultimately\
    \ accountable for programme opera-\ntions and impact (Table 3). In Malaysia, decentralization\
    \ \nwas seen as benefiting elimination. While the malaria \nprogramme at the national\
    \ level developed policy, pro-\nvided technical expertise, and controlled the\
    \ finances, \neach state and district had a vector-borne disease pro-\ngramme\
    \ office which managed, coordinated and imple-\nmented malaria activities. The\
    \ programme engaged state \noffices in the elimination planning by holding elimina-\n\
    tion workshops. Additionally, the malaria programme \nbelieved that the development\
    \ of sub-sector offices, or \nmalaria offices in remote localities in Sabah State\
    \ had a \nsubstantial impact on reducing malaria morbidity by \nfacilitating integration\
    \ of the malaria programme into \ncommunities. Through engagement with the local\
    \ level, \nthere was a greater level of accountability sub-nationally \nfor implementation\
    \ of the malaria programme and its \nimpact on the ground. However, funding and\
    \ decision-\nmaking appeared to mainly rest with the national level.\nIn contrast,\
    \ decentralization in Cape Verde appeared \nto impede malaria programme progress,\
    \ mainly because \ncapacity was low at the health delegation (local health \n\
    authority) level and there were few resources or capacity \nfor the central malaria\
    \ programme to supervise or imple-\nment activities in the peripheral areas. Accountability\
    \ for \nthe quality and impact of programme activities was not \nclear.\nDecentralization\
    \ led to both positive and negative out-\ncomes for the malaria programmes. In\
    \ the Philippines, \nthe process of decentralization led to a seemingly cha-\n\
    otic malaria programme environment in the 1980s and \n1990s. At certain points,\
    \ provincial and municipal level \nauthorities were not able to lead malaria control\
    \ efforts \nbecause of insufficient training and resources. There was \na high\
    \ degree of variation across provinces in quality and \nextent of implementation,\
    \ NGO involvement, and exter-\nnal funding. In Laguna Province, for example, devolution\
    \ \nin malaria free areas disrupted progress as malaria per-\nsonnel were reassigned\
    \ to other activities. This led to a \ndisruption of the surveillance-response\
    \ system and cre-\nated a vacuum of experience when an outbreak occurred, \nwhich\
    \ then threatened to spread into other receptive, \nmalaria-free provinces where\
    \ capacity was also inade-\nquate. However, the positive impacts of decentralization\
    \ \nincluded an increase in provincial, municipal and com-\nmunity ownership of\
    \ malaria, eventual growth in staff \nand skills based in the field and a tailored\
    \ approach to \nmalaria control and elimination. Department of Health \n(national\
    \ level) staff were positioned in each province \nto supervise and monitor activities,\
    \ but they were not \ngiven decision-making authority. Local, sub-national staff\
    \ \nappreciated this autonomy and turned to higher levels \nonly when in need\
    \ of technical guidance.\nBhutan’s decentralization process was also relatively\
    \ \ndisorganized in the early years, when districts began \nmanaging the delivery\
    \ of basic services. Malaria inci-\ndence rose from 5213 cases in 1983 to 18,368\
    \ in 1984. \nThe increase in cases was believed to be the result of a \ndecline\
    \ in indoor residual spraying (IRS) coverage and \nquality. However, once the\
    \ process was more estab-\nlished, decentralization may have contributed to longer\
    \ \nterm reductions in malaria cases through an expansion \nof facilities and\
    \ deployment of malaria workers in health \ncenters in endemic areas, boosting\
    \ surveillance activities.\nIn Sri Lanka, decentralization may have also contrib-\n\
    uted to an initial rise in malaria-related incidence and \ndeaths. From 1990–99,\
    \ when the system was undergo-\ning the transformation, confirmed infections rose\
    \ from \n142,294 (1995) to 264,549 (1999). Then, from 2000 \nonward, incidence\
    \ declined. The national programme \nformulated malaria control policy, monitored\
    \ national \nmalaria trends, provided technical guidance, and under-\ntook entomological\
    \ and parasitological surveillance. \nDistrict-level offices coordinated parasitological\
    \ and \nentomological surveillance, vector control, and con-\nducted supervision\
    \ and M&E activities. Even with the \ninitial challenges, decentralization may\
    \ have contributed \nto stronger leadership at the district level and local adap-\n\
    tion of the programme. Accountability mainly rested \nwith the national office;\
    \ however, district malaria officers \nwere also held accountable to the national\
    \ programme.\nTurkey’s centralized health system may have contrib-\nuted to the\
    \ consistent approach of the public health ser-\nvices, and the maintenance of\
    \ skills, capacity and malaria \ncontrol activities over time. Challenges included\
    \ staff \nshortages for active case detection in certain parts of the \ncountry.\
    \ Staff were often transferred from areas where \ntransmission had been interrupted\
    \ to areas with current \ntransmission, leaving malaria-free areas vulnerable\
    \ in the \nevent of resurgence.\nTurkmenistan’s centralized health system may\
    \ have also \nled to a greater degree of consistency in the programme, \nPage\
    \ 8 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \naccountability at the national\
    \ level, and political sup-\nport. However there were challenges in the programme,\
    \ \nincluding delays in diagnosis, treatment and reporting in \nrural areas.\n\
    In Namibia, the national malaria programme provided \nfunding, trainings and commodities\
    \ to the regional level, \nwhich coordinated district activities. Due to the fact\
    \ that \ndonor funding for malaria almost exclusively moved \nthrough the national\
    \ programme, accountability rested \nmainly at the national level.\nThe Mauritius\
    \ case-study described its malaria pro-\ngramme as semi-vertical and the bulk\
    \ of malaria per-\nsonnel sat in the national office. Accountability for \nprogramme\
    \ implementation and impact rested mainly at \nthe national level.\nImpact of integration\
    \ on elimination progress\nThe impact of integration on malaria control efforts\
    \ \nwas overall considered negative, mainly due to over-\nburdening staff with\
    \ often-undefined roles and respon-\nsibilities. There was also a risk that the\
    \ integrated \nprogramme would dedicate fewer resources to malaria \nwhen cases\
    \ were reduced. The potential positive outcome \nof increased programme efficiencies\
    \ and cost savings \nthrough integration (e.g., with all vector-borne diseases)\
    \ \nwas not documented in the case-studies.\nBhutan, Sri Lanka and Cape Verde\
    \ provided clear \nexamples of malaria programme integration with the \ntransition\
    \ from single-disease to multi-purpose techni-\ncians. In Bhutan and Sri Lanka\
    \ the impact of integration \nwas just occurring at the time of data collection\
    \ and its \nimpact was not described. Before integration, malaria \ntechnicians\
    \ in Bhutan posted in hospitals and basic \nhealth units were responsible for\
    \ all malaria diagnosis, \ntreatment, and parasitological and entomological surveil-\n\
    lance and vector control. Sub-national Health Delegates \nin Cape Verde became\
    \ overloaded as they were respon-\nsible for clinical and administrative duties\
    \ in addition to \nsupervising the team of health technicians responsible \nfor\
    \ coordinating interventions and surveillance.\nIn Mauritius, the immediate integration\
    \ of malaria con-\ntrol into the general public health services once the last\
    \ \nindigenous case was detected in 1968 was likely a con-\ntributing factor in\
    \ the resurgence of cases in the 1970s. \nMedical officers were newly responsible\
    \ for malaria in \ntheir districts. These rapid transitions contributed to \n\
    poorer quality passive case detection, lack of participa-\ntion by health workers\
    \ in malaria screening programmes, \nand financial constraints after integration.\n\
    In Namibia, integration similarly presented logistical \nand bureaucratic hurdles:\
    \ one example was that drivers \nwere not available for malaria related activities\
    \ because \nthey were busy with other Ministry-related tasks.\nMalaysia’s integration\
    \ of the malaria programme \noccurred after 1981, when elimination was declared\
    \ \ninfeasible. The malaria programme was integrated with \nother vector borne\
    \ diseases at the central and state-\nbased offices. Since dengue was the most\
    \ common notifi-\nable disease in 2010, it is likely that integration diverted\
    \ \nresources away from malaria programme activities.\nTurkey provided a contrasting\
    \ example of a vertical \nmalaria programme. It appeared that the programme’s\
    \ \nverticality led to a greater level of consistency in pro-\ngramme activity\
    \ and resources, and translated to clear \naccountability at the national level\
    \ for malaria strat-\negy and achievements. However, during the epidemics \nrecorded\
    \ in the 1970s and 1990s, a contributing factor \nwas waning interest in malaria\
    \ control as the caseload \nbecame very low. It is theoretically possible that\
    \ an inte-\ngrated programme would been more flexible and cost-\neffective, able\
    \ to shift staff or resources as needed across \nprogrammes.\nThe Philippines\
    \ and Turkmenistan reports were not \nspecific about the level of integration\
    \ of the malaria \nprogramme.\nMotivation and incentives\nMaintaining a high level\
    \ of motivation in implementers is \nimportant to sustain consistency and quality\
    \ of interven-\ntions. Staff motivation is an important aspect of human \nresource\
    \ capacity, and depends on a number of factors: \nworking conditions, financial\
    \ incentives, correct and \nprompt compensation, management of staff and possibil-\n\
    ities for professional advancement [20]. This basic moti-\nvation package is often\
    \ the key to a successful malaria \nprogramme. As malaria cases decline, different\
    \ strategies \nmust be employed to keep staff committed, and prevent \nturnover\
    \ and loss of institutional knowledge. Incentives \nmay be used if specific and\
    \ predetermined milestones are \nachieved. Incentives are the “rewards and punishments\
    \ \nthat [service] providers face as a consequence of the \norganizations in which\
    \ they work, the institution under \nwhich they operate and the specific interventions\
    \ they \nprovide” [20]. Community level and political motivation \nis also a key\
    \ predictor of malaria elimination success, \nand can be significantly enhanced\
    \ by including elimina-\ntion targets and legislation. The case-studies described\
    \ \nstructures and mandates that motivated and incentiv-\nized communities or\
    \ other sectors to engage in malaria \nelimination. Professional incentives were\
    \ in place for vol-\nunteer health workers, but not described for malaria pro-\n\
    gramme workers.\nIn Sabah State of Malaysia, Primary Health Care Vol-\nunteers\
    \ (PHCV) were motivated by the prospect of \nprofessional work. PHCVs played an\
    \ important role in \ndiagnosis, treatment and prevention. IRS spraymen were \n\
    Page 9 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \noften recruited from\
    \ the PHCV pool, offering the possi-\nbility of a future paid position. Similar\
    \ to the Sabah pro-\ngramme, the Philippines used incentives for the work of \n\
    the paid Barangay (i.e., village) Health Workers. In addi-\ntion to earning a\
    \ small wage and an important role in the \ncommunity, their microscopy skills\
    \ and responsibilities \nwere highly regarded among the primarily uneducated \n\
    women who participated in the programme, who other-\nwise had limited employment\
    \ opportunities.\nThe structure of external grant funding in the Philip-\npines\
    \ inadvertently led to a shift in non-financial as well as \nfinancial motivation\
    \ in municipal staff. When the Global \nFund grant support began in Apayao Province,\
    \ the grant \nwas structured such that municipality offices were given \nresponsibility\
    \ for planning and management, which trans-\nlated to an increased level of motivation\
    \ of municipal staff \nto take initiative and ownership of malaria control, with\
    \ \nthe positive affect of an increase in level of confidence for \nmanaging the\
    \ malaria programme activities.\nExternal grant funding increased the level of\
    \ motiva-\ntion to conduct comprehensive field work in Sri Lanka, \nbecause that\
    \ funding covered travel costs and per diems \nfor intensive entomological surveillance\
    \ and supervision. \nHowever, delays in payment for the overtime or traveling\
    \ \nclaims counteracted the potential beneficial impact of \nthese incentives.\n\
    The Sabah State malaria programme’s collaboration \nwith private sector plantations\
    \ (e.g., palm oil planta-\ntions) showed the motivating factors for plantations\
    \ to get \ninvolved in malaria control. Plantation owners provided \nmalaria diagnosis\
    \ and treatment and some also provided \nvector control (either directly or through\
    \ support to the \ndistrict malaria programme office) because they believed \n\
    the benefits of the collaboration to be an increase in plan-\ntation worker productivity\
    \ and reduction in worker health \ncare costs, an increase in their profile as\
    \ a good place to \nwork by providing access to health care and prevention on\
    \ \nsite, and abiding by expectations in Malaysia for corporate \nsocial responsibility\
    \ and adherence to the labour laws.\nMauritius programme staff considered their\
    \ public \nhealth laws enforcing environmental management and \naccess to homes\
    \ to conduct vector control to be motivat-\ning factors for community acceptance\
    \ and participation \nin the malaria programme’s vector control activities.\n\
    Certification schemes kept motivation at higher lev-\nels in Turkmenistan and\
    \ the Philippines. Turkmenistan \ncreated a certification for laboratory quality,\
    \ for which \nevery laboratory participated in a scoring system for \ndiagnosis,\
    \ and labs exceeding an 80  % score received a \n1-year certification. One example\
    \ of an overarching elim-\nination-friendly structure is the Philippines subnational\
    \ \nelimination certification process, where provinces were \nreviewed and validated\
    \ as “malaria free.” This structure \nwas thought to have motivated provincial\
    \ staff and com-\nmunity participation in malaria control.\nBhutan and Cape Verde\
    \ did not report on incentives. \nNamibia’s programme found difficulty in recruiting\
    \ sup-\nport to and engagement of communities because their \nhealth volunteers\
    \ were not motivated through financial \nor professional incentives.\nTraining\n\
    Training is an important component of a malaria elimina-\ntion and POR programme.\
    \ While there was very limited \ninformation in the case-studies on the coverage\
    \ and con-\nsistency of trainings, several country experiences showed \nthe risk\
    \ of weakening the malaria programme when \ntraining programmes became infrequent\
    \ or inadequate. \nConversely, programme activities were strengthened \nwhen training\
    \ was increased with the injection of exter-\nnal funding or if an outbreak occurred.\
    \ The content and \nformat of trainings were not well described and appeared \n\
    to be weakly structured in the case-studies, and there \nwas very little information\
    \ on surveillance and response \ntraining. Most programmes did not describe on-the-job\
    \ \ntraining formats, so it is assumed that they were large, \nseminar-style trainings.\n\
    There were several countries with inadequate train-\ning programmes and resultant\
    \ operational challenges. \nBecause training in Namibia was insufficient, quality\
    \ of \ndiagnosis and treatment services, record keeping, coordi-\nnation, time\
    \ management and communication were sub-\noptimal. These problems were exacerbated\
    \ by poor job \ndescriptions. In the Philippines, lack of training and fol-\n\
    low up when a new drug policy was rolled out meant that \nsome staff were unaware\
    \ of the new policy and how to \nimplement it. Inadequate surveillance training\
    \ in Turk-\nmenistan weakened the programme in the 1990s and \ncontributed to\
    \ the outbreak of 1998–99. The problem \nwas exacerbated by understaffing, in\
    \ that many Russian \nspecialists left the country after independence in 1991.\
    \ \nPost outbreak, the programme increased capacity with \nthe development of\
    \ a continuous education programme \n(2004–10), reaching more than 1400 personnel.\
    \ In 2010, \n11–20 % of the government malaria budget was spent on \nstaff training.\n\
    Global Fund grants provided funds to increase the \nnumber of trainings in Bhutan,\
    \ Philippines and Sri Lanka. \nSri Lanka held regular trainings to maintain engagement\
    \ \nin elimination. Philippines’ trainings led to improvements \nin planning and\
    \ delivery of interventions.\nBhutan, Cape Verde, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Turkey\
    \ \nprioritized microscopy training to ensure that diagnosis \nskills were maintained\
    \ as malaria cases declined.\nPage 10 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016)\
    \ 15:488 \nSupervisory structure\nSupervision of malaria control activities is\
    \ conducted \nto ensure the quality of interventions and to increase or \nmaintain\
    \ a high level of motivation in the workforce [21]. \nEffective supervision should\
    \ include regular visits to the \nperiphery and activities to check information\
    \ and sup-\nplies, problem-solving with the employee, and a feedback \nmechanism\
    \ to encourage improvement [21]. In the case-\nstudy reports, supervision of intervention\
    \ quality, timing, \ncoverage and measurement of impact were not described. \n\
    Resource constraints in some programmes limited staff \ntime and transportation\
    \ to carry out supervision of field \nactivities.\nIn some case-studies the planned\
    \ (though not neces-\nsarily executed) supervision structure was reported. In\
    \ \nBhutan, the malaria technicians supervised village health \nworkers and health\
    \ centers. The Sanitary Epidemiologi-\ncal Service (SES) of Turkmenistan, which\
    \ was overseen \nby the Deputy Minister of Health, monitored coverage \nand performance\
    \ of all interventions. In both Bhutan and \nTurkmenistan, the quality assurance\
    \ process and supervi-\nsion of microscopy were highlighted as key activities.\n\
    In the Philippines, Department of Health representa-\ntives at the provincial\
    \ level were reluctant to supervise \nas the local staff worked autonomously.\
    \ Thus, provin-\ncial authorities viewed health workers and local staff as \n\
    partners and supervision in the traditional sense did not \noccur.\nThe Namibia\
    \ and Sri Lanka programmes provided \ntimeframes for supervision. In Namibia,\
    \ national staff \nplanned to conduct annual regional supervisory visits, \nregional\
    \ staff conducted quarterly district visits, and dis-\ntrict staff visited clinics\
    \ on a monthly basis. Sri Lanka’s \nRegional Malaria Officers aimed to visit all\
    \ district ento-\nmological surveillance, IRS programmes, and up to two \nactive\
    \ case detection activities each month.\nIn Sabah State of Malaysia, state and\
    \ district level \nentomologists supervised insecticide treated net (ITN) \nand\
    \ IRS programmes conducted by district and sub-\ndistrict offices. The national\
    \ level laboratory supervised \nall microscopists and provided retraining for\
    \ those who \ncommitted frequent mistakes. District level malaria offic-\ners\
    \ supervised health volunteers.\nIn Mauritius, IRS activities by public health\
    \ staff were \n“strictly” supervised by the team. IRS was conducted for \n2 years\
    \ within 500 m of a case’s residence.\nIn some countries, resources were not sufficient\
    \ \nto maintain adequate supervision. Lack of transpor-\ntation and limited staff\
    \ in Sri Lanka cut down the \namount of field supervision in recent years. There\
    \ \nwas little funding or time available for Cape Verde’s \n17 Health Delegates\
    \ to supervise the network of pri-\nmary health facilities and health technician\
    \ teams. In \nNamibia, a supervisory structure existed but was not \nfollowed\
    \ due to time constraints and unreliable trans-\nportation. In Sri Lanka and Namibia,\
    \ the injection of \nGlobal Fund grant funding increased the resources for \n\
    supervision.\nMultisectoral collaboration\nThe case-studies provided examples\
    \ of multisectoral \ncollaboration, where malaria programmes worked or \nplanned\
    \ to collaborate either with other Ministries in \nthe government, such as the\
    \ Ministry of Labour or For-\neign Affairs, or other, non-health sectors including\
    \ pri-\nvate sector health facilities or extractive industries. This \ntype of\
    \ approach is different from programme integra-\ntion with national curative or\
    \ preventive services, but can \nwork well within that structure. Resurgences\
    \ in several \ncountries may have been prevented by identifying risks, \nsharing\
    \ information and collaborating on malaria edu-\ncation and control with other\
    \ ministries and the private \nsector. Contracting out services to private entities,\
    \ which \nwas done by some countries, may be cost-effective and \nincrease quality\
    \ and coverage. There were no experiences \ndocumented of programmes working with\
    \ small enter-\nprises or local chambers of commerce.\nThe Bhutan malaria programme\
    \ reported a need to \ninvolve other Ministries because of economic develop-\n\
    ment activities and related migrant labour entering the \ncountry. Cape Verde\
    \ developed collaborations with the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Environment,\
    \ to improve \nagricultural practices and the management of rural water \nsources.\n\
    Some programmes outsourced malaria control imple-\nmentation to NGOs. Namibia\
    \ and Angola launched the \nTrans-Kunene Malaria Initiative (TKMI) in 2009 to\
    \ mon-\nitor cross-border importation and coordinate commu-\nnication, activities\
    \ and policies. An NGO provided the \nfunding and support for long-lasting insecticide-treated\
    \ \nnet (LLIN) distribution and monitoring along the border \narea. An NGO in\
    \ the Philippines became the Principal \nRecipient of the Global Fund grant in\
    \ funded provinces. \nIn Sri Lanka, LLIN distribution in the conflict-affected\
    \ \nareas of the country relied upon local NGOs, as they \nhad community based\
    \ ties to the region and were able to \noperate in areas that presented major\
    \ challenges for the \nmalaria programme.\nSeveral case-studies presented examples\
    \ of collabo-\nrations with private sector plantations or construction \ncompanies.\
    \ During its first elimination campaign, Mau-\nritius collaborated with private\
    \ sugar companies to edu-\ncate employees about malaria prevention and to create\
    \ \nprivate clinics for screening and case reporting. More \nrecently, the Sabah\
    \ State malaria programme in Malay-\nsia developed informal partnerships with\
    \ private sector \nPage 11 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \n\
    plantations. Plantation owners contributed resources \nby building subsector offices\
    \ or clinics for malaria pro-\ngramme workers and contracting out or conducting\
    \ IRS \nfor plantation structures. Leaders of Apayao Province in \nthe Philippines\
    \ worked with local mine and mill opera-\ntors and dam construction companies\
    \ to identify pro-\njects that would increase the flow of migrant labour in \n\
    high malaria risk areas and to develop joint screening and \nreporting systems.\
    \ In Turkey, the malaria programme \nmonitored irrigation systems.\nTurkmenistan\
    \ had a similar challenge, where there was \nan increase in vulnerability to malaria\
    \ transmission due \nto military training activities and migrant worker mobil-\n\
    ity, both of which contributed to the outbreaks of malaria \nin 1998–99 and 2002–2003.\
    \ Vulnerability is the proxim-\nity to malarious areas or resulting from the frequent\
    \ influx \nof infected individuals or groups or infective anophelines \n[15].\
    \ In response, in 2005, the Chairman of the Cabinet of \nMinisters of Turkmenistan\
    \ approved several documents \ncalling for intersectoral collaboration and implemented\
    \ \nplans including collaborating with the Ministry of Defense \nto share information,\
    \ immigration services, and construc-\ntion and oil companies that import labor\
    \ to provide health \ninformation, free access to diagnosis and treatment.\nMalaria\
    \ programme choices and changes\nMost case-studies documented the development\
    \ of stra-\ntegic plans and strategies for targeting interventions. \nSome programmes\
    \ showed a high degree of flexibility and \nforward thinking. Surges in action\
    \ by programmes were \noften reactionary and not a result of robust planning,\
    \ and \nthere were gaps in many programmes in monitoring and \nevaluation, particularly\
    \ in the provision of feedback to \nthe lower levels of the health system. Table 4\
    \ provides key \nlearnings for programme choices and changes.\nStrategic plans\n\
    The case-study reports had limited information on pro-\ngramme strategies and\
    \ activities, and how they were \ndesigned. Five case-studies reported on the\
    \ national stra-\ntegic plan objectives and planned interventions (Bhutan, \n\
    Cape Verde, Philippines, Turkey and Turkmenistan). It \nis assumed that all countries\
    \ had strategic plans for con-\ntrol and elimination, but these plans were not\
    \ described \nin the case-study. Most reports did not indicate whether \nthe specific\
    \ strategies were followed, or whether there \nwas 100 % compliance in coverage\
    \ and timing. This is dis-\ncussed in the M&E section.\nStratification\nStratification\
    \ plans assist malaria programmes in tar-\ngeting interventions and managing threats\
    \ of increased \nreceptivity or vulnerability. Receptivity means there is \npresence\
    \ of anopheline vectors and existence of other \nfactors favoring malaria transmission\
    \ [15], while vulner-\nability describes the risk of malaria importation. Strati-\n\
    fication plans may be based on disease epidemiology, \nentomological data, and\
    \ socio-economic and develop-\nment factors, such as development projects or population\
    \ \nmovement. Five case-studies included a recent stratifica-\ntion system (Table 5).\
    \ Although the spatial scale and cat-\negories used in the stratification systems\
    \ varied greatly, \nthese systems identified priority areas for programmes \n\
    to dedicate resources and response activities. Overall, a \nmajor gap in stratification\
    \ plans across the case-studies \nwas the surveillance and response strategies\
    \ developed to \nmitigate the threat of vulnerability.\nThe spatial scale used\
    \ in the stratification systems var-\nied across the countries. Some countries\
    \ used the WHO \nfoci classification system, which is currently comprised \nof\
    \ seven categories of transmission foci (new potential, \nnew active, endemic,\
    \ residual active, residual non-active, \ncleared up, pseudo focus) [15]. The\
    \ POR countries of \nMauritius, Turkey, and Turkmenistan reported using \nthe\
    \ foci system. Bhutan used a district-level stratifica-\ntion system, but in 2012\
    \ adapted the foci-based system \nusing six categories (endemic, residual active,\
    \ residual \nnon-active, new active, new potential, cleared-up). Mau-\nritius\
    \ used three categories (active residual foci; active \nnew foci with more than\
    \ three cases; active new foci with \nless than three cases). Other countries\
    \ employed differ-\nent spatial or descriptive scales. “Localities” in Malay-\n\
    sia were described as a village, section of plantation or \nhousing area. Other\
    \ countries used district or regional \nadministrative units. In the Philippines,\
    \ the unit of \nadministration was the province, but the category of risk \nwas\
    \ defined at the barangay (village) level and aggregated \nup to the province\
    \ level.\nOnly the Malaysia and Turkmenistan reports described \nhow the programmes\
    \ developed their stratification \nTable 4 Key learnings from malaria elimination\

    \ \nreceptivity, and access to the health system. Turkmeni-\nstan reviewed case\
    \ investigation and surveillance data \ncombined with the malaria foci record\
    \ “passports”, which \nincluded mapping. Programmes updated their stratifica-\n\
    tion systems from every 3 years up to every 30 years or \nmore.\nThe stratification\
    \ strategies in Mauritius, Philippines \nand Turkey outlined response activities\
    \ to be applied in \neach strata. The malaria programmes with clear strati-\n\
    fication criteria, indicators and vector control targets \nappeared to benefit\
    \ from these systems. Stratification \nwas viewed as extremely helpful by the\
    \ Philippines pro-\ngramme and in Turkey was believed to have facilitated \nappropriate\
    \ decision making for the application of vector \ncontrol. Namibia’s stratification\
    \ system allowed for tar-\ngeting of resources to priority areas; however the\
    \ risk of \nimportation and onward transmission in some areas was \nlikely underrepresented.\
    \ In Sri Lanka, epidemic forecast-\ning based on entomological surveillance identified\
    \ areas \nfor mobile surveillance clinics and focal IRS.\nProgramme action\nSome\
    \ malaria programmes were spurred to action in \nresponse to increasing transmission,\
    \ an outbreak or an \nincrease in mortality. In most cases, these events were\
    \ \ncaused by waning surveillance or control, precipitated \nby a weakening of\
    \ the surveillance and response system, \nwhich subsequently required a ramp up\
    \ of resources and \nprogramme intervention. In other cases, surges in action\
    \ \nwere the result of leadership at the national or subna-\ntional level.\nIn\
    \ several countries, a gradual decline in programme \nefforts led to outbreaks,\
    \ which in turn encouraged pro-\ngrammatic action. Turkey did not plan for potentially\
    \ \nincreasing transmission when major irrigation projects \nwere underway and\
    \ increases in migration were expected. \nThese factors contributed to an outbreak\
    \ in 1977. In \nresponse, the programme was given a larger allocation \nby the\
    \ government, surveillance agents and microsco-\npists were hired, and laboratories\
    \ received more funding. \nTurkmenistan saw an increasing level of vulnerability\
    \ to \nmalaria importation along the border with Afghanistan, \nand this risk\
    \ was compounded by delays in diagnosis, \ntreatment and reporting of malaria\
    \ cases in some rural \nareas. These factors led to an outbreak in 1998–99, the\
    \ \nresponse for which was an immediate increase in con-\nsumables for diagnosis\
    \ and chloroquine and primaquine \nfor radical treatment and chemoprophylaxis.\
    \ A reduc-\ntion in transmission followed. In Cape Verde, multi-\nple outbreaks\
    \ have occurred after IRS was reduced or \nhalted; each outbreak triggered a surge\
    \ in IRS coverage. \nThe efforts, though, were not maintained as evidenced by\
    \ \nthe locally acquired cases recorded nearly every year. In \n2006, an increase\
    \ in mortality to eight deaths led to an \ninvestigation by the Cape Verde Ministry\
    \ of Health and \ndevelopment of a new national goal of malaria elimina-\ntion\
    \ by 2020. In Malaysia, outbreaks in plantation areas \nof Sabah State stimulated\
    \ several inter-sectoral private–\npublic partnerships with plantations which\
    \ included sur-\nveillance and vector control activities.\nIn several countries,\
    \ endorsement of an elimination \ngoal by government leaders led to programme\
    \ action. \nWhen malaria elimination was adopted in the 1940s and \nre-adopted\
    \ after its resurgence in 1975, the Government \nof Mauritius organized a military-like\
    \ offensive. Philip-\npines provided a similar example, but in a highly decen-\n\
    tralized context, where in certain provinces motivated \nleaders augmented malaria\
    \ screening and other control \nefforts by increasing staff and funding for the\
    \ activities. \nIn Namibia, action was spurred by the leadership of the \nformer\
    \ Minister of Health.\nIn some countries, programme activities continued \nconsistently,\
    \ without such surges in action. After expe-\nriencing resurgence in the 1970s,\
    \ Sri Lanka maintained \nentomological and parasitological surveillance activities,\
    \ \nwhich informed programme activities and response strat-\negies. Bhutan also\
    \ had relatively consistent programme \nimplementation.\nFlexibility of malaria\
    \ programme strategies and approaches \nto problem‑solving\nSeveral countries\
    \ showed a high level of flexibility by \nintroducing new or adapting strategies,\
    \ from insecticide \nrotation to lessen the risk of insecticide resistance, to\
    \ \nan increase in parasitological screening in development \nareas to curtail\
    \ the risk of transmission, to collaborations \nwith the private sector. The case-studies\
    \ did not have \ndetailed information on the process undertaken to evalu-\nate\
    \ or adapt new strategies.\nSri Lanka, Bhutan and Malaysia showed evidence of\
    \ \nflexible programming. Sri Lanka introduced a series of \nprogramme changes\
    \ in the 1990s, including the intro-\nduction of targeted IRS to replace “blanket”,\
    \ or universal, \nspraying, partly in response to new WHO recommen-\ndations [22].\
    \ IRS insecticide rotation was introduced in \n1998, for which different types\
    \ of insecticides were used \nin bordering districts with rotation of insecticides\
    \ across \ndistricts over time in order to lessen the risk of resist-\nance. Farmer\
    \ Field Schools were developed in the late \n2000s, building awareness about the\
    \ connection between \ninsecticide use for agriculture and for disease manage-\n\
    ment. Then, between 2000 and 2011, primaquine for \nradical cure of Plasmodium\
    \ falciparum infections and \nRDTs for mobile malaria clinics were rolled out.\
    \ In 2009, \nas the country progressed toward elimination, a series \nPage 14\
    \ of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \nof changes to its parasitological\
    \ surveillance programme \nwere introduced. Bhutan similarly instituted a series\
    \ of \nsurveillance and response activities, including parasi-\ntological surveillance,\
    \ mapping and response measures \nstarting in 2013.\nThe malaria programme of\
    \ Sabah State of Malaysia \nalso showed flexibility. In the mid-1990s, Sabah State\
    \ \nresponded to the need at the community level for better \naccess to diagnosis\
    \ and treatment by recruiting and train-\ning primary health care volunteers.\
    \ In 1995, volunteers \ncollected 14 % of the blood slides taken in the state.\n\
    Adoption of an elimination goal spurred the design and \nscale up of surveillance\
    \ activities and integrated vector \nmanagement (IVM) in Turkey, to be used in\
    \ active foci \nand in emergency situations. The Ministry of Health sup-\nported\
    \ these new strategies through decrees, regulations \nand guidelines.\nTurkmenistan\
    \ showed adaptive capacity in its response \nto two outbreaks that occurred post-elimination.\
    \ A suite \nof epidemiological, treatment and entomological surveil-\nlance interventions\
    \ and policies were rapidly executed \nin response to the 1998–1999 outbreak,\
    \ along with \nmonitoring and supervision by the national programme. \nHowever\
    \ another outbreak occurred within 3  years \n(2002–2003), meaning that these\
    \ measures were likely \nnot sustained. The outbreak of 2002–2003 led to a similar\
    \ \nscale up of interventions and surveillance, and also led to \nsweeping changes\
    \ to strengthen the whole malaria con-\ntrol system starting in 2004.\nThe programme\
    \ in Mauritius appeared to stay consist-\nent over time. During the period of\
    \ resurgence, the pro-\ngramme showed flexibility in that it was able to mobilize\
    \ \na large number of staff. The Cape Verde and Namibia \ncase-studies did not\
    \ contain specific examples of flexibil-\nity in the malaria programme.\nProgramme\
    \ capacity for forward thinking\nMalaria programmes in the case-study series did\
    \ not \nshow a high level of capacity for anticipation of threats to \nelimination.\
    \ There are many examples of major develop-\nment projections that combined a\
    \ potential for increased \nreceptivity and vulnerability. In general programmes\
    \ \neither did not identify these challenges in advance there-\nfore did not have\
    \ adequate or timely responses to these \nthreats, or they were unable to secure\
    \ funding to miti-\ngate the impact. In either case, there appeared to be a \n\
    lack of coordination with other sectors. In the few exam-\nples where programmes\
    \ did work with other sectors, it \nappeared to help avoid outbreaks or epidemics.\n\
    Several malaria programmes did not anticipate the \nincreased risk of malaria\
    \ transmission posed by irri-\ngation and reservoir projects. In Sri Lanka, dam\
    \ con-\nstruction and forest clearing for rice cultivation in the \nmalaria-endemic\
    \ eastern part of the country likely \nincreased receptivity and led to the epidemic\
    \ of 1987. \nThere was no documented action by the malaria pro-\ngramme, nor was\
    \ there evidence in the case-study that \nresources were increased, to offset\
    \ these risks, and the \nepidemic grew to 687,599 cases by 1987. Reservoir con-\n\
    struction in the 1980s and 1990s in Turkmenistan also \nled to increases in receptivity\
    \ as the filtration ponds \nincreased anopheline breeding habitat. At the same\
    \ time \n(1980s), the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics\
    \ (USSR) increased population movement into \nthe country from Afghanistan, where\
    \ malaria endemicity \nwas higher. These developments contributed to the out-\n\
    breaks in the 1990s.\nThe epidemic of 1977 in Turkey, which took place only \n\
    3  years after the country reported its last indigenous \nmalaria case, was caused\
    \ in part by an extensive irrigation \nproject which increased breeding habitat\
    \ and the level of \ninternal migration from higher transmission areas in the\
    \ \neastern part of the country. However, the programme \ndid not increase its\
    \ surveillance efforts and by 1977 there \nwere 115,512 recorded Plasmodium vivax\
    \ cases. A sec-\nond epidemic occurred in 1991, even though the irriga-\ntion\
    \ canals were covered to prevent mosquito breeding. \nThe programme did not adequately\
    \ respond to large-\nscale internal migration from remote, endemic rural \nareas\
    \ into the irrigation project zone, nor account for the \nflow of migrants from\
    \ neighbouring countries, many of \nwhich were not politically stable and some\
    \ of which were \nexperiencing P. vivax epidemics. There were an inade-\nquate\
    \ number of malaria personnel in the affected areas \nand it is unclear whether\
    \ additional resources were made \navailable to the programme to stymie the risks.\
    \ Subse-\nquently, there was an increase from less than 15,000 cases \nin 1991\
    \ to more than 84,000 by 1994.\nWhen an influx of construction workers entered\
    \ Mau-\nritius after a major typhoon, a resurgence of malaria \noccurred from\
    \ zero local (since 1968) to 41 cases in 1975. \nBased on this experience, Mauritius\
    \ anticipated future \nrisk of imported malaria by implementing an extensive \n\
    border screening programme, including follow up visits \nand screening for arriving\
    \ at-risk groups and detected \npositive cases. Similar to Mauritius, an increase\
    \ in intra-\nnational and international movement in Cape Verde \noccurred as a\
    \ result of improvements in ports and air-\nports. The programme did not anticipate\
    \ the impact of \nthese projects. Bhutan’s malaria programme was rapidly \nmoving\
    \ toward elimination and was keenly aware of the \nhigh receptivity and vulnerability\
    \ along the southern \nborder with India. In addition, there were an estimated\
    \ \n35,000 documented workers in the country, the major-\nity of which were employed\
    \ in large-scale development \nprojects in the interior and southern districts.\
    \ Proactive \nPage 15 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \ncase\
    \ detection started in these development zones where \nmigrants live and work.\
    \ The programme also piloted \nCommunity Action Groups in the southern, receptive\
    \ \ndistricts that have larger migrant flows from India. These \ngroups enlisted\
    \ community support in prevention and \ncontrol of malaria.\nThe number of migrant\
    \ workers originating from high \ntransmission neighbouring countries propelled\
    \ Malay-\nsia’s Sabah State to begin collaborations with private \nsector plantations\
    \ in the early 2000s to implement and \nsurveillance of malaria to anticipate\
    \ and avoid outbreaks.\nThe Philippines planned for malaria elimination by \n\
    developing a certification process for subnational elimi-\nnation in 2011, believed\
    \ to be necessary because of the \ngeography of the country, which is composed\
    \ of many \nislands with different malaria potential.\nThe Namibia case-study\
    \ did not provide specific exam-\nples of anticipation of threats.\nMonitoring\
    \ and evaluation\nMonitoring and evaluation (M&E) includes monitoring \nprogramme\
    \ outputs, such as whether intervention cover-\nage and quality was achieved,\
    \ and evaluation of impact. \nMost case-studies described evaluation of case data\
    \ while \nsome included vector control or surveillance data. Only \ntwo programmes\
    \ emphasized the quality or coverage \nof interventions. An important part of\
    \ M&E is analysis \nand swift feedback to the periphery, which should theo-\n\
    retically stimulate effective programme response, clearly \nM&E needs to be undertaken\
    \ with a spirit of surveillance \nand response.\nOnly two case-studies highlighted\
    \ the results of moni-\ntoring and showed that the programme did not achieve \n\
    the coverage or quality targets. No case-studies included \ninformation on M&E\
    \ of inputs and outputs. The Malaysia \ncase-study gave the most comprehensive\
    \ results of inter-\nvention monitoring, showing the difficulty in achieving \n\
    coverage and timeliness of case investigation, diagnosis, \nvector control, and\
    \ the intensive passenger screening \nprogramme.\nFor other countries, case reporting\
    \ appeared to be the \nmain tool for evaluation. Bhutan checked weekly case \n\
    reports from the health facilities. The malaria programme \nfollowed up with health\
    \ facilities for missing or incom-\nplete reports, and if an increase in cases\
    \ was reported, \nthe respective health center was alerted. Namibia also \nreviewed\
    \ weekly case reporting. In recent years, roll out \nof better diagnostic tools\
    \ and coverage improved data \nquality and representation of the malaria burden.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, IRS quality was monitored after quality declined. \nA weakness\
    \ cited in the Namibia case-study was the \nlack of data and limited feedback\
    \ to the sub-national \nprogrammes.\nMalaysia developed a web-based surveillance\
    \ database \nin 2000 for M&E, which facilitated first the reporting of \nmalaria\
    \ cases, then included case investigation and vec-\ntor control intervention data\
    \ which could be monitored. \nAlso in 2000, a separate online case notification\
    \ system \nfor health providers was introduced, where private and \npublic health\
    \ facilities rapidly reported all notifiable \ninfectious diseases. The malaria\
    \ programme regularly \nreviewed data from both systems and identified and con-\n\
    tacted the hospitals, clinics, and private providers that \nfailed to notify cases.\
    \ The use of two parallel systems \ncould have been cumbersome, but the report\
    \ stated that \nthe national and state programme officers used both \ndatabases\
    \ to drive management decisions.\nThe monitoring and evaluation of malaria activities\
    \ \nin Sri Lanka was coordinated by the Regional Malaria \nOfficers (at district\
    \ level) and by the AMC Directorate \n(national level). Sri Lanka built a web-based\
    \ case infor-\nmation system in 2009, separate from the national health \ninformation\
    \ system, to ensure reporting within 24 h. The \nmalaria programme planned to\
    \ integrate the malaria \nreporting system into the national health information\
    \ \nsystem after reaching elimination. In 2010, the malaria \nprogramme introduced\
    \ a toll free hotline for private \nsector case reporting. In 2009, to increase\
    \ data analysis, \nreview and improve the feedback loop to the sub-national \n\
    programme offices the malaria programme instituted \ncase review meetings. These\
    \ meetings were attended by \nDirectorate and regional malaria programme officers,\
    \ \nwhere details of each case and follow up measures were \nreviewed, and they\
    \ provided an opportunity for feedback \nto the regional malaria officers, who\
    \ then relayed infor-\nmation back to the districts. These meetings showed an\
    \ \nopenness to review, evaluation and change by both the \nnational and regional\
    \ levels.\nThere was a lack of information on the tools and pro-\ncesses used\
    \ in Cape Verde and the Philippines for M&E.\nFor Turkey and Turkmenistan, resurgences\
    \ demon-\nstrated the weaknesses in monitoring and evaluation. \nIn Turkmenistan,\
    \ while transmission decreased when \nfunding was available and activities were\
    \ well-organized, \ndelays in diagnosis, treatment and reporting fueled the \n\
    outbreaks of 1998–99 and 2002–03. Case reporting did \nnot flow to the central\
    \ level in time for evaluation. Simi-\nlarly, in Turkey, the delayed reporting\
    \ to the provincial \nand national level contributed to the 1998–99 outbreak.\n\
    Enabling factors\nThere are many factors that enable or hinder progress \ntowards\
    \ elimination for a national malaria programme. \nPolitical commitment, funding,\
    \ and human resources \nare three key factors that have a large influence on pro-\n\
    gramme progress. These factors also determine the \nPage 16 of 21\nSmith Gueye\
    \ et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \nconsistency of malaria programme implementation.\
    \ \nTable  6 provides key learnings on enabling factors for \nmalaria programmes.\n\
    Political commitment\nDepending on the country’s level of decentralization and\
    \ \nits health system structure, political commitment at the \nnational or local\
    \ level was a driving factor for malaria \nprogramme success. Political commitment\
    \ took many \nforms, including enacting mandates or laws that sup-\nport vector\
    \ control activities and surveillance, ensuring \nadequate domestic funding and\
    \ leadership and vision \nfor elimination by national or local level leaders.\
    \ Turk-\nmenistan provides an example of the deleterious impact \nof waning political\
    \ commitment when malaria incidence \ndeclines.\nIn Mauritius, there was a high\
    \ degree of political com-\nmitment at the national level, evidenced by the con-\n\
    sistent domestic financing of the programme. National \npolicy was supportive\
    \ to elimination, contributing to a \nhigh level of participation by residents\
    \ in malaria con-\ntrol activities. There were penalties for non-compliance \n\
    and health inspectors had legal power to inspect dwell-\nings. Similarly in Malaysia,\
    \ national policies and legisla-\ntion were enacted to support elimination; for\
    \ example, \nthe malaria programme could engage in IRS and ITN \ndistribution\
    \ on private property and all foreign workers \nhad to undergo screening for malaria\
    \ before receiving \na work permit. Sabah and Sarawak States had addi-\ntional\
    \ state-level ordinances to support malaria control \nactivities.\nTurkey’s first\
    \ elimination attempt was successful in part \ndue to steady political commitment.\
    \ Turkey experienced \nan epidemic in 1977, then signed the Tashkent Declara-\n\
    tion in 2006, which outlined the strategy to achieve elimi-\nnation in nine countries\
    \ of the WHO EURO Region by \n2015. With the Declaration, the malaria programme\
    \ had \nthe necessary political support to transition toward elim-\nination in\
    \ 2008.\nThe Bhutan malaria programme also had the support \nof the Ministry of\
    \ Health—outbreak reports reached the \nPresident’s office. Namibia’s elimination\
    \ programme had \nthe support of the Minister of Health, who was the for-\nmer\
    \ manager of the malaria programme and an advocate \nfor regional elimination.\
    \ In Cape Verde, an increase in \nmalaria mortality (to eight deaths) in 2006\
    \ led to a greater \nlevel of attention of government leaders and the develop-\n\
    ment of a new elimination goal of 2020.\nNational-level political commitment for\
    \ elimination \nin Turkmenistan waned in the years leading up to the \noutbreak\
    \ in Mary Province (2002–2003). In response, \ncommitment was strengthened from\
    \ 2004 onwards, \nas evidenced by the government financing dedicated \nto malaria\
    \ in preparation for the certification process \nin 2010. The country then drew\
    \ up a comprehensive \nnational plan for prevention of reintroduction with sup-\n\
    port and commitment from the Ministry of Health and \nMedical Industry, Finance,\
    \ and intersectoral cooperation.\nIn other case-studies, commitment at the local\
    \ level \nwas considered to be a driving factor for success. Malay-\nsia’s Sabah\
    \ State developed and presented to the national \nprogramme a 5  years action\
    \ plan for malaria control, \nwhich built the case for an increase in funding,\
    \ human \nresources and development of subsector outpost offices \nin remote areas,\
    \ in addition to scaling up of vector con-\ntrol, surveillance and community-based\
    \ activities. The \nplan was successful and the state obtained funding from \n\
    the national government for 100 additional positions. As \na result, the proportion\
    \ of cases investigated increased \nfrom 40 to 87 % and malaria offices in remote\
    \ localities \nwere opened to provide microscopy, vector control, mass \nblood\
    \ surveys, and health education.\nPhilippines also provided an example of the\
    \ strength of \ncommitment at the local level. Municipalities and com-\nmunities\
    \ participated and developed civic duty and pride \nthrough malaria programme\
    \ activities, such as environ-\nmental clean-up events. The level of commitment\
    \ and \nmalaria experience of provincial managers had a large \ninfluence on the\
    \ success of the programme. For example, \nApayao and Laguna Provinces were highlighted\
    \ in the \ncase-study as having strong, knowledgeable, dedicated, \nwell-liked\
    \ and respected leaders, which drove action and \nsuccess in their provinces.\n\
    Sri Lanka’s malaria programme had commitment to \nmalaria at both national and\
    \ local levels. The malaria \nprogramme and Ministry of Health showed commitment\
    \ \nthrough the maintenance of surveillance and vector con-\ntrol in the conflict\
    \ zone. Commitment by the Ministry of \nHealth continued even with very low malaria\
    \ cases, evi-\ndenced by the maintenance of specialized malaria screen-\ning in\
    \ health facilities and continuation of entomological \nsurveillance.\nTable 6\
    \ Key learnings on enabling factors of malaria elimination programmes\n• Political\
    \ commitment at the regional, national, provincial, district, and community levels\
    \ took many forms and contributed to programme success\n• Sustained and long-term\
    \ financial commitment to the malaria programme is a key to success\n• Consistency\
    \ of malaria programmes depends on political commitment, human and financial resources,\
    \ leadership of the malaria programme and \noperational capacity of the overall\
    \ health system\nPage 17 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \nStable\
    \ and predictable funding and human resources\nStrong financial commitment has\
    \ led to strong malaria \ncontrol programmes. The case-studies showed three \n\
    examples of resurgence primarily due to a reduction \nin human and financial resources\
    \ for malaria elimina-\ntion. Some countries relied purely on domestic financ-\n\
    ing, which caused some challenges in the past but overall \nappeared to increase\
    \ the consistency of the programme \nwhen compared to countries that rely heavily\
    \ on donor \nfinancing. Of interest is the specific question regarding \nhow to\
    \ maintain funding and skills of IRS spraymen and \nother staff on needed response\
    \ activities when cases are \nvery low or reach zero.\nThree countries that have\
    \ successfully eliminated \nmalaria today had experienced resurgences after reaching\
    \ \nor nearly reaching elimination in the past, in most part \ndue to declines\
    \ in funding or human resources. Reduced \nfunding in Mauritius contributed to\
    \ the resurgence in \nthe 1970s. Inadequate financial and human resources \nled\
    \ to Turkey’s 1977 epidemic and again to the 1993–96 \nepidemic, where there were\
    \ insufficient staff and health \nfacilities in the area of a major development\
    \ project, \nand insufficient malaria expertise at the provincial level. \nThere\
    \ was a decrease in staffing in receptive and vulner-\nable areas and delays in\
    \ identification and reporting of \ncases. The lack of human and financial resources\
    \ in Turk-\nmenistan contributed to the 1998–99 outbreak as techni-\ncal skills\
    \ and declining staff were lost in the 1990s.\nPost-resurgence, these countries\
    \ built up their pro-\ngrammes in order to achieve elimination. Mauritius, \n\
    where the government funded the malaria programme, \nspent over US $2 per capita\
    \ on malaria in the period after \nthe resurgence, despite zero indigenous transmission,\
    \ in \nan effort to minimize the risk of resurgence. Per-capita \nexpenditure\
    \ during the first elimination attempt, before \nthis latest resurgence, ranged\
    \ from $6 to $3. A 100-per-\nson surveillance team and 100-person vector control\
    \ \nteam spent nearly 100  % of time on malaria-related \nactivities, a relatively\
    \ large workforce in a context of zero \nindigenous cases. After the epidemic\
    \ of 1977, Turkey \nincreased its allocation to the malaria programme with \n\
    a corresponding increase in the number of surveillance \nagents, laboratories,\
    \ and microscopists. The country \nfound that maintaining skilled personnel was\
    \ essential \nto achieve elimination and prevent resurgence through \nrapid response\
    \ to outbreaks.\nAfter the 1998–99 outbreak in Turkmenistan, an ini-\ntiative\
    \ to build up the number of epidemiologists, lab \ntechnicians, and parasitologists\
    \ began. Then, from 2005 \nto 2009, in preparation for the elimination goal, the\
    \ pro-\ngramme doubled the number of malaria staff in parasi-\ntology, entomology,\
    \ and laboratory diagnostics. By 2010, \nas mentioned previously, 11–20  % of\
    \ the government \nmalaria budget was spent on training, an indicator of the \n\
    Ministry’s efforts to maintain quality interventions. The \n2009–10 programme\
    \ costs were covered mainly by the \ngovernment.\nMalaysia has had recent success\
    \ in maintaining low \ntransmission, partly attributable to the strength of the\
    \ \nhealth system. Malaysia provided one of the few exam-\nples of a fully domestic-funded\
    \ malaria programme in the \nelimination phase, which has led to a greater degree\
    \ of \nconsistency in funding and human resources when com-\npared to other, donor-funded\
    \ programmes.\nBhutan maintained a cadre of malaria technicians, even \nduring\
    \ years of declining malaria incidence. However, \nat the time of case-study publication,\
    \ during elimina-\ntion, these technicians were to be integrated into multi-\n\
    purpose health workers. With this transition, there is a \nrisk that commitment\
    \ to malaria could wane. The case-\nstudy also reported on the importance of Global\
    \ Fund \ngrant funding (Rounds 4 and 7) for staff capacity build-\ning, development\
    \ of community leadership and action, \nand malaria prevention commodities for\
    \ hard to reach \npopulations.\nIn the Philippines, provincial manager empowerment\
    \ \nand ownership has increased consistency and increased \nfunding by local governments.\
    \ The case-study also noted \nthe importance of Global Fund and other donor funding\
    \ \nto maintain programme capacity.\nSri Lanka has had an adequate level of funding\
    \ and \nresources over time, evidenced by consistent activities \nand the maintenance\
    \ of specialized resources such as \nmalaria-only diagnostic centers in health\
    \ facilities. How-\never, there was concern noted in the case-study about \nlong-term,\
    \ sustainable funding as the country reached \nits goal of zero malaria cases,\
    \ in part because of the his-\ntorical contributing factors to the 1987 epidemic,\
    \ which \nincluded a shortage of Regional Malaria Officers. In addi-\ntion, full\
    \ time malaria programme staff decreased by 29 % \nfrom 2004 to 2009, which reduced\
    \ the number of public \nhealth field officers and IRS spraymen who were moved\
    \ \nto other positions (e.g., clerks in medical institutions, \ndrivers, assistants)\
    \ and to other disease priorities (e.g., \ndengue) and were not easily released\
    \ to work on malaria. \nThese transfers of positions were likely due to the low\
    \ \nnumber of cases where administrators did not consider it \nnecessary to maintain\
    \ a malaria control employee.\nCape Verde and Namibia provided examples of incon-\n\
    sistent funding and human resources. Cape Verde has \nreceived funding from the\
    \ Global Fund and the Gov-\nernment of Spain. However, shortages in trained human\
    \ \nresources for health and malaria control have continued \nto constrain the\
    \ programme, evidenced by the single pro-\nfessional running the entire malaria\
    \ programme at the \nnational level.\nPage 18 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar\
    \ J  (2016) 15:488 \nSimilarly, human resources and funding in Namibia \nwere\
    \ not considered adequate, even with the donor fund-\ning. There were vacant positions\
    \ at every level, which \nled to a reactive rather than a proactive and planned\
    \ \napproach. Staff turnover translated to an increased \nworkload.\nConsistency\
    \ of programme implementation\nConsistency of programme implementation over time\
    \ \ndepends on the level of political commitment, human \nand financial resources,\
    \ and leadership of the malaria \nprogramme. It also depends on the operational\
    \ capacity \nof the programme and the overall health system struc-\nture. Comparing\
    \ the consistency, coverage and quality \nof interventions across the countries\
    \ in the case-studies \nproved challenging, as these aspects of the programmes\
    \ \nwere not adequately documented. Changes in leadership, \ncommitment and funding\
    \ levels led to decreased consist-\nency in some programmes. In three cases, programmes\
    \ \nwere consistent, leading to major reductions in malaria \nincidence, which\
    \ precipitated a lower level of commit-\nment and attention to the malaria programme\
    \ and a low-\nering of quality and coverage of the programme. In these \ncases,\
    \ resurgence was around the corner, and instigated a \nrise in programme quality\
    \ and coverage.\nTurkey had success in its first elimination attempt in \npart\
    \ due to the experienced, specialized network that car-\nried out operations.\
    \ Turkmenistan’s outbreak of 1998–99 \nwas partly due to a weakening of the surveillance\
    \ sys-\ntem. Post-outbreak, the malaria programme ramped up \ntraining, surveillance\
    \ and vector control activities, and \nensured the supply of malaria control stocks\
    \ well after \nthe outbreak was contained.\nSuccess in maintaining low cases in\
    \ Malaysia, Bhutan \nand Sri Lanka was partly attributed in the case-studies to\
    \ \nthe strength of the health system and available infrastruc-\nture, including\
    \ consistent availability of supplies, even in \nthe conflict affected districts\
    \ of Sri Lanka. However, in \nMalaysia, the high turnover of leadership in the\
    \ disease \ncontrol programme translated to a loss of institutional \nmalaria\
    \ knowledge and may have impacted the quality of \nimplementation.\nFinancial\
    \ and political support in Mauritius allowed for \nconsistency of implementation,\
    \ even in the POR phase. \nFor example, the passenger screening programme was\
    \ \nmaintained, which continued to draw human and finan-\ncial resources during\
    \ a period of zero local transmission.\nThe Cape Verde and Namibia case-studies\
    \ did not \nreport a consistent level of malaria activity implemen-\ntation. Both\
    \ programmes had inadequate IRS coverage \nand quality at times. Restructuring\
    \ of the programme \nand health system multiple times in the Philippines led \n\
    to gaps in coverage of interventions, which affected \nprogramme performance.\
    \ The case-study emphasized \nthe role of the provincial manager in driving programme\
    \ \nconsistency through ownership, initiative and expertise.\nDiscussion\nThis\
    \ paper reviewed nine case-studies examining \nmalaria eliminating programmes\
    \ and found that these \nprogrammes operated in highly diverse and challeng-\n\
    ing ecological, epidemiological, financial, political, and \norganizational contexts.\
    \ However, despite this diver-\nsity, commonalities and learning points were identified\
    \ \nthat can help programme managers, policy makers and \nfunders improve the\
    \ functioning of malaria elimination \nprogrammes. Malaria programmes that were\
    \ successful \nin eliminating malaria or greatly reducing malaria inci-\ndence\
    \ had the following characteristics: clear lines of \naccountability and some\
    \ degree of verticality in the pro-\ngramme; sustained political commitment and\
    \ funding; \na high degree of flexibility and adaptation to changing \ncircumstances\
    \ and tools; and multi-sector collabora-\ntions that facilitated response to threats\
    \ of outbreak and \nresurgence.\nThe analysis of case-studies was limited by several\
    \ \nfactors. The original case-studies were based on retro-\nspective data collection,\
    \ and the quality of data varied \nacross topics and themes across the case-studies.\
    \ Data \ncollection for the case-studies was broad, covering all \nmalaria control\
    \ strategies and activities and across many \ndecades, meaning that detailed information\
    \ on pro-\ngramme management strategies was not available for \nevery case-study\
    \ nor for every year covered in the data \ncollection process. Furthermore, each\
    \ final case-study \nreport underwent a major review and editing process, \nwhich\
    \ may have introduced errors, deleted concepts or \nchanged perspectives. Due\
    \ to financial and time con-\nstraints, a second round of in-country visits, key\
    \ inform-\nant interviews and record review were not conducted \nfor this cross-case\
    \ analysis. Because of these limitations, \nrelevant and helpful information or\
    \ experience from \nnational malaria programmes may not be represented in \nthis\
    \ analysis.\nThe comparative analysis distilled experience on the \ncore components\
    \ of programme management thought \nto be essential to accelerating towards global\
    \ eradica-\ntion. However, the analysis was unable to make specific \nrecommendations\
    \ on what did or did not lead to coun-\ntry progress towards elimination due to\
    \ differences in \nthe malaria programmes that exist beyond programme \nmanagement.\
    \ What was possible was to determine how \nmalaria programmes handled challenges\
    \ that were out-\nside of their sphere of influence, partially under the influ-\n\
    ence of programme, or completely under the influence of \nthe programme.\nPage\
    \ 19 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \nMalaria programmes faced\
    \ several obstacles over which \nthey had very little control. A major challenge\
    \ was oper-\nating in a decentralized and integrated health system, \nwhere, in\
    \ most cases, provincial or district health offices \ncontrolled malaria resources\
    \ and implementation with-\nout defined, clear roles and responsibilities. The\
    \ experi-\nence and knowledge base at the national programme was \nno longer utilized\
    \ as it was in the past, and oftentimes \nthe provincial offices did not have\
    \ adequate training in \nthe beginning of these transitions. Thus the subnational\
    \ \nsystems were not able to develop and implement tailored \nsurveillance and\
    \ response systems that are able to deal \nwith the heterogeneity of transmission\
    \ that occurs in \nelimination settings. In an integrated programme, diag-\nnosis\
    \ and treatment were provided by the general health \nservices, generally by those\
    \ without malaria expertise. \nFor countries where decentralization or integration\
    \ will \nbe implemented, evidence suggests that integration must \nbe gradual\
    \ and well-planned. District officers must have \nadequate training and supervision\
    \ and health workers \nneed preparation and motivation to assist with malaria\
    \ \ncontrol. If possible, malaria programmes should advocate \nfor sustaining\
    \ some elements of verticality, such as mul-\ntipurpose malaria-focused workers,\
    \ to ensure sufficient \nattention to malaria. These positions can support non-\n\
    specialists in the general health system and increase the \nquality of services\
    \ [23].\nStronger malaria programmes have clear accountability \nby identifying\
    \ who is responsible for achieving elimina-\ntion, but this clarity can be challenging\
    \ in an integrated \nand decentralized context. Experience from other dis-\nease\
    \ eradication programmes found that designating a \nresponsible central unit or\
    \ an individual ensures leader-\nship and coordination [24, 25]. National and\
    \ state-level \nelimination plans are also helpful. A multi-sectoral task \nforce,\
    \ at the state or provincial level, ensures engagement \nfrom ministries and experts\
    \ from other disciplines [24, \n25]. Lastly, malaria programmes should seek to\
    \ empower \nand increase authority of local level staff to ensure strong \nengagement\
    \ and ownership of the malaria programme. \nBuilding management skills at the\
    \ lower levels is one way \nto empower staff [26]. Implementing monthly case review\
    \ \nmeetings, convened by the national programme, where \ndistrict level officers\
    \ work together to interpret outcomes \nand identify lessons to improve daily\
    \ practice, is a form of \norganizational learning and supportive supervision.\n\
    Malaria programmes have a degree of control over \nmalaria programme capacity,\
    \ supervision and motiva-\ntion of workers. The productivity of workers and quality\
    \ \nof services provided are critical to programme perfor-\nmance and both rely\
    \ on staff capacity [26]. In most out-\nbreaks or resurgences documented in the\
    \ case-studies, \ncontributing factors were inadequate staff, insufficient \n\
    training and low-quality supervision. Experience from \nthe malaria and smallpox\
    \ eradication programmes has \nshown the necessity of adequate personnel that\
    \ are \nwell-trained, supervised, motivated, and capable of \nflexible action,\
    \ evaluation and problem solving [4, 24]. \nThus, training programmes must include\
    \ both techni-\ncal and operational components; on-the-job training, \nwith emphasis\
    \ on supervision and coordination [27]. \nProgrammes can also consider shifting\
    \ resources to con-\ntinuing education and development, as large investments \n\
    in training are often lost when there is no maintenance \n[26, 27]. Continuing\
    \ education can also improve reten-\ntion by incentivizing and motivating personnel.\
    \ Supervi-\nsion is also critical to programme quality, in particular for \ndecentralized\
    \ and integrated disease programmes and for \nthose that depend on high quality\
    \ surveillance activities \nthat are field-based [21, 28]. Good supervision requires\
    \ \nupdated job descriptions with clear descriptions of roles \nand responsibilities\
    \ [29]. While supervision usually takes \nthe form of peripheral visits and checking\
    \ information \nand supplies, monthly review meetings are another way \nto supervise\
    \ and also facilitate peer-to-peer learning and \nexchange [24]. Problem solving\
    \ and feedback, in particu-\nlar supportive feedback, are important parts of supervi-\n\
    sion and build worker motivation [21].\nThe case-studies showed that malaria elimination\
    \ \nworkers are a diverse group, including paid and volunteer \nhealth workers,\
    \ malaria programme and hospital staff, \nseasonal employees, and multi-sector\
    \ partners. These \npersonnel have different values and are motivated by dif-\n\
    ferent factors. For paid staff, a basic motivation package \nshould be ensured,\
    \ including reasonable level and tim-\ning of pay, working environments, potential\
    \ for learn-\ning career advancement, and system capacities [26, 27]. \nMalaria\
    \ programmes may be able to lobby their Ministry \nto ensure there is a basic\
    \ package in place. Malaria pro-\ngrammes can also build forums for professionals\
    \ to asso-\nciate and learn from each other, and develop criteria for \ncareer\
    \ advancement based on performance [17]. Perhaps \nmost important, motivation\
    \ is high when there is a clear \ngoal and endpoint—malaria programmes can clarify\
    \ their \nstrategy and milestones, bringing the team along with \nthem [24].\n\
    Malaria programmes have control over their efforts to \nimprove the level of political\
    \ commitment and funding, \nprogramme strategy and collaborations for malaria\
    \ elimi-\nnation. Political commitment at the global and national \nlevel is needed\
    \ for elimination, as very well evidenced by \nexperience from smallpox and polio\
    \ eradication [24, 29]. \nReliable financial commitment is also needed, from both\
    \ \ndomestic and international sources [2, 23]. Throughout \nthe case-studies,\
    \ the declaration of a national or sub-\nnational elimination goal often sparked\
    \ and sustained \nPage 20 of 21\nSmith Gueye et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:488 \n\
    political commitment and increased funding. In some \ncases, regional or global\
    \ forums catalyzed support for a \nnational elimination goal, through building\
    \ awareness \nand friendly competition amongst countries.\nThe case-studies did\
    \ not sufficiently document strategic \nplan development and their adjustments\
    \ and adaptation, \nstratification and targeting of interventions. Targeting \n\
    requires access to and analysis of real-time information \nwith built-in feedback\
    \ mechanism to the field where \nimplementation decisions are made. Smallpox eradica-\n\
    tion experience shows that developing and using a min-\nimum set of indicators\
    \ will likely improve data use and \nutility in the field [24]. Targeted implementation\
    \ and \nsupervision is possible when good quality and real-time \ninformation\
    \ is available [28].\nThere is a risk that elimination programmes are not \nflexible\
    \ enough to adapt to conditions that continuously \nevolve as a country approaches\
    \ zero local malaria cases. \nInstead of a ‘business as usual’ attitude, successful\
    \ pro-\ngrammes in the case-studies constantly adapted new \ntechniques and tools.\
    \ Awareness and use of new tools \nis facilitated by having access to published\
    \ and grey lit-\nerature and to forums that bring together countries and \npartners\
    \ to share experiences. In addition, strong pro-\ngrammes identified evolving\
    \ threats to elimination, such \nas major development projects, and worked with\
    \ other \nMinistries and the private sector to minimize the risks. In \nsome cases,\
    \ effective collaborations can entail contract-\ning out services to private companies\
    \ or NGOs.\nConclusion\nGlobal malaria eradication will require well-managed \n\
    malaria programmes providing high quality implementa-\ntion of evidence-based\
    \ strategies, founded upon strong \nsurveillance and response strategies tailored\
    \ to the sub-\nnational level transmission context, with adequate fund-\ning and\
    \ human resources to sustain malaria elimination \nand prevention of reintroduction.\
    \ A first step toward \nachieving this goal is to align national malaria operational\
    \ \nplans, broken down to the subnational level, with the \ncurrent operational\
    \ and implementation guides, the GTS \nand the AIM. Roles and responsibilities\
    \ at each level and \nacross agencies must be clarified, including the multi-\n\
    sectoral collaborators that will be integral to achieving \nelimination.\nManagement\
    \ of malaria programmes may be enhanced \nby further training in supervision and\
    \ management skills. \nThe most technically savvy workers typically lack man-\n\
    agement experience [24]. An assessment of management \npractices and skills specific\
    \ for malaria elimination may \nbe helpful, in addition to workshops on organizational\
    \ \nlearning, problem solving, and financial management \nwhich can build morale\
    \ in addition to skills [27, 30].\nBased on evidence from other disease eradication\
    \ pro-\ngrammes, there is a need to develop a minimum set of \nindicators that\
    \ relate to elimination and eradication goals. \nMalaria programmes must have\
    \ well-functioning real-time \ninformation systems and capacity for analysis with\
    \ timely \nfeedback to the field. Programme planning and targeting \nwill not\
    \ happen without access to good data and analysis.\nLastly, as seen from the gaps\
    \ in information and evi-\ndence provided in the case-studies, it is clear that\
    \ national \noperational plans must be accompanied by a portfolio of \ncontext-specific,\
    \ programme management-related opera-\ntional/implementation research that the\
    \ programme will \nuse to adapt and adjust strategies and interventions to \n\
    achieve the highest level of impact. There are still impor-\ntant gaps in evidence,\
    \ such as how effective supervision \nis carried out, how workers are best motivated,\
    \ and how \nto improve performance and retention of health work-\ners in resource-constrained\
    \ environments [21]. There are \nalso evidence gaps on incentives and their use,\
    \ in particu-\nlar when working with community health workers [26]. \nImplementation\
    \ of evidence-based, updated strategies \nalong with building management and supervisory\
    \ skills \nwill move malaria programmes towards elimination and \nsupport steady\
    \ progress towards global eradication.\nAbbreviations\nAIM: Action and Investment\

    Abstract— Sustainability is a normative concept, building on \nideas such as justice,\
    \ equity and responsibility, and based on \nhuman culture and society. Computers,\
    \ internet, and the \ntechnologies that are central in our network society embed\
    \ also \nnormative values and are part of a cultural context. But the work \n\
    looking at computer technologies and sustainability has been \nmostly oriented\
    \ towards either calculating the impact of \ntechnology or using technology as\
    \ a tool for solving practical \nproblems. ICT is seen as a neutral system to\
    \ be used or study, \nwhile the more normative aspects are mostly overlooked.\
    \ This \npaper explores some of the problems arising from these \noverlooked normative\
    \ values, such as focusing only on \nquantifiable problems while forgetting other\
    \ aspects that may be \nas important but not easy to put in numbers, or trusting\
    \ too \nmuch in numbers while hiding assumption and model choices. \nThis paper\
    \ suggests that more critical reflection on these \nquestions is needed in the\
    \ research area, as well as developing \nmore connections with existing research\
    \ on these topics in more \ntraditional disciplines. \n \nIndex Terms—ICT4S, data,\

    Sustainability is a normative concept, building on ideas \nsuch as justice, equity\
    \ and responsibility, and based on human \nculture and society. The most cited\
    \ definition comes from the \nBrundtland's report for the UN World Commission\
    \ on \nEnvironment and Development: “development that meets the \nneeds of the\
    \ present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their\
    \ needs” [1]. The key point in this \ndefinition is bringing together environmental\
    \ and humanitarian \nconcerns under the concept of equity (between and within\
    \ \ngenerations). It includes the concept of needs and human \nwellbeing, in particular\
    \ focusing on the world's poor, and the \nidea of limits on the environment ability\
    \ to meet these needs. It \nframes the environmental problems not as something\
    \ external \nto human society, but as a basis for our future. It includes the\
    \ \nrealization that the social and economic systems are not \nindependent of\
    \ the environment, but embedded in it, and that \nthese systems have to take into\
    \ account that we live on a \nlimited planet. Sustainability is different than\
    \ most other topics \nin science and engineering and can be defined as a “wicked\
    \ \nproblem” [2]. Wicked problems are problems that contain \nparadoxes, \nconflicts,\
    \ \nchanging \nrequirement, \ncomplex \ninterdependencies and that cannot be easily\
    \ modeled by \ntraditional scientific approaches [3]. Sustainability research\
    \ and \npractice makes extensive use of modeling tools and quantitative \ntechniques\
    \ such as life cycle assessment (LCA) [4] that may \nseem less normative, but\
    \ that embed also political ideological \nand ethical values [5].  \nICT for sustainability\
    \ (ICT4S) is a growing research area \nexploring the use of information technologies\
    \ with a \nsustainability purpose [6]. Most ICT4S research has focused \neither\
    \ on understanding the negative direct impacts of hardware \nsuch as energy use\
    \ of internet [7,8,9] and the generation of e-\nwaste [10], or on the applications\
    \ of using the technologies \nwith a sustainability purpose, such as increasing\
    \ the efficiency \nof systems and increasing dematerialization [11] or triggering\
    \ \nbehavioral change [12]. Computer technologies are treated \neither as a system\
    \ to be understood, or as tools that can be used \nfor some purpose. This paper\
    \ argues that this focus on \ncomputers as tools, without reflecting upon the\
    \ bias coming \nfrom their cultural context and history, creates problems and\
    \ \nblindspots that are worth bringing attention to. First the paper \npresents\
    \ the focus on quantitative data, central to the \naffordances provided by computer\
    \ technologies, as a key \ncomponent of ICT4S. Second, it discusses new characteristics\
    \ \nand approaches that ICT is adding to how we work with \nsustainability work.\
    \ Based on these, this paper explores some \nof the risks and blindspots of the\
    \ focus on metrics and \nquantitative data in the context of a wicked normative\
    \ problem \nsuch as sustainability. Finally, some proposals for contributions\
    \ \nand further research in this topic are proposed. \nII. IT’S ALL ABOUT THE\
    \ DATA \nIt can be argued that the applications and research in the \narea of\
    \ ICT for Sustainability are for the most part based on the \ncreation, processing\
    \ and communication of quantitative \nsustainability data [13]. This is not unexpected,\
    \ as logic and \narithmetic calculations are historically main tasks computers\
    \ \nwere created for. This text presents efficiency and behavioral \nchange as\
    \ two main topics of ICT4S that represent this focus \non quantitative data. Efficiency\
    \ is one of the key concepts that \nare heavily mentioned in the literature of\
    \ ICT for Sustainability \n[14]. Reports such as Smart2020 [11], and Greener and\
    \ Smarter \n[15], point out efficiency as the most important contribution \nthat\
    \ ICT can make to sustainability, and even as a central part \n2nd International\
    \ Conference on ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S 2014) \n© 2014. The authors - Published\
    \ by Atlantis Press\n148\nin achieving a more sustainable society in general.\
    \ In the \ncontext of ICT4S, efficiency usually means the use of ICT for \noptimizing\
    \ a system or a process with a sustainability purpose, \nfor instance reducing\
    \ the amount of energy and materials \nrequired for delivering a service or the\
    \ greenhouse gases \nproduced when creating a product. ICT has always been used\
    \ \nto increase efficiency, specially time-efficiency, accelerating \nexisting\
    \ processes [16]. This acceleration is the defining \ncharacteristic of the impact\
    \ of ICT in society, and as Castells \n[17] argues, one of the pillars of the\
    \ information society. The \ncurrent discourse in ICT4S uses the terms smart or\
    \ smarter, \narguing that by measuring and controlling parameters, ICT can \n\
    tune and automate existing systems, reducing emissions and \nresource consumption\
    \ while maintaining or increasing utility. \nExamples of this include the topics\
    \ of smart cities, smart grids, \nsmart appliances, intelligent transport systems\
    \ and smart \nlogistics. Smart grid is representative for how ICT is being \n\
    applied for sustainability related efficiency. Information \ntechnologies are\
    \ used to improve the actual electricity grid \nsystem, for instance routing power\
    \ more efficiently, reducing \nthe need for excess capacity and allowing two-way\
    \ real time \ninformation exchange between producers and customers for \nreal\
    \ time demand side management. Smart grid has been \nsuggested as the single most\
    \ important application of ICT for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions  [11].\
    \ Intelligent transport \nsystems (ITS) is also a very active research area where\
    \ the \noptimization potential of ICT is being explored, including the \noptimization\
    \ of storage and transportation of goods [11]. ICT \napplications that are suggested\
    \ to increase efficiency include \ninventory reduction, eco-driving, route optimization\
    \ and \nintermodal shifts. A particular example is the computer models \nused\
    \ by Japan National Institute of Informatics for calculating \nthe best possible\
    \ delivery route between different stores and \nproviders, creating both economical\
    \ and environmental savings \n[18]. Efficiency measures are also being applied\
    \ to other fields, \nsuch as agriculture. For instance ICT based smart irrigation\
    \ \nsystems to reduce water usage and carbon emissions by \ncontext-aware watering\
    \ schedules, using weather data and/or \nsoil moisture and evapotranspiration\
    \ sensing [19]. \nAnother central theme of ICT for sustainability is the use of\
    \ \ntechnology for supporting or triggering behavioral change \ntowards sustainability.\
    \ This includes research on eco-feedback, \npersuasive technologies, ambient awareness\
    \ and pervasive and \nparticipatory sensing. This kind of research is most prominent\
    \ \nin the area of Sustainable HCI. Di Salvo et al [12] in their \nsurvey of the\
    \ research area found that 70% of the publication \ncorpus on sustainable HCI\
    \ was on persuasive and ambient \nawareness. A main concept in research about\
    \ behavioral \nchange is using technology for “making the invisible visible”.\
    \ \nInformation technology is used to visualize and communicate \ndata that is\
    \ relevant for sustainability such as energy use, water \nuse or carbon dioxide\
    \ emissions [20]. This is seen as a \nprecondition for acting and increasing sustainability:\
    \ if it's \nvisible, it's actionable and then it can be made sustainable [21].\
    \ \nSome examples of applications and research looking at these \ntopics include:\
    \ research on energy meters for visualizing \nenergy consumption at home; the\
    \ use of competition and other \npersuasive techniques for reducing energy consumption;\
    \ \nprojects making energy visible, such as transparent screens \nshowing a metaphorical\
    \ tree representing energy consumption, \npower cords that make electricity consumption\
    \ visible, and \nlamps that reward low energy use [22,23]; visualization of \n\
    water usage at home using a LED lights  display in the shower \n[24]; visualization\
    \ of carbon dioxide impact in the supply chain \nof products [25]. \nMany efficiency\
    \ and behavioral change applications are \nbased on the gathering, processing\
    \ and visualization of metrics. \nEfficiency and smart solutions use ICT for gathering\
    \ \ninformation, processing it and analyzing more optimal \nsolutions, automating\
    \ processes based on the data, and getting \nfeedback from the changes. Behavioral\
    \ change applications are \nin many cases (not all) based on providing quantitative\
    \ \nfeedback (either directly or in some persuasive way such as in \ngames) to\
    \ the users to help them make better decisions and \nincrease their awareness\
    \ about the impact of their actions. \nUsing ICT for efficiency and behavioral\
    \ change provides \nopportunities and solutions that can have a positive impact\
    \ in \nsustainability. It could even be said that they are necessary. It is \n\
    difficult to change something if there is no feedback of the \nstarting state\
    \ and of how the actions performed affect it. But the \nimplicit emphasis on “what\
    \ can be measured” creates problems \nand blindspots that are worth discussing,\
    \ both for minimizing \nthe risks and for opening up new opportunities that may\
    \ be \nhidden. \nIII. NEW DATA APPROACHES \nThe use of new information technologies\
    \ in quantitative data \nalso adds special characteristics that differ from the\
    \ way \n“traditional” methods in sustainability information, in \npractices such\
    \ as LCA and environmental impact analysis. \nThese characteristics show how the\
    \ application of new \ntechnologies and approaches from ICT can transform (and\
    \ is \nalready transforming) how data is created, shared and \nvisualized in sustainability\
    \ practice [13,26,27]: \nA. Bottom up automatic data \nThe use of new technologies\
    \ such as pervasive sensing, \nmachine-readable data, and open licenses, together\
    \ with new \napproaches such as crowdsourcing and mashups, are changing \nhow\
    \ data is created and collected. These approaches can \nchange how sustainability\
    \ data is created, from a mostly \nmanual way to a more automated and bottom-up\
    \ approach, \nwhere bigger amounts of data can be processed in a more \nprogrammatic\
    \ style. With the exponential increase on the \nworld's capacity to store, communicate\
    \ and compute \ninformation and the increase of data availability connected to\
    \ \nthe physical world, the same approach could be applied to \nother products\
    \ and services.  \nCrowdsourcing is also relevant in this context, as it changes\
    \ \nthe way data can be collected to a more social bottom-up \napproach. Relevant\
    \ examples using crowdsourcing in a \nsustainability context include the gathering\
    \ of weather data \n149\n[28], the track of deforestation using satellite pictures1,\
    \ or \ninformation about supply chains [25]. Pervasive sensing is \nanother technology\
    \ that can enable the automatic gathering of \ndata. Examples of sustainability-oriented\
    \ projects exploring \nthis are: PEIR, an application from CENS at UCLA that tracks\
    \ \nthe user's location and movements using GPS and calculates \nthe CO2 impact\
    \ and the exposure to air pollution [29], and Air \nQuality Egg2, an open source\
    \ crowdfunded sensor that can \ntrack NO2 and CO concentrations as indicators\
    \ of air pollution. \nB. Real time and dynamic feedback \nOther important characteristic\
    \ is the use of real time and \ndynamic feedback that is up to date with the latest\
    \ data \navailable. This is in contrast with existing sustainability \napproaches,\
    \ such as LCA, where environmental information is \nmainly collected either in\
    \ a static, retroactive process or in a \nprognosis, scenario based approach.\
    \ Smart energy meters, that \nallow real time feedback of electricity consumption,\
    \ are a \nrepresentative example of this shift towards real time, and they \n\
    are one of the key technologies used in many ICT4S \nbehavioral change applications\
    \ such as in ambient awareness \nprojects [20,30]. This acceleration of time is\
    \ one of the main \ncharacteristics of ICT and its impact in society [17]. \n\
    C. Transparency and openness \nMuch of the existing sustainability data is published\
    \ in \ncommercial databases or expensive journal articles where the \npublic does\
    \ not have access to it, and/or written in paper or in \na text document where\
    \ a computer service cannot access it. \nApplying open licenses and machine-readable\
    \ formats to \nsustainability data can make the information more accessible \n\
    to the general public, and the machine-readability makes \npossible to easily\
    \ reuse existing data fostering new \ninnovations. There are initiatives working\
    \ in this direction. \nExamples include Earthster3, an upcoming LCA tool with\
    \ \nfocus on open source and visualization, AMEE4 a UK \ncompany that provide\
    \ environmental data in a machine-\nreadable API, ELCD5, a European LCA database\
    \ that is \naccessible for free in machine-readable XML format, and \nOpenLCA,\
    \ an open source LCA modeling software [31]. \nD. Dynamic visualization \nNew\
    \ technologies are increasing the possibilities of making \nthe visualization\
    \ more dynamic and interactive. Applications \nsuch as Webenergy6, HelsinkiCO27,\
    \ and Carbon.to [32], \nexplore this space, allowing users to interact with \n\
    environmental impact analysis, letting the users to change \nparameters of the\
    \ impact assessment and play with the results, \n                            \

    \ for better \ncommunication of quantitative information. \nE. User-driven innovation\
    \ \nThe affordances of information technologies are broadening \ninnovation [33],\
    \ and innovation is now driven not only by \nprofessionals, but also by end users\
    \ and amateurs. In the case \nof sustainability practice, the increasing availability\
    \ of data in \nopen and machine-readable formats makes it possible to \nvisualize,\
    \ transform, and remix different datasets, and to \ngenerate new innovative usages\
    \ outside the sustainability \npractice community [34]. Another key difference\
    \ of this \ndemocratization of innovation is the openness of the process, \nas\
    \ user innovations are usually freely revealed [33], which \nmakes them easier\
    \ to spread and to be adopted and adapted. \nIV. DATA BLINDNESS \nThe focus on\
    \ quantitative data together with the \ntransformative ways of working with data\
    \ using new \ninformation technologies create new risks and challenges, \nwhich\
    \ I group as “data blindness”, or the risk of trusting only \nor too much in data.\
    \ \nA. Trusting only on data \nWhile we have this focus on quantitative data,\
    \ we have to \nremember that sustainability is a “wicked problem”, not easily\
    \ \nreduced to numbers and explicitly normative. One side of this \nproblem is\
    \ that a data-driven approach focuses de-facto on \nparts of sustainability that\
    \ are possible or easy to quantify, \nwhile other areas that are more challenging\
    \ to put numbers on \nare neglected. This can be seen in the focus on energy and\
    \ CO2 \nemissions in many studies, for instance in the majority of life \ncycle\
    \ assessments of ICT [7,35], while other problems such as \ntoxicity do not get\
    \ the same attention. This can also be argued \nin the case of behavioral change\
    \ interventions, the focus on \nwhat can be measured means that there is an overrepresentation\
    \ \nof projects working for instance with electricity consumption, \nwhile other\
    \ areas that may be bigger but difficult to calculate, \nsuch as the impact of\
    \ the production of consumer goods, are \nnot being explored. \nThe focus on quantitative\
    \ data and real-time information \ncan create also a kind of time-shortsightedness.\
    \ The \nquantitative nature of the data makes it difficult to look at long-\n\
    term developments concerning the future, as there is no \nmeasured data for it.\
    \ Höjer et al. [36] argue that this is a \ncommon problem for environmental system\
    \ analysis tools, and \nthat there is a need for more prospective thinking and\
    \ \nintegrating with future studies. The real-time focus of ICT can \naccentuate\
    \ this problem, as data becomes more immediate and \nthere is less room for reflection\
    \ than in traditional \nenvironmental system analysis tools.  \nBrynjarsdóttir\
    \ et al. [37] discuss some of these problems in \nthe context of sustainable HCI,\
    \ connecting them to the culture \nof modernism, which “trust that formal, rational\
    \ methods \ncapture essentially everything that matters about a given \nsituation”.\
    \ They argue that this axiom of modernism is central \nto many of the persuasion\
    \ and behavior change projects in \nsustainable HCI, and that it narrows the view\
    \ of sustainability \n150\nassuming that the users are individuals maximizing\
    \ utility \nbased on information. They suggest that there should be a shift \n\
    to more reflection instead of prescription, and to a focus on \nsocial and cultural\
    \ practices instead of on individuals. \nB. Trusting too much on data \nAnother\
    \ problem of the focus on quantifiable data is how to \ndeal with uncertainty\
    \ and assumptions. Data such as \nenvironmental impact analysis or carbon footprints\
    \ include \nmany assumptions and modeled data, it has uncertainties and it \n\
    may not be relevant for the specific case at hand. This is \nchallenging to present\
    \ and the quantitative data may lead to a \nfalse sense of exactness, as it is\
    \ argued by Koomey et al \n[38].  These uncertainties are not a specific problem\
    \ of ICT4S, \nbut a general problem in environmental system analysis such as \n\
    LCAs, related to poor data quality, use of aggregated data and \nwrong assumptions\
    \ [39]. The assumptions in the model can \nalso be influenced by the creators’\
    \ values, while these choices \nremain mostly invisible to the users of the model.\
    \ A classical \nexample used is how the game SimCity simulates taxes so low-\n\
    taxes systems work better than more welfare oriented, thus \ncommunicating these\
    \ values to the game users as they learn by \nsimulation [40]. This blindness\
    \ to the shortcoming of modeling \ntools is connected to the modernity values\
    \ of calculability and \npredictability, the belief that everything can be numerically\
    \ \ncomputed and that we can know beforehand the outcome of \nactions [41], in\
    \ contrast with the wicked nature of \nsustainability, \nwhich \nincludes \nparadoxes,\
    \ \ncomplex \ninterdependencies and changing requirements.  \nThe problem with\
    \ uncertainties and model assumption is \naccentuated when using computer technologies\
    \ that use \nautomatic calculation, crowdsourcing, or mashup and lack the \ntextual\
    \ space for analysis and discussion available in LCAs \npublished as scientific\
    \ articles. This produces new challenges \nthat will need to be explored on how\
    \ to work, calculate and \ncommunicate the uncertainties in the results. An example\
    \ can \nbe seen in Greenalytics, a web application that uses machine-\nreadable\
    \ data and APIs to calculate dynamically the carbon \nfootprint of websites using\
    \ a mashup approach [42]. It provides \nat first sight a very accurate result\
    \ in kilograms or tons of CO2 \nwith decimal points. It includes a disclaimer,\
    \ explaining the \nuncertainties and how the result is not an accurate value but\
    \ a \nbest approximation based on the existing data. The details of \nhow the\
    \ numbers are calculated and the assumptions made are \nalso presented. But this\
    \ result includes many uncertainties and \nassumptions, and communicating these\
    \ is a challenge [42]. \nC. Trusting in the wrong data \nAnother facet if the\
    \ same problem is trusting in the wrong \ndata. Models are imperfect, and when\
    \ an impact is measured \nand optimized there might be rebound effects outside\
    \ the \nboundaries of the model. When increasing the efficiency of a \nsystem,\
    \ metrics are used to measure the efficiency, but this \nmeans that it is only\
    \ the measured metric that will be \noptimized, even if the result for the end\
    \ goal can be actually \nnegative. Hilty et al. [43] explores this problem with\
    \ efficiency, \nmeaning that the efficiency gains of using ICT have been eaten\
    \ \nup by rebound effects resulting in increasing output, not in \nreducing input.\
    \ These rebound effects can be created by the \nchoice of what is measured, in\
    \ the case of efficiency it is \nusually the ratio not the total amount. A rebound\
    \ effect is the \nlost gains in efficiency of technological progress due to that\
    \ \ncost reduction leads to increased consumption of the same \nservice, and/or\
    \ increase in other spending due to higher income \nand systemic macro-economic\
    \ effects [44]. This is not \nexclusive to ICT, but endemic to efficiency. A classical\
    \ \nexample is provided by Allenby [45], where he shows how cars \nhave increased\
    \ in fuel efficiency, but the total impact of cars \nhave grown as cars are bigger\
    \ and faster, there are many more \ncars and we drive them more. Hilty argues\
    \ that using ICT for \nefficiency measures is not an enough precondition for saving\
    \ \nresources, but that sufficiency measures, focusing on the total \namount that\
    \ is needed instead of on the efficiency ratio [46], \nand restricting input and\
    \ output are needed in order to avoid \nthese unwanted rebound effects [45]. \n\
    V. REFLECTIONS \nA focus of ICT4S research in quantitative data comes \nnaturally\
    \ from the affordances provided by ICT and by the \nimplicit values of modernity.\
    \ ICT have developed from \ncomputing tools and have transformed the way we can\
    \ manage \nquantitative information, allowing the processing and storage \nof\
    \ amounts of data that were unthinkable before. The values of \nmodernity and\
    \ informationalism focus also on the use models \nand metrics as a way, or the\
    \ way, of understanding and \ncontrolling systems and nature. The use of quantitative\
    \ data in \nICT4S is a powerful tool, improving sustainability work by \nmaking\
    \ variable visible and creating feedback mechanisms, \nand provides many opportunities\
    \ for increasing efficiency of \nsystems, measuring change, providing feedback\
    \ on behavioral \nand policy changes, etc.  \nICT can be used for sustainability\
    \ practice, showing new \nways of how sustainability data and information can\
    \ be created, \nshared and visualized through the application of new \ntechnologies\
    \ and paradigms, such as APIs, open licenses, \ncrowdsourcing, pervasive sensors\
    \ and mashups. These \ntechnologies add new affordances and transform the way\
    \ of \nworking with sustainability data: \n• \nThere is a focus on providing real\
    \ time and dynamic \nfeedback instead of using past static data. \n• \nThe data\
    \ is gathered in an automatic way from the \nbottom up, instead than top-down\
    \ approaches, using \nsensors, mashups and crowdsourcing. \n• \nThere is a focus\
    \ on transparency and openness. \n• \nData is visualized dynamically and interactively.\
    \ \n• \nThe innovation model is more open and broadened \noutside the sustainability\
    \ field.  \nThe mostly implicit focus in quantitative data in ICT4S, \ntogether\
    \ with these new ways this data is created and \ncommunicated create risks and\
    \ missed opportunities that need \nto be explored, what I call data blindness.\
    \ This can mean that \nwe trust only in data, focusing on problems and areas that\
    \ are \npossible to model, while leaving aside other aspects that are \ndifficult\
    \ or impossible to quantify, and that we trust too much \nin data, forgetting\
    \ that behind models and calculations there are \n151\nassumptions and uncertainties,\
    \ or that we may be measuring \nthe wrong things. This does not mean to oppose\
    \ to the use of \nquantitative data in ICT4S, but it suggests that more critical\
    \ \nreflection on these questions is needed in the research area. I \nwill present\
    \ some of the possible action points: \n• Developing more connections with existing\
    \ research \non these topics in more traditional disciplines. The \nlimitations\
    \ \nand \nrisks \nof \nquantitative \ndata \nin \nsustainability have been pointed\
    \ out before in \nsustainability research. Finnveden [47], for instance, \ndiscusses\
    \ the limitations in LCAs and other \nenvironmental system analysis tools and\
    \ how data \ngaps, uncertainties in data and methodology, and the \nvalues embedded,\
    \ make LCAs limited to provide \nprescription, for instance in deciding if a product\
    \ is \nbetter than another one. It is suggested that \nenvironmental analysis\
    \ can be a necessary and useful \ninput in decision making, but more as a tool\
    \ for \nlearning, helping to identify critical points and in \ngeneral to increase\
    \ the knowledge of the studied \nsystems. There is space for ICT4S research to\
    \ expand \nthe connections with sustainability research from other \ndisciplines\
    \ to gain insight about what it has been done \nalready regarding these risks.\
    \ \n• Distinguishing models as tools and models as goals: \nWhen \nfaced \nwith\
    \ \nuncertainties \nin \nmodeling \nsustainability, we can increase the quality\
    \ of the \nparameters, of the data collected, make it more real \ntime, but in\
    \ the end we still have a model, or as \nBorges wrote in on exactitude in Science,\
    \ “becomes so \nexact that only a map on the same scale as the empire \nitself\
    \ will suffice” [48]. I will argue that it is necessary \nto remind us that models\
    \ and metrics are useful tools \nbut in the end only proxies for working towards\
    \ value-\nbased human-centered sustainability. In the case of \nefficiency, a\
    \ similar effect can be observed, where the \nefficiency rate, from being a tool,\
    \ becomes a goal in \nitself. There is a risk for rebound effects where \nefficiency\
    \ (what is measured) improves, while the \ntotal impact (the original goal) increases\
    \ instead of \ndecrease.  \n• Increasing transparency: An area where ICT can \n\
    make a difference for mitigating data-blindness is \nincreasing \nthe \ntransparency\
    \ \nand \nopenness \nof \nsustainability data and studies. Much of the existing\
    \ \nsustainability data is published in commercial \ndatabases or expensive journal\
    \ articles where the \npublic does not have access to it, and/or written in \n\
    paper or in a text document where a computer service \ncannot access it. Applying\
    \ open licenses to \nsustainability data (and models) can make the \ninformation\
    \ more accessible, easier to replicate, and \nmake assumptions visible to examine.\
    \ \n• Exploring new qualitative areas and research \nmethods. A blindspot that\
    \ is worth exploring are the \napplications of ICT for areas of sustainability\
    \ and \nenvironmental impacts that are difficult to quantify \nand have therefore\
    \ been most forgotten in research. \nThis could include, as Brynjarsdottir et\
    \ al [37] \nsuggest, a focus in reflection not in prescription, and a \nshift\
    \ from behaviors to practices, going beyond the \nfocus on individual actions\
    \ and metrics towards more \nholistic society practices. This type of more qualitative\
    \ \nresearch will create also methodological challenges \nand call for more interdisciplinary\
    \ collaborations in \nICT4S. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \n“Grownups love numbers. When\
    \ you tell them that you have \nmade a new friend, they never ask you any questions\
    \ \nabout essential matters. They never say to you, \"What \ndoes his voice sound\
    \ like? What games does he love best? \nDoes he collect butterflies?\" Instead,\
    \ they demand: \"How \nold is he? How many brothers does he have? How much \n\
    does he weigh? How much money does his father make?\" \nOnly from these figures\
    \ do they think they have learned \nanything about him. […] But certainly, for\
    \ us who \nunderstand life, figures are a matter of indifference.”  \n– Le Petit\
    \ Prince [49]  \n \nEmpowering new ways of creating, processing and \ncommunicating\
    \ sustainability data is and will be a main topic \nof ICT4S research, connected\
    \ to some of the most explored \nparts of the research field such as using technology\
    \ for \nincreasing efficiency and for providing feedback and \nfacilitating behavior\
    \ change. These are powerful ways in which \nICT can contribute to sustainability\
    \ work. But there is a need \nfor more discussion and reflection on the values\
    \ and \nassumptions behind the focus on quantitative data, making it \nmore explicit\
    \ instead than being tacit. If not, we risk the \npresented problems of trusting\
    \ only and/or too much in data or \nfocusing on the wrong data and hiding rebound\
    \ effects. It is \nespecially important to identify and work with these specific\
    \ \nproblems and risks when applying new ICT approaches that \ntransform how we\
    \ work with data using mashup approaches, \nsensors, real time data, etc. This\
    \ paper tried to open a bit more \nthis discussion and proposes some action points,\
    \ such as \nincreasing the connection to existing research on traditional \nareas\
    \ of sustainability research that have a longer tradition on \ndealing with the\
    \ limitation of quantitative data and models in \nsustainability, to use the affordances\
    \ of ICT to increase the \ntransparency of data and models, and to have a wider\
    \ \nperspective and explore possible blindspots of relevant topics \nand research\
    \ methods that we may be missing out on, and that \ncould enrich the ICT4S field.\

    Abstract While resilience is deﬁned differentially by social scientists and ecolo-

    gists, sustainability is possible where resilient social and ecological systems
    meet

    and interact, and sustainable resilient systems promote societal use of ecosystem

    services supporting contemporary societal needs without risk to future generations.

    Yet it is possible for seemingly appropriate and rational decisions from individuals,

    and society at large, to be counter to long-term sustainable solutions. Historic
    rice

    ﬁeld cultivation in the wetlands of the Carolinas and Florida provides an example

    of various forms of resilience and sustainability within the theoretical framework
    of

    alternate stable states, whereby a resilient system can exist in more than one
    state

    and where stability is achieved when disruptive variables are not so disruptive
    as

    to generate tipping points from one state to another. This contribution examines

    the changing role and political as well as environmental impacts of rice agricul-

    ture in the region with particular emphasis on the contingent processes of envi-

    ronmental and cultural transformation that took place between the seventeenth
    and

    twenty-ﬁrst centuries.

    Deﬁning Resilience

    The anthropogenic modiﬁcation of Earth and Earth systems has, in recent years,

    garnered attention from a variety of academic disciplines resulting in increased

    awareness and interest in resiliency across multiple system types that include
    ecolog-

    ical and social systems. Generally, resilience is the amount of disturbance a
    system

    canabsorbwithout changingstate(Gunderson2000, 426). However, resiliencecanbe

    deﬁned differentially by various disciplines: social scientists deﬁne social resilience

    as comprising three dimensions—coping capacity, adaptive capacity, and transfor-

    mative capacity (Keck and Sakdapolrak 2013, 5–7). Ecologists measure ecological

    resilience by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed by a system before
    its

    variables and processes controlling the system’s behavior are changed such that
    the

    system redeﬁnes its structure or settles in an alternate stable state (Gunderson
    2000,

    426). Ecologists also identify systems designed with a single operating objective
    and

    a global optimum where alternate states should be avoided as engineering resilience

    (Gunderson 2000, 426).

    There is potential for sustainability where resilient social and ecological systems

    meet and shape one another through various interactions. Sustainable resilient

    systemspromotesocietaluseofecosystemservicessupportingcontemporarysocietal

    needs without risk to future generations (Adger and Hodbod 2013). It is possible
    for

    seemingly appropriate and rational decisions from individuals, and society at
    large, to

    be counter to long-term sustainable solutions, even to the point where the resiliency

    of the support systems that promote such decisions is disrupted (Kahn 1966, 23,
    24,

    27). The consequences of known and unknown socio-ecological risks to the present

    and the future are diminished where resilient systems support sustainability (Adger

    and Hodbod 2013, 79–81). Risks that may be mitigated include changing climate,

    natural disasters, and wholesale socio-political systems change (e.g., abolition
    of

    slavery).

    Alternate stable states theory suggests a resilient system can exist in more than
    one

    state. A state is considered stable when the disruptive variables inﬂuencing it
    are not

    so disruptive that it shifts state or regimes. The resiliency of a system determines
    how

    large of a perturbation the system can experience without the system shifting
    states.

    Stable state theory is commonly visualized with a cup-and-ball diagram (Fig. 1),

    where the “cup” represents the system, and the ball represents the state of the
    system.

    The parameters maintaining the system state are represented by the walls of the
    cup;

    the position of the ball in the cup represents the state of the system. When the
    ball is

    at the bottom of the cup (i.e., the basin of attraction) the system is most stable.
    The

    steepness of the walls determines the return time of the system after disturbance,

    whereas the width of the cup pertains to the system’s resilience. Negative feedback

    mechanisms tend to push the system back towards the stable bottom of the cup after
    a

    perturbation. For the system to change to an alternate state, the perturbation
    must be

    large enough for the ball to breach the precipice of the cup and enter another
    stable

    state. Once an alternative stable state has been entered it is unlikely that the
    previous

    stable state can be reclaimed.

    Fig. 1 Characteristics of socio-ecological stable states are represented by the
    various components

    of the cup-and-ball diagram. The state of the system is represented by the ball,
    while the parameters

    that control the system’s state are represented by the walls of the cup. In the
    ﬁgure presented there

    is a transition era where the precipice of the original state (i.e., Era of “rice
    culture”) has been

    breached and the system is gaining momentum towards transitioning to the contemporary
    era but

    there are a variety of forces attempting to push the system’s state back into
    the stability of the era

    of “rice culture”. We refer to this era as a transition era

    Resilience on Lowcountry Wetlands and in Lowcountry Rice

    Fields

    The economic, cultural, and environmental signiﬁcance of southeastern rice is
    almost

    completely obscured by that of King Cotton, the export crop that came to dominate

    southern agriculture by the mid-1800s. Even still, the role of rice agriculture
    is almost

    completely unknown to the American consciousness as the driving national force
    it

    once was, one that created the wealthiest planters and largest slaveholders in
    British

    North America before the American Revolution. South Carolina rice planters claimed

    Nathaniel Heyward, the wealthiest slave holder with the largest slave holdings,
    as

    one of their own until his death in 1851 (Heyward 1993, xi, liv, 3–6, 12–13, 18–19).

    The value of rice to global society has been and continues to be immense.

    Across time and space, Queen Rice can demonstrate how human labor and

    wetlands can be harnessed for economic ends, and how such systems can be resilient

    or collapse with political change such as that of the 13th Amendment of the US

    Constitution. Wetlands are valuable natural resources that provide high biological

    diversity. They ﬁlter and transform nutrients and pollutants and act to buffer
    the

    impacts of human activities on downstream aquatic systems (Hook 1993, 2157,

    2160). Wetlands have been transformed in West Africa’s Upper Guinea Coast since

    c. 1500 CE (Fields-Black 2008, 135–160) and in North America since the 1720s to

    grow rice as a staple and commodity crop. In North America, the modiﬁcation of

    wetlands continued into the 1920s (Heyward 1993, x, xxii–xxx, xxxiii–xxxiv, liii–liv,

    14, 33–34, 45, 48, 50, 54, 56, 60, 62, 63–65, 67–69, 74–75, 81–82, 90, 213–216,
    39).

    During this period, some 234,354 acres of wetlands in South Carolina were modiﬁed

    Fig. 2 Historic rice ﬁelds of the coastal plains of the southeastern U.S.A. extend
    from southeastern

    North Carolina to northeastern Florida. In green are the results of a mapping
    project using high

    resolution LiDAR to identify the historic rice ﬁelds of South Carolina

    for rice production (Hanks et al. 2021, 7) (Fig. 2). Historic rice ﬁelds provide
    an

    interesting case study of the various forms of resilience and sustainability within
    the

    theoretical framework of alternate stable states.

    Wetland clearing, tree stump removal, land leveling, and construction of water

    retention devices resulted in the ﬁrst foray in the coastal plains of southeastern
    North

    Carolina to northeastern Florida, U.S.A. into the culture of rice as a staple
    crop

    to be followed with its use as a commodity crop. Ecosystems over extensive areas

    were substantially transformed by the rice economy and altered soils, vegetation,
    and

    hydrologies present invaluable opportunities for habitat conservation, speciﬁcally
    for

    economically important and migratory waterfowl. Queen Rice also provides impor-

    tant insights into resilience, in that ongoing and ecological and human dynamics

    produce new and invaluable stable states despite previous collapses.

    The Queen Rice economy was entirely dependent on enslaved people to help

    planters identify microenvironments where rice could be successfully cultivated
    and

    perform the arduous labor of converting coastal plain marshes and forests to rice
    agri-

    culture from the late 1600s to mid-1800s. Enslaved laborers levelled the primeval

    forest, felling cypress trees with axes–trunks of the largest cypress trees measured

    up to 12 ft in circumference–and deracinated the cypress knees with hand tools

    (Harper 1998, 59). Enslaved laborers made the earth as “level as a billiard table”

    with shovels, baskets, and planks of wood and moved 500,000 cubic feet of river

    muck per mile on South Carolina’s Cooper River alone to construct the hydraulic
    irri-

    gation system (Rosengarten 1998, 40; Ferguson 1992, 147). Then, enslaved laborers

    cultivated, harvested, and processed the rice crops and maintained the hydraulic
    irri-

    gation system. American and European slave traders imported an estimated 198,314

    Africa captives into South Carolina and Georgia colonies between 1701 and 1858

    (www.slavevoyages.com). It is likely that the majority of these enslaved people
    were

    forced to labor in the swamps on Lowcounty South Carolina and Georgia rice plan-

    tations. South Carolina rice planters and congressmen led the legislative lobby
    to

    keep the trans-Atlantic slave trade open and legal. The Compromise of 1796 resulted

    in the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in US colonies in 1808. The
    illegeal

    slave trade continued into the Lowcountry. South Carolina and Georgia’s share
    of

    slave importation equalled more than half (53%) of the entire number of African

    captives imported into the US mainland. (www.slavevoyages.com). Dependence on

    an unfree and unpaid labor system set up a social system and an economic system,

    a plantation economy, which were not resilient.

    The earliest rice culture was not resilient. It used low-lying, inland freshwater

    environments, valley bottoms of cypress-hardwood streams, and wetlands at the

    heads of creeks and rivers. Colonial naturalist Mark Catesby described the land

    that planters converted as “impregnated by the washings from the higher lands”

    over a period of years to become “deep soyl [sic]…a sandy loam of a dark brown

    colour” (Catesby 1771, iii). Early planters adapted rice cultivation techniques
    to the

    Lowcountry environment. Inland, freshwater swamp rice plantations depended on

    the natural features of watersheds to better irrigate rice ﬁelds. By hand, enslaved

    laborers cleared hardwood forests of cypress, tupelo, and sweet gum trees, exposing

    soils with slow water permeability and high water-holding capacity into which
    rice

    was sowed.

    The ﬁelds were located on low-lying nearly level terrain with very slight

    downward-sloping grades (0–2%) that allowed drainage of freshwater into the rice

    ﬁelds. Locations of rice ﬁelds were chosen to take advantage of water from higher

    elevations ﬂowing down into the ﬁelds from surface and groundwater sources (Smith

    2019, 3–6, 7–8, 29–35, 38, 96–97, 109–112, 116–118, 120–121). Enslaved laborers

    built clayey embankments that retained water in reservoirs and quarter-drains
    then

    released it.

    The 1700s saw demand and market share for rice from the Carolinas increase and

    concurrently, the development of more effective technologies and infrastructures

    for managing water. By 1710, rice had become South Carolina’s most successfully

    cultivated staple crop and by the 1730s demand for rice exports was exploding.

    Annual exports from Charleston harbor increased ﬁve-fold between 1720 to 1740,

    from about 6 to 30 million pounds (Coclanis 1989, 83). Growth in the 1730s is
    partly

    attributed to the relaxation of the British Navigation Acts, enabling Carolina
    planters

    to export rice directly to Southern Europe on British ships.

    Planters in the early eighteenth century were focused on economic growth. But,

    with increased demand and market share, planters established greater management

    control over the ﬂow of water into the rice ﬁelds by constructing a complex of

    278

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    irrigation channels, trunks, and gates. Early trunks consisted of hollowed out
    tree

    trunks with plugs on each end. The irrigation resembled technologies used in West

    Africa’s rice-growing region (Carney 1996, 27; Doar 1970, 12). Planters further

    mechanized water control systems with valves, rectangular boxes that were open
    to

    incoming water on one end, and sliding gates to trap and release freshwater into
    the

    rice ﬁelds. Simultaneously, the valves resembled technologies English farmers
    were

    using to drain fens (Edelson 2006, 6, 34, 48, 73–74, 76, 197).

    Despite technological improvements, inland rice cultivation presented serious

    limits to the agricultural system’s potential for growth. Planters were limited
    by

    the unidirectional ﬂow of stream and river water, and gestating rice was vulnerable

    to both droughts and ﬂoods. Subtropical storm runoff readily breached the earthen

    embankments and washed out inland rice ﬁelds. On the other hand, the burgeoning

    rice export trade demanded more efﬁcient, reliable, and predictable irrigation
    systems

    that would give planters more control over water.

    South Carolina rice planter, Nathaniel Hayward’s, primary inheritance was an

    inland rice ﬁelds on a tributary of the Broad River in Beaufort County, South
    Carolina

    and tidal rice ﬁelds only partially reclaimed near the Combahee River. He made
    a

    good faith effort planting the inland rice ﬁelds, which took advantage of water
    on

    higher elevations in the marsh where evergreen loblolly pine and oak trees grew
    in

    dry, sandy, clay soils without altering the environment. Nathaniel Heyward planted

    his inland rice ﬁelds for only one season. When the rice was still in the ﬁelds
    and

    almost ready to be harvested, a “freshet” destroyed the entire crop. Legend has
    it that

    he drove out to his inland rice ﬁeld in his buggy the next morning after the storm

    to survey the damage. His ﬁne rice crop was submerged. Heyward took one look

    at the water covering it, got back in the buggy, and never went back to or planted

    the inland rice ﬁeld again. From this point, he focused on managing his brothers’

    inheritances, draining the swamps on his partially reclaimed tidal ride ﬁelds
    and his

    brothers’ larger tidal rice ﬁelds, and subsequently acquiring and building his
    own

    empire, 17 “gold mines,” tidal rice ﬁelds on the Combahee River in South Carolina’s

    Colleton County (Heyward 1993, 11–12, 14, 50, 65–67).

    Inland rice culture provided means to store water in reserve systems as a way
    to

    provide some mitigation against unpredictable water supply, which was the primary

    threat to a successful crop (Smith 2019, 3, 9, 81–82, 88, 99, 195; Coclanis 1989,

    78–83). There remained some uncertainty for successful crop production depending

    on the severity of the drought where upstream reserves could not store enough
    water

    to supply the downstream rice ﬁeld. It was not until the development of the tidal
    ﬁeld

    system that large scale and consistent rice crops could be produced and shipped
    to

    market.UnlikeNathanielHeyward,notallriceplantersgaveupinlandricecultivation

    entirely. Middling planters who were not uber-wealthy like the Heywards, continued

    to grow inland rice primarily for subsistence. After the collapse of the Queen
    Rice

    economy in the early twentieth century, African American farmers on heirs’ property,

    property owned by the descendants of landowners who died intestate, well into
    the

    twentieth century (Heyward 1993, xiii–xiv; Hilliard 1975, 57–58; Merrens 1972,

    187, 192; Smith 2019, 3, 9, 81–82, 88, 99, 195; Vernon 1993, 248, n.9, 274 n.7).

    279

    Inland swamp rice production was not perfect. It did not allow planters to control

    water and often led to too much water, in torrential deluges called freshets,
    or too

    little water in the rice ﬁelds. Perfecting water control would require more technology,

    more labor, even more knowledge of the coastal wetlands, and much more capital

    to reclaim the swamps and establish tidal rice production. It would take another
    few

    decades for all of these factors to come together in the mid-eighteenth century.

    Tidal rice plantations were based on a simple principle of water control; they

    used the fresh water in river estuaries, which rose and fell with the tides, to
    ﬂood

    rice ﬁelds. Tidal rice ﬁelds are located in an inland zone that is close enough
    to

    the coast to experience tidal ﬂuctuations but far enough upstream to be freshwater.

    This geographic location allowed them to take advantage of the predictable tidal

    ﬂuctuations and the associated freshwater wedge, thereby allowing the management

    of freshwater into and out of the ﬁelds.

    Tidal rice plantations used water-control structures to inundate ﬁelds with the

    freshwater of estuaries that ﬂoated on top of the salt water and that rose and
    fell

    with the tides. With predictable environmental conditions (i.e., predictable supply
    of

    freshwater) ensured, the physical structure of the former wetlands as tidal rice
    ﬁelds

    became engineered and managed. As the process of rice culture in tidal ﬁelds was

    ﬁne tuned and overall yield per acre increased, the tidal ﬁelds system was focused
    on

    a singularly objective, the production of rice for its market value. The immensity
    of

    the change to the structure and function of the wetlands across such a large geography

    resulted in a state shift from natural wetlands to engineered and managed wetlands,

    or rice ﬁelds. This combination made for the only naturally irrigated soils in
    the US.

    When management control was established over the hydrology of tidal wetlands,
    the

    area of rice cultivation greatly expanded.

    Planters and enslaved laborers selected level land along rivers with tidal estuaries,

    impacted by the tides, accessing freshwater on either side. Planters and enslaved

    laborers converted level ﬂoodplains and swamplands along tidal rivers to rice
    ﬁelds,

    managing both fresh- and saltwater. Canals with ﬂoodgates were even constructed

    to channel freshwater from tidal estuaries to remote rice ﬁelds.

    Slave labor was used throughout the time where the methodology of growing rice

    in the southern coastal plains of the United States was ﬁne-tuned and increasingly

    focused on the tidal rice system. This societal stable state allowed forced and
    enslaved

    labor to transform a vast geography of wetlands across these coastal plains (more

    than 234, 354 acres in South Carolina, USA alone) (Hanks et. al. 2021, 7). Enslaved

    laborers converted tidal swamps to rice ﬁelds with water control infrastructures
    by

    building ditches and embankments around an entire ﬂoodplain. Next, they cleared,

    burned, and removed trees and stumps. Embankments that surrounded ﬁelds had

    wooden “trunks” installed for ﬂooding and drainage. Trunks passed through the

    dikes and allowed movement between rice ﬁelds or between a tidal rice ﬁeld and

    the tidal river. Initially, cypress trunks were used after being hollowed from
    top to

    bottom and installing a large plug to control water ﬂow. Trunks eventually evolved

    into sophisticated wooden structures with gates at each end that opened and shut

    depending on the tide. Individual ﬁelds had cross ditches and channels excavated

    and check banks installed for highly precise water level control (Fig. 3). In
    the ﬁnal

    stage, enslaved laborers planted rice on the ﬂoodplains.

    Fig. 3 Comparison and description of inland (a) and tidal rice ﬁeld (b) morphology.
    Inland ﬁelds

    are linear, gravity fed wetlands. Widths of these wetlands can range from over
    1000’ wide to just

    100’ wide. Inland ﬁelds are bordered by uplands. Tidal ﬁelds were constructed
    in ﬂoodplain areas

    between sections of tidal, freshwater rivers and uplands. Inland ﬁelds tend to
    be narrow and long

    which result in smaller acreage impoundments. Tidal ﬁelds are not as constrained
    by adjacent

    uplands and individual impoundments on the average are larger acreages than those
    in inland rice

    ﬁelds

    Conversion of a tidal swamp was a “great undertaking,” one considerably more

    difﬁcult than that of the inland swamps. It required signiﬁcant engineering knowledge

    andknowledgeofthenaturallandscape,aswellasintensivecapitalandenslavedlabor

    inputs over many years. In addition to clearing and leveling the land, constructing

    the hydraulic irrigation system, enslaved laborers maintained the irrigation system

    against the threat of breaks in the embankments and the rush of water. Because
    of

    the capital, labor, and time demands of tidal rice culture, only wealthy planters
    with

    multiple investments like Nathaniel Heyward, not small farmers, could undertake

    swamp reclamation. Then, they reinvested proﬁts from one tidal rice plantation
    into

    acquiring more labor and reclaiming more tidal lands. The intensiﬁcation of capital

    in the new American economy was vital to tidal rice culture (Heyward 1993, 18).
    By

    the mid-eighteenth century, tidal rice culture was extensive. By 1770, rice exports

    exceeded 60 million pounds per year (Fig. 1), largely due to tidal rice cultivation

    (Coclanis 1989, 83).

    The system of slave labor became entangled with the environmental system of

    engineered and managed rice ﬁelds so intensively that the environmental system
    of

    engineered and managed rice ﬁelds could not exist were it not for the social system.

    With the environmental system of rice production now being stable and consistent

    (i.e., in an alternate stable state) across such a large geography and the singular
    focus

    of the rice ﬁelds being to produce marketable rice, slave labor became an integral
    cog

    in the socio-environmental system of rice culture in the southeastern United States.

    In other words, to maintain the stability of the environmental system (i.e., rice
    ﬁelds)

    required the stability of the social system where slave labor was foundational.

    The full tragedy of Queen Rice is that African–Americans were at high risk of

    disease and survival rates were notably low in New World rice plantations. Though

    yields of tidal rice were incredibly productive and ﬁnancially lucrative and though

    enslaved laborers contributed labor as well as critical skills, tidal rice culture
    came

    at a high cost for enslaved laborers. The saturated and inundated environments
    of the

    inland and tidal rice ﬁelds were extremely unhealthy environments. Rice plantations

    in the South Carolina and Georgia lowcountry had among the highest death rates

    among enslaved children and adults in the US, and second only to sugar plantations

    in the entire New World (Forster and Smith 2011, 909, 923). Whereas death rates

    for slaves on cotton and tobacco plantations dropped to approximately 33% by the

    1780s, double the number, approximately two-thirds, of enslaved people still died
    on

    lowcountry rice plantations up until the Civil War. Along the Savannah River,
    90%

    of children enslaved on rice plantations died before 15 years of age. In the winter
    of

    1839 when most of the children died on Pierce Butler’s Butler Island rice plantation

    on the Altamaha River near Darien, GA, the mother of a child who recently died

    described the plight of many women enslaved on Lowcountry rice plantations saying

    over and over again to Fannie Kemble, Butler’s English wife: “I’ve lost a many;
    they

    all goes so” (Dusinberre 1996, 2–3, 49–51, 55–56, 58, 61, 74, 80–81, 84, 103,
    121,

    188, 199, 237–238, 240–241, 245, 325, 412–413, 415–416; Kemble 1984, 130).

    The tight coupling of the social and environmental systems in the production of

    rice as a commodity crop through the engineered tidal ﬁeld system operated within
    an

    engineering resilience framework. Production of rice for market value was the
    single

    objective of the tidal rice ﬁeld system and any alternate state, for either the
    environ-

    mental or social system, was potentially not acknowledged but certainly to be
    avoided

    at all costs. Maintaining the system in an engineering resilient framework required

    constant input of energy which was provided by slave labor. Southern planters
    were

    unable to assess potential risks to the coupled socio-environmental system they
    had

    developed and fostered because they were operating in an engineering resiliency

    state-of-mind, where no other potential alternate stable states were envisaged.
    In this

    framework, the environmental stability of the tidal rice ﬁelds was a requisite
    that had

    to be maintained to produce rice and the only way this was possible was through

    slave labor.

    The external forces that tested the resilience of the environmental system (i.e.,

    engineered and managed tidal rice ﬁelds) still existed in both chronic (e.g.,
    the erosion

    of dikes along riverbanks) and episodic (e.g., hurricanes) but this was overcome
    with

    the immense human power of forced free labor provided by a social system that

    enabled slave labor. Any threats to the social system (i.e., slavery) was quashed
    by

    the system itself. That is until the American Civil War put an end to slavery.
    At this

    point, both environmental and social systems underwent interlinked perturbations

    that allowed both to realize various trajectories previously unacknowledged and

    likely beyond contemporaneous comprehension. People who were once enslaved

    were now “free” and those who enslaved them now had to envision new ways to

    manage their engineered rice ﬁelds without slave labor. This resulted in a period

    after the American Civil War where planters attempted to continue to produce and

    manage rice as a commodity crop within the engineered rice ﬁelds up until the

    282

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    last commercial rice crop in South Carolina was produced by ss. In Fig. 1 this
    is

    represented by the small (and temporary) alternate stable state (termed “transition

    era”), which was fragile at best, requiring only small perturbations to push the
    system

    into a completely different stable state. These perturbations came in the form
    of

    several hurricanes and disruptions in market supply chains that affected planters
    in

    the southeastern coastal plains.

    This transition era reﬂects the point made in Haldon et al. (2020, 1) that systems

    seldom collapse in the dramatic fashion so often popularized in modern culture.
    The

    rice culture that began in the 1670s and saw its ultimate demise beginning just
    prior

    to the American Civil War did not change the social nor the environmental systems

    in rapid fashion. Still today American society struggles with racism, some 155
    years

    after the end of the American Civil War. The environmental system continues to

    change and may require more time to reach the stable bottom of the cup than that
    of

    the social system.

    The postbellum social system disrupted the production of rice as a commodity

    crop in the southeastern U.S. due to the abolishment of slavery, but it also affected

    the engineered rice ﬁelds where, after some time, it was no longer seen as a tenable

    option to manage for rice production. These managed wetlands now experienced

    various ecological trajectories. While some previously managed ﬁelds were unman-

    aged and allowed to “re-wild,” still others were managed for another objective–

    waterfowl hunting. The utilization of rice ﬁelds for waterfowl hunting beginning

    in the 1910 and 1920s has continued to evolve as a conservation ethic has perco-

    lated through this region. In recent years management of engineered tidal rice
    ﬁelds

    has become more diverse in the set of objectives that now includes, along with

    waterfowl, ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat (e.g., black rail, wood
    storks,

    roseate spoonbill, American alligator, etc.). These “new” objectives and their
    socio-

    environmental stable states are represented by the third cup in Fig. 1 and have
    yet to

    be fully established.

    Resilience, Climate Change, and the 21st Century Rice Field

    Infrastructure

    Given that the rice ﬁelds in South Carolina have signiﬁcant historical, cultural
    and

    ecological signiﬁcance, it is prudent to consider the permanence of these man
    made

    systems. Over the course of rice history in South Carolina, there have been several

    shifts in locations and objectives of rice ﬁelds. Initially the potential to reap
    ﬁnancial

    proﬁts started the rice economy in South Carolina and planters developed and used

    the inland ﬁeld system. Ultimately tidal rice ﬁelds provided a ﬁnancially successful

    alternative to inland ﬁelds and planters shifted their development and management
    in

    this area. These tidal ﬁelds (and inland ﬁelds to a lesser degree) transitioned
    from a

    ﬁnancial to an ecological objective with the end of rice as a commodity crop and
    the

    rise of sporting pursuits on the rice plantations. From the early twentieth century
    this

    Resilience of Coupled Socio-Ecological Systems: Historic Rice Fields …

    283

    ecological objective has persisted and become more diverse with recognition that
    the

    management of these tidal and inland rice ﬁelds beneﬁts waterfowl and many other

    non-game species like bald eagles, wood storks, black rails, etc.

    There is increasing awareness by the owners and managers of the rice ﬁelds that

    the permanence of the existing system is being inﬂuenced negatively. Federal,
    state,

    and private owners of rice ﬁelds are faced with changing forces on this infrastruc-

    ture. Decision making about how, when and how much to invest in these man-made

    systems is complex and has been ongoing since their creation.

    Rice ﬁelds are composed of raised dikes that prevent water from entering or

    exiting a particular area where rice was grown and now is managed for wildlife

    habitat (Fig. 3). Canals were excavated to enable water ﬂow throughout the system.

    Water control structures were placed in dikes to permit water retention or dewatering

    in these rice ﬁelds. Other than the water control structures (which are typically

    wooden), this system is constructed from onsite mud and soil. The properties of
    this

    mud and soil have inﬂuenced the maintenance regimes of the earthen infrastructure

    from the very inception of rice ﬁeld construction in the early eighteenth century.
    As

    an example, some plantations may have been established along sections of rivers

    where the local material had a high sand content. Other rice ﬁelds were established

    along particular rivers where the available soil material was higher in loam or
    clay.

    When building dikes that stand 4–6’ above the wetland grade, soils with higher
    clay

    content are able to persist longer with the normal erosion forces of rain, travel
    across

    the dikes, etc. These constant erosion forces require these dikes to have material

    placed back on top and the interim period between these efforts can vary from
    5 to

    10 years for areas of sand versus 10–15 years for areas of material with higher
    clay

    content.

    Rice planters initially and wildlife habitat managers today have dealt with this

    constant degradation of the built rice ﬁeld system. Retopping dikes, installing
    new

    water control structures, excavating canals for improved water circulation were
    all

    acts that have been required from the very beginning of rice culture and were
    incor-

    porated into the mental calculus of determining whether it was worth the ﬁnancial

    investment to perform these remedial acts. Maintenance and repair issues have
    always

    been a part of the rice ﬁeld landscape and until recent decades were costs nearly
    all

    were willing to bear to maintain the system.

    The costs and efforts, though, of maintaining rice ﬁelds, especially tidal ones,

    has become more costly and more frequent in recent decades. Environmental forces

    that have been inﬂuenced by climate change are causing increased degradation and

    loss of the rice ﬁeld infrastructure. These forces include increases in tidal
    amplitude

    as driven by sea level rise and increase in the frequency of tropical storm events
    as

    a result of climate change. We discuss each of these factors below and how they

    negatively impact rice ﬁeld infrastructure.

    Tidal rice ﬁelds were placed along the tidal rivers in creeks to take advantage

    of the tidal, freshwater. Dikes and water control structures allowed the intentional

    ﬂooding and dewatering of the rice ﬁelds depending on different times of the rice

    growing season. Since the transition to management of wildlife habitat, the inten-

    tional ﬂooding and dewatering of the tidal rice ﬁelds enables management for native

    284

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    plant communities (e.g., widgeongrass in brackish and smartweed and panic grasses

    in freshwater rice ﬁelds) that do not develop under normal tidal regimes in free
    tidal

    ﬂow marshes.

    At a mechanistic level, tidal ﬁelds worked because the dike heights were built
    to a

    grade above mean high water. The bed of the rice ﬁeld (i.e., the broad acreage
    where

    rice initially and not native plants were and are grown) was at a level above
    mean

    low water (Fig. 4). This enabled full dewatering of the rice ﬁeld because as the
    tidal

    river reached low tide, i.e. below the bed level, water from the tidal rice ﬁeld
    passed

    through water control structures from the rice ﬁeld and into the free tidal ﬂow
    water

    bodies.

    Sea level rise impacts are most visible in coastal communities. The impacts of

    more frequent ﬂooding on tourist and beach communities are commonly reported

    in the media (Tibbetts and Mooney 2018; Cappucci 2020). Additionally, sea level

    rise also inﬂuences tidal amplitude inland along tidal rivers. In South Carolina,
    these

    river systems are typiﬁed by the Combahee, Ashepoo, Edisto and Santee Rivers.

    Coastal South Carolina has seen a signiﬁcant increase in tide levels. Since 1950,

    tidal waters have increased 10 inches in Charleston, which is central along the
    coast

    to rice growing areas of SC (Anonymous 2019, 6). Additionally, this increase appears

    to be increasing to a point where tidal increases of 1 inch every 2 years is anticipated.

    These dramatic statistics within the tidal rice ﬁeld landscape are forcing

    landowners to think of how increasing mean high water marks interact with the
    grade

    of perimeter dikes. Indeed, increasing numbers of spring tides, i.e. the strongest
    tide

    of the lunar cycle, are now overtopping these perimeter dikes. Efforts to raise
    them

    Fig. 4 Cross section sketch of a tidal rice ﬁeld bed, canal and perimeter and
    dike. Tidal amplitudes

    during the era of rice ﬁeld development (i.e., late 1700s until mid 1800s). MLW
    level is at a point

    below the rice ﬁeld bed such that water could easily pass from the tidal rice
    ﬁeld into the tidal

    rivers. Sea level rise in the late twentieth and current twenty-ﬁrst century have
    shifted this tidal

    amplitude up such that MLW levels are just below or at bed level and thereby making
    it difﬁcult to

    fully dewater tidal rice ﬁelds for wildlife habitat management objectives

    Resilience of Coupled Socio-Ecological Systems: Historic Rice Fields …

    285

    are ongoing on rice plantations. In fact, because of the increasing mean high
    water,

    efforts to raise dike levels over the last decade are ongoing in all areas of
    tidal rice

    ﬁelds across South Carolina.

    However, there is another more difﬁcult dynamic associated with the increased

    tidal amplitude. Increasingly managers of tidal rice ﬁelds have difﬁculty fully
    dewa-

    tering the ﬁelds during low tide periods because the mean low water mark has also

    increased over time. Thus, the time and potential of water to pass from the tidal
    rice

    ﬁeld and into the tidal river is limited. Because these tidal ﬁelds are managed
    for

    wildlife habitat and because many of the native plants require periods of drying
    to the

    bed, the management focus for wildlife is becoming more difﬁcult. Some plantations

    have installed mechanical pumping stations to ameliorate the impact of increasing

    mean low water marks, but this cost is additive to the cost of dike maintenance
    and

    retopping.

    Climatechangehas alsoimpactedthefrequencyof tropical stormevents (Marsooli

    et al. 2019, 5). Coastal South Carolina has seen these impacts recently with nine

    tropical storms events impacting coastal South Carolina since 2016 (Mizzell et
    al.

    2020, 12). Luckily, there is a trend for the increased tropical storm events to
    be

    storms with less intensity than in the past; however, these events lead to excessive

    ﬂooding from rainfall and tidal surge. Both sources of excess water in tidal rivers

    cause excessive dike erosion, dike breaching, and loss of water control structures.
    In

    recent years, some plantations have performed these dike repairs between hurricane

    seasons only to be forced into the same repair the next year caused by another
    storm.

    Tidal rice ﬁelds are more susceptible to these impacts than inland ﬁelds for two

    reasons. First, tidal ﬁelds are directly adjacent to tidal rivers and creeks.
    Therefore

    they are immediately impacted by increases in tidal amplitude and storm surge
    as a

    result of tropical storm events. In contrast, inland ﬁelds are insulated by geography

    fromtheseimpacts;however,intenseraineventscancauseexcessiveﬂoodingthrough

    the system, which degrades dikes and water control structures. In general, the
    cost

    of maintenance of tidal ﬁelds versus inland ﬁelds is 1.5–2 times higher (per acre

    of managed wetland). One complicating factor though is that more tidal ﬁelds than

    inland ﬁelds are still actively maintained and managed for wildlife habitat.

    There are few absolutes when dealing with environmental forces. One is that

    man is rarely successful in engineering solutions that will completely ameliorate
    the

    impacts on an anthropogenic landscape. So why then do owners and managers of

    tidal rice ﬁelds continue to repair and maintain these systems in the face of
    increasing

    pressures? What are the alternatives to the tidal rice ﬁeld system for wildlife
    habitat

    management? What are the societal forces that would entrain owners and managers

    to continue to repair tidal rice ﬁelds versus move back to inland ﬁelds where
    restoring

    dikes, canals, and water control structures is easier and less costly per acre?
    All of

    these questions are being considered informally across the coast of South Carolina.

    Historically, real estate values have been the motivators for persistence in main-

    taining and repairing tidal ﬁelds through the recent impacts of increases in tidal

    amplitude and storm frequency. Tidal rice ﬁelds, when well managed for wildlife,

    can be valued at $8000 to $10,000 per acre. These values are signiﬁcant when consid-

    ering some tidal ﬁelds are hundreds of acres. The value of tidal ﬁelds where the
    dikes

    286

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    not intact and management not possible would diminish to approximately $250 per

    acre. Furthermore, the overall real estate of many of these plantations exists
    because

    of the presence of functional tidal rice ﬁelds on the property. Would land owners

    be willing to pay these prices if the tidal ﬁelds were not functional (i.e., dikes
    are

    breached, water control structures are not present)?

    The attractiveness of the habitat to wildlife itself must also be considered in
    the

    question of tidal versus inland rice ﬁelds. In general, many water birds (waterfowl

    and other species) typically do not use the area of habitat in close proximity
    to the

    dike infrastructure. There is a band that surrounds these dikes where the habitat
    may

    be suitable, but wildlife do not use it with as great a frequency as the interior
    of these

    wetland units. This dynamic has not received much research, but it is hypothesized

    that water birds avoid dikes due to the disturbance of travel across the dikes.

    Many acres are still accessible to water birds in a squarish-conﬁguration of

    hundreds of acres of tidal rice ﬁelds. This is in contrast to inland ﬁelds that
    tend to be

    narrow and long. Might many inland ﬁelds be too narrow to allow full habitat utiliza-

    tion by wildlife without the hypothesized perimeter disturbance effect? Research
    on

    this has not been conducted but would be useful in better understanding how transi-

    tioning ﬁnancial and logistical resources away from tidal and into inland ﬁelds
    might

    succeed.

    Conclusion

    Change is certain, whether it be social or ecological and often the two co-mingle
    and

    affect one another. Unlike the white rice ﬁeld planters of the antebellum southern

    U.S., who were unable to envisage any other stable state, contemporary society
    must

    attempt to project future changes and evaluate mitigating solutions to possible
    risks.

    Historic rice ﬁelds, as a social-environmental system, are facing multiple changes

    due to climate change. As such, they are a prime case for evaluating society’s
    ability

    to consider alternative scenarios where current social and environmental functions

    may change but large scale changes, or even functional loss, may be ameliorated.
    In

    this light, many stakeholder groups who are part invested in the socio-environmental

    system of historic rice ﬁelds are confronted with deciding how and if they should
    deal

    with increased sea levels and tropical storm activity. Understanding the magnitude

    of impacts and the nature of the resource lost to climate change is a wise ﬁrst
    step in

    evaluating the type of mitigating response.

    In the case of rice ﬁelds, we know their historical signiﬁcance, their place in
    the

    cultural fabric of coastal South Carolina, and their importance as valuable wildlife

    habitat. How can these components of historic rice ﬁelds, or potentially a subset

    of these components, be maintained given the impending threats? Several questions

    come to mind: (1) What, of the socio-environmental attributes of the rice ﬁelds,

    should be the focus of conservation efforts?, (2) What are the possible implications

    of conserving one attribute while forgoing conserving another (i.e., what does
    a new

    alternate stable state look like?), (3) Who decides what attribute(s) to conserve?,
    (4)

    Resilience of Coupled Socio-Ecological Systems: Historic Rice Fields …

    287

    What effect will possible changes in the environmental system have on the social

    system and vice-versa?, (5) What potential means are available to achieve conserva-

    tion of the decided upon attributes to be conserved? These are not easy questions
    to

    answer given the complexity of either the social or environmental systems as sepa-

    rate entities, let alone when attempting to consider them as a single co-mingled
    and

    interacting system.

    As a hypothetical example, it may be possible to shift the ecological function
    of

    the threatened tidal ﬁelds (due to sea level rise and increased tropical storm
    activity)

    to inland ﬁelds. In this example, inland ﬁelds could be cleared of timber, tree
    trunks

    removed, the land leveled, and water retention and control structures and devices

    installed to reclaim the forested land to its former rice ﬁeld structure. As the
    struc-

    ture of tidal ﬁelds changes and presumably functional loss occurs, the hope would

    be for these reclaimed inland ﬁelds to take on the structure and function of tidal
    rice

    ﬁelds. If this were to be successful, it would increase the resilience of the
    ecological

    system; however, there are likely cascading effects to the social system that
    must be

    considered. The loss of structure and function of the tidal ﬁelds, where the primary

    focus is on waterfowl hunting and their contemporary maintenance is provided by
    a

    relatively small group of landowners, will likely result in changes in the structure
    of

    monetary support for conservation efforts in the region. In other words, the structure

    and function of today’s tidal ﬁelds and the resulting large scale conservation
    activi-

    ties are primarily maintained by a small group of landowners. Without the available

    environmental structure to support waterfowl hunting, these landowners may forgo

    ﬁnancial support for conservation across the region. Shifting the ecological struc-

    ture and function of the tidal ﬁelds to the reclaimed inland ﬁelds will result
    in a

    different spatial arrangement and potentially different land ownership of these
    land-

    scape features. The owners of these newly reclaimed rice ﬁelds may have a different

    conservation ethic than the owners of the “lost” tidal ﬁelds. What might this
    mean

    for the ecological structure and function? How might this impact the societal
    system

    within the region?

    With inevitable change to both environmental and societal systems, some of which

    is foreseeable while others may not be, society should consider what the value
    of the

    various attributes of any given social-environmental system are, what maintains
    the

    system’s structure and function, what are the possible threats, however likely,
    to the

    various attributes of the system, and what the structure and function of alternate
    stable

    states might be. Such efforts should provide various scenarios where the resilience

    of socio-environmental systems is increased. In doing so, society will hopefully
    be

    \ \n173\nBibliography \n177\nPreface\nix\nIt was not until a few months before\
    \ completing my Industrial Design Engineer-\ning master that I even considered\
    \ pursuing a PhD. Perhaps that was because my \ndad completed his about nine months\
    \ before I was born. Given my stubbornness \n(disclaimer: this statement may never\
    \ be used against me and if confronted I will \ndeny its existence), I may have\
    \ had some determination to not follow his path. \nPerhaps this thesis is therefore\
    \ proof that I am more like my dad than I dare to \nadmit. Perhaps it is also\
    \ proof that I inherited some of my mom’s perseverance and \ndedication.\nThe\
    \ journey of this PhD project started rather unexpectedly. Following random \n\
    events that led me to join a remote response team around the Haiyan typhoon that\
    \ \ndecimated the Philippines, I was invited to a Creative Industry conference\
    \ in Amster-\ndam. After his talk, I approached Edward Faber from T-Xchange and\
    \ he gave me the \ntip to contact professor Hulscher if I was interested in pursuing\
    \ a PhD in serious \ngaming (thank you for that tip). I sent an e-mail to Suzanne\
    \ that same evening, not \nknowing that Mascha was also involved in the project.\
    \ That is, in a nutshell, how \nthis journey started.\nWhat a journey it turned\
    \ out to be. And what amazing people I have worked \nwith or met along the way.\
    \ Many people deserve thanks for their help in completing \nthe journey (and I\
    \ sincerely hope I am not forgetting anyone). \nTo all my RiverCare colleagues,\
    \ thank you for all the insightful meetings, \ndiscussions and barbecues. It is\
    \ an amazing feat that, at the time of writing, almost \nall of the researchers\
    \ have successfully defended their theses or will do so in the near \nfuture.\
    \ To Koen, Juliette, Laura, Pepijn and Valesca, my RiverCare colleagues at the\
    \ \nUniversity of Twente, thank you for the fact that your doors were always open\
    \ for \nme. Koen and Juliette, this certainly applies to you if we consider frequency.\
    \ Koen, \nyou have a natural ability to very quickly separate the core of a problem\
    \ from its side \nissues. Thank you for all the interesting and useful discussions\
    \ that helped organize \nmy thoughts and for your enthusiasm and help in the development\
    \ of the Virtual \nRiver Game. The advantage of postponing the defense is that\
    \ I can now congratulate \nyou and Marieke with the birth of Annika. Juliette,\
    \ we were in the \"project G jour-\nney\" together and your positive attitude\
    \ really made it a team effort. We both went \nthrough ups and downs in the project\
    \ and it was good to know we could always fall \nback on each other. I am really\
    \ happy for you and Yared that Eliana joined your lives \nand I wish the three\
    \ of you all the happiness in the world.\nThanks also to NWO and the industrial\
    \ partners for making RiverCare possible. \nThanks especially to David, Fedor,\
    \ Florian, Hansje, Hermjan, Johan, Pascal, Rina, \nRoula and Thomas for providing\
    \ valuable feedback on the project during the multi-\nple user committee meetings.\
    \ \nx\nTo all my DPM department colleagues, thanks for always making me feel at\
    \ \nhome. To my (former) Human Centered Design colleagues, Anika, Anouk, Arie\
    \ Paul, \nCristina, Deger, Frederick, Jelle, Julia, Julieta, Mascha and Renan,\
    \ thanks for all the \ninspiration that you provided me along the way. It is great\
    \ to know that I am stay-\ning in the HCD group now that this journey has come\
    \ to an end. Thanks to Anouk, \nKatja, Hans, Johannes, Julieta, Leopoldo, Monique,\
    \ Patrick, Pieter, Renan, Rick and \nSteven – i.e. my roommates in N211 and W258\
    \ over the years (some for only a short \ntime, some longer, one prolonged even\
    \ after leaving the university) – for the nice and \nwelcome atmosphere. We all\
    \ had our ups and downs in our PhD/PDEng projects \nand, at least for me, it was\
    \ great to be able to share success stories, vent frustrations \nand exchange\
    \ advice. Thanks also to Adriaan, Chanmi, Gisela, Ilknur, Jorge, Marl-\nise, Nick,\
    \ Roberto, Wienik and Willem for the fun and interesting talks, both at the \n\
    university and elsewhere. To Norbert, Joop, Peter, Simon, Theo, Thomas, Henk,\
    \ \nDennis, Kai and Esther, thank you for your help and advice in manufacturing\
    \ the \nVirtual River Game prototype (I still owe you a cake). To Inge, Inge and\
    \ Annemarie, \nthank you for being the heartbeat of DPM, you keep us all going.\
    \ It is invaluable \nto know that I can always walk into the secretary to ask\
    \ any question. To Clareyne, \nTheo, Tox and Vera, thank you for the fun in all\
    \ the Optimus board meetings and in \norganizing its activities. It is great to\
    \ see that Optimus is still going strong.\nAlso thanks to my colleagues at the\
    \ WEM department. Formally I was only part \nof the department for three months,\
    \ but I was a regular lurker in the WEM corri-\ndors in the last few years (and\
    \ I have some bad news if you were hoping that is now \ncoming to an end). Denie\
    \ and Ralph, thank you for all your work on both getting \nRiverCare off the ground\
    \ and making it a success. Jord, thank you for the experience \n(and pleasure)\
    \ of setting up a complete minor course together from scratch.\nRyan, thank you\
    \ for all the help to build the game prototype. Your practical \nlook on how to\
    \ (mass) produce parts of the prototype likely saved countless hours \nof work.\
    \ Your flexibility to spend time on this project when it was needed most \nwas\
    \ also greatly appreciated (even while you were faced with the uncertainties of\
    \ \nBrexit). Also thanks for the in-depth political discussions we had as well\
    \ as for your \npodcast recommendations (please provide new ones, I have ran out\
    \ of Freakonom-\nics episodes).\nMany thanks to all my co-authors, Jan, Juliette,\
    \ Jelle, Fedor, Koen, Marc, \nMenno, Anouk, Mascha and Suzanne: you helped shape\
    \ the thesis that you now \nhold in your hands. Fedor, working together with you\
    \ has been (note: not past tense) \nvery inspiring and you have taught me so much.\
    \ Your optimism, looking at prob-\nlems as solvable puzzles rather than insurmountable\
    \ obstacles, greatly helped the \nsuccess of this project.\nxi\nKoen and Anouk,\
    \ thank you for being my paranymphs. Given that you are both \nco-authors of Chapter\
    \ 5, it reassures me that either of you can take over the defense \nif necessary\
    \ (but no pressure).\nMascha and Suzanne, thank you for being my promotors, I\
    \ could not have \nwished for better supervisors. Mascha, it is to your credit\
    \ that it feels as if we have \nexperienced this journey together. Thank you for\
    \ your commitment and for always \nbeing there for me. Suzanne, this project was\
    \ very different from the PhD projects \nthat you usually supervise. Perhaps at\
    \ times you wondered where this journey would \nlead to, or if it would lead anywhere\
    \ at all (if so, you were not alone). Thank you for \nyour continuous support.\
    \ \nTo all my friends that I neglected in the last, hectic year of this journey,\
    \ thank \nyou for all the fun, laughs and distractions that helped me to take\
    \ some distance from \nwork (this was very much needed at times). Chris, Ewout,\
    \ Lennart and Roy, hopefully \nwe can resume our regular \"man\" Sunday activities\
    \ soon enough. Mark, I am sure that \nyou have meanwhile found many nice roads\
    \ and cycling paths in the Kempen area to \nshow me. Congratulations also to you\
    \ and Vera with the birth of Amélie (by now she \nis already one year old, the\
    \ first version of this preface was written some time ago). \nTo the (former)\
    \ members of Klein Verzet, it is high time for a long cycling weekend \nsomewhere\
    \ in the hills or mountains.\nTo my family, Dini, Bep, Loes, Kees, Danielle, Gertjan,\
    \ Michel, Lizette, Patri-\nque, Sjoerd, Nynke, Noortje and Pim, thank you for\
    \ always making me feel welcome. \nI am also very thankful to now find family\
    \ in Marianne, Hans, Bas, Sandra, Matthijs \nand Josephine. Klaas and Saskia,\
    \ thank you for being the loving parents that you are, \nfor all the lessons that\
    \ you gave me that helped completing this journey, and for all \nthe support you\
    \ have given me during my entire life. Words cannot express the grat-\nitude that\
    \ I have for all the things you have done for me. \nMonique, the fact that I was\
    \ working on this journey in room N211 is, literally, \nthe reason we met. Special\
    \ thanks to many people mentioned above for ensuring \nthat Monique became part\
    \ of my life (please also apologize to Monique for bring-\ning this PhD into her\
    \ life). Monique, thank you for looking after me when I needed \nit most. I am\
    \ a very lucky man to have you by my side. I could not wish for a nicer, \nsweeter\
    \ and caring partner to explore the future together. We now have our house \n\
    (although it is still under construction). We now have our tree (although it needs\
    \ \nto grow a bit more before it will give us apples). The only thing missing\
    \ then is our \nanimal (it seems doubtful that China will grant us a panda).\n\
    Enschede, September 2020\nSummary\nxiii\nS\nEnvironmental management concerns\
    \ the management of land and natural resources \nin a way that creates and maintains\
    \ prosperous social, economic and ecological \nsystems. Environmental management\
    \ therefore typically has to deal with multiple \nsources of complexity and uncertainty\
    \ to reach robust, informed and well-considered \ndecisions based on all the knowledge\
    \ available. To combat complexity and uncer-\ntainty, active experimentation and\
    \ continuous evaluation are advocated. Serious \ngames are receiving increased\
    \ attention in environmental management as a method \nboth to facilitate stakeholder\
    \ participation and to stimulate social learning. \nYet, the research, design\
    \ and implementation of serious games is still largely \ndriven by technical aspects,\
    \ fueled by expectations rooted in advances in compu-\ntational power and in the\
    \ entertainment gaming industry. Less attention has been \ngiven to research the\
    \ extent to which the design of serious games can cater to the \nneeds and desires\
    \ of stakeholders. The aim of this thesis is therefore to explore how \na human\
    \ centered design of serious games contributes to foster exploring complex-\n\
    ity, facilitating stakeholder participation and stimulating social learning in\
    \ environ-\nmental management. Human centered design can be viewed as a design\
    \ philosophy \nthat considers the will and needs of a product’s prospective users\
    \ as the starting \npoint of the design process. The first contribution of this\
    \ thesis is therefore exploring \nhow human centered design can contribute to\
    \ developing a serious game that meets \nthe actual needs and desires of stakeholders.\
    \ To pursue the aim, a human centered \ndesign process is applied to the design\
    \ of the Virtual River Game, a serious game on \nDutch river management, as a\
    \ case study. \nxiv\nSummary\nS\nAs a starting point to design the Virtual River\
    \ Game, we researched the actual \nneeds and desires of river management stakeholders\
    \ based on interviews (Chapter \n2). We developed an interview method that integrates\
    \ Sense-making and Cultural \nTheory. Following the human centered design philosophy,\
    \ the method facilitates \nriver management stakeholders to structurally reflect\
    \ on a self-introduced, challeng-\ning situation and subsequently imagine how\
    \ they would like to address this situa-\ntion. Based on these interviews, we\
    \ identified three challenges that stakeholders face \nin Dutch river management:\
    \ (1) the distribution between the contribution of spatial \nmeasures and dike\
    \ reinforcement to reach flood safety norms, (2) the inclusion of \nsecondary\
    \ objectives next to reaching flood safety norms, and (3) sustaining the inte-\n\
    grated river management approach in the maintenance of floodplains. By analyzing\
    \ \nthe stakeholders’ perspectives on these challenges, we gained an initial understand-\n\
    ing of the actual needs and desires of stakeholders. Subsequently, this understanding\
    \ \nevolved by developing prototypes and evaluating these with stakeholders (Chapter\
    \ \n4). Without applying the human centered design approach, we would likely not\
    \ have \nrealized or fully understood that several stakeholders view hydrodynamic\
    \ models, \nmodels used in river management decision-making, as black boxes. \n\
    To fulfill this identified need, we developed a tangible user interface, linking\
    \ a \nphysical game board to digital models (Chapter 4). The game board is a hexagonal\
    \ \ngrid where each grid tile contains pieces  that represent the tile’s elevation\
    \ and land \nuse. The grid tiles combined represent a typical, but fictional,\
    \ stretch of a Dutch \nriver. Players apply river management interventions by\
    \ changing pieces on the game \nboard. The changes are subsequently turned digital\
    \ as input to a hydrodynamic and \nother environmental models and the output of\
    \ the hydrodynamic model is visualized \non the game board. This way, players\
    \ see the effects of interventions (the model’s \noutput) on the location where\
    \ they applied them (the model’s input). The interface \nenables players to collaboratively\
    \ work with the models in the game, regardless of \nbackground or expertise (Chapter\
    \ 5). Furthermore, by using a physical game board, \nthe interface eases the players’\
    \ cognitive load to process information and stimulates \nplayers to use visible\
    \ actions that make their views on both the problems and their \nsolutions explicit\
    \ to each other. Applying human centered design therefore led to \nthe development\
    \ of the novel interface design that links a physical game board to \nenvironmental\
    \ models in order to make models used in practice both accessible and \ntransparent,\
    \ the second contribution of this thesis. \nWe analyzed the state-of-the-art in\
    \ evaluating social learning outcomes of seri-\nous games to collaboratively explore\
    \ complexity (Chapter 3). The review shows that \nthere is a lack of systematic\
    \ evaluation approaches to assess cognitive, normative \nand relational learning\
    \ outcomes, the operationalization of social learning, of such \nxv\nS\nserious\
    \ games. Three evaluation strategies to assess each type of learning outcome \n\
    are identified: (1) measuring participants’ knowledge before and after playing\
    \ a game \n(measured learning), (2) participants self-reporting on learning after\
    \ playing a game \n(self-reporting learning), and (3) observing learning by participants\
    \ during a game \n(observed learning). Based on the review, all three strategies\
    \ are suitable for assess-\ning cognitive learning outcomes. For normative learning\
    \ outcomes, the use of the \nmeasured and self-reported learning evaluation strategies\
    \ are suitable. For assessing \nrelational learning outcomes, the self-reported\
    \ and observed learning strategies are \napplicable. The review further provides\
    \ an overview of methods applicable to each \nevaluation strategy to assess each\
    \ type of social learning outcome. In the context of \nthis thesis, the evaluation\
    \ strategies and identified methods were used in two ways. \nFirst, to develop\
    \ an evaluation approach to assess the social learning outcomes of the \nVirtual\
    \ River Game. Second, to use as design guidelines that sets a design objective\
    \ \ntowards social learning that we aimed to attain and assess.\nAfter developing\
    \ a final prototype of the Virtual River Game, we applied the \ngame in five sessions\
    \ with both domain experts (river management professionals) \nand non-experts\
    \ (non-professionals and laymen) to evaluate how and to what extent \nthe game\
    \ stimulates social learning using the developed evaluation strategy (Chapter\
    \ \n5). Through self-reporting, both domain experts and non-experts stated that\
    \ they \ngained insights by playing the game, albeit to a different extent. Non-experts\
    \ mostly \nagreed or strongly agreed with statements that they gained insights\
    \ in relation to \ntopics such as the functioning of the river system, the trade-offs\
    \ between interven-\ntions, the use of hydrodynamic models, and the views and\
    \ perspectives of other \nplayers. In their comments, non-experts emphasized insights\
    \ that are exclusively \nassociated with cognitive learning. Experts rated the\
    \ statements in a more mixed \nway, with some statements rated positively but\
    \ some statements, such as on the use \nof hydrodynamic models, neutrally to negatively.\
    \ In their comments, experts empha-\nsized insights related to both cognitive\
    \  and relational learning. A contributing factor \nto stimulate social learning\
    \ in the sessions was the ability for players to experiment \nwith river management\
    \ interventions. In particular, the interface design enables \nplayers to design\
    \ interventions in the game – experimenting with the location, shape, \ndirection\
    \ and size of interventions – over selecting predefined intervention options.\
    \ \nAs the third contribution of this thesis, adding this type of experimentation\
    \ using \ntangible game pieces to serious games is valuable as it enables players\
    \ to collabora-\ntively explore and learn how interventions can be implemented\
    \ effectively. As the \nfourth contribution of this thesis, although serious games\
    \ are tailor-made, the plat-\nform developed for the Virtual River Game may be\
    \ used to more easily transfer the \ngame to other physical, political and cultural\
    \ settings. Moreover, the tangible, hybrid \nxvi\nSummary\nS\ninterface may be\
    \ used as a platform to develop new serious games with a spatial \ncomponent in\
    \ application areas such as water management, land use management \nand urban\
    \ planning. \nIn conclusion, applying a human centered design approach, explicitly\
    \ research-\ning the actual needs and wishes of stakeholders, can enrich the design\
    \ of a serious \ngame and lead to novel game designs that provide meaning and\
    \ value to stakehold-\ners. Supported by the results of this thesis, we strongly\
    \ believe in the value of serious \ngames to collaboratively explore complexity\
    \ in environmental management. As we \nshow in this thesis, serious games can\
    \ provide a simplified yet accurate representa-\ntion of reality where stakeholders\
    \ can engage in a shared exploration of environmen-\ntal complexity. Moreover,\
    \ we show how human centered design can contribute to \ndesigning serious games\
    \ that cater to the actual needs and wishes of stakeholders. As \na result, the\
    \ four main contributions of this thesis are (1) applying a human centered \n\
    design process to the design of serious games, (2) developing a novel interface\
    \ design \nthat uses a physical game board linked to environmental models to make\
    \ the models \naccessible and transparent, (3) adding the ability to experiment\
    \ with the design of \ninterventions as a game mechanic over selecting predefined\
    \ interventions, and (4) \ncreating a hybrid, tangible interface as a platform\
    \ to customize existing or develop \nnew serious games with a spatial component.\
    \ There is work to be done to further \nexplore to use and potential of serious\
    \ games and we provide recommendations for \nboth research in general and towards\
    \ the outcomes of this thesis specifically. We \nhope that this thesis encourages\
    \ and inspires both design researchers and game \ndesigners to continue exploring\
    \ how the design of serious games to collaboratively \nexplore complexity in environmental\
    \ management can add meaning and value to \nstakeholders.\nxvii\nS\nChapter 1\n\
    Introduction\n2\n1\n1.1 \nEnvironmental management\nWe, as a species, place enormous\
    \ strain on our planet and face unprecedented envi-\nronmental challenges as a\
    \ result. We place strain on our planet by using natural \nresources and land\
    \ for social benefit and economic activities such as to produce \nhydropower in\
    \ the Nile river basin and to create agricultural land through deforest-\nation\
    \ of the Amazon rainforest. We face environmental challenges such as climate \n\
    change and global warming and see their effects through devastating forest fires\
    \ in \nAustralia and the melting ice mass in the Arctics. It is undeniable that\
    \ human actions \nand decisions are major contributing factors to the environmental\
    \ challenges we face \ntoday (IPCC, 2014). Environmental management therefore\
    \ refers to the management \nof human activity and its impacts on the environment,\
    \ both now and in the future. \nAs Folke et al. (2002, p. 8) state, environmental\
    \ management concerns the manage-\nment of land and natural resources in a way\
    \ that creates and maintains prosperous \nsocial, economic and ecological systems.\
    \ Environmental management may therefore \nbe defined as “the actual decisions\
    \ and actions concerning policy and practice regard-\ning how resources and the\
    \ environment are appraised, protected, allocated, developed, \nused, rehabilitated,\
    \ remediated and restored, monitored and evaluated” (Mitchell, \n2002, p. 8).\
    \ As a result, environmental management is concerned with the process of \ndecision-making\
    \ in relation to objectives on using natural resources, improving the \nquality\
    \ of the environment or limiting its degradation, and avoiding humanitarian \n\
    as well as environmental disasters. Environmental management calls for an interdis-\n\
    ciplinary approach and requires dealing with complexity to reach robust, informed\
    \ \nand well-considered decisions based on all the knowledge available.\n1.1.1\
    \ \nComplexity in environmental management\nFrom a systems perspective, environmental\
    \ management addresses the management \nof complex adaptive systems as the behavior\
    \ of environmental systems is more than \nthe sum of the behavior of its elements\
    \ (Norberg and Cumming, 2008). Complex-\nity in environmental systems therefore\
    \ relates to the fact that all the elements of \na system combined function as\
    \ a whole, while the interaction of these elements is \ndynamic, non-linear and\
    \ self-organizing (Cilliers, 1998). Moreover, as environmen-\ntal management is\
    \ concerned with social-ecological systems (Berkes et al., 2000; \nColding and\
    \ Barthel, 2019), this interaction is not limited to physical interaction \nwithin\
    \ an environmental system, but also includes the social interaction between \n\
    the stakeholders and institutions that manage or affect the system. Consequently,\
    \ \nenvironmental management typically deals with multiple sources of complexity\
    \ \n(Hommes, 2008). First, interventions in environmental systems have effects\
    \ on a \n3\nIntroduction\n1\nrange of spatial scales, from local to global, that\
    \ transcend boundaries such as coun-\ntry borders (Boyd et al., 2008; Cheruvelil\
    \ et al., 2008; Gurnell et al., 2016; Pelosi et al., \n2010; Vinke-de Kruijf et\
    \ al., 2013; Vreugdenhil et al., 2010). For example, construct-\ning a hydropower\
    \ dam has ecological, hydraulic and social effects throughout a river \nbasin.\
    \ Second, interventions in environmental systems have effects on different \n\
    temporal scales, from short- to long-term (Cash et al., 2006; Groffman et al.,\
    \ 2006; \nGrumbine, 1994; Mardle and Pascoe, 2002; Zevenbergen et al., 2008).\
    \ Deciding to \nreduce or cease the extraction of natural gas may reduce CO2 emissions\
    \ in the long-\nterm, but may require an initial increase of emissions in order\
    \ to construct infra-\nstructure for alternative energy sources. Third, environmental\
    \ systems concern \ninherent uncertainties, meaning that we are not able to fully\
    \ anticipate the effects \nof interventions (Berends et al., 2019; Berends et\
    \ al., 2018; Brugnach et al., 2007; \nPolasky et al., 2011; Warmink et al., 2017).\
    \ We use tools such as computer models and \nclimate change scenarios to take\
    \ decisions based on the best available knowledge, \nbut the real impacts and\
    \ effects of interventions only become apparent well after \ntheir implementation.\
    \ Fourth, environmental systems cover a range of stakehold-\ners and agencies,\
    \ meaning that interventions are planned in policy arenas guided \nby different\
    \ objectives, perspectives and skewed decision-making power (Brugnach \net al.,\
    \ 2011; Fliervoet et al., 2017; Gregory et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2011; Mendoza\
    \ \nand Martins, 2006; Verbrugge et al., 2017). Although environmental management\
    \ \nrequires an integral approach, sectoral responsibilities and interests as\
    \ well as more \npositive or negative future outlooks all affect how stakeholders\
    \ view both problems \nand their solutions. In this thesis, we view complexity\
    \ to therefore include both \nthe techno-physical complexity of the environmental\
    \ system itself as well as the \nsocio-political complexity of managing the system.\n\
    To combat complexity and uncertainty, scholars have advocated active exper-\n\
    imentation and continuous evaluation in the form of adaptive management (Allen\
    \ \net al., 2011; Armitage et al., 2007; Armitage et al., 2008; Berkes, 2009;\
    \ Lee, 1999; Pahl-\nWostl et al., 2007b; Rodela, 2011; Tompkins and Adger, 2004).\
    \ Adaptive manage-\nment accepts both complexity and uncertainty in environmental\
    \ management while \nacknowledging the need to act. Adaptive management therefore\
    \ emphasizes moni-\ntoring carefully defined system indicators and responding\
    \ to changes in the system. \nCentral in these approaches is the need for stakeholder\
    \ participation and learning \nto include additional forms of knowledge, to improve\
    \ the shared understanding of \nenvironmental systems, and to build trust and\
    \ the ability to collaborate between \nstakeholders (Crona and Parker, 2012; Cundill\
    \ et al., 2012; Fabricius and Cundill, \n2014; Huitema et al., 2009; Lockwood,\
    \ 2000; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007a; Pahl-Wostl et \nal., 2008; Stringer et al.,\
    \ 2006).\n4\n1\n1.1.2 \nStakeholder participation and social learning\nAdaptive\
    \ management calls for stakeholder participation to increase the knowledge \n\
    about environmental systems in the form of learning through management (Allen\
    \ \net al., 2011; Lee, 1999; Tompkins and Adger, 2004). Moreover, stakeholder\
    \ participa-\ntion is advocated to include the stakeholders’ different values,\
    \ perspectives and tacit \nknowledge in environmental decision-making in order\
    \ to increase the quality and \nacceptability of decisions (Ananda and Herath,\
    \ 2003; Cundill and Rodela, 2012; Greg-\nory and Wellman, 2001; Reed, 2008; Ruiz-Frau\
    \ et al., 2011; Voinov and Bousquet, 2010; \nVoinov et al., 2016). Therefore,\
    \ through active participation, stakeholders learn about \nthe environmental system,\
    \ about the effects of interventions, and about the views \nand perspectives of\
    \ other stakeholders (Armitage et al., 2008; Muro and Jeffrey, 2008; \nPahl-Wostl\
    \ et al., 2007a; Reed et al., 2010; Rodela, 2011). Such learning processes \n\
    are generally referred to as social learning. Although scholars debate its definition,\
    \ \nsocial learning can be referred to as a change in understanding through interaction\
    \ \nin collaborative and participatory processes that go beyond the individual\
    \ (see e.g. \nCundill and Rodela, 2012; Muro and Jeffrey, 2008; Reed et al., 2010;\
    \ Rodela, 2011). \nSocial learning requires deliberative interactions and building\
    \ relationships between \nstakeholders with the ultimate aim to lead to collective\
    \ action (Cundill and Rodela, \n2012; Keen et al., 2005; Mostert et al., 2008;\
    \ Pahl-Wostl et al., 2008). Social learn-\ning therefore contributes to informed\
    \ and robust decision-making by establishing \na shared understanding of both\
    \ environmental issues as well as the positions and \nperspectives of all stakeholders.\
    \ Combined, stakeholder participation and social \nlearning are seen as essential\
    \ to pursue cross-disciplinary objectives in environmen-\ntal management (Berkes,\
    \ 2009; Mostert et al., 2008; Pahl-Wostl, 2007; Reed, 2008). \nOne method that\
    \ is receiving increased attention to facilitate participation and social \nlearning\
    \ in environmental management is the use of serious games (Aubert et al., \n2018;\
    \ Barreteau et al., 2007; Edwards et al., 2019; Flood et al., 2018; Marini et\
    \ al., 2018; \nMedema et al., 2016; Savic et al., 2016).\n1.2 \nSerious games\
    \ to explore complexity\nSerious games are generally referred to as games with\
    \ a primary purpose other than \nmere entertainment (Michael and Chen, 2005; Susi\
    \ et al., 2007). The origin of the \nterm serious game, in line with how it is\
    \ used today, can be traced back to Clark \nAbt’s book titled Serious Games (Abt,\
    \ 1970). Abt defined games to be serious games \nas “in the sense that these games\
    \ have an explicit and carefully thought-out educa-\ntional purpose and are not\
    \ intended to be played primarily for amusement. This does \nnot mean that serious\
    \ games are not, or should not be, entertaining” (Abt, 1970, p. \n9). Yet, the\
    \ term serious games did not become popular until in early 2000s, when \n5\nIntroduction\n\
    1\nSawyer (2002), inspired by developments in the entertainment gaming industry,\
    \ \npublished the white paper titled Serious Games: Improving Public Policy through\
    \ \nGame-based Learning and Simulation. Although not limited to digital games,\
    \ seri-\nous games have since then increasingly been associated with computer\
    \ or computer \nsupported games (Michael and Chen, 2005; Susi et al., 2007; Zyda,\
    \ 2005). While \nthe term serious game has only recently become popular, there\
    \ is a long history of \nusing games for “serious” purposes (Wilkinson, 2016).\
    \ In the military, games have \nbeen used for centuries for the purpose of training,\
    \ analyzing tactics and preparing \nmissions (Smith, 2010). In business management,\
    \ games have been used since the \n1930s for managers to experiment with playing\
    \ the role of top executives as well as \nsimulating existing or exploring conceptual\
    \ business operations (Faria et al., 2009). \nIn healthcare, games have been used\
    \ to prepare future professional for patient inter-\naction and empathy as well\
    \ as for critical and emergency situations since the late \n1970s (Nehring and\
    \ Lashley, 2009).\nIn environmental management, serious games were adopted to\
    \ address short-\ncomings of models and simulations. In particular, models and\
    \ simulations were \ninitially successfully introduced to analyze well-structured\
    \ problems such as found \nin business management and operational planning (DeLeon,\
    \ 1994; Miser, 1985). \nHowever, the rigid and mathematical models and simulations\
    \ at the time performed \npoorly when applied on heavily disputed, ill-structured\
    \ – or ‘wicked’ (Rittel and \nWebber, 1973) – problems such as found in social\
    \ policies, urban planning, and \nenvironmental management (Brewer, 1986; DeLeon,\
    \ 1994; Wenzler, 1993). Gaming \nproved to be an effective way to communicate\
    \ the dynamics of the system and its \nmodel, but also to include other types\
    \ of data, insights and tacit knowledge (Geurts \net al., 2007; Mayer, 2009; Parson,\
    \ 1997). Such serious games initially became used \nin urban planning to explore\
    \ complex issues around land use, community develop-\nment, public participation,\
    \ ecology and natural resources in the 1970s (Geurts et al., \n2007; Mayer, 2009;\
    \ Taylor, 1971). Later, serious games started to be used in environ-\nmental management\
    \ under the term policy exercises: scenario-based, preparatory \nactivities for\
    \ effective participation in official decision processes (Brewer, 1986, 2007;\
    \ \nToth, 1988a, b). The use of games was again seen as a method to overcome weak-\n\
    nesses of other science-based policy support. In particular, models and simulations\
    \ \nfulfilled the need to communicate scientific knowledge on global environmental\
    \ \nchange, but failed to capture its politics (Mayer, 2009; Runhaar and van Nieuwaal,\
    \ \n2010). Games were used to open up the black box of quantitative models and\
    \ enable \npolicy makers to use these models in decision-making (Mayer, 2009;\
    \ te Brömmel-\nstroet and Bertolini, 2008; Vennix and Geurts, 1987). Moreover,\
    \ games were seen as \nan effective method in policy exercises as games enabled\
    \ policy makers to experi-\n6\n1\nment without decisions or outcomes becoming\
    \ official (Brewer, 1986, 2007; Toth, \n1988a, b).\nIn this thesis, we focus on\
    \ serious games in order to collaboratively explore \ncomplexity in environmental\
    \ management. Over the years, various other terms for \nsuch serious games have\
    \ been used, such as simulation games, policy games and \npolicy exercises (Duke\
    \ and Geurts, 2004; Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer, 2009). For the \npurpose of this\
    \ thesis and in line with common practice in literature, we consider \nthe terms\
    \ serious games, simulation games, policy games and other terms to be \nsynonymously.\
    \ Moreover, we often use the word game to refer to serious game or \nequivalent.\
    \ In the next subsections, we discuss the design and definition as well as \n\
    the strengths and weaknesses of serious games to collaboratively explore complexity\
    \ \nin environmental management.\n1.2.1 \nDesign and definition\nSerious games\
    \ to collaboratively explore complexity aim at providing a simplified \nrepresentations\
    \ of reality (Duke and Geurts, 2004; Harteveld, 2011; Rodela et al., \n2019; Savic\
    \ et al., 2016). To include the reality of the environmental system, these \n\
    games are generally developed as interaction layers to computer models and simu-\n\
    lations (Bekebrede, 2010; Craven et al., 2017; Crookall et al., 1987; Geurts et\
    \ al., 2007; \nLearmonth et al., 2011; Mayer, 2009; Rodela et al., 2019; Valkering\
    \ et al., 2013; van \nHardeveld et al., 2019). To interact with models and simulations,\
    \ this type of serious \ngames uses a graphical user interface (Craven et al.,\
    \ 2017; Jean et al., 2018; van Pelt et \nal., 2015), tabletop surface (Antle et\
    \ al., 2011), game board (Cleland et al., 2012; Keijser \net al., 2018; Meya and\
    \ Eisenack, 2018), or a combination of these (Magnuszewski et \nal., 2018; Stefanska\
    \ et al., 2011). The games allow players to perform actions, which \ninfluences\
    \ the underlying models and simulations, and includes feedback mecha-\nnisms for\
    \ players to inspect the actions’ effects. \nNext to the technical complexity\
    \ of the environmental system, serious games \ngenerally include the social and\
    \ political aspects of environmental management by \nincluding roles, (competing)\
    \ objectives and interaction rules (de Caluwé et al., 2012; \nGeurts et al., 2007;\
    \ Mayer, 2009). In-game roles and objectives are designed based on \nreal-world\
    \ stakeholders and reflect these stakeholders’ responsibilities, priorities and\
    \ \nresources (Magnuszewski et al., 2018; Vasconcelos et al., 2009; Villamor and\
    \ Badmos, \n2016). Interaction rules provide structure to the game, but also reflect\
    \ stakeholders’ \nreal-world abilities, asymmetrical access to information and\
    \ power dynamics (Beke-\nbrede et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2013; Souchère et al.,\
    \ 2010). \nTo bring these points together, serious games to collaboratively explore\
    \ \ncomplexity may be defined as “experi(m)ent(i)al, rule-based, interactive environ-\n\
    7\nIntroduction\n1\nments, where players learn by taking actions and by experiencing\
    \ their effects through \nfeedback mechanisms that are deliberately built into\
    \ and around the game” (Mayer, \n2009, p. 825). Such serious games can facilitate\
    \ stakeholders in their communication, \ncan more easily incorporate diverse perspectives,\
    \ can integrate scientific and tacit \nknowledge, can stimulate experimentation\
    \ and creativity, can provide the ability to \ncollaboratively test management\
    \ strategies in a scenario, and enable to experience \nthe problem from another\
    \ perspective by taking on roles (Bekebrede, 2010; Brewer, \n2007; Duke, 1974;\
    \ Duke and Geurts, 2004; Geurts et al., 2007; Gilbert et al., 2002; \nHaug et\
    \ al., 2011; Mayer, 2009; Medema et al., 2016; Parson, 1997). By doing so, seri-\n\
    ous games in environmental management aim to, for example, raise awareness about\
    \ \nenvironmental risks or problems (Antle et al., 2011; Becu et al., 2017; Craven\
    \ et al., \n2017; Douven et al., 2014; Rebolledo-Mendez et al., 2009), to explore\
    \ and communi-\ncate the complexity of an environmental problem (Ayadi et al.,\
    \ 2014; Bekebrede et \nal., 2018; Cleland et al., 2012; Page et al., 2016; Zhou\
    \ et al., 2013), to facilitate public \nparticipation around environmental problems\
    \ (Barnaud et al., 2007; Ducrot et al., \n2015; Magnuszewski et al., 2018; Salvini\
    \ et al., 2016; Speelman et al., 2014), and to \nsupport decision-making in addressing\
    \ environmental problems (Hertzog et al., \n2014; Hill et al., 2014; Keijser et\
    \ al., 2018; Lankford and Watson, 2007; Onencan et \nal., 2016). In the next two\
    \ sections, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using \ngames to these\
    \ ends.\n1.2.2 \nStrengths\nThere are some clear strengths of using serious games\
    \ to collaboratively explore \ncomplexity. First, serious games integrate the\
    \ complexity of the environmental \nsystem with the complexity of the multi-stakeholder\
    \ setting (Bekebrede, 2010; Duke \nand Geurts, 2004; Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer,\
    \ 2009; Zhou, 2014). Based on underlying \nmodels and simulations, serious games\
    \ to collaboratively explore complexity enable \nstakeholders to explore the problem,\
    \ possible interventions, and the effects of such \ninterventions – the physical-technical\
    \ complexity. In addition, stakeholders are able \nto experience the strategic\
    \ interactions between stakeholders – the socio-political \ncomplexity – by explicitly\
    \ including roles, objectives, and interaction rules in the \ngame.\nSecond, serious\
    \ games enable stakeholders to explore the policy problem in a \nsafe experimentation\
    \ environment (Bekebrede, 2010; de Caluwé et al., 2012; Duke and \nGeurts, 2004;\
    \ Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer, 2009). Games take stakeholders out of their \nordinary\
    \ lives and into an environment that is bound in time and space (Juul, 2011).\
    \ \nAs Duke (1974) argued, playing a game in a collaborative context starts discussions\
    \ \n8\n1\nabout the game’s topic, relations and outcome. However, discussions\
    \ and decisions \nin games are only valid within these boundary conditions; they\
    \ have no implications \noutside of the game. Therefore, as stakeholders take\
    \ on roles in the game, they may \ntake positions they might not defend in reality\
    \ (de Caluwé et al., 2012; Geurts et al., \n2007). Moreover, stakeholders are\
    \ more inclined to experiment and be creative with \nsolutions that may be much\
    \ more sensitive in reality (Duke and Geurts, 2004; Geurts \net al., 2007; Mayer,\
    \ 2009). \nThird, serious games can merge gaming mechanics with models and simula-\n\
    tions (Bots and van Daalen, 2007; Mayer, 2009; Voinov et al., 2016). Serious games\
    \ \nmay be seen as an interaction layer to models and simulations, enabling stakeholders\
    \ \nto directly interact with environmental models without the need for support\
    \ from \nexperts. By playing serious games, stakeholders may therefore increase\
    \ the under-\nstanding of the models that describe environmental systems by making\
    \ the models \ninteractive and easier to use (Bekebrede, 2010; Mayer, 2009; Vennix\
    \ and Geurts, 1987; \nVoinov et al., 2016).\nFourth, serious games enable learning\
    \ about challenges in environmental \nmanagement (Crookall and Thorngate, 2009;\
    \ Hofstede et al., 2010; Marini et al., 2018; \nMayer, 2009; Medema et al., 2016).\
    \ In fact, games play into the nature of humans, \nwho “enjoy exploring, discovering\
    \ and learning. They do not like just to be told about \nsomething; they learn\
    \ most readily from concrete instances and information strong \nin imagery” (Duke\
    \ and Geurts, 2004, p. 35). By experimenting in a game, stakehold-\ners learn\
    \ what intervention options they have available to address an environmental \n\
    problem and what the effects of interventions are. In this learning-by-doing,\
    \ stake-\nholders therefore learn about the complexity of the system. In addition,\
    \ stakehold-\ners also engage with others in a joint problem investigation, thereby\
    \ learning about \nhow other stakeholders view both the problem and its solution\
    \ (Bots and van Daalen, \n2007; Geurts et al., 2007).\n1.2.3 \nWeaknesses\nAlthough\
    \ the use of serious games to collaboratively explore complexity has the \nabove\
    \ listed strengths, serious games also have their weaknesses. First, serious games\
    \ \nare generally tailor made to specific environmental systems with unique policy\
    \ situ-\nations and cultural contexts (Ampatzidou et al., 2018; Bots and van Daalen,\
    \ 2007; \nde Caluwé et al., 2012; Duke and Geurts, 2004; Geurts et al., 2007;\
    \ Toth, 1988b). As \na result, researching and developing such serious games is\
    \ time consuming. More-\nover, these games generally cannot be easily transferred\
    \ to other situations or loca-\ntions even though these seem similar. The game\
    \ has to, for example, be linked to \n9\nIntroduction\n1\nanother model (which\
    \ may not be of the same quality), the roles and rules need to \nbe adapted to\
    \ the new policy situation, or the high-tech solution may not fit the \nlocation’s\
    \ cultural context. \nSecond, serious games are designed with learning objectives\
    \ relevant to real-\nity, but learning still needs to be transferred to reality\
    \ (Chin et al., 2009; Crookall \nand Thorngate, 2009; Geurts et al., 2007; Hofstede\
    \ et al., 2010; Mayer, 2009; Mayer \net al., 2014). Although there is ample evidence\
    \ that games support learning about \nenvironmental problems (Aubert et al., 2018;\
    \ Crookall and Thorngate, 2009; Flood et \nal., 2018; Marini et al., 2018; Medema\
    \ et al., 2016), it has not yet been systematically \nvalidated that lessons learned\
    \ through games are transferred to the real world and \nused in addressing environmental\
    \ problems (Chin et al., 2009; Mayer, 2009; Mayer \net al., 2014).\nThird, as\
    \ a follow-up to the previous point, research on the scientific validity of \n\
    using serious games is met with some suspicion (Chin et al., 2009; Hofstede et\
    \ al., \n2010; Mayer, 2009). As games can have many different forms and are applied\
    \ in vari-\nous contexts, no common methodology to assess the effectiveness of\
    \ serious games \ncurrently exists (Mayer, 2014). In addition, data to assess\
    \ the effectiveness of serious \ngames needs to be gathered in an uncontrolled\
    \ setting; stakeholders may have prior \nrelationships, stakeholders may have\
    \ positive or negative attitudes towards games \nin general and the use of serious\
    \ games in particular, and facilitators have to guide \nthe sessions while continuously\
    \ making decisions on the spot (Chin et al., 2009; de \nCaluwé et al., 2012; Hofstede\
    \ et al., 2010; Mayer et al., 2014). To quote Hofstede et al. \n(2010, p. 825):\
    \ “Proving that simulation games work reminds us of high school math \nin which\
    \ one had to build a complicated argument to prove that two triangles had \nthe\
    \ same shape when one glance at the figure sufficed to confirm that they did.\
    \ The \neffectiveness of simulation games is evident to those who work with them\
    \ (players and \nfacilitators).” Combining this and the previous point, more systematic\
    \ evaluation \napproaches are needed to assess the effectiveness of serious games\
    \ and increase the \nacceptance of research on the application of serious games.\
    \ \n1.3 \nDesigning serious games\nDesigners have some resources available to\
    \ them to design games in general (Salen \net al., 2004; Schell, 2008) and serious\
    \ games specifically (Harteveld, 2011; Ritterfeld \net al., 2009). There are also\
    \ resources available to design serious games in the context \nof environmental\
    \ management. Bots and van Daalen (2007) for example provide \na conceptual framework\
    \ for designing serious games to support policy-making in \nmanaging natural resources.\
    \ Rodela et al. (2019) conceptualize the different uses of \nserious games in\
    \ natural resources and environmental management. Marini et al. \n10\n1\n(2018)\
    \ provide recommendations for the design of serious games to support long-\nterm\
    \ cooperation between stakeholders in water management. Mayer et al. (2016) \n\
    construct four frames to describe the utility of games for society, business and\
    \ poli-\ntics. All these resources are useful to consider trade-offs in the game\
    \ design such \nas balancing meaning, reality and play in the game to reach the\
    \ game’s intended \npurpose (Harteveld, 2011). However, the resources frame serious\
    \ games as an object \nto reach the game’s defined purpose. The resources do not\
    \ help designers to deter-\nmine the game’s purpose, nor if and how that purpose\
    \ fulfills the stakeholders actual \nneeds and desires. \n1.3.1 \nHuman centered\
    \ design\nIn design, it is nowadays widely recognized that people who potentially\
    \ use the prod-\nuct should be involved in the design process in order to develop\
    \ products that meet \nreal needs and wishes. User involvement in design is generally\
    \ advocated under the \numbrella of human centered design. Human centered design\
    \ is a broad concept that \ncan perhaps better be described as a philosophy to\
    \ design products that considers \nthe will and needs of those that use them as\
    \ the starting point of the design process. \nSpecifically, it places the meaning\
    \ a product should offer to people as a central design \nactivity next to a product’s\
    \ purpose (Krippendorff, 2004). People are involved at \nspecific moments or actively\
    \ throughout the design process (Sanders, 2002; Sand-\ners and Stappers, 2008).\
    \ All human centered design methods and techniques there-\nfore center around\
    \ designers communicating, interacting and empathizing with \nprospective users\
    \ of the product in order to obtain an understanding of their needs, \ndesires\
    \ and experiences (Giacomin, 2014; Norman and Verganti, 2014; Steen, 2011). \n\
    Interviews, focus groups, card sorting and ethnography are for example used to\
    \ elicit \npeople’s needs and wishes (Arhippainen and Tähti, 2003; Hanington,\
    \ 2010; Muller, \n2001; Rauth et al., 2010; Sperschneider and Bagger, 2003; Stewart\
    \ and Shamdasani, \n2014). Scenarios and personas are developed to capture current\
    \ and future use situ-\nations of the product (Anggreeni, 2010; Carroll, 1995;\
    \ Pruitt and Grudin, 2003; Tide-\nman, 2008; van der Bijl-Brouwer, 2012). Co-design\
    \ workshops, design games and \nroleplaying are used to include users in the design\
    \ process (Garde, 2013; Thalen, \n2013; van Amstel, 2015). Prototypes, from early\
    \ concepts to functional products, are \ndeveloped iteratively and presented to\
    \ users in order to evaluate these throughout \nthe design process (Kuijer and\
    \ De Jong, 2011; Lloyd and Dykes, 2011). From a design-\ner’s perspective, the\
    \ methods and techniques acknowledge the use related exper-\ntise of prospective\
    \ users, empower prospective users to explore and define potential \nfutures,\
    \ and enable both designers and prospective users to experience the conse-\nquences\
    \ of design decisions. In this thesis, we propose to research the needs and \n\
    11\nIntroduction\n1\ndesires of environmental management stakeholders and to make\
    \ their needs and \ndesires the starting point of a serious game’s design process\
    \ by applying a human \ncentered design process.\n1.4 \nResearch objective\nThe\
    \ aim of this thesis is to explore how a human centered design of serious games\
    \ \ncontributes to foster exploring complexity, facilitating stakeholder participation\
    \ and \nstimulating social learning in environmental management. Therefore, the\
    \ thesis’ \nfocus is on researching and designing serious games to meet actual\
    \ stakeholder \nneeds and desires by applying a human centered design approach.\
    \ To investigate \nthe main aim and accompanying research questions, the design\
    \ and evaluation of \nthe Virtual River Game, a serious game on Dutch river management,\
    \ serves as a case \nstudy. In this thesis, we use serious games to collaboratively\
    \ explore complexity to \nrefer to the aim.\nThe contributions of this thesis\
    \ to the existing literature are threefold. First, the \nthesis covers a wider\
    \ view on serious games development by explicitly researching \nthe stakeholder\
    \ needs and desires as part of the game design process. Second, we \nexplore and\
    \ present novel research methods, design concepts and game mechanics \nthat may\
    \ contribute to boosting strengths and overcoming weaknesses of serious \ngames\
    \ in general. Third, the Virtual River Game, and particularly its evaluation,\
    \ adds \nfurther evidence of the strengths of using serious games to collaboratively\
    \ explore \ncomplexity in environmental management. \n1.4.1 \nResearch context\n\
    The design and evaluation of the Virtual River Game serves as a case study to\
    \ pursue \nthe aim of this thesis. We developed the game in the context of a changed\
    \ manage-\nment paradigm in Dutch river management. Before the paradigm shift,\
    \ ensuring \nflood safety around rivers focused solely on constructing hydraulic\
    \ structures such as \ndikes. Following two near-flood events in 1993 and 1995,\
    \ the new management para-\ndigm that was implemented focuses on increasing the\
    \ resilience of the river system \nby creating space for water (Rijke et al.,\
    \ 2012; Warner et al., 2012; Zevenbergen et al., \n2015). So called spatial measures\
    \ were implemented, such as constructing side chan-\nnels, lowering floodplains\
    \ and relocating dikes (Berends et al., 2019; Straatsma et al., \n2019; Van Denderen\
    \ et al., 2019; van Stokkom et al., 2005). Similar to the old manage-\nment paradigm,\
    \ the measures’ primary objective was to increase flood safety. As a \nsecondary\
    \ objective, the measures aimed to improve the spatial quality of the river \n\
    areas, which can be summarized as its ecological value as well as its cultural\
    \ meaning \n12\n1\nand aesthetics (Fliervoet et al., 2013b; Klijn et al., 2013;\
    \ Nillesen and Kok, 2015; Schut \net al., 2010). These new type of measures and\
    \ inclusion of secondary objectives has \nadded to the Dutch river management\
    \ complexity.\n1.4.2 \nRiverCare\nThe Virtual River Game case study was executed\
    \ as part of the RiverCare research \nprogram funded by NWO (Hulscher, 2014).\
    \ The RiverCare research program was \ninitiated in response to the spatial measures\
    \ implemented in the new Dutch river \nmanagement paradigm. Specifically, research\
    \ projects within the RiverCare program \naimed to research topics that include\
    \ the effects of newly applied management meas-\nures, new governance strategies\
    \ and valorization as well as communication of knowl-\nedge. For example, the\
    \ management measure to construct longitudinal training \ndams was researched\
    \ for the effects on morphology (de Ruijsscher et al., 2018) and \necology (Collas\
    \ et al., 2018). Morphological effects were also studied for main river \nchannels\
    \ (Chavarrías et al., 2019), side channels (Van Denderen et al., 2019), bank \n\
    erosion (Duró et al., 2018) and regional river systems (Candel et al., 2018; Geert-\n\
    sema et al., 2018). Other research focused on quantifying uncertainty of interven-\n\
    tion measures (Berends et al., 2018) floodplain vegetation patterns and monitoring\
    \ \n(Harezlak et al., 2020; van Iersel et al., 2018), and ecosystem services (Koopman\
    \ et al., \n2018; Pfau et al., 2019). On governance, research was conducted on\
    \ the collaborative \nmanagement of floodplains (Fliervoet et al., 2017), public\
    \ participation (Verbrugge \nand van Den Born, 2018) and public procurement strategies\
    \ (Bout et al., 2019). \nResearch on the valorization of knowledge developed in\
    \ RiverCare focused on the \ndevelopment of a decision support tool to optimize\
    \ river management (Straatsma \nand Kleinhans, 2018) and researching the export\
    \ potential of generated knowledge. \nLastly, research focused on the communication\
    \ of research results in the form of \ndeveloping a knowledge base and storylines\
    \ (Cortes Arevalo et al., 2019) as well as \ndesigning a serious game, of which\
    \ this thesis is a result. Developing the Virtual \nRiver Game as part of the\
    \ RiverCare research program enabled us to benefit from \nthe knowledge and expertise\
    \ available within the program on topics such as hydro-\ndynamics, ecology and\
    \ governance.\n1.4.3 \nSerious games in river management\nA handful of serious\
    \ games exist that enable stakeholders to collaboratively explore \ncomplexity\
    \ in river management. Many of these games focus on managing water \nresources,\
    \ such as for irrigation and hydropower (Burton, 1994; Douven et al., 2014; \n\
    Hertzog et al., 2014; Lankford and Watson, 2007; Onencan et al., 2016; Onencan\
    \ and \nvan de Walle, 2018; Rajabu, 2007). A few river management games explicitly\
    \ include \n13\nIntroduction\n1\nflood risk management. Below, we briefly discuss\
    \ these games as these are relevant \nin the context of this thesis. \nValkering\
    \ et al. (2013) developed the Sustainable Delta Game where players are \ntasked\
    \ with developing collective strategies to limit the probability of both floods\
    \ \nand droughts from occurring in a fictional stretch of a Dutch river. Every\
    \ game round, \nplayers use cards to apply policy interventions and receive feedback\
    \ in a graphical \nuser interface that includes a virtual game world. As a higher\
    \ level goal, players learn \nabout the complex interactions between river management,\
    \ climate change and \nchanges in society. The game provides feedback to players\
    \ through an integrated \nassessment meta model that describes cause-effect relations\
    \ based on hydrological \nand impact models. Van der Wal et al. (2016) showed\
    \ that playing the game in twelve \nsessions lead to convergence of the players’\
    \ perspectives. They further concluded \nthat model feedback in the game was an\
    \ important contributing factor for converg-\ning perspectives. Lawrence and Haasnoot\
    \ (2017) adapted the game for application \nin New Zealand and used it to introduce\
    \ players to the use of adaptive pathways as \na way to deal with climate change\
    \ uncertainties. Van Pelt et al. (2015) also applied \nthe Sustainable Delta Game\
    \ in sessions and showed that the game was effective to \ncommunicate about climate\
    \ change uncertainties.\nStefanska et al. (2011) created the Floodplain Management\
    \ Game where players \nplay the roles of farmers, local authorities or water boards\
    \ in a stretch of a river and \nare tasked to manage their own objectives, such\
    \ as profit, biodiversity and control of \nwater flow. By playing the game, players\
    \ explore both technical problem-solving such \nas problem identification and\
    \ analysis as well as relational issues such as understand-\ning mutual relationships\
    \ and recognizing the other players’ positions and interests. \nThe game uses\
    \ a printed game board as an abstract representation of a stretch of a \nriver\
    \ where players manage the land use of parcels in the river’s floodplains. Player\
    \ \nactions are processed manually by an operator and the actions’ effects are\
    \ subse-\nquently calculated by a simplified system dynamics model of the Tisza\
    \ river basin \nin Central Europe. Stefanska et al. (2011) showed that the game\
    \ is a useful tool for \nplayers to experience the challenge of creating river\
    \ management policy by uniting \ntechnical problem-solving with understanding\
    \ mutual relationships. Magnuszewski \net al. (2018) expanded the Floodplain Management\
    \ Game to the Lords of the Valley \ngame to further include and explore social\
    \ aspects of floodplain management.\nCarson et al. (2018) and Bathke et al. (2019)\
    \ developed versions of the Multi \nHazard Tournament – expanding on the Invitational\
    \ Drought Tournament (Hill et \nal., 2014) – where players develop proactive management\
    \ strategies to address possi-\nble droughts, floods and water quality issues\
    \ in a river basin. The game presents a \nmap of a fictional river basin on a\
    \ graphical user interface where players can further \n14\n1\nfind information\
    \ such as their budget, forecasted climate conditions and predefined \nadaptation\
    \ options. Players select adaptation options and receive feedback on envi-\nronmental,\
    \ social and economic factors based on a system dynamics model describ-\ning the\
    \ main characteristics of the Cedar River basin in Iowa, the United States. By\
    \ \nplaying the game, players gain understanding of complex water resources systems,\
    \ \nthe trade-offs of adaptation choices and of the other players’ positions.\
    \ Carson et \nal. (2018) and Bathke et al. (2019) showed that playing the game\
    \ enabled players \nto learn about water quality as well as flood and drought\
    \ mitigation options, about \neach other’s perspectives and about potential opportunities\
    \ for future partnerships.\nCraven et al. (2017) developed the SimBasin game where\
    \ players select projects \nto manage indicators related to flooding, agriculture,\
    \ hydropower and ecology in a \nriver basin. In a series of turns, players choose\
    \ to implement projects such as hydro-\npower construction, ecological restorations\
    \ or flood protection that affect the future \nof the basin. Players receive feedback\
    \ on their choices in the game’s graphical user \ninterface based on a simplified\
    \ water resources model of the Magdalena-Cauca river \nbasin in Colombia. The\
    \ game aims to stimulate social learning and in particular \nfor players to gain\
    \ a shared understanding and sense of urgency around the river’s \nmanagement.\
    \ They showed that the game provided an attractive and open discus-\nsion space\
    \ and was therefore successful to bring stakeholders and scientists to the \n\
    same table. \nIn this thesis, we took inspiration from these games to design the\
    \ Virtual River \nGame and expand on these and other environmental management\
    \ games by explor-\ning how a human centered design approach benefits a serious\
    \ game’s design.\n1.4.4 \nResearch gap\nThe games listed above illustrate the\
    \ interest in using serious games to explore \ncomplexity, facilitate participation\
    \ and stimulate social learning in environmental \nmanagement. The recent interest\
    \ to develop and apply serious games has largely \nbeen driven by advances in\
    \ computational power and in the entertainment gaming \nindustry (Aubert et al.,\
    \ 2018; Bekebrede, 2010; Mayer, 2009). Recent studies advo-\ncate for making the\
    \ stakeholders, the policy context, and the (social) processes of \nthe problem\
    \ at hand the driving force of a serious game’s design rather than tech-\nnical\
    \ aspects (Aubert et al., 2019; Rodela et al., 2019). Human centered design fits\
    \ \nthis approach, but has not been applied before on serious games to collaboratively\
    \ \nexplore environmental complexity. In this thesis, we therefore explore how\
    \ apply-\ning a human centered design, taking the stakeholders and their needs\
    \ and desires \nas the starting point of the design process, may enrich the design\
    \ of serious games \nto collaboratively explore complexity.\n15\nIntroduction\n\
    1\n1.5 \nResearch questions\nThe aim of this thesis is to explore how a human\
    \ centered design of serious games \ncontributes to foster exploring complexity,\
    \ facilitating stakeholder participation, and \nstimulating social learning in\
    \ environmental management. We investigate the aim \nthrough the Virtual River\
    \ Game case study. By applying a human centered design \napproach, the following\
    \ research questions are addressed:\nRQ1. \nWhat are the challenges, needs and\
    \ stakeholder perspectives needed to \ncollaboratively explore river management\
    \ complexity?\nRQ2. \nHow can social learning through serious games be evaluated\
    \ and how can \nthe evaluation approach be used to distill game design guidelines\
    \ for collab-\noratively exploring complexity?\nRQ3. \nHow can the intended serious\
    \ game be designed to meet the identified \nstakeholder needs and intended social\
    \ learning outcomes?\nRQ4. \nHow and to what extent does the Virtual River Game\
    \ enable stakeholders to \ncollaboratively explore river management complexity\
    \ and stimulate social \nlearning?\nFigure 1.1 An overview of the research approach.\n\
    16\n1\n1.6 \nMethodology\nBelow, the methodology of the research is briefly discussed\
    \ for each research ques-\ntion and placed in the context of the Virtual River\
    \ Game case study.\nRQ1. \nTo investigate the aim of the thesis, the needs and\
    \ desires of stakehold-\ners are considered as the prominent driver for design\
    \ of the Virtual River \nGame. We elicited the initial stakeholder needs and desires\
    \ by interview-\ning several stakeholders in Dutch river management. Through interviews,\
    \ \ndesigners can obtain an in-depth understanding of the stakeholders’ needs,\
    \ \ndesires and experiences. To enhance this process, we developed an interview\
    \ \nmethod to uncover the challenges in Dutch river management as perceived \n\
    by the stakeholders, as well as their perspectives on these challenges. We \n\
    used these challenges and perspectives to derive stakeholder needs and \ndesires.\n\
    RQ2. \nBased on the stakeholder needs and desires elicited in RQ1, we were able\
    \ to \nformulate social learning objectives for the Virtual River Game. To evaluate\
    \ \nto what extent the game is effective to stimulate social learning, we aimed\
    \ \nto develop an evaluation approach for the game. To do so, we conducted a \n\
    systematic literature review to analyze the state-of-the-art in the evaluation\
    \ \nof serious games aimed to stimulate social learning around sustainability\
    \ \nissues. We created an overview of assessment methods in relation to a typol-\n\
    ogy on social learning that defines three types of social learning: cognitive,\
    \ \nnormative and relational. \nRQ3. \nWe explored how the Virtual River Game\
    \ can be designed to meet the needs \nand desires elicited in RQ1 and the learning\
    \ objectives in RQ2. Following a \nhuman centered design approach, we developed\
    \ non-functional and play-\nable low-fi prototypes to allow stakeholders to participate\
    \ in the design \nprocess and experience the consequences of design choices. We\
    \ used the \ninput and feedback of stakeholders both to gain further understanding\
    \ of \nthe stakeholder needs and desires as well as to determine refinements and\
    \ \nnew directions for the game’s design. Moreover, to facilitate participation\
    \ \nand social learning, it is important that all stakeholders are able to iden-\n\
    tify and work with the models and simulations included in the game. We \ntherefore\
    \ focused on (1) how the Virtual River Game can serve the needs \nof both domain\
    \ experts and non-experts in this respect, and (2) how these \ntwo groups can\
    \ be facilitated to collaboratively explore river management \ncomplexity.\n17\n\
    Introduction\n1\nRQ4. \nWe developed the Virtual River Game specifically to meet\
    \ the stakeholders’ \nneeds and desires. Based on these, we formulated specific\
    \ learning objec-\ntives for the game. Using the overview created in RQ2, we subsequently\
    \ \ndeveloped an evaluation approach to assess the learning objectives. We \n\
    applied the Virtual River Game in five sessions and used the evaluation \napproach\
    \ to determine how and to what extent the game leads to social \nlearning outcomes.\
    \ \n1.7 \nThesis outline\nThe structure of this thesis is as shown by Figure 1.1.\
    \ Chapter 2 is concerned with \nthe investigation of current management challenges\
    \ in Dutch river management, \nincluding the perspectives of stakeholders on these\
    \ challenges, answering RQ1. In \nChapter 3, we analyze the state-of-the-art of\
    \ how social learning outcomes of serious \ngames aimed to enable stakeholders\
    \ to collaboratively explore sustainable manage-\nment strategies are evaluated.\
    \ Chapter 3 therefore answers the first part of RQ2 and \nprovides a framework\
    \ to answer RQ4. Chapter 4 concerns how prototyping efforts \nled to designing\
    \ a physical game board as an interface to digital models for the \nVirtual River\
    \ Game and discusses the interface’s impact on the game being an effec-\ntive\
    \ boundary object. Chapter 5 subsequently describes the Virtual River Game final\
    \ \nprototype and discusses the game’s social learning outcomes as well as how\

    \ answer RQ3, \nwhile Chapter 5 also answers the second part of RQ2 and RQ4.\n\
    Combined, the chapters describe the research around and the design of the \nVirtual\

    the aim of this thesis: to explore how the serious games’ design contributes to\
    \ foster \nexploring complexity, facilitating stakeholder participation and stimulating\
    \ social \nlearning in environmental management. In Chapter 6, we discuss the\
    \ four main \ncontributions of the research, reflect on the research approach\
    \ and discuss the \nresearch’s limitations. The four main contributions of this\
    \ thesis are: (1) applying a \nhuman centered design process to the design of\
    \ serious games; (2) developing a novel \ninterface design that uses a physical\
    \ game board linked to environmental models to \nmake the models accessible and\
    \ transparent; (3) adding the ability to experiment \nwith the design of interventions\
    \ as a game mechanic over selecting predefined inter-\nventions; and (4) creating\
    \ a hybrid, tangible interface as a platform to customize \nexisting or develop\
    \ new serious games with a spatial component. In the final chapter, \nChapter\
    \ 7, we provide conclusions to both the overall aim and the research questions\
    \ \nbefore ending with recommendations in regard to future research and possible\
    \ next \nsteps with the thesis’ outcomes.\n18\n1\nChapter 2\nUnderstanding stakeholder\

    Abstract\nIntegrated river basin management increases technical as well as management\
    \ and \ngovernance complexity. As more stakeholders are involved from different\
    \ back-\ngrounds, it becomes increasingly important to understand how stakeholders\
    \ frame \nissues in integrated river basin management. To better understand this\
    \ process, \nthe following research questions are addressed: (1) what are the\
    \ current complex \nchallenges perceived by river basin management stakeholders;\
    \ (2) what are their \nresolution strategies to address these challenges; and\
    \ (3) what are their underlying \nperspectives towards these challenges? Semi-structured\
    \ interviews were conducted \nwith Dutch river basin management stakeholders following\
    \ Sense-making method-\nology. Cultural Theory was used to analyze how respondents\
    \ construct perspectives. \nThree shared challenges were identified following\
    \ the introduction of new sources \nof uncertainty: (1) creating flexibility in\
    \ a controlled river system; (2) sustaining the \nintegrated approach in the maintenance\
    \ of floodplains; and (3) formulating future \nriver basin management policies\
    \ to adapt to climate change. The analysis showed \nhow stakeholders use different\
    \ rationalities in constructing these perspectives. As \nan implication, it is\
    \ important for all stakeholders to recognize and acknowledge \nthese perspectives\
    \ in integrated river basin management decision-making. New \ntools, such as serious\
    \ gaming environments, are needed to facilitate exchanging and \nunderstanding\
    \ stakeholders’ perspectives. \n21\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives regarding\
    \ challenges for integrated river \n2\n2.1 \nIntroduction\nIntegrative management\
    \ approaches are increasingly common in river basin manage-\nment (Fliervoet et\
    \ al., 2013b; Mitchell, 1990, 2005; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2008; Rijke et al., \n\
    2012; Watson, 2004). Such approaches, commonly referenced to as integrated river\
    \ \nbasin management, in general acknowledge the interrelationships between water\
    \ \n– both quality and quantity – and other variables such as land use. Therefore,\
    \ inte-\ngrated river basin management requires a holistic or systems approach\
    \ to address \nissues (Mitchell, 1990, 2005; Rijke et al., 2012; Watson, 2004).\
    \ Two interpretations of \na holistic or systems approach exist. First is the\
    \ comprehensive interpretation, which \naddresses a system at its largest scale\
    \ – e.g. river basin – and includes all possible \nvariables and their relationships.\
    \ Second is the integrative interpretation, which \ntakes a more focused approach\
    \ by selecting the key variables and their relationships \nthat determine the\
    \ most variability in the system. As Watson (2004) explains, more \nrecent forms\
    \ of integrated river basin management use the integrative interpretation \nto\
    \ avoid conceptual, analytical and managerial challenges posed by the comprehen-\n\
    sive interpretation. The integrative interpretation is defined by Rijke et al.\
    \ (2012, p. \n371) as an approach that \"aligns multiple objectives in a river\
    \ basin across different \nspatial scales and temporal dimensions\".\nIn The Netherlands,\
    \ integrated river basin management is found in the \"Room \nfor the River program\"\
    \ (RftR) and the \"Delta Program\" (DP). In these programs, flood \nrisk management\
    \ targets have been combined with objectives on for example nature \nrestoration,\
    \ recreation and agriculture (Klijn et al., 2013; Rijke et al., 2012; van Herk\
    \ \net al., 2012). Moreover, these programs have shifted Dutch river basin management\
    \ \nfrom protecting against water with dikes to accommodating water with spatial\
    \ meas-\nures such as side-channels and dike relocations, placing more emphasis\
    \ on spatial \ndevelopment (Wiering and Arts, 2006; Wolsink, 2006). Such integrated\
    \ river basin \nmanagement approaches are not limited to the Netherlands and can\
    \ be observed in \nmany developed countries (see Warner et al., 2012).\nConsequently,\
    \ integrative approaches introduce stakeholders from non-water \nrelated disciplines\
    \ to river basin management. As a result, decision-making in inte-\ngrated river\
    \ basin management has become much more multidisciplinary, collabo-\nrative and\
    \ complex (Dewulf et al., 2015; Margerum and Robinson, 2015; Pahl-Wostl, \n2006).\
    \ Previous studies have shown a need for understanding how stakeholders \nframe\
    \ issues in such decision-making settings (Curtis et al., 2002; Gray, 2004; Mostert\
    \ \net al., 2008). Following Goffman (1974), stakeholders frame issues in order\
    \ to organ-\nize their own understanding of the issue and to subsequently guide\
    \ future action. If \nstakeholders do not recognize and acknowledge other stakeholders\
    \ framing issues \ndifferently, it becomes difficult to reach a shared solution\
    \ (Gray, 2004; Mostert et al., \n22\nbasin management \n2\n2008; Thompson, 1997).\
    \ The importance is therefore to recognize the existence of \nconflicting frames,\
    \ develop an understanding of these frames and develop responses \nthat takes\
    \ all relevant frames into account. \nThis paper contributes to obtaining a better\
    \ understanding of how issues in \nintegrated river basin management are framed\
    \ differently by involved stakeholders \nas a preparatory step for the development\
    \ of a serious game. To gain this under-\nstanding, three research questions are\
    \ addressed in this paper: (1) what are current \ncomplex challenges perceived\
    \ by river basin management stakeholders; (2) what are \nriver basin management\
    \ stakeholders’ envisioned resolution strategies to address \nthese; and (3) what\
    \ are river basin management stakeholders’ underlying perspec-\ntives towards\
    \ these challenges? To investigate the research questions, semi-struc-\ntured\
    \ interviews were conducted with river basin and floodplain management \nstakeholders.\
    \ To explore the first and second research question, Dervin’s Sense-mak-\ning\
    \ methodology was applied. Thereby, the interviews were set up and conducted \n\
    following a user-centered, constructivist approach with a focus on both challenges\
    \ \nand proposed resolution strategies from the respondents’ point of view. To\
    \ explore \nthe third research question, the perspectives that respondents expressed\
    \ towards \nthese challenges were analyzed using Cultural Theory.\n2.2 \nTheoretical\
    \ framework\n2.2.1 \nSense-making methodology\nDervin’s Sense-making is a generalizable\
    \ methodology for studying how individual \nstakeholders construct meaning – or\
    \ in effect frame – their surroundings (Dervin, \n2003). First, it assumes the\
    \ stakeholder is an expert in his or her world while acknowl-\nedging that there\
    \ is other expertise which may be useful. Second, it assumes that the \nstakeholder\
    \ is a theorist in his or her world and therefore has hunches, hypotheses and\
    \ \ngeneralizations about how things are connected and how power flows (Dervin,\
    \ 1999). \nAs a user-centered approach, Sense-making focuses on identifying what\
    \ individual \nstakeholders \"'really' think, feel, want [and] dream\" (Dervin,\
    \ 1998). In relation to natu-\nral resources management, Romanello (2003) executed\
    \ Sense-making interviews and \nasked natural and social scientists to describe\
    \ specific discussions over climate issues in \nwhich disagreement occurred. This\
    \ application of Sense-making focuses on analyzing \nhow individual stakeholders\
    \ think, feel and question certain situations. Sense-making \nmethodology was\
    \ applied similarly in this study, informing the interview approach, one \nof\
    \ the three different ways to apply Sense-making as a method (Dervin, 1999). Moreo-\n\
    ver, Sense-making was used to allow a respondent to put forward, construct and\
    \ frame \nchallenges as well as resolution strategies based on his or her own\
    \ world. \n23\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives regarding challenges for\
    \ integrated river \n2\nIn the interviewing method, Sense-making attends to constructivist\
    \ assump-\ntions by paying ‘empirical attention’ to the world of the respondents\
    \ rather than the \nworld of the researcher (Dervin, 2003). The respondent is\
    \ seen as facing a gap arising \nout of a situation that prevents him or her from\
    \ reaching a desired outcome. The gap \nneeds to be bridged in order to reach\
    \ this outcome (Dervin and Foreman-Wernet, \n2012; Naumer et al., 2008). This\
    \ way, Sense-making interviews incorporate a deliber-\nate design that invites\
    \ respondents to bridge gaps by drawing their own connections \n\"between past\
    \ and present, present and future; relationships and impacts of power; \nthe very\
    \ value of formal information or lack of it\" (Dervin, 1999).\n2.2.2 \nCultural\
    \ theory and perspectives\nCultural Theory (CT), as described by Thompson et al.\
    \ (1990), explains how ways of \nlife – social structures – maintain themselves\
    \ – or fail to do so – following social-cul-\ntural viability. A main assumption\
    \ behind the theory is that specific cultural profiles \ncan be linked to individual\
    \ perceptions. CT is based on two social dimensions coined \nby Douglas (1970):\
    \ (1) whether an individual’s behavior is influenced by external \nrules (grid);\
    \ and (2) whether an individual feels strongly about belonging to a group \n(group).\
    \ Following these social dimensions as a 2x2 matrix, CT distinguishes four \n\
    ways of life often referred to as rationalities: hierarchist, egalitarian, individualist\
    \ \nand fatalist. Each rationality has its own ideal (stereotypical) world view,\
    \ which are \nsummarized in Table 2.1. \nAccording to CT, these four world views\
    \ act as lenses through which individuals \nobserve the world as well as drive\
    \ action. The theory therefore recognizes that indi-\nviduals and social groups\
    \ act differently under similar circumstances following differ-\nences in their\
    \ underlying beliefs and values. Thompson et al. (1990) extended the \ngrid-group\
    \ based approach to the environmental domain, adding views on nature, \nresources\
    \ and attitude towards risk to each rationality. Subsequently, CT has been \n\
    applied in public policy studies in order to understand how both individuals and\
    \ \ngroups both interpret and address environmental challenges such as climate\
    \ change \n(Verweij et al., 2006), environmental problems related to car use (Steg\
    \ and Sievers, \n2000) and renewable energy (West et al., 2010).\nCT has also\
    \ been extended to Dutch water and river basin management (Hoek-\nstra, 1998;\
    \ Middelkoop et al., 2004; Offermans, 2012; Valkering et al., 2009; Van Asselt\
    \ \net al., 2001). In this extension, most scholars focused on hierarchism, egalitarianism\
    \ \nand individualism – the active rationalities – as fatalism – the passive rationality\
    \ – \nwithdraws itself from policy-making (asking: \"why bother?\"). Building\
    \ on their work, \nthe lenses of CT’s three active rationalities in relation to\
    \ Dutch river basin manage-\nment are summarized in Table 2.2.\n24\nbasin management\
    \ \n2\nAs for the application of CT to Dutch water and river basin management,\
    \ \nHoekstra (1998) applied CT to develop perspectives on water based on the lenses\
    \ of \neach way of life and subsequently derived future scenarios from these perspectives.\
    \ \nSomewhat similar, Middelkoop et al. (2004) used CT to develop integrated scenar-\n\
    ios for water and river basin management based on perspectives. In this approach,\
    \ a \nperspective is a consistent and coherent description of: (1) how the world\
    \ functions \n(world view); and (2) how policy should be carried out (management\
    \ style). \nOffermans (2012) developed the Perspective Method to analyze the role\
    \ of \nperspectives and perspective change in river basin management. In this\
    \ method, \nperspectives are derived by measuring positions – one for each active\
    \ rationality – for \na set of beliefs. For example, on the belief of water system\
    \ organization, the hierar-\nchist’s position is control and regulation, the egalitarian’s\
    \ position is natural devel-\nopment and resilience and the individualist’s position\
    \ is opportunism and innovative \ntechnologies. Contrary to Middelkoop et al.\
    \ (2004), perspectives in the approach \nof Offermans (2012) are therefore not\
    \ stereotypical; they can be heterogeneous by \nCultural Theory \nrationality\n\

    \ Theory rationalities.\n25\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives regarding\
    \ challenges for integrated river \n2\nconsisting of positions from multiple rationalities.\
    \ The operationalized \"Perspective \nMethod\" – a set of 15 beliefs and according\
    \ positions – was used in combination with \na serious game to measure participants’\
    \ perspectives and perspective change in game \nsessions (Valkering et al., 2013).\
    \ In this study, CT was applied similarly to Offermans \n(2012); using a set of\
    \ beliefs to analyze the perspectives that river basin management \nstakeholders\
    \ take towards challenges. Appendix 2.A provides an overview of beliefs \nand\
    \ the respective positions that each rationality takes.\n2.3 \nIntegrated river\
    \ basin management in the Netherlands\nFollowing near-flood events of the Rhine\
    \ and Meuse rivers in both 1993 and 1995, \nRoom for the River (RftR) was developed\

    \ in relation to Dutch river basin management.\n26\nbasin management \n2\nquality\
    \ of the riverine area by incorporating multiple objectives on other river func-\n\
    tions (Klijn et al., 2013; Rijke et al., 2012; van Herk et al., 2012). Consequently,\
    \ stake-\nholders from disciplines such as spatial planning, ecology and business\
    \ have been \nintroduced to Dutch river basin management, increasing its complexity\
    \ (van Herk \net al., 2012; Wiering and Arts, 2006; Wolsink, 2006). Through RftR’s\
    \ integrative \napproach, many floodplain areas have been developed as nature\
    \ or cultural land-\nscapes areas. As a result, the Dutch rivers and floodplains\
    \ have been transformed \nfrom the former single function of agriculture into\
    \ multifunctional riverine land-\nscapes (Fliervoet and van den Born, 2017; Pahl-Wostl,\
    \ 2006). 39 projects have been \nexecuted under the RftR program, most of which\
    \ are either completed or nearly \ncompleted at the time of writing. RftR projects\
    \ are therefore transitioning to their \nrespective maintenance phases (Fliervoet\
    \ and van den Born, 2017).\nThe Delta Program (DP) on the other hand is setting\
    \ out the medium to long-\nterm strategy (2050-2100 outlook) of Dutch water management\
    \ in response to \nclimate change (Deltacommissaris, 2011). In the context of\
    \ its river component, DP \nis using RftR as an example for both collaborative\
    \ and integrative strategies (Rijke et \nal., 2012). Similar to RftR, DP seeks\
    \ to combine increasing flood safety with spatial \nquality. However, for DP spatial\
    \ quality is not a secondary objective in itself and \ntherefore not fully funded\
    \ by the government. Rather, it seeks to combine flood \nsafety measures with\
    \ spatial development that other stakeholders – i.e. provincial \ngovernments,\
    \ municipalities or NGOs – would like to see and contribute to finan-\ncially.\
    \ A second major difference between RftR and DP’s river component is that \nwhere\
    \ RftR only looked at spatial riverine measures, DP combines spatial measures\
    \ \nwith dike reinforcements. At the time of writing, the first short-term projects\
    \ are \nbeing implemented which focuses on dike reinforcements and the long-term\
    \ strat-\negy is in its plan-making phase.\n2.4 \nMethod\nTo answer the research\
    \ questions, interviews with a variety of river basin manage-\nment stakeholders\
    \ were conducted using a semi-structured protocol. Using the \nSense-making interview\
    \ method allowed respondents to focus on self-identified \nchallenging situations\
    \ and to construct their own views. To subsequently analyze \nthese views, Cultural\
    \ Theory was used to analyze these views and generate perspec-\ntives. The interviews\
    \ were set up and executed in four phases:\n1. \nBackground questions related\
    \ to respondents’ work activities, their own visions \non flood safety management,\
    \ nature management and floodplain management \nas well as current trends they\
    \ are observing in river basin management.\n27\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives\
    \ regarding challenges for integrated river \n2\n2. \nContextual questions related\
    \ to a challenging situation – identified by the \nrespondents themselves – such\
    \ as goals they had, other stakeholders they \nworked with and actions they took.\n\
    3. \nSpecific questions related to the identified challenging situation such as\
    \ what \nstruggles they have or had, what concerned them and what questions they\
    \ \nwould like to see answered.\n4. \nEnvisioning questions related to resolution\
    \ strategies to the identified challeng-\ning situation such as what would be\
    \ their preferred outcome, what would help \nthem achieve it and what would they\
    \ do if given a magic wand.\n2.4.1 \nSelection of respondents\nRespondents were\
    \ invited to participate using Table 1 from Fliervoet and van den \nBorn (2017)\
    \ on different river basin and floodplain management organizations as \na starting\
    \ point. Next, respondents were invited based on the criteria that they (1) \n\
    have more than five years of experience in river and floodplain management; and\
    \ (2) \nhave a position with decision-making power in their organizations. The\
    \ first criterion \nensured that respondents have ample experience with the RftR\
    \ policy and its integra-\ntive approaches. The second criterion ensured that\
    \ respondents are involved in deci-\nsion-making, both within their respective\
    \ organizations and between organizations. \nIn total, 15 interviews were conducted,\
    \ in each case by one interviewer; the first \nauthor of this paper. Table 2.3\
    \ provides an overview of the interview respondents, \nthe different organizations\
    \ they represent and a categorization of their function.\nOne interview was conducted\
    \ with two representatives of the same nature \ndevelopment organization (interview\
    \ #2). The interviews were conducted face-to-\nface at the offices of the respondents.\
    \ Thirteen respondents were male, three were \nfemale, which is representative\
    \ for the gender division in the field. The interviews \nwere executed between\
    \ the 15th of July, 2016 and the 18th of November, 2016, lasted \nbetween 47 and\
    \ 124 minutes, with an average of 80 minutes per interview, and were \nrecorded\
    \ for transcription and coding.\n2.4.2 \nData analysis\nThe interviews were analyzed\
    \ in two steps. The first step concerned deductive coding \nfollowing Miles and\
    \ Huberman (1994). The first author acted as first coder and the \nsecond author\
    \ as second coder. The first coder developed a coding scheme in iter-\nations,\
    \ which resulted in 12 themes and 66 categories below these themes. This \nscheme\
    \ was subsequently used by both the first and second coder to code the inter-\n\
    views. Afterwards, memos were created to structure and analyze the information\
    \ \nwithin themes and categories, structure links between categories as well as\

    \ \n2\nTo answer the third research question, the identified challenges were consid-\n\
    ered as a situation in which the respondents acted. Cultural Theory (CT) was subse-\n\
    quently used to understand how respondents view as well as address these situations\
    \ \nbased on how respondents’ opinions, expressions of belief and proposed resolution\
    \ \nstrategies reflected CT’s rationalities. As explained by Hartmann (2011, p.\
    \ 41), the \nsame respondent may act according to hierarchist rationality in one\
    \ situation, but \nfollow the individualist rationality in another. The analysis\
    \ therefore does not assign \none or multiple rationalities to a respondent, but\
    \ analyzes how they act in regard to \nthese situations. In the presented results,\
    \ these views of respondents are presented \nas generalized perspectives. As such,\
    \ these do not necessarily reflect CT’s stereo-\ntypical rationalities; the perspectives\
    \ can be non-stereotypical and reflect multiple \nrationalities. This approach\
    \ was taken as the study analyses the reality of the identi-\nfied challenges\
    \ and in reality, both individuals and organizations do not follow CT’s \nstereotypes,\
    \ but rather follow beliefs of multiple rationalities (Billgren and Holmén, \n\
    2008; Thompson et al., 1990; Verweij et al., 2006). It was assumed that underlying\
    \ \nbeliefs and values at the individual level are equally found at the organizational\
    \ level. \nThe analysis approach taken resembles the operationalized Perspective\
    \ Method \nof Offermans (2012), extending her 15 beliefs to a larger set of 53\
    \ relevant beliefs \nand positions of the three CT’s active ways of life in relation\
    \ to Dutch river basin \nmanagement based on Hartmann (2011); Hoekstra (1998);\
    \ Middelkoop et al. (2004); \nOffermans (2012); Thompson et al. (1990); Valkering\
    \ et al. (2011); and Van Asselt et \nal. (2001). The overview of these beliefs\
    \ and positions can be found in Appendix 2.A. \nThis overview was used as a coding\
    \ scheme for the memos related to each identified \nchallenge in the first analysis\
    \ step to construct respondents’ perspectives.\n2.5 \nIdentified challenges and\
    \ diverging perspectives\nThree challenges were identified in the interview analysis:\
    \ (1) the challenge of creat-\ning flexibility in a controlled river system; (2)\
    \ the challenge of sustaining the inte-\ngrated approach in the maintenance of\
    \ floodplains; and (3) the challenge of future \nriver basin management policies\
    \ to adapt to climate change. Below, each challenge \nis presented, combined with\
    \ respondents’ resolution strategies as well as general-\nized perspectives.\n\
    2.5.1 \nThe challenge of creating flexibility in a controlled river system \n\
    The rivers in the Netherlands are considered a controlled system; the rivers are\
    \ cana-\nlized and the hinterland is protected from extreme river discharges by\
    \ floodplains \nand dikes. In Room for the River (RftR), the primary objective\
    \ focused on creating \nspace for water as a flood safety strategy and the secondary\
    \ objective of developing \n31\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives regarding\
    \ challenges for integrated river \n2\nspatial quality put more emphasis on the\
    \ rivers’ floodplains by applying spatial meas-\nures as well as focusing on nature\
    \ restoration. Here, respondents displayed diverging \nperspectives on how to\
    \ manage the floodplains and specifically floodplains allocated \nto nature restoration.\
    \ As multiple respondents explained, the main idea for these \nnewly created nature\
    \ areas is to let natural dynamics run their course up to a certain \nextent.\
    \ But how do respondents approach management of these areas in an other-\nwise\
    \ controlled river system?\nThe control perspective\nIn the control perspective,\
    \ in particular water managers placed emphasis on creat-\ning clear boundaries\
    \ on the extent of allowed natural dynamics in the nature areas. \nThese respondents\
    \ explained how allowing natural dynamics would cause vegeta-\ntion to grow and\
    \ hydraulic resistance of the floodplains to increase, limiting their \ndischarge\
    \ capacity. Therefore, respondents pointed out the necessity to keep vege-\ntation\
    \ in the floodplains under control. As one water manager explained: \"You do \n\
    not want unwanted developments in the wrong locations. […] How do you maximize\
    \ \nnatural dynamics on one hand and limit it for flood safety on the other?\"\
    \ \nAs an example management solution to keep floodplain vegetation in control,\
    \ \nrespondents explained that the Public Works authority developed the so-called\
    \ vege-\ntation layer. This layer is a flood safety management instrument combining\
    \ maps \nand rules, specifying what type of vegetation is allowed at which location\
    \ in the \nfloodplains. Basically, it establishes a norm for floodplain vegetation\
    \ which may not \nbe exceeded. As one water manager explained: \"The vegetation\
    \ layer says how we, as \nthe Public Works authority, allow vegetation to be in\
    \ the floodplains.\"\nFor the most part, respondents displayed the hierarchist\
    \ rationality towards \nmanaging the floodplains in this perspective, showing\
    \ a partial domination of \nnature, controllability as the desired system property\
    \ and viewing the floodplains \nas controllable lands. The development of the\
    \ vegetation layer is a response to safe-\nguard the controllability of the system\
    \ following the hierarchist rationality through \ninstitutionalizing as the risk-handling\
    \ style and establishing thresholds that may \nnot be exceeded. \nThe flexibility\
    \ perspective\nWhere water managers in the control perspective emphasized the\
    \ need for control-\nlability of natural dynamics, nature managers and some governmental\
    \ manag-\ners focused on allowing natural dynamics in the floodplains to run their\
    \ course. \nHere, respondents explained how nature managers approach the floodplains\
    \ radi-\ncally different from water managers: \"Flood safety bases itself on the\
    \ fixation of the \n32\nbasin management \n2\ncurrent situation and the permitting\
    \ of change. [Our] management is focused on \nsystem development that follows\
    \ natural processes.\" These respondents expressed \nthat it is more important\
    \ to plan ahead and make sustainable developments possi-\nble. Although they acknowledged\
    \ that water discharge is the main function of the \nfloodplains and that thus\
    \ flood safety is leading and agree that nature in the flood-\nplains requires\
    \ regulation, they called for more integrative approaches rather than \nmanage\
    \ flood safety and nature separately. In doing so, their call followed the egal-\n\
    itarian rationality, although also acknowledging elements associated with the\
    \ hier-\narchist rationality.\nIn pursuit of more integrative approaches, respondents\
    \ called for more flexibil-\nity to manage the floodplains and especially the\
    \ newly created nature areas, express-\ning critique towards the vegetation layer.\
    \ Some pointed out that it is quite static and \nconserving, determining the type\
    \ of vegetation on each square meter and that such \nsquare meter fixation is\
    \ not compatible with nature management’s focus on flood-\nplain development.\
    \ Respondents also explained that compensation for vegetation \nmanagement is\
    \ similarly specified to every square meter based on costs for cutting, \npruning\
    \ and grazing for different vegetation types. Multiple respondents stated that\
    \ \nthis funding system is inflexible and counterproductive, not fitting with\
    \ the approach \nfor nature restoration focusing on system development. Combined,\
    \ respondents \nsubscribing to the flexibility perspective explained that the\
    \ flood safety management \nmethods are simply not compatible with nature management\
    \ approaches: \"You can \nregulate what each square meter should look like and\
    \ how we should maintain it, so \nthey [the Public Works Authority] fall back\
    \ on the vegetation layer and that is the safe \nway to guarantee flood safety.\"\
    \ \nIn the flexibility perspective, multiple respondents displayed the egalitarian\
    \ \nrationality towards managing the floodplains; long-term, sustainable and pro-active\
    \ \nsolutions combined with more emphasis on integral management, nature develop-\n\
    ment and resilience.\nAn attempt to bring perspectives together\nIn order to meet\
    \ calls for more flexibility in floodplain management, water managers \nexplained\
    \ that the Public Works authority developed so-called mixed-types in the \nvegetation\
    \ layer which specifies that an area can consist of multiple vegetation types\
    \ \ngiven a more or less fixed partition, for example 10 percent of one type and\
    \ 90 percent \nof the other. However, nature managers explained that these mixed-types\
    \ do not \nprovide them the flexibility as they are still presented with a spatial\
    \ boundary; the \nmixed-types do not allow them to look for alternative measures\
    \ to reduce the flood-\nplain’s hydraulic resistance outside the mixed-type’s\
    \ demarcated area. The solution \n33\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives regarding\
    \ challenges for integrated river \n2\npresented here is the introduction of new\
    \ norms with a flexible component, follow-\ning the hierarchist rationality. From\
    \ the control perspective, this safeguards flood \nsafety while providing flexibility.\
    \ Respondents subscribing to the flexibility perspec-\ntive however stated that\
    \ their desired flexibility is not obtained as the fundamentals \nof the vegetation\
    \ layer are still incompatible with nature management approaches. \nProposing\
    \ resolution strategies\nRespondents proposed multiple resolution strategies towards\
    \ obtaining flexibil-\nity for nature restoration in a controlled river system.\
    \ Two categories of strategies \nwere identified. In the first category, respondents\
    \ focused on increasing adaptivity \nin floodplain management. All mentioned the\
    \ conserving perspective in current \nwater and nature policies and management\
    \ methods as obstructing. As an example, \nsubscribers to both perspectives proposed\
    \ more intensive vegetation management \nactivities executed at longer intervals.\
    \ A water manager proposed to perform rigorous \nvegetation management every 10\
    \ years over the current less intensive and preserving \nannual approach, putting\
    \ less strain on the Public Works authority to monitor and \nmanage floodplain\
    \ vegetation. Another water manager proposed a similar strategy \ntowards floodplain\
    \ management in general, proposing to evaluate plans on whether \nthey solve the\
    \ bigger problem rather than comply with all rules and regulations. \nThis line\
    \ of argumentation focuses on the governmental regulation and manag-\ning its\
    \ scarce resources, in line with the hierarchist rationality. Alternatively, nature\
    \ \nmanagers suggested that when floodplain vegetation causes an increase in hydraulic\
    \ \nresistance but also has ecological value, it should be possible to look for\
    \ a solution \n– achieve water level reduction by reducing the hydraulic resistance\
    \ – at a different \nlocation. They furthermore proposed to cut down vegetation\
    \ altogether over reduc-\ning its hydraulic resistance to an acceptable level,\
    \ mimicking natural processes that \nreset floodplain vegetation. More rigorous\
    \ vegetation management is proposed by \nthese nature managers as well, but in\
    \ order to preserve developed nature in other \nlocations. The line of argumentation\
    \ here focuses on nature development where \nnatural processes are guiding, following\
    \ the egalitarian rationality. \nIn the second category, respondents discussed\
    \ establishing integral river \nbasin management organizations to replace the\
    \ current fragmented governmental \nresponsibilities. These respondents explained\
    \ that these sectoral responsibilities are \ninefficient, counterproductive and\
    \ leading to polarization. In their resolution strate-\ngies, subscribers to the\
    \ control perspective proposed to form a single governmental \nmanagement organization,\
    \ integrally responsible for the river and floodplains. While \nthey focused on\
    \ governmental responsibilities for this management organization, \nassociated\
    \ with the hierarchist rationality, all cited increasing management effi-\n34\n\
    basin management \n2\nciency as the main driver, a view associated with the individualist\
    \ rationality. In addi-\ntion, a governmental manager also explicitly used another\
    \ argument associated with \nthe individualist rationality for the management\
    \ organization: to pursue exploita-\ntion of the floodplain areas. Subscribers\
    \ to the flexibility perspective also proposed \nto form single management organizations,\
    \ however not necessarily governmental. \nThey proposed floodplain management\
    \ organizations on a more local or regional \nscale – single to a couple of floodplains\
    \ – consisting of water and nature managers as \nwell as local stakeholders. The\
    \ proposed goals for these organizations are all in line \nwith the egalitarian\
    \ rationality: finding more sustainable and long-term solutions, \ncreating more\
    \ cohesion between water and societal aspects of river basin manage-\nment and\
    \ establishing more equality between stakeholders through participatory \ndecision-making.\
    \ \n2.5.2 \nThe challenge of sustaining the integrated approach in the \nmaintenance\
    \ of floodplains\nFollowing the (near) completion of all RftR projects, many respondents\
    \ reported \non problems arising in the subsequent maintenance phase. Several\
    \ respondents \nshared concerns that while RftR projects featured strong integral\
    \ approaches in the \nplan-making, objectives might become impossible to achieve\
    \ as a result of a lack of \nmaintenance inclusion in plan-making. In the context\
    \ of RftR, respondents pointed \nout a specific cause contributing to the lack\
    \ of maintenance inclusion: the intro-\nduction of public tendering of floodplain\
    \ areas. Before RftR, riverine projects were \nplanned and implemented under the\
    \ ownership of the Public Works authority with \nan intention to transfer floodplain\
    \ ownership to a preselected terrain management \norganization. As a result of\
    \ a state aid discussion, this transfer of ownership was no \nlonger allowed.\
    \ Instead, it had to be publicly tendered. Multiple respondents indi-\ncated that\
    \ the introduction of public tendering during RftR added a market-oriented \n\
    mechanism that worked against including maintenance in plan-making. \nAs an example,\
    \ one RftR project discussed by multiple respondents was the \nNijmegen-Lent project.\
    \ A large project combining a dike relocation and a side-chan-\nnel in the river\
    \ Waal at the city of Nijmegen. A water manager explained how the \nState Forestry\
    \ Agency was the intended terrain management organization for the \nfloodplain\
    \ area of the project. When it became apparent that ownership would \nnot be transferred\
    \ to the State Forestry Agency, but had to publicly tender for it \ninstead, they\
    \ withdrew themselves from the advising committee. The water manager \nexplained\
    \ that the public tendering discussion was not limited to the Nijmegen \nproject:\
    \ \"This change happened more or less during the plan-making of all RftR \nprojects\"\
    . As a result, input from the State Forestry Agency towards maintenance in \n\
    35\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives regarding challenges for integrated\
    \ river \n2\nthe project’s plan-making and implementation was lost. In this instance,\
    \ the State \nForestry Agency acted along the fatalist rationality, withdrawing\
    \ from the deci-\nsion-making all together.\nIn addition, respondents explained\
    \ that the introduction of public tendering \nmeant the Public Works authority\
    \ would retain ownership of RftR project areas. \nFollowing budget cuts, a financial\
    \ dependency was created for the Public Works \nauthority to generate revenue\
    \ from its assets. A governmental manager explained \nhow the objectives towards\
    \ public use of the floodplains determined in the plan-mak-\ning might become\
    \ impossible. An example is the planned use of the floodplain area \nfor public\
    \ events: the cost for using the terrain became 20 times more expensive \nas the\
    \ organizers were suddenly charged market rates. As expressed by multiple \nrespondents,\
    \ the introduction of public tendering changed the rules towards RftR \nprojects’\
    \ maintenance phases. In regard to this introduction of a market-oriented \nmechanism\
    \ – associated with the individualist rationality – respondents displayed \ndiverging\
    \ perspectives. \nThe accepting perspective\nOn one side were water managers who\
    \ focused their strategies on accepted public \ntendering as the given situation:\
    \ \n\"Public tendering has become reality, thus we need to act accordingly. […]\
    \ But \nif you are an ecologist who deeply cares about the qualities of an area,\
    \ then it is \nvery painful to accept that these areas are no longer automatically\
    \ transferred \nto the State Forestry Agency but are instead brought to the market,\
    \ with the \nrisk that a farmer will simply mow the grass, because that is a real\
    \ possibility.\"\nThe same respondent proposed to bring areas to the market together\
    \ with other \nstakeholders in order to at least agree on all the objectives pursued\
    \ in the area. \nHowever, other stakeholders should financially contribute for\
    \ pursuing goals – for \nexample, nature development goals – which are not the\
    \ responsibility of the Public \nWorks authority. Another water manager would\
    \ like to see that in a couple of years’ \ntime, an organization is found that\
    \ performs maintenance activities and users are \nsatisfied both with how the\
    \ area has developed and how responsible authorities \nperform their roles, proposing\
    \ more an ideal vision rather than a solution proposal. \nThese respondents acted\
    \ with the hierarchist rationality in regard to this challenge, \nbut also showed\
    \ elements of the fatalist rationality by accepting it is not going to \nchange\
    \ and stating it is not the responsibility of the Public Works authority. Their\
    \ \n36\nbasin management \n2\nproposed resolution strategies mainly reflect the\
    \ hierarchist rationality in the proce-\ndural and sectoral approaches and searching\
    \ for win-win solutions.\nThe rejecting perspective\nNature and governmental managers\
    \ on the other hand looked to either reduce the \n– in their eyes – negative effects\
    \ of public tendering or to remove the mechanism \naltogether. These respondents\
    \ were critical of the segregation of project phases \nand the introduction of\
    \ public tendering: \"You do not build a landscape for tomor-\nrow, you build\
    \ it for the future. […] That means that you plan with maintenance in \nmind,\
    \ not what others at time do, maintaining the plan.\" The respondents specifi-\n\
    cally opposed the short-term contracts that public tendering introduced towards\
    \ \nfloodplain management. One nature manager explained how the six year contracts\
    \ \nare much less interesting for the respondent’s organization as they hold the\
    \ philos-\nophy to only manage terrains if they have durable ownership. These\
    \ respondents \nexpressed concerns following the egalitarian rationality towards\
    \ public tendering \nsuch as negative consequences on sustainability as well as\
    \ lack of long-term outlooks \nand pro-active strategies. One respondent proposed\
    \ to make a governmental organ-\nization integrally responsible for the planning,\
    \ implementation and maintenance \nof a project in order to sustain integral approaches.\
    \ Another respondent stated that \nhigher administrative levels should determine\
    \ that a different economic profit model \nshould apply to the public tenders\
    \ if needed to make sure objectives determined in \nplan-making remain attainable.\
    \ Although these respondents expressed concerns \nfollowing the egalitarian rationality,\
    \ they turn towards the hierarchist rationality \nof governmental responsibility\
    \ and regulation to deal with the undesired, negative \nconsequences.\n2.5.3 \n\
    The challenge of future river basin management policies to adapt \nto climate\
    \ change\nIn regard to future challenges, several respondents discussed climate\
    \ change in rela-\ntion to river basin management. Some water and governmental\
    \ managers exten-\nsively focused on the challenge of future river basin management\
    \ policies to adapt \nto climate change. The challenge is related to the Delta\
    \ Program (DP), which, as \nexplained in the background section, uses RftR as\
    \ an example for its river compo-\nnent. However, respondents pointed out two\
    \ major differences, differences which \ncurrently lack specifications. Firstly,\
    \ RftR’s two objectives on flood safety and spatial \nquality were paid for by\
    \ the same stakeholder: the Dutch national government. \nHowever, DP looks at\
    \ \"combining efforts\"; if an opportunity arises to combine spatial \n37\nUnderstanding\
    \ stakeholder perspectives regarding challenges for integrated river \n2\ndevelopments,\
    \ other stakeholders are asked to contribute financially. As a govern-\nmental\
    \ manager stated: \"This causes a discussion on cost sharing and that is of \n\
    course a whole other principle than we had in RftR.\" \nSecondly, a different\
    \ approach to flood safety management is taken in DP. \nWhereas RftR only looked\
    \ at spatial measures for its flood safety measures, DP looks \nto, as respondents\
    \ summarized, \"develop a powerful combination of spatial meas-\nures and dike\
    \ reinforcements.\" However, they pointed out that DP does not include \na specification\
    \ of how much spatial measures or dike reinforcements should each \ncontribute\
    \ to DP’s objective of flood safety. As a water manager explained: \nYou can achieve\
    \ flood safety targets with dike reinforcement and with spatial \nmeasures. And\
    \ which targets you solve with which kind of measures is not spec-\nified. In\
    \ RftR it was simple, you reach all targets through spatial measures unless \n\
    it is impossible to reach this way.\nThe preference strategy\nCombined, respondents\
    \ discussed how these two non-specifications are causing \nuncertainty in the\
    \ development of future river basin management plans. As an exam-\nple, a province\
    \ was asked to develop a \"preference strategy\"; a plan that combines \ndike\
    \ reinforcements and spatial measures to achieve DP’s long-term flood safety \n\
    objectives (2050-2100). The province developed the strategy, but it was subsequently\
    \ \nrejected by the DP management as the strategy was too expensive, it had to\
    \ be \nadjusted. A water manager explained that the preference strategy therefore\
    \ became \n\"a guiding compass\"; a map of how much water level reduction could\
    \ be achieved, \ninstead of a decision.\nAnother water manager expressed critique\
    \ towards the rejection of the prefer-\nence strategy as it made it uncertain\
    \ whether or not spatial measures in the strategy \nare going to be implemented.\
    \ As a result, water boards do not know the water levels \nfor which they need\
    \ to reinforce their dikes to comply with new protection norms \nas some of these\
    \ dikes are in locations where spatial measures are planned in the \npreference\
    \ strategy. Other respondents recognized this need to decide on whether \nor not\
    \ spatial measures are going to be executed:\n\"If you do not make arrangements,\
    \ the water boards will understandably heighten \nthe dike to the maximum necessary\
    \ height. […] But then you do not need spatial \nmeasures anymore, at least, not\
    \ for the water level reduction targets. While you \ncan achieve many other targets\
    \ through spatial measures and it makes the river \nsystem more robust.\"\n38\n\
    basin management \n2\nA water manager however explained that the costs to achieve\
    \ the same level of \nflood safety through dike reinforcement is far lower than\
    \ through spatial measures, \nadding: \"The minister [of Infrastructure and Environment]\
    \ takes a sober and effec-\ntive approach, so you can imagine what the choice\
    \ between dike reinforcement and \nspatial measures should be.\"\nRespondents\
    \ did not display multiple perspective towards this challenge. For \nthe most\
    \ part, respondents displayed the hierarchist rationality towards this chal-\n\
    lenge, expressing predominantly positions such as expert norms as the primary\
    \ \nmotives for action, government regulation as management mechanism and water\
    \ \nmanagement focused on win-win solutions. \nResolution strategies to make decisions\n\
    In targeting this challenge, respondents also expressed the hierarchist rationality\
    \ in \ntheir resolution strategies. Moreover, they all showed similar lines in\
    \ their strategies. \nOverarching in all of these were the need to come to agreements\
    \ on what measures \nare going to be taken. Specifically, the respondents stated\
    \ that securing finances for \nlong-term plans as one of the important aspects\
    \ towards resolving the challenge. \nOn this point, respondents advocated that\
    \ the national government should make \nfunds available for spatial measures to\
    \ reach the requested agreement on measure \nimplementation and provide water\
    \ boards with the desired certainty. A respondent \nproposed to execute dike reinforcement\
    \ and spatial measures projects as part of one \norganization in order to approach\
    \ an area as one project instead of multiple projects \nin an area. In addition,\
    \ this respondent would like to see more \"rules of play\" for the \nDP plan-making\
    \ similar to those that existed in RftR. Another respondent echoed \nthis view\
    \ and proposed to formulate clear boundary objectives for decision-making, \n\
    for water management, but also towards for example required nature development.\
    \ \n2.6 \nThe framing of challenges and divergent perspectives\nIn this research,\
    \ Sense-making methodology and Cultural Theory (CT) were \ncombined to identify\
    \ the challenges and analyze respondents’ perspectives. The \napplication of Sense-making\
    \ enabled respondents to put forward and construct \nthe challenges, their perspectives\
    \ towards these and possible resolution strategies \nthemselves. Cultural Theory\
    \ subsequently enabled the analysis of how stakeholders \nframe both the challenges\
    \ and their resolution strategies by analyzing the ration-\nalities they used\
    \ towards these situations. The combination proved to be a suitable \napproach\
    \ to gain insight into and understand how issues are framed in river basin \n\
    management. Moreover, the combination enabled the empirical assessment of the\
    \ \nrationalities stakeholders use in framing a situation, rather than confirming\
    \ the \n39\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives regarding challenges for integrated\
    \ river \n2\nresearcher’s beliefs (Billgren and Holmén, 2008). Furthermore, the\
    \ combination \nprovided a methodology using the complementation of  \"intensive\
    \ explication\" and \n\"comparative generalizations\"; an in-depth case study\
    \ of a system and its stakehold-\ners and limited generalizations regarding identifiable\
    \ patterns respectively (Morrow \nand Brown, 1994, p. 211-212). \n2.6.1 \nDivergent\
    \ perspectives following the introduction of uncertainty\nThe identified challenges\
    \ and divergent perspectives show how stakeholders frame \nchanges to river basin\
    \ management differently. Verweij et al. (2006) argue that at \nleast three divergent\
    \ perspectives exist that frame the issue – defining the problem \nand suggesting\
    \ solutions in policy problems – corresponding to the three active \nrationalities\
    \ in CT. However, in the results presented in this paper, only one or two \ndistinctive\
    \ perspectives on each challenge were identified. This may be explained \nby the\
    \ limited representation of private organizations in both Dutch river basin \n\
    management and the executed interviews that could be expected to frame these \n\
    challenges using the individualist rationality. According to Thompson (2008),\
    \ uncer-\ntainty is a prerequisite for divergent perspectives to emerge. In all\
    \ three challenges, \nnew sources of uncertainty are added to existing river basin\
    \ management discourses \nasking for a response.\nThe challenge of creating flexibility\
    \ in a controlled river system\nThe challenge of creating flexibility in a controlled\
    \ river system relates to how newly \ncreated nature areas in the floodplains\
    \ should be managed. In these areas, natural \ndynamics are allowed to run their\
    \ course up to a certain extent. The unpredictable \nnatural dynamics could however\
    \ lead to an increase in hydraulic roughness of flood-\nplains, adding uncertainty\
    \ to flood safety management. In response, water manag-\ners frame the issue from\
    \ the hierarchist rationality as needing to control the natural \ndynamics. Nature\
    \ managers, on the other hand, frame the issue from the egalitarian \nrationality\
    \ by focusing on allowing natural dynamics to run their course. In particu-\n\
    lar, water managers employ a fixation point of view while permitting change –\
    \ focus-\ning on controllability – and nature managers take a development point\
    \ of view based \non natural processes – focusing on sustainability – which seems\
    \ incompatible. Yet, \nboth water and nature managers agree that water discharge\
    \ is the main function of \nthe floodplains. Similarly, they both consider the\
    \ floodplains as controllable lands \nand agree that nature in the floodplains\
    \ requires regulation. The challenge seems \npurely rooted in the execution of\
    \ floodplain management and regulation of nature \nrestoration, not in a split\
    \ point of view on its necessity. These results are in line with \nWiering and\
    \ van de Bilt (2006), who predicted that water and nature management \n40\nbasin\
    \ management \n2\nin the Dutch floodplains could become a marriage where spouse\
    \ clash in the daily \nhousekeeping, particularly when the maintenance aspect\
    \ of floodplains comes in. \nThe challenge also reflects results of Fliervoet\
    \ et al. (2013b), who looked specifically \nat – as they defined it – the \"nature-safety\
    \ dilemma\" and showed that floodplain \nmanagement stakeholders are looking for\
    \ more flexibility in river and nature poli-\ncies. Moreover, they showed that\
    \ the current static and conserving approaches in \nDutch river basin management\
    \ – exemplified in this paper by the vegetation layer – \nare not compatible with\
    \ more adaptive floodplain management concepts.\nThe challenge of sustaining the\
    \ integrated approach in the maintenance \nof floodplains\nIn the challenge of\
    \ sustaining the integrated approach in the maintenance of flood-\nplains, the\
    \ introduction of public tendering to RftR added a market-oriented mech-\nanism\
    \ –  associated with the individualist rationality – to floodplain management\
    \ \npolicy. Following this introduction, organizations now have to publicly tender\
    \ for \nshort-term contracts to manage the floodplain areas following the completion\
    \ of RftR \nprojects. As a result, it is no longer certain who or which organization\
    \ would manage \nthe floodplain areas. Governmental and nature managers rejected\
    \ the introduction \nof public tendering as it introduced negative consequences\
    \ towards their desire of \npursuing sustainability, creating long-term outlooks\
    \ and implementing pro-active \nstrategies, framing the issue using the egalitarian\
    \ rationality. Water managers on the \nother hand accepted public tendering as\
    \ the new reality and looked for solutions that \nsuits all involved while stressing\
    \ that it is not their responsibility to pursue other \ngoals such as nature development,\
    \ framing the issue from both the hierarchist and \nfatalist rationalities. Similar\
    \ to the results presented here, Fliervoet et al. (2017) also \nnoted the effects\
    \ of public tendering to floodplain management. Through an unsuc-\ncessful pilot\
    \ study on collaborative floodplain management, they showed that the \npublic\
    \ tendering was obstructing to establish collaborative arrangements and could\
    \ \npossibly exclude nature management organizations. Furthermore, they showed\
    \ that \nit leads to segregation of activities rather than integrated floodplain\
    \ management.\nThe challenge of future river basin management policies to adapt\
    \ to \nclimate change\nIn the challenge of future river basin management policies\
    \ to adapt to climate \nchange, lack of specifications in the river component\
    \ of the Delta Program (DP) \nin comparison to RftR added uncertainty towards\
    \ taking decisions. Firstly, RftR’s \nprimary objective, increasing flood safety,\
    \ had to be reached only using spatial \nmeasures unless this was not possible.\
    \ DP instead combines dike reinforcement \n41\nUnderstanding stakeholder perspectives\
    \ regarding challenges for integrated river \n2\nand spatial measures to increase\
    \ flood safety, but lacks specification on how much \neach should contribute.\
    \ Secondly, spatial quality was an objective fully paid for by \nthe national\
    \ government in RftR. Spatial quality is however not a DP objective and \nstakeholders\
    \ who want spatial quality developed are asked to financially contribute \nto\
    \ DP projects. Combined, the lack of specifications has resulted in the postpone-\n\
    ment of decisions. A consequence feared by respondents is that water boards will\
    \ \nexecute dike reinforcement to maximum necessary height to meet the flood safety\
    \ \nnorms, making spatial measures unnecessary. The challenge therefore relates\
    \ to \nlengthy decision-making and the need to come to decisions. The challenge\
    \ however \nrelates to taking decisions – it is less important what these decisions\
    \ are – in order \nfor all stakeholders to know what they can expect.\nThe existing\
    \ lack of specifications obstruct the respondents’ desires of expert \nnorms as\
    \ the primary motives for action, government regulation as management \nmechanism\
    \ and water management focused on win-win solutions. The respond-\nents therefore\
    \ all displayed the hierarchist rationality in relation to this challenge, \n\
    whereas the other challenges displayed two perspectives each. This result may\
    \ be \nattributed to a limited amount of respondents addressing this challenge\
    \ in their \ninterviews. Alternatively, it may explain why the challenge exists\
    \ in the first place. \nAs noted by Van Asselt et al. (2001), the hierarchist\
    \ water management style pursues \nwin-win situations, but avoids making real\
    \ choices. As a result, decision-making can \nget stuck in conferences and become\
    \ sluggish. Schwartz (1991, p. 765) explains how \nthe CT’s rationalities undermine\
    \ themselves if left unchecked: \"Hierarchies, in turn, \nwould be stagnant without\
    \ the creative energy of individualism, incohesive without \nthe binding force\
    \ of equality, unstable without the passivity and acquiescence of fatal-\nism.\"\
    \ The existence of the challenge may therefore be explained by the fact that the\
    \ \nnon-hierarchist rationalities are insufficiently represented.\n2.6.2 \nA call\
    \ for clumsiness and learning \nIn all challenges, divergent perspectives were\
    \ socially constructed towards new situa-\ntions in river basin management following\
    \ the introduction of new sources of uncer-\ntainty. That divergent perspectives\
    \ exist in these situations is however inevitable and \neven desirable; it indicates\
    \ that the challenges matter (Verweij et al., 2006). Verweij \net al. (2006) furthermore\
    \ explain that each perspective tells a plausible, but selective, \nstory. It\
    \ is therefore not a debate about which perspective is right or wrong: \"If you’re\
    \ \nhaving to ask who’s right (worse still, if you already know who’s right),\
    \ you’re wrong!\" \n(Thompson, 1997, p. 209). Formulating a response based on\
    \ only one perspective \nwill therefore be only a partial solution at best and\
    \ an ineffective, counterproduc-\ntive solution at worst. For all challenges,\
    \ it is therefore necessary to develop suitable \n42\nbasin management \n2\nresponses\
    \ that make sure all stakeholders’ rationalities are taken into account and \n\
    all stakeholders have something to take home. Such responses where all rationalities\
    \ \nare included and acknowledged by others are called \"clumsy solutions\" (Hartmann,\
    \ \n2011; Thompson, 2008; Verweij et al., 2006).\nThe vegetation layer, discussed\
    \ extensively in relation to the challenge of creating \nflexibility in a controlled\
    \ river system, is – in its current form – an example of a \nsolution based on\
    \ one perspective; it is not (yet) a clumsy solution. It is a typi-\ncal command\
    \ and control type of solution that satisfies water managers’ desired \nhierarchist\
    \ fundamentals, but fails to include nature managers’ desired egalitarian \nfundamentals.\
    \ \nIn order to develop clumsy solutions, the starting point to formulate policy\
    \ \nresponses should not be cost-benefit analysis or probabilistic risk assessment,\
    \ but \nthe understanding of the contending social framings of both the issue\
    \ and the solu-\ntion. (Thompson, 1997; Verweij et al., 2006). New tools – classified\
    \ as the \"other \ntool-kit\" by Thompson (1997) – are therefore needed to enable\
    \ stakeholders to not \nonly express their own perspectives, but also to recognize\
    \ and understand those of \nothers. Ignoring these contending frames may lead\
    \ to conflicts remaining unresolved \n(Mostert et al., 2008). \n2.6.3 \nDeveloping\
    \ a serious gaming environment\nOne category of tools that are able to facilitate\
    \ the interaction and exchange of \nperspectives between stakeholders are learning\
    \ environments. Learning environ-\nments support stakeholders to understand the\
    \ diversity of frames used in deci-\nsion-making process in order to help resolve\
    \ conflicts and formulate collective action \n(Keen et al., 2005; Pahl-Wostl et\
    \ al., 2007a). Ultimately, these environments should \ncontribute to improving\
    \ the efficiency, effectiveness and democratic legitimacy of \ndecision-making\
    \ (Sørensen and Torfing, 2017). A serious gaming environment (SGE) \n– a learning\
    \ environment facilitated through a serious game – is seen as a suitable \nmethod\
    \ for river basin management stakeholders to collaboratively explore chal-\nlenges\
    \ and debate responses under the inherent uncertainties found in river basin \n\
    management (Valkering et al., 2013). In a SGE, players can play a role in river\
    \ basin \nmanagement other than their own in a safe environment – a game – making\
    \ them \nfamiliar with other perspectives. This way, a SGE provides the necessary\
    \ ingredi-\nents for policy-oriented learning as stakeholders have – and are in\
    \ a way forced – to \nconsider other perspectives (Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith,\
    \ 1993) and social learning \nas it facilitates an inclusive, communicative and\
    \ participatory process where stake-\nholders can exchange perspectives (Keen\
    \ et al., 2005; Koppenjan and Klijn, 2004; \nRist et al., 2006).\n43\nUnderstanding\
    \ stakeholder perspectives regarding challenges for integrated river \n2\nThe\
    \ research presented here serves as a preparatory step in the development of \n\
    such a SGE for Dutch river basin management. Specifically, the identified challenges\
    \ \nprovide a scope for the SGE, providing input for gaming scenarios where stakeholders\
    \ \nhave to consider and discuss each other’s perspective towards: (1) the need\
    \ for flexi-\nbility versus control; (2) how to include the maintenance aspect\
    \ of riverine projects \nin plan-making; and (3) decide about the balance between\
    \ dike reinforcement and \nspatial measures towards achieving river basin management\
    \ goals. Furthermore, the \nidentified perspectives and resolution strategies\
    \ inform player roles as well as game \nrules and options. As a next step, a case\
    \ study will be set up in order to co-develop \nthe SGE with relevant stakeholders.\n\
    2.7 \nConclusion\nThe research presented in this paper aimed to identify shared\
    \ challenges that river \nbasin management stakeholders experience towards integrated\
    \ river basin manage-\nment in the Netherlands as well as the stakeholders’ perspectives\
    \ towards these \nchallenges. The objective was to gain a better understanding\
    \ of how issues are \nframed in integrated river basin management differently\
    \ by involved stakeholders. \nCombining Sense-making and Cultural theory proved\
    \ a suitable approach to gain \nthis understanding. A strength of the approach\
    \ is that it enabled an in-depth case \nstudy focused on the \"world\" of the\
    \ respondent rather than the researchers, while \nable to make generalizations.\
    \ The combination could be a useful approach towards \nunderstanding how stakeholders\
    \ frame issues in contested policy areas other than \nriver basin management as\
    \ well. To utilize its full potential however, it is important \nto make sure\
    \ all voices are represented in the study.\nThree challenges were identified in\
    \ the analysis. The first challenge, creating \nflexibility in a controlled river\
    \ system, relates to managing nature restoration areas \nin the floodplains. Water\
    \ managers emphasize the need for controllability of natural \ndynamics in these\
    \ areas, while nature managers point out the need for sustainability \nby allowing\
    \ natural dynamics to run their course. Both acknowledge that nature in \nthe\
    \ floodplains requires regulation to safeguard flood safety. Therefore, the challenge\
    \ \nseems purely rooted in the execution of floodplain management and regulation\
    \ in \nrelation to nature restoration, not in a split point of view on its necessity.\
    \ \nThe second challenge, sustaining the integrated approach in the maintenance\
    \ \nof floodplains, relates to the fact that the introduction of publicly tendering\
    \ of \nfloodplain areas added a market-oriented mechanism that works against includ-\n\
    ing the maintenance aspect in plan-making. As a result, river basin management\
    \ \nstakeholders worry that floodplain areas are not going to develop as intended\
    \ in the \nplan-making.\n44\nbasin management \n2\nThe third challenge, future\
    \ river basin management policies to adapt to climate \nchange, relates to two\
    \ non-specifications in the Delta Program which are causing \ndecisions in its\
    \ plan-making to be postponed: (1) the lack of specification how much \ndike reinforcement\
    \ and spatial measures should each contribute to flood safety \nobjectives; and\
    \ (2) the lack of including spatial quality development as a clear Delta \nProgram\
    \ objective. The challenge relates to taking decisions over postponing them \n\
    – it is of less important what these decisions are – in order for all stakeholders\
    \ to \nknow what they can expect.\nThe results presented show how stakeholders\
    \ use different rationalities in \nconstructing perspectives following the introduction\
    \ of new sources of uncertainty. \nMoreover, the results show how existing policy\
    \ responses towards the challenges are \nbased on only a single perspective and\
    \ insufficiently incorporates other perspectives. \nAs an implication, it is important\
    \ for all stakeholders to consider and include these \nperspectives in integrated\
    \ river basin management decision-making. Current tools \nlike cost-benefit-analysis\
    \ or probabilistic risk assessment ignore this essential aspect \nin the decision-making\
    \ process. Therefore new tools are needed that facilitate stake-\nholders to express\
    \ their own perspectives and help to recognize and understand the \nperspectives\
    \ of others. Learning environments like a serious gaming environment \nare believed\
    \ to have the potential to provide this facilitation. \n45\nUnderstanding stakeholder\

    Serious games are increasingly explored as collaborative tools to enhance social\
    \ \nlearning on sustainable management of land and natural resources. A systematic\
    \ \nliterature review was conducted to examine the current state of the art of\
    \ the differ-\nent methods and procedures used to assess social learning outcomes\
    \ of collaborative \nserious games. 42 publications were identified and included\
    \ in the review following \nstudy selection and quality assessment steps. Extracted\
    \ data from the publications \nwere categorized in relation to five research questions.\
    \ Approaches that were used \nto assess cognitive, normative and relational learning\
    \ outcomes of collaborative seri-\nous games were subsequently identified based\
    \ on the categorizations. As a result, \nthese approaches distinguishes between\
    \ the nature of learning in the assessment of \ncollaborative serious games. Combined,\
    \ these approaches provide an overview of \nhow to assess social learning outcomes\
    \ of collaborative serious games, including the \nmethods and procedures that\
    \ can be used, and may serve as a reference for scholars \ndesigning and evaluating\
    \ collaborative serious games. \n55\nOn evaluating social learning outcomes of\
    \ serious games to collaboratively address \n3\n3.1 \nIntroduction\nEnvironmental\
    \ sustainability problems are typically complex and multi-scale, \nconcern inherent\
    \ uncertainty and affect multiple stakeholders and agencies. Solv-\ning sustainability\
    \ problems concerns the management of land and natural resources \nin a way that\
    \ creates and maintains prosperous social, economic, and ecological \nsystems\
    \ (Folke et al., 2002). To address such problems, decision-making needs to be\
    \ \nadaptive to deal with the uncertainties and needs to include the diversity\
    \ of knowl-\nedge and values of all affected stakeholders. To achieve this, scholars\
    \ have advocated \nactive experimentation and continuous evaluation, summarized\
    \ as learning-by-do-\ning, in natural resources management (Armitage et al., 2007;\
    \ Berkes, 2009; Pahl-\nWostl, 2007; Rodela, 2011). Central to these approaches\
    \ is collaboration between and \nlearning among researchers, resource managers\
    \ and resource users in order to find \nsustainable solutions (Crona and Parker,\
    \ 2012; Folke et al., 2002; Folke et al., 2005; \nOlsson et al., 2004).\nLearning,\
    \ in particular social learning, is therefore seen as a prominent driver \nand\
    \ normative goal in natural resources management (Armitage, 2005; Armitage et\
    \ \nal., 2008; Berkes, 2009; Pahl-Wostl, 2006; Reed et al., 2010). Although there\
    \ is debate \nto find a commonly shared definition for social learning (see e.g.\
    \ Cundill and Rodela, \n2012; Muro and Jeffrey, 2008; Reed et al., 2010; Rodela,\
    \ 2011), scholars increasingly \nagree that social learning has occurred when\
    \ a change in understanding – related \nto for example the system, problem at\
    \ hand, agreement and collective action – is \nachieved through interaction in\
    \ collaborative and participatory settings (Baird et \nal., 2014; Keen et al.,\
    \ 2005; Muro and Jeffrey, 2008; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007a; Reed \net al., 2010).\
    \ Social learning outcomes therefore require deliberative interactions, \nwhere\
    \ multiple stakeholders work together and build relationships, which should \n\
    ultimately lead to collective action (Cundill and Rodela, 2012; Keen et al., 2005;\
    \ Pahl-\nWostl et al., 2008). Baird et al. (2014) define three types of learning\
    \ outcomes in rela-\ntion to social learning: cognitive – the acquisition of new\
    \ or restructuring of existing \nknowledge – normative – a shift in viewpoints,\
    \ values or paradigms – and relational \n– an improved understanding of others’\
    \ mind-sets and enhanced trust and ability \nto cooperate between stakeholders.\n\
    Serious games are increasingly explored as a method to establish social learning\
    \ \non sustainable natural resources management and urban planning (Ampatzidou\
    \ et \nal., 2018; Furber et al., 2018; Marini et al., 2018; Medema et al., 2016).\
    \ Serious games \nare generally referenced to as games that have a primary purpose\
    \ other than enter-\ntainment, such as educating, training or informing players\
    \ (Abt, 1970; Michael and \nChen, 2005; Susi et al., 2007). More specifically\
    \ towards policy-making, Mayer (2009, \np. 825) defines games as \"experi(m)ent(i)al,\
    \ rule-based, interactive environments, \n56\nsustainability problems: A literature\
    \ review \n3\nwhere players learn by taking actions and by experiencing their\
    \ effects through feed-\nback mechanisms that are deliberately built into and\
    \ around the game\". A recognized \nstrength of such serious games is that games\
    \ can include both the techno-phys-\nical complexity – the underlying physical\
    \ elements of the system and its uncer-\ntainties – and the socio-political complexity\
    \ – the strategic interactions between \nstakeholders in the policy arena – by\
    \ combining role-play with in-game feedback \nmechanisms (Bekebrede, 2010; Marini\
    \ et al., 2018; Mayer, 2009; Medema et al., 2016). \nTherefore, serious games\
    \ fit well with the learning-by-doing approach in natural \nresources management;\
    \ serious games offer stakeholders a place to negotiate, delib-\nerate, exchange\
    \ perspectives used in decision-making and learn about the trade-offs \nbetween\
    \ decisions in the safe experimentation environment of a game (Bekebrede, \n2010;\
    \ Mayer, 2009). Moreover, multiplayer and multi-role serious games thereby \n\
    offer the collaborative and participatory stakeholder interactions that are needed\
    \ to \nestablish social learning (Ampatzidou et al., 2018; Medema et al., 2016).\
    \ The term \ncollaborative serious games is used in the remainder of the paper\
    \ to refer to serious \ngames that follow the above definition by Mayer (2009),\
    \ but are particularly focused \nto collaboratively – through mutual engagement\
    \ of stakeholders in a coordinated \neffort to solve the problem (Roschelle and\
    \ Teasley, 1995, p. 70) – explore sustainable \nmanagement strategies. \nThe assumption\
    \ is that any learning that occurs from playing collaborative seri-\nous games\
    \ is transferable to the world outside the game (Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer, \n\
    2009). A collaborative serious game can therefore be seen as an intervention,\
    \ or a \ntransitional object (Geurts et al., 2007), that may lead to social learning\
    \ outcomes. \nWhile calls exist for more systematic assessment of learning through\
    \ serious games \n(see i.e. Mayer et al., 2014), assessing social learning outcomes\
    \ of collaborative seri-\nous games is challenging. On a practical level, gathering\
    \ data occurs in a collab-\norative setting that introduces many confounding variables\
    \ such as players’ prior \nrelations, players’ attitudes towards serious gaming\
    \ and facilitators who have to make \ndecisions on the spot while guiding sessions\
    \ (de Caluwé et al., 2012; Hofstede et al., \n2010; Mayer et al., 2014). On a\
    \ higher level, the lack of consensus on the definition \nof social learning itself\
    \ has made it difficult to assess (Crona and Parker, 2012) and \nindeed few studies\
    \ empirically and directly assess the learning effects of interven-\ntions (Armitage\
    \ et al., 2008; Baird et al., 2014; Rodela, 2011).\nThe research presented in\
    \ this paper adds to this gap by answering the main \nresearch question: What\
    \ is the current state of the art of the different methods and \nprocedures used\
    \ to assess social learning outcomes of collaborative serious games? To \nthis\
    \ end, a systematic literature review was conducted to survey the empirical assess-\n\
    ment of social learning through collaborative serious games. As such, the contribu-\n\
    57\nOn evaluating social learning outcomes of serious games to collaboratively\
    \ address \n3\ntions of this paper include: (1) Summarizing and categorizing different\
    \ evaluation \nprocedures applied and methods used to assess social learning outcomes\
    \ of collab-\norative serious games; and (2) presenting a state of the art overview\
    \ of approaches \nto assess social learning outcomes of collaborative serious\
    \ games.\nThe next section presents the method of the systematic review and describes\
    \ \nall the steps taken in detail. Sections three and four cover the search and\
    \ categori-\nzation results of the review respectively. Section five discusses\
    \ approaches used to \nassess cognitive, normative and relational learning outcomes\
    \ of collaborative seri-\nous games. Section six finally sums up the conclusions\
    \ drawn from the review and \nprovides an overview of the identified assessment\
    \ approaches.\n3.2 \nMaterials and methods\nTo perform the literature review,\
    \ the guidelines by Kitchenham and Charters (2007) \n– an updated version of Kitchenham\
    \ (2004) – were used. These guidelines are an \nestablished procedure for conducting\
    \ systematic reviews, particularly in software \nengineering. Although collaborative\
    \ serious games are not exclusively digital – a \nboard game can also be used\
    \ to explore sustainable management solutions – the use \nof these guidelines\
    \ is appropriate as many serious games do make use of software \nand the guidelines\
    \ are based on guidelines used in other disciplines. \nKitchenham and Charters\
    \ (2007) prescribe three phases of a systematic review: \nplanning, conducting\
    \ and reporting. The planning phase covers confirming the need \nfor a review,\
    \ defining the research questions and producing a review protocol. The \nconducting\
    \ phase involves developing a search strategy, executing as well as docu-\nmenting\
    \ the search, performing a study selection and extracting data relevant to the\
    \ \nresearch questions. The reporting phase then covers reporting and disseminating\
    \ the \nresults of the study. In the next subsections, all the steps taken in\
    \ performing the \nsystematic literature review are described. \n3.2.1 \nRelated\
    \ work\nAs a starting point in the study, a search was executed to confirm the\
    \ need for a \nreview. One literature review, by Calderón and Ruiz (2015), on\
    \ the different methods \nand procedures used to evaluate serious games was identified\
    \ in this step. Notably, \nthe serious games included in this review are mostly\
    \ evaluated using a questionnaire \nas the main assessment method and are mostly\
    \ evaluated on the educational effec-\ntiveness – defined by Calderón and Ruiz\
    \ (2015) as the learning outcomes, usability \nand user’s experience. The study\
    \ is similar in terms of its scope and research ques-\ntions covered, but lacks\
    \ the focus on social learning and the policy setting. The study \n58\nsustainability\
    \ problems: A literature review \n3\nwas therefore used as a reference for the\
    \ overall search strategy, such as to sharpen \nthe research questions and to\
    \ formulate inclusion and exclusion criteria. Other \nreviews, both literature\
    \ and meta reviews, focused on the effectiveness of serious \ngames (Backlund\
    \ and Hendrix, 2013; Boyle et al., 2016; Connolly et al., 2012; Girard \net al.,\
    \ 2013; Wouters et al., 2009), not on the assessment procedures. \nIn addition\
    \ to these studies, five review papers were identified which focus \non serious\
    \ games in relation to sustainable development (Katsaliaki and Mustafee, \n2012),\
    \ climate change (Flood et al., 2018; Reckien and Eisenack, 2013; Wu and Lee,\
    \ \n2015) and sustainable water resources management (Aubert et al., 2018). While\
    \ these \ndo not review the assessment approaches of learning outcomes, the serious\
    \ games \nreviewed in these papers do all relate to sustainability and may therefore\
    \ be of inter-\nest to this review. These studies were therefore used to inform\
    \ the search strategy, \nfor example to define keywords, and as snowball resources.\n\
    Concluding, no review was found that focuses specifically on evaluating collab-\n\
    orative serious games and this study therefore adds an in-depth review with this\
    \ \nexplicit focus to the literature. \n3.2.2 \nResearch questions\nTo examine\
    \ the current state of the art of the different methods and procedures \nused\
    \ to assess social learning outcomes of collaborative serious games, the following\
    \ \nresearch questions were addressed to analyze publications:\nRQ1. \nHow is\
    \ learning through collaborative serious games conceptualized?\nRQ2. \nWhen is\
    \ data collected in the evaluation of learning through collaborative \nserious\
    \ games?\nRQ3. \nWhat methods are used in the evaluation of learning through collaborative\
    \ \nserious games?\nRQ4. \nDo evaluations of learning through collaborative serious\
    \ games use quan-\ntitative, qualitative or a combination between quantitative\
    \ and qualitative \ndata?\nRQ5. \nWhat are the learning effects of collaborative\
    \ serious games according to \ntheir evaluations in relation to social learning?\
    \ \nLearning is used over social learning in these questions to not exclude publications\
    \ \nthat use a different learning conceptualization but do fall within the scope\
    \ of this \nreview. For all research questions, data was extracted from the publications\
    \ and \nsubsequently categorized, which is further explained in the data extraction\
    \ and data \nanalysis subsections (3.2.7 and 3.2.8). \n59\nOn evaluating social\
    \ learning outcomes of serious games to collaboratively address \n3\n3.2.3 \n\
    Search strategy\nThe search strategy defines the systematic approach to identify\
    \ publications to \ninclude in the literature review. Two categories of keywords\
    \ were used to create \nsearch combinations. The first category (A) covered three\
    \ keywords to identify publi-\ncations that covered a game-based approach: serious\
    \ gam* (A1), simulation gam* \n(A2) and policy gam* (A3). The asterisk was used\
    \ in each keyword to cover for both \ngame and gaming. Simulation and policy gaming\
    \ were added to the search terms as \nInclusion criteria\n• \nPublications that\
    \ describe a collaborative serious game on sustainable management \nof land or\
    \ natural resources, or otherwise related to a complex sustainability issues \n\
    (e.g. climate change)\n• \nPublications that describe the assessment of learning\
    \ outcomes of a collaborative \nserious game\n• \nPublications that describe the\
    \ procedure and methods applied to assess learning \noutcomes of a collaborative\
    \ serious game\nExclusion criteria\n• \nPublications that describe a serious game,\
    \ but which do not cover a collaborative \nserious game (e.g. a single-player\
    \ serious game)\n• \nPublications that describe a collaborative serious game,\
    \ but the game is not in any \nway related to sustainability\n• \nPublications\
    \ that describe a collaborative serious game, but which do not assess its \nlearning\
    \ outcomes\n• \nPublications that describe the evaluation of the learning outcomes\
    \ from a collabora-\ntive serious game, but offer no information on how this assessment\
    \ was performed\n• \nPublications that describe the assessment of a larger learning\
    \ process of which a \ncollaborative serious game is a component that cannot be\
    \ seen as separated from \nthe larger process and its evaluation\n• \nPublications\
    \ that describe a formative evaluation that only focuses on improving \nthe design\
    \ of a collaborative serious game and do not assess learning outcomes in \nany\
    \ way\n• \nPublications that describe a serious game designed only for use in\
    \ an educational \nsetting \n• \nPublications that are not written in English\n\
    • \nPublications that are only available as abstract 1\n1 Abstracts were still\
    \ reviewed, if the abstract seemed applicable, an attempt was made to obtain \n\
    the entire publication, exclusion occurred if this was not possible.\nTable 3.1\
    \ Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n60\nsustainability problems: A literature\
    \ review \n3\npilot searches showed this term, unlike alternatives such as applied\
    \ gaming, returned \nsearch results that were relevant to the scope.\nThe second\
    \ category (B) covered 18 keywords to identify publications in rela-\ntion to\
    \ sustainability and disciplines dealing with sustainability issues: sustainabil-\n\
    ity (B1), sustainable use (B2), sustainable development (B3), climate change (B4),\
    \ \nclimate adaptation (B5), environmental change (B6), energy transition (B7),\
    \ adaptive \n*management (B8), collaborative management (B9), natural resource\
    \ management \n(B10), environmental management (B11), spatial planning (B12),\
    \ urban planning \n(B13), urban development (B14), water management (B15), water\
    \ resources (B16), \nriver management (B17) and river basin (B18). These keywords\
    \ were selected based \non the five identified review papers on games and sustainability\
    \ (Aubert et al., 2018; \nFlood et al., 2018; Katsaliaki and Mustafee, 2012; Reckien\
    \ and Eisenack, 2013; Wu \nand Lee, 2015), pilot searches and publications covering\
    \ collaborative serious games \nalready known to the authors. The asterisk in\
    \ adaptive *management was added to \nalso cover for both comanagement and co-management.\n\
    The keywords were subsequently used in search strings to search for all possible\
    \ \ncombinations between one keyword from category A and one keyword from category\
    \ \nB. Using Boolean statements, the search strings therefore covered \"(A1 OR\
    \ A2 OR \nA3) AND (B1 OR B2 … OR B18).\" \nSearches were limited to publications\
    \ published since 2007 to review the state \nof the art. 2007 was chosen in order\
    \ to cover the last ten years and as pilot searches \nfound few publications providing\
    \ sufficient information for the scope of the review \nbefore 2007 – consistent\
    \ with the results of Calderón and Ruiz (2015).\nSix databases were similarly\
    \ determined through pilot searches for conducting \nthe review: ACM Digital Library,\
    \ IEEE Xplore Digital Library, ISI Web of Science, \nScienceDirect, Scopus and\
    \ SpringerLink. Searches were executed on title, abstract \nand keywords.\n3.2.4\
    \ \nStudy selection\nTo narrow down the publications obtained following the search\
    \ strategy, an initial \nselection and a final selection step were performed following\
    \ inclusion and exclu-\nsion criteria (Table 3.1). In the initial selection, each\
    \ study was reviewed based on its \ntitle, abstract and keywords. This way, publications\
    \ clearly not covering the scope \nof the literature review – i.e. a publication\
    \ describing the economy and markets as \na serious game – were excluded. In the\
    \ final selection, the publications included in \nthe initial selection were reviewed\
    \ more rigorously according to the same criteria by \nscanning through each study\
    \ and readings its conclusion. The entire study was read \nif necessary to determine\
    \ inclusion or exclusion.\n61\nOn evaluating social learning outcomes of serious\
    \ games to collaboratively address \n3\n3.2.5 \nStudy quality assessment\nFollowing\
    \ the study selection steps, the selected publications were looked at in more\
    \ \ndetail in relation to the research questions in a quality assessment step.\
    \ Specifically, \nquestions that can be answered with yes or no were formulated\
    \ in relation to the \nresearch questions: \n1. \nDoes the publication provide\
    \ a conceptualization of learning? (RQ1)\n2. \nDoes the publication state when\
    \ data is collected in the evaluation of the \ncollaborative serious game? (RQ2)\n\
    3. \nDoes the publication discuss a method, technique or theory used to evaluate\
    \ \nthe collaborative serious game? (RQ3)\n4. \nDoes the publication discuss whether\
    \ the evaluation used a quantitative or \nqualitative approach, or both in the\
    \ evaluation of the collaborative serious \ngame? (RQ4)\n5. \nDoes the publication\
    \ describe learning outcomes of the collaborative serious \ngame following evaluation?\
    \ (RQ5)\nThe publications included in the study selection step were assessed on\
    \ each of these \nquestions as yes or no, corresponding to a 1 or 0 score. If\
    \ a publication included all \nrelevant aspects in regard to the scope of the\
    \ review, it would therefore score five \nout of five. Publications that scored\
    \ four or higher were deemed of sufficient qual-\nity and included in the review.\
    \ Publications that scored exactly three, and were thus \nType\nDefinition/indicators\

    \ problems: A literature review \n3\nexcluded, were checked again after completing\
    \ the quality assessment to confirm \nexclusion was the correct decision.\n3.2.6\
    \ \nSnowballing\nTo cover for relevant publications missed in the database searches,\
    \ a snowballing \napproach was used to identify further relevant publications\
    \ (Wohlin, 2014). Firstly, \nbackward snowballing was applied by identifying possible\
    \ relevant publications \nfrom the reference lists of publications passing the\
    \ quality assessment step. Secondly, \nforward snowballing was applied by checking\
    \ all publications citing the publications \ndeemed of sufficient quality using\
    \ Google Scholar. Thirdly, the five review papers on \nsustainable development,\
    \ climate change and sustainable water resources manage-\nment (Aubert et al.,\
    \ 2018; Flood et al., 2018; Katsaliaki and Mustafee, 2012; Reck-\nien and Eisenack,\
    \ 2013; Wu and Lee, 2015) identified earlier were used to snowball \nfrom as serious\
    \ games covered in these reviews may be of interest to the scope of \nthis review.\
    \ All papers identified through snowballing were subsequently reviewed \nfollowing\
    \ the same study selection and quality assessment steps.\n3.2.7 \nData extraction\n\
    In the data extraction step, all the publications included in the study selection\
    \ and \ndeemed of sufficient quality were read in its entirety. Data was extracted\
    \ from the \npublications in regard to the research questions. All extracted data,\
    \ for all publi-\ncations, were stored in a spreadsheet. At this point, if publications\
    \ were identified \ncovering the same collaborative serious game without providing\
    \ additional insight \ninto its evaluation – i.e. a conference paper covering\
    \ a limited evaluation and a jour-\nnal paper covering a more extensive evaluation\
    \ by the same authors – the publication \nwith the lower quality assessment was\
    \ excluded from the review.\n3.2.8 \nData analysis and categorization\nAll data\
    \ was subsequently categorized in regard to each research question. An induc-\n\
    tive approach was used to create categories based on the data retrieved by identi-\n\
    fying common themes, for example applied methods as surveyed in RQ3. On the \n\
    first research question, for example, in regard to the conceptualization of learning,\
    \ \ncategories included social learning and experiential learning. For RQ5, the\
    \ typol-\nogy on social learning by Baird et al. (2014) (see Table 3.2) was used\
    \ as a framework \nto define categories that differentiate between the three types\
    \ of learning. From an \nassessment perspective, the typology is beneficial as\
    \ it views learning outcomes from \ntheir nature – cognitive, normative or relational\
    \ – rather than their perceived value. \nMoreover, the typology separates relational\
    \ learning as an explicit learning outcome, \n63\nOn evaluating social learning\

    \ outcomes of collaborative serious games. \n3.3 \nSearch results\nThe entire\
    \ review, from developing the scope and performing the search, selection, \ndata\
    \ analysis and synthesis, was executed between October 2017 and November 2018.\
    \ \nInitial database searches were executed on or a few days before the 7th of\
    \ January, \n2018, and all publications extracted through these searches were\
    \ analyzed. After \nprocessing all retrieved publications, all database searches\
    \ were updated on the 7th \nof November, 2018. Figure 3.1 provides an overview\
    \ of the number of publications \nfound and subsequently included after each step.\n\
    As Figure 3.1 shows, 78 publications retrieved through the database searches \n\

    \ 41 \npublications were included following quality assessment. 66 additional\
    \ publica-\ntions were identified through snowballing, 45 publications from the\
    \ publications \nidentified through database searches and 21 from the five review\
    \ papers (Aubert et \nal., 2018; Flood et al., 2018; Katsaliaki and Mustafee,\
    \ 2012; Reckien and Eisenack, \n2013; Wu and Lee, 2015). 6 of these 66 publications\
    \ passed the same selection steps \nand quality assessment. Five publications\
    \ were subsequently removed from the total \npublications as these covered the\
    \ same collaborative serious game without provid-\ning additional insight into\
    \ its evaluation. 42 publications were therefore included \nin the review.\nFigure\
    \ 3.2a shows an overview of how many publications included in the review \nwere\
    \ retrieved through each database as well as through snowballing. Some publi-\n\
    cations appeared in multiple databases and are added to these databases in the\
    \ \nfigure, explaining why the numbers added up are higher than 42. Scopus, as\
    \ can be \nexpected, provided the most publications included in the review. No\
    \ publications \nretrieved from the IEEE database passed the selection criteria\
    \ and quality assess-\nment steps.\nFigure 3.2b shows an overview of the publications\
    \ included in the review in \nregard to their year of publication. The figure\
    \ suggests an increasing trend in the use \nof collaborative serious games to\
    \ explore sustainable management strategies. It must \nbe noted that 2018 has\
    \ the highest publications included in the review (10 publica-\ntions), even though\

    \ A literature review \n3\nForty-two publications were included in the review.\
    \ In relation to the first \nresearch question, social learning and experiential\
    \ learning were the only conceptu-\nalizations of learning used by more than two\
    \ publications. While some publications \nprovided learning conceptualization\
    \ related to social learning – i.e. collective learn-\ning (Barnaud et al., 2007;\
    \ Souchère et al., 2010) and boundary crossing (Jean et al., \n2018) – other publications\
    \ provide conceptualizations that do not explicitly include \nthe relational learning\
    \ component of social learning. This is reflected in the review \nas the latter\
    \ publications, as well as the publications that do not provide an identi-\nfiable\
    \ conceptualization of learning, mostly report on cognitive learning outcomes.\
    \ \nThe next subsections discuss the assessments of cognitive, relational and\
    \ normative \nlearning outcomes of collaborative serious games in detail.\n3.5.1\
    \ \nCognitive learning\nCognitive learning relates to the acquisition of new or\
    \ the restructuring of existing \nknowledge. Almost all of the publications in\
    \ the review – 37 out of 42 – report on \ncognitive learning outcomes of collaborative\
    \ serious games. Two categories were \nlinked to cognitive learning, increased\
    \ system understanding and raised awareness, \nalthough both can relate to acquiring\
    \ new knowledge and restructuring existing \nknowledge. Three common approaches\
    \ were identified in the assessment: (1) self-re-\nflective questions after game\
    \ sessions; (2) pre-post measurements of self-reported \nknowledge on issues;\
    \ and (3) observed acquisition or restructuring of knowledge. \nFirstly, 21 publications\
    \ asked participants self-reflective questions in questionnaires, \ninterviews\
    \ or debriefings after game sessions, sometimes in combination with other \nmethods\
    \ (Barnaud et al., 2007; Becu et al., 2017; Bekebrede et al., 2018; Carson et\
    \ al., \n2018; Cleland et al., 2012; Dionnet et al., 2008; Ducrot et al., 2015;\
    \ Duffhues et al., \n2014; Ferrero et al., 2018; Haug et al., 2011; Hill et al.,\
    \ 2014; Lawrence and Haasnoot, \n2017; Martin, 2015; Mayer et al., 2013; Onencan\
    \ et al., 2016; Page et al., 2016; Rumore \net al., 2016; Souchère et al., 2010;\
    \ Valkering et al., 2013; van Pelt et al., 2015; Zhou \net al., 2013). For example,\
    \ Dionnet et al. (2008) assessed their TADLA approach, \nwhich aims to facilitate\
    \ farmers in the collective modernization of their irrigation \nsystem, by combining\
    \ a questionnaire after game sessions with follow-up interviews. \nThey showed\
    \ that their approach helped farmers to acquire a more comprehensive \nunderstanding\
    \ of how the different system components work together. Becu et al. \n(2017) asked\
    \ self-reflective questions on what local policymakers learned during their \n\
    structured, round-table debriefing of LottoSim, a game to support social learning\
    \ \non coastal risk prevention measures. According to their evaluation, the participants\
    \ \nespecially learned about the dynamics of water expansion in flooding events\
    \ as a \nresult of the game’s integrated simulations. Moreover, the game helped\
    \ participants \n77\nOn evaluating social learning outcomes of serious games to\
    \ collaboratively address \n3\nto discuss long-term strategies, although participants\
    \ did not pursue other preven-\ntion measures than those already applied in practice.\
    \ Keijser et al. (2018) in turn \nassessed the ability of the Marine Spatial Planning\
    \ Challenge to communicate the \ndynamic and complex interactions between shipping\
    \ and spatial planning in the \nmaritime environment. Questionnaires after game\
    \ sessions were applied to assess \nself-reported learning through closed questions\
    \ and a five-point Likert scale. Their \nresults show that the game worked well\
    \ as an introduction to marine spatial plan-\nning where participants gain a grasp\
    \ of its complexities, particularly for those with \nlimited knowledge on the\
    \ topic.\nSecondly, 12 publications analyzed self-reported learning through pre-post\
    \ \nmeasurements of participants’ knowledge on the issues addressed in the game\
    \ \n(Carson et al., 2018; Douven et al., 2014; Ducrot et al., 2015; Eisenack,\
    \ 2013; Haug et \nal., 2011; Keijser et al., 2018; Meya and Eisenack, 2018; Onencan\
    \ and van de Walle, \n2018; Rumore et al., 2016; Salvini et al., 2016; Sterman\
    \ et al., 2015; van Pelt et al., 2015). \nQuestionnaires were the common method\
    \ for this approach, complemented with \nother methods, although Salvini et al.\
    \ (2016) and Haug et al. (2011) instead used \ninterviews and concept maps respectively.\
    \ Salvini et al. (2016) assessed the effects \non social learning of their game,\
    \ that aims to induce Brazilian farmers to explore \nagroforestry practices, by\
    \ conducting interviews with participants. The interviews \ncovered the same questions\
    \ before and after game sessions and included questions \non the farmers’ practices,\
    \ knowledge of different systems and opinions on forming \ncooperatives. The farmers\
    \ learned about the technical aspects of agroforestry, such \nas the amount of\
    \ investments needed for new infrastructure, and its benefits, such as \nincreased\
    \ productivity, product quality and profitability. Haug et al. (2011) assessed\
    \ \nsocial learning outcomes through a policy game on EU climate change policy\
    \ and \nthe member states’ sharing arrangements. Participants were asked to draw\
    \ concept \nmaps (Ruiz-Primo and Shavelson, 1996) before and after game sessions.\
    \ The analysis \nof the concept maps was complemented with self-reflective questions\
    \ asked in ques-\ntionnaires and interviews after game sessions. Their results\
    \ showed there were some \ncognitive learning outcomes as certain issues became\
    \ more central and specific in the \npost session concept maps – in indication\
    \ of restructuring of knowledge.\nPre-post measurements of cognitive learning\
    \ outcomes through questionnaires \nwere based on qualitative assessment of open\
    \ questions or quantitative assessment \nof closed questions using Likert scales\
    \ or a combination of the two. For example, \nDouven et al. (2014) assessed the\
    \ impact on both raising awareness and upgrad-\ning knowledge of playing the Shariva\
    \ game, which aims to stimulate collaboration \namong water and related professionals\
    \ and to resolve transboundary river basin \nissues. They used questionnaires\
    \ with both open and closed questions before and \n78\nsustainability problems:\
    \ A literature review \n3\nafter game sessions in this assessment. Their results\
    \ show that participants acquired \nknowledge on addressing and resolving transboundary\
    \ river basin issues. Onen-\ncan and van de Walle (2018) assessed whether or not\
    \ participants gained increased \nsituational awareness – the perception of system\
    \ elements, comprehension of \ntheir meaning and projection of their near future\
    \ status – from playing WeShareIt \nNzoia. To this end, they applied questionnaires\
    \ based on SART (Taylor, 1990), using \n10-dimensional subjective ratings, before\
    \ and after game sessions in combination \nwith in-game performance measures to\
    \ measure the game’s effects. Their results \nshowed an increase in participants’\
    \ situational awareness, on all dependent varia-\nbles, between the pre-test and\
    \ post-test of local policymakers. \nThirdly, 10 publications assessed cognitive\
    \ learning outcomes without asking \nparticipants, but rather assessed observed\
    \ acquisition or restructuring of knowledge \nby analyzing observations and data\
    \ resulting from game sessions (Antle et al., 2011; \nAyadi et al., 2014; Hertzog\
    \ et al., 2014; Magnuszewski et al., 2018; Meinzen-Dick et \nal., 2018; Moser\
    \ and Mußhoff, 2016; Sausse et al., 2013; Stefanska et al., 2011; Tanwat-\ntana\
    \ and Toyoda, 2018; Villamor and Badmos, 2016). To assess whether or not partic-\n\
    ipants improved their understanding of the complexity of planning for a sustainable\
    \ \nfuture through their game Futura, Antle et al. (2011) analyzed field notes\
    \ on partici-\npant behaviour and quotes by identifying themes through coding.\
    \ Their results show \nthat participants did not necessarily acquire new knowledge\
    \ from playing the game, \nbut do obtain a better sense of the sheer complexity\
    \ of sustainable development. \nSausse et al. (2013) developed a game for local\
    \ stakeholders to explore management \nof both genetically modified and conventional\
    \ crops in an area. To analyze how \nfarmers manage the coexistence of both crop\
    \ types, they analyzed data collected \nfrom gameplay, such as the simulation\
    \ results, player actions and maps drawn by \nthe participants, complemented with\
    \ observations from notes and audio recordings, \nto understand why players made\
    \ certain decisions and why certain events occurred. \nThey showed that farmers\
    \ learned about how to technically implement management \nmeasures and to better\
    \ assess the risk of coexistence of both genetically modified \nand conventional\
    \ crops in fields next to each other.\n3.5.2 \nNormative learning\nNormative learning\
    \ relates to a shift in viewpoints, values or paradigms. Assessing \nchanges in\
    \ viewpoints and values is particularly challenging as these are difficult to\
    \ \nmeasure and require reflection – and thus time – to occur. How normative learning\
    \ \nhas been assessed in collaborative serious games is therefore of particular\
    \ inter-\nest. Five publications reported on normative learning outcomes (Ducrot\
    \ et al., 2015; \nLawrence and Haasnoot, 2017; Meya and Eisenack, 2018; Sterman\
    \ et al., 2015; van \n79\nOn evaluating social learning outcomes of serious games\
    \ to collaboratively address \n3\nder Wal et al., 2016). In addition, Haug et\
    \ al. (2011) did assess normative learning, \nbut did not find evidence of it\
    \ taking place. Their assessment was based on pre-post \nmeasurements,  participants\
    \ rating the extent they agreed or disagreed on propo-\nsitions before and after\
    \ game sessions, in combination with participant interviews \nafter game sessions.\n\
    Three of the five publications that do report on normative learning outcomes \n\
    assess individual changes in views and values and use one of the two measurements\
    \ \neither through pre-post measurements or self-reflective questions after gameplay.\
    \ In \nthe evaluation of Ter’Aguas, a game used to simulate negotiations related\
    \ to land-use \nplanning in a Brazilian municipality, Ducrot et al. (2015) applied\
    \ a short-term and \nlong-term learning assessment. In the long-term assessment,\
    \ through interviews \nconducted eight months after the game sessions, they found\
    \ that participants had \nchanged their opinion on their role and position in\
    \ relation to water management \nissues. For example, a participant noted that\
    \ (s)he no longer threw away oil after \nbecoming aware of a water quality issue\
    \ through playing the game. \nTwo publications applied pre-post measurements that\
    \ asked participants to \nindicate to what extent they agreed with propositions,\
    \ an approach similar to Haug \net al. (2011). Meya and Eisenack (2018) assessed\
    \ how playing the board game KEEP \nCOOL, which aims to enhance public understanding\
    \ of climate change science \nand to raise awareness among public, scientific\
    \ and environmental organizations, \nchanges participants’ beliefs on international\
    \ climate politics. To this end, they asked \nparticipants to rate their opinions\
    \ on for example personal responsibility towards \nclimate change mitigation and\
    \ the confidence in politics to act against climate \nchange on a five-point Likert\
    \ scale in questionnaires before and after game sessions. \nTheir results showed\
    \ that participants perceive increased responsibility and become \nmore confident\
    \ in the potential of politics to act. Similarly, Sterman et al. (2015) \nused\
    \ pre-post measurements of closed question questionnaires to assess changes in\
    \ \nattitudes towards climate change from playing the game WORLD CLIMATE, which\
    \ \naims to help participants understand the dynamics and geopolitical implications\
    \ of \nclimate change. Their results showed that participants become more worried\
    \ about \nclimate change, believe it to be more personally important and are more\
    \ likely to \nurge for immediate action.\nThe other two publications that reported\
    \ normative learning outcomes \ncover different versions of the Sustainable Delta\
    \ Game, which aims to help partic-\nipants learn about preparing water management\
    \ strategies for an uncertain future. \nLawrence and Haasnoot (2017) applied an\
    \ adapted version of the game in a regional \nwater management project in New\
    \ Zealand to test how dynamic pathways, pro-ac-\ntive planning to adapt to uncertain\
    \ future developments, can be adopted in deci-\n80\nsustainability problems: A\
    \ literature review \n3\nsion-making. Based on observations during game sessions\
    \ complemented with \nanalyses of the debriefings and interviews with participants\
    \ after game sessions, \nthey concluded that the game led to group convergence\
    \ on the necessities to make \ndecisions in uncertain conditions. Van der Wal\
    \ et al. (2016) in turn explicitly assess \nsuch group convergence by measuring\
    \ changes in group perspectives. They applied \nperspective mapping, a method\
    \ rooted in Cultural Theory to classify, interpret and \nanalyze different individual\
    \ perspectives (Offermans et al., 2011). Specifically, partic-\nipants were asked\
    \ to select statements they agreed with in relation to a topic during \neach phase\
    \ of the game. The method is therefore quite similar to the agreement or \ndisagreement\
    \ ratings applied by Haug et al. (2011), Meya and Eisenack (2018) and \nSterman\
    \ et al. (2015). Group convergence was subsequently assessed by comparing \nthe\
    \ agreement on statements between participants. The analysis was complemented\
    \ \nwith analyzing recordings of game sessions to understand why perspectives\
    \ changed \nand participant interviews after the game to validate that participants\
    \ found the \ngame and its underlying model credible. Their results show that\
    \ individual perspec-\ntives changed during gameplay, leading to group convergence\
    \ in most game sessions.\n3.5.3 \nRelational learning\nRelational learning relates\
    \ to obtaining an improved understanding of others’ mind-\nsets, enhanced trust\
    \ and ability to cooperate. Around half of the publications – 17 \nout of 42 –\
    \ report on relational learning outcomes. Two categories were identified in \n\
    regard to relational learning outcomes: Understanding other roles and perspectives\
    \ \nand building relationships and trust. The first category, reported by 13 publications,\
    \ \nrelates to participants acquiring an increased understanding on other participants’\
    \ \nroles, mind-sets and points of view (Barnaud et al., 2007; Becu et al., 2015;\
    \ Carson et \nal., 2018; Douven et al., 2014; Ducrot et al., 2015; Ferrero et\
    \ al., 2018; Haug et al., 2011; \nJean et al., 2018; Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017;\
    \ Mayer et al., 2013; Rumore et al., 2016; \nSouchère et al., 2010; Villamor and\
    \ Badmos, 2016). The second category, reported by \nseven publications, instead\
    \ relates to enhancing participants’ ability to collaborate \nby building relationships\
    \ and enhancing trust (Bekebrede et al., 2018; Carson et al., \n2018; Jean et\
    \ al., 2018; Martin, 2015; Salvini et al., 2016; Souchère et al., 2010; Speel-\n\
    man et al., 2014). Both learning outcomes were assessed mostly qualitatively,\
    \ based \non self-reflective questions in questionnaires, interviews and debriefings\
    \ conducted \nafter game sessions or well after game sessions (post-post). However,\
    \ building rela-\ntionships and trust was reported more often when collaborative\
    \ serious games were \nused in a community or an existing project; when participants\
    \ address a shared prob-\nlem that directly impacts them. \n81\nOn evaluating\
    \ social learning outcomes of serious games to collaboratively address \n3\nFor\
    \ example, in the same long-term assessment as described in the previ-\nous section,\
    \ Ducrot et al. (2015) participants indicated in the interviews that they \nlearned\
    \ about the relationships between issues and stakeholders, and obtained a \nbetter\
    \ understanding of other stakeholders’ positions. Similarly, Rumore et al. (2016)\
    \ \ninterviewed participants four to six weeks after game sessions in the assessment\
    \ of a \ntailored role-playing game to enhance engagement in the NECAP project,\
    \ a project \nthat aims to increase the climate change adaptation readiness of\
    \ coastal communi-\nties in New England. In the interviews, participants showed\
    \ increased empathy and \nappreciation for other perspectives as a result of playing\
    \ the game. In particular, \nparticipants noted these learning outcomes as they\
    \ took on another role, engaging \nthe issue from another perspective, and engaged\
    \ openly with other stakeholders’ \npoint of views. Different from these examples,\
    \ Carson et al. (2018) used question-\nnaires both directly after game sessions\
    \ and three months later to assess the effect \nof the Multi Hazard Tournament\
    \ on decision-making, social learning, and relation-\nship building in watershed\
    \ management. The post-game questionnaire showed that \nlearning about other stakeholders’\
    \ perspectives was the main learning outcome. \nMoreover, participants indicated\
    \ in the follow-up questionnaire that game sessions \nhad led to them pursuing\
    \ potential projects with other participants. \nException to this approach is\
    \ Jean et al. (2018), who combined self-reflective \nquestions with interaction\
    \ and social network analysis to assess how playing Aqua \nRepublica – a game\
    \ focused on sustainable watershed management – enhanced \ncollaboration and knowledge\
    \ co-creation. In particular, participants were asked to \nrate the collaboration\
    \ in their game session both during – after completed phases – \nand after the\
    \ session. Interaction analysis and social network analysis were applied \non\
    \ session recordings of the game phases to analyze the amount of interactions\
    \ \nbetween participants, the quality of interactions and the effect pre-existing\
    \ rela-\ntionships had on group dynamics. Their analysis shows that participants\
    \ share ideas \nand build relationships in game sessions, providing evidence that\
    \ collaborative seri-\nous games can help to enhance connections and develop a\
    \ mutual understanding \nbetween stakeholders. \n3.5.4 \nCollective action\nApart\
    \ from cognitive, relational and normative learning outcomes, social learning\
    \ \nshould ultimately lead to collective action (Cundill and Rodela, 2012; Keen\
    \ et al., \n2005; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2008). Arguably, the best indicator of collective\
    \ action is \nshowing that using a collaborative serious game led to real world\
    \ impact. Indeed, \na few publications describe how game sessions within a project\
    \ or community led \nto real world initiatives and decisions. For example, the\
    \ application of the Sustain-\n82\nsustainability problems: A literature review\
    \ \n3\nable Delta Game in a water management project in New Zealand by Lawrence\
    \ and \nHaasnoot (2017) led to the adoption of adaptive pathways strategy in the\
    \ project’s \nclimate adaptation strategy. In the interviews conducted before\
    \ game sessions by \nSalvini et al. (2016), farmers indicated that they had had\
    \ negative experiences with \nfarmer cooperatives in the past. In interviews after\
    \ game sessions, farmers individ-\nually indicated that they were considering\
    \ to create a new cooperative together with \nother participants.\nOne publication\
    \ however set out to measure the real world impact of using a \ncollaborative\
    \ serious game. Meinzen-Dick et al. (2018) used two different follow-\nups after\
    \ game sessions to improve local community understanding of groundwater \ninterrelationships\
    \ and to stimulate collective governance of groundwater in India: \n(1) interviewing\
    \ locals who did not participate in game sessions to measure whether \nor not\
    \ there were any spill-over learning effects; and (2) gathering community-level\
    \ \ndata of different communities in the region, both communities where the collabora-\n\
    tive serious game was used and where it was not used, to evaluate whether or not\
    \ the \ngame led to changes in community practices. In relation to the latter,\
    \ more commu-\nnities – statistically significant – where the game was used adopted\
    \ lessons from the \ngame, leading Meinzen-Dick et al. (2018) to conclude that\
    \ playing the game led to \nreal world impact.\n3.5.5 \nReflection and limitations\n\
    All literature reviews aim to provide the complete overview of relevant publications\
    \ \nand the state-of-the-art. There are however some threats and limitations to\
    \ note in \nthat regard. Firstly, a literature review is always limited in the\
    \ keywords that it uses \nin the document search. In this case, a combination\
    \ of generic and specific keywords \nwas used in relation to sustainability and\
    \ disciplines dealing with sustainability \nissues. The generic keywords aimed\
    \ to make sure collaborative serious games on a \nvariety of sustainability topics\
    \ were found. The specific keywords were added based \non relevant review papers\
    \ and collaborative serious games known to the research-\ners. A threat here is\
    \ that the prior knowledge results in a bias. the generic keywords \nin combination\
    \ with snowballing off identified publications however limited any \ninfluence\
    \ of such a bias.\nAnother threat is that the analysis of the identified publications,\
    \ and particu-\nlarly during the study selection and quality assessment steps,\
    \ contains some subjec-\ntivity. After all, the majority of these analysis steps\
    \ were conducting by a single \nresearcher, the first author of this paper. To\
    \ limit this threat, a systematic approach to \nthe review was applied, following\
    \ the guidelines by Kitchenham and Charters (2007). \nFirstly, the study selection\
    \ protocol enabled an initial selection that excluded publi-\n83\nOn evaluating\
    \ social learning outcomes of serious games to collaboratively address \n3\ncations\
    \ clearly out of scope of the review, but included publications that required\
    \ \nmore scrutiny and in-depth assessment. Secondly, the quality assessment step\
    \ added \na structured way of selecting the publications relevant to include in\
    \ the review and \nwhile answering the quality assessment questions may still\
    \ have included some \nsubjectivity, this could only affect publications that\
    \ scored just short of the thresh-\nold and were thus excluded. These publications\
    \ were carefully looked at again after \ncompleting the entire quality assessment\
    \ to check whether or not exclusion was \na correct conclusion. None of these\
    \ publications were subsequently added to the \nreview. \n3.6 \nConclusion\nSerious\
    \ games are increasingly explored as a method to establish social learning \n\
    on sustainable natural resources management and urban planning. The aim of this\
    \ \nreview was to answer the main research question: What is the current state\
    \ of the \nart of the different methods and procedures used to assess social learning\
    \ outcomes \nof collaborative serious games? A systematic literature review was\
    \ conducted, which \nreviewed 42 publications that applied serious gaming to collaboratively\
    \ explore \nsustainable management strategies of land and natural resources. The\
    \ publica-\ntions were analyzed in order to determine how three types of learning\
    \ outcomes – \ncognitive, normative and relational learning – were assessed. To\
    \ this end, data was \nextracted from the publications in relation to five research\
    \ questions and were cate-\ngorized following an inductive approach. The categorizations\
    \ made it possible to \nidentify approaches used in relation to assessing cognitive,\
    \ normative and relational \nlearning outcomes of collaborative serious games.\n\
    Most evaluations of collaborative serious games focus on assessing cognitive \n\
    learning, which relates to the acquisition of new or the restructuring of existing\
    \ \nknowledge, for example whether or not participants obtain a better understanding\
    \ \nof the complexities of climate change. Few evaluations focus explicitly on\
    \ normative \nlearning, which relates to a shift in viewpoints, values or paradigms,\
    \ for example on \nan individual’s feeling of responsibility towards climate change\
    \ mitigation. That few \nevaluations assess normative learning is not surprising\
    \ as it generally requires expe-\nrience, reflection and time before a person\
    \ would shift viewpoints, values or para-\ndigms. Nevertheless, the reviewed publications\
    \ do show that collaborative serious \ngames can lead to normative learning. About\
    \ half of the reviewed publications report \non relational learning outcomes,\
    \ which relates to obtaining an improved under-\nstanding of others’ mind-sets,\
    \ enhanced trust and ability to cooperate. That only \nhalf assess this learning\
    \ type seems to relate to whether or not relational learning is \nseen as part\
    \ of the conceptualization of learning and whether or not the collabora-\n84\n\
    sustainability problems: A literature review \n3\ntive serious game is used in\
    \ an existing project or community. Table 3.9 provides an \noverview of the approaches\
    \ used in the assessment of the three learning outcomes, \nincluding the common\
    \ methods and procedures used.\nThe review shows that three common approaches\
    \ are used to assess cognitive learn-\ning outcomes. Firstly, asking participants\
    \ self-reflective questions such as what they \nlearned after game sessions, either\
    \ in a qualitative assessment through open ques-\ntions or a quantitative assessment\
    \ using closed questions. Secondly, applying meas-\nurements of participants’\
    \ knowledge before and after game sessions, also based on \nself-reporting by\
    \ asking open or closed questions to participants. Thirdly, assessing \nobserved\
    \ acquisition or restructuring of knowledge by analyzing observations, either\
    \ \nqualitatively or quantitatively, and in-game collected data.\nTwo approaches\
    \ are used to assess normative learning outcomes. Firstly, asking \nparticipants\
    \ to rate their views on propositions in pre–post measurements, option-\nally\
    \ complemented with such ratings during game sessions, through closed ques-\n\
    tions questionnaires. Next to assessing individual shifts in viewpoints, pre–post\

    \ serious games.\n85\nOn evaluating social learning outcomes of serious games\
    \ to collaboratively address \n3\nmeasured individual shifts can be compared within\
    \ the group of participants to \ndetermine whether or not convergence of group\
    \ opinion occurs. Secondly, interviews \nwith participants well after game sessions\
    \ – weeks to months – can be used to reflect \non the impact of collaborative\
    \ serious games on normative learning.\nTwo approaches are also used to assess\
    \ relational learning outcomes. Firstly, \nasking participants self-reflective\
    \ questions following game sessions – the approach \nused in all but one publication\
    \ reviewed – in order to determine whether or not \nparticipants gained a better\
    \ understanding of other stakeholders. Secondly, asking \nparticipants to self-report\
    \ the level of collaboration in combination with analyz-\ning participants’ interactions\
    \ during game sessions. This approach quantitatively \nanalyzes the group dynamics\
    \ during game sessions in order to determine whether or \nnot relationships are\
    \ enhanced and a mutual understanding is developed.\nOf course, evaluation approaches\
    \ are not exclusive from one another. Many \nof the reviewed publications in fact\
    \ combine approaches or use multiple methods \nto assess learning outcomes. A\
    \ multi-method evaluation approach is also recog-\nnized to fit well with serious\
    \ gaming in general. However, explicitly assessing cogni-\ntive, normative and\
    \ relational learning may help to separate the nature of learning \nthrough collaborative\
    \ serious games. The overview provided in this paper may there-\nfore serve as\
    \ a reference for scholars designing and evaluating collaborative seri-\nous games,\
    \ particularly those that address sustainability problems, but may also be \n\
    useful in relation to serious games that aim to collaboratively address problems\

    4\nAbstract\nSerious games are increasingly used to facilitate stakeholder discussion\
    \ and collab-\noration. Much attention is given in the game design literature\
    \ on how to choose \nand design a serious game’s scope, content, mechanics, and\
    \ link to reality in order \nto achieve the game’s intended learning outcomes.\
    \ In this paper, we focus on how a \nserious game’s interface and the interaction\
    \ it elicits contributes to achieving learn-\ning outcomes. We do so in the context\
    \ of the Virtual River, a serious game focused \non river management. Following\
    \ the design and evaluation of a paper prototype of \nthe Virtual River, a design\
    \ challenge arose as the highly simplified models of reality \nused was perceived\
    \ as a black box by non-expert participants, while expert partici-\npants perceived\
    \ it as oversimplified and unrealistic. As hydrodynamic models used \nin river\
    \ management practice are in itself perceived by non-experts as a black box, we\
    \ \ndecided to look for ways to simplify the interaction with such models in the\
    \ game. \nHere, we present a tangible user interface for the Virtual River. The\
    \ interface enables \nparticipants to get a better grip on the hydrodynamics of\
    \ a river system. The system \nis set up as a discussion platform where the game\
    \ board and its tangible game pieces \nhelp participants express their thoughts\
    \ and ideas. We argue that using tangible \ninteraction in Virtual River contributes\
    \ to social learning outcomes by providing \nhypotheses based on literature and\
    \ present how we intend to test these hypotheses.\n95\nHow a tangible user interface\
    \ contributes to desired learning outcomes of the \n4\n4.1 \nIntroduction\nSerious\
    \ games are increasingly explored as tools to facilitate stakeholder discussion\
    \ \nand collaboration in multidisciplinary settings (Ampatzidou et al., 2018;\
    \ Furber et al., \n2018; Marini et al., 2018). Serious games are generally referred\
    \ to as games designed \nwith a purpose other than entertainment, such as training,\
    \ educating or informing \nplayers (Michael and Chen, 2005; Susi et al., 2007).\
    \ More specifically towards the use \nof games to facilitate discussion and collaboration\
    \ in a policy-making setting, Mayer \n(2009, p. 825) defines serious games as\
    \ “experi(m)ent(i)al, rule-based, interactive \nenvironments, where players learn\
    \ by taking actions and by experiencing their effects \nthrough feedback mechanisms\
    \ that are deliberately built into and around the game.” \nBy combining role-play\
    \ with in-game feedback mechanisms, such serious games \nprovide stakeholders\
    \ with an environment to negotiate, deliberate, and exchange \ntheir perspectives\
    \ on both the problem at hand and its solution in the safe experi-\nmentation\
    \ environment of a game (Barreteau et al., 2007; Bekebrede, 2010; Mayer, \n2009).\
    \ This way, stakeholders learn both about the techno-physical complexity—\nthe\
    \ system covered in the game, including its underlying physical elements and \n\
    its uncertainties—and the socio-political complexity—the strategic interactions\
    \ \nbetween stakeholders in the policy arena (Bekebrede, 2010; Marini et al.,\
    \ 2018; Mayer, \n2009).\nAs with any product, the design of the game is crucial\
    \ to achieve its purpose. \nThe game’s goal, scope, content and mechanisms require\
    \ careful considerations. To \nhelp designers in this effort, various guidelines\
    \ exist on how to develop (serious) \ngames and what design choices to consider\
    \ (Harteveld, 2011; Ritterfeld et al., 2009; \nSalen et al., 2004). These guidelines\
    \ go in-depth on how to set up the rules and \ncontent of the game, how to create\
    \ a link to reality, and how to facilitate play in order \nto establish intended\
    \ interaction and learning outcomes. However, these guidelines \npay less attention\
    \ to the interface design and how the interface can contribute to \nachieving\
    \ the specific purpose of the serious game.\nIn this paper, we focus on the design\
    \ process of the Virtual River, a multiplayer \nserious game on river management,\
    \ and argue that the game’s tangible user inter-\nface contributes to intended\
    \ learning outcomes. Specifically, we are developing the \ntangible user interface\
    \ – an interface that provides physical forms to digital infor-\nmation (Hornecker\
    \ and Buur, 2006; Ishii, 2008) – to overcome a design challenge \nthat arose from\
    \ formative evaluation sessions of a Virtual River paper prototype. \nSpecifically,\
    \ non-expert participants perceived the game and its models as complex, \nwhile\
    \ expert participants found the same models oversimplified and unrealistic. The\
    \ \ndesign challenge therefore relates to incorporating hydrodynamic models, numerical\
    \ \nmodels that calculate water flow, in Virtual River while at the same time\
    \ offering a \n96\nVirtual River serious game \n4\nway to easily and intuitively\
    \ interact with these models. In this paper, we use the case \nof Virtual River’s\
    \ tangible user interface, in development at the time of writing, to \ncombine\
    \ theory on tangible interaction and social learning to discuss how tangible \n\
    interaction may not only overcome the design challenge, but also enhance specific\
    \ \nsocial learning outcomes of playing the game.\nIn Section 4.2, we further\
    \ introduce river management with a particular focus \non the Netherlands and\
    \ serious games in relation to river management. In Section \n4.3, we present\
    \ the theoretical framework in relation to both social learning and \ntangible\
    \ interaction. In Section 4.4, we discuss Virtual River, including its goal, a\
    \ \npreviously developed paper prototype and its evaluations, and the tangible\
    \ user \ninterface currently in development. In Section 4.5, we present three\
    \ hypotheses, \nbased on literature, on how tangible interaction may contribute\
    \ to specific learning \noutcomes and discuss how we intend to test these hypotheses.\
    \ Finally, in Section 4.6, \nwe state some concluding remarks and explain our\
    \ next steps in the development \nand evaluation of Virtual River and its tangible\
    \ user interface.\n4.2 \nBackground and related work\n4.2.1 \nRiver management\n\
    Rivers are in many ways important to society, from providing a source of water\
    \ to \nchannels for shipping to habitats for animals and plants. At the same time,\
    \ rivers can \nalso pose a threat to society as rivers are prone to flooding.\
    \ Therefore, rivers, espe-\ncially in low-lying countries, are nowadays actively\
    \ and carefully managed. However, \nriver management issues are generally multi-scale\
    \ (Gurnell et al., 2016; Vreugden-\nhil et al., 2010), concern inherent uncertainties\
    \ (Berends et al., 2018; Warmink et \nal., 2011), and affect multiple stakeholders\
    \ and agencies (Wiering and Arts, 2006; \nWolsink, 2006). Therefore, decision-making\
    \ processes need to be adaptive to deal \nwith the uncertainties and need to include\
    \ the diversity of knowledge and values \nof all affected stakeholders. To this\
    \ end, scholars have advocated active experimen-\ntation and continuous evaluation,\
    \ summarized as learning-by-doing, in natural \nresources management and in river\
    \ basin management specifically (Armitage et al., \n2007; Berkes, 2009; Pahl-Wostl,\
    \ 2007; Rodela, 2011).\nIn the Netherlands, a country known for its continuous\
    \ combat with water, \nthe main priority in river management is flood safety;\
    \ protecting the hinterland \nfrom flooding. The historic approach has been the\
    \ construction and reinforcement \nof dikes, but a recent paradigm shift has changed\
    \ the approach from protection to \ninclude resilience by applying intervention\
    \ measures that create space for water \n97\nHow a tangible user interface contributes\
    \ to desired learning outcomes of the \n4\n(Klijn et al., 2013; Rijke et al.,\
    \ 2012; van Herk et al., 2012). Examples of such space \ncreating measures include\
    \ side channels, i.e. secondary river channels in the rivers’ \nfloodplains, or\
    \ moving a dike further away from the river to increase the size of the \nfloodplain.\
    \ While the paradigm shift still holds flood safety as the most important \npriority,\
    \ it also focuses on nature restoration efforts along the Dutch rivers. The para-\n\
    digm shift has therefore also introduced new stakeholders to Dutch river manage-\n\
    ment (Wiering and Arts, 2006; Wolsink, 2006). However, Dutch river management\
    \ \nis predominantly expert- and model-driven. Water managers rely on complex\
    \ hydro-\ndynamic models to estimate how the river will react to certain intervention\
    \ meas-\nures. The tools used by water managers are perceived as black boxes to\
    \ stakeholders \nfrom non-water backgrounds (den Haan et al., 2018a). In such\
    \ a setting, serious \ngames could serve as boundary objects; shared objects that\
    \ may serve as references \nin discussions and that \"are both adaptable to different\
    \ viewpoints and robust enough \nto maintain identity across them\" (Star and\
    \ Griesemer, 1989, p. 387). In other words, a \nserious game—through its interaction\
    \ design, its physical or abstract representation \nof reality, and its rules—integrates\
    \ scientific and political worlds into a shared object \nin a way that is recognizable\
    \ yet interpretable by all stakeholders in order to serve as \na reference for\
    \ discussion (Barreteau et al., 2007; White et al., 2010).\n4.2.2 \nSerious gaming\
    \ in river management\nSerious games that integrate scientific and political worlds\
    \ are increasingly find-\ning their way in the water domain (Aubert et al., 2018;\
    \ Magnuszewski et al., 2018; \nMarini et al., 2018; Medema et al., 2016). In relation\
    \ to river management specifically, \nthere are a number of examples of serious\
    \ gaming approaches to facilitate stake-\nholder discussion and collaboration\
    \ (Douven et al., 2014; Hill et al., 2014; Lankford \nand Watson, 2007; Onencan\
    \ and van de Walle, 2018; Rusca et al., 2012; Savic et al., \n2016; Stefanska\
    \ et al., 2011; Valkering et al., 2013). For example, Stefanska et al. (2011)\
    \ \ndescribe the Floodplain Management Game, where players play the roles of farmers,\
    \ \nlocal authorities, or water boards in a small area in the river basin each\
    \ with their \nown objectives, such as profit, biodiversity, and control of water\
    \ flow, often conflict-\ning with those of others. This way, players explore technical\
    \ problem-solving as well \nas relational issues. Valkering et al. (2013) developed\
    \ the Sustainable Delta Game \nin which players are given the objective to develop\
    \ collective strategies to limit the \nprobability of both floods and droughts\
    \ from occurring. As a higher level goal, play-\ners learn about the complex interactions\
    \ between river management, climate change \nand changes in society. Douven et\
    \ al. (2014) developed the Shariva game in which \nplayers have to make trade-offs\
    \ between hydropower production in upstream areas \nand agricultural development\
    \ in downstream areas. The objective of the Shariva \n98\nVirtual River serious\
    \ game \n4\ngame is to create awareness, to upgrade knowledge, and to design procedures\
    \ for \ncooperation in transboundary river basins among water and related professionals.\
    \ \nWhile these serious games all cover different scopes and learning objectives,\
    \ \nthey have in common that they provide stakeholders with a means to collaboratively\
    \ \nexplore both the problem at hand and its solution. In doing so, stakeholders\
    \ learn \nabout how a river system functions, how management decisions affect\
    \ certain key \nperformance indicators, and how decisions lead to trade-offs between\
    \ these indi-\ncators—the techno-physical complexity—as well as how other stakeholders\
    \ look at \nthe problem, how stakeholders prefer to address the problem, and how\
    \ stakeholders \nmight be willing to compromise—the socio-political complexity.\
    \ \n4.3 \nTheoretical framework\n4.3.1 \nSocial learning\nSerious games—particularly\
    \ the multiplayer and multi-role serious games following \nthe definition by Mayer\
    \ (2009)—are recognized to offer the necessary collaborative \nand participative\
    \ interactions needed to establish social learning (Ampatzidou et \nal., 2018;\
    \ Medema et al., 2016). Social learning is considered to be a normative goals\
    \ \nand prominent driver to manage natural systems in natural resources management\
    \ \n(Armitage et al., 2008; Berkes, 2009; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007a; Reed et al.,\
    \ 2010). \nScholars have yet to find a commonly shared definition for social learning\
    \ (see \nCundill and Rodela, 2012; Muro and Jeffrey, 2008; Reed et al., 2010;\
    \ Rodela, 2011), \nbut scholars do share the view that social learning has occurred\
    \ when a change in \nunderstanding is achieved through interaction in collaborative\
    \ and participatory \nsettings (Baird et al., 2014; Keen et al., 2005; Muro and\
    \ Jeffrey, 2008; Pahl-Wostl et \nal., 2007a; Reed et al., 2010). Collaborative\
    \ and deliberative interactions between \nstakeholders are required to achieve\
    \ social learning, which should ultimately lead \nto collective action (Cundill\
    \ and Rodela, 2012; Keen et al., 2005; Pahl-Wostl et al., \n2008). Changes in\
    \ understanding may relate to the natural system that is managed, \nthe problem\
    \ that is addressed, or agreement on either the problem or its solution. \nTherefore,\
    \ social learning outcomes relate to the techno-physical complexity of the \n\
    system, the socio-political complexity, or both. To differentiate between these\
    \ differ-\nent forms of social learning, Baird et al. (2014) offers a typology\
    \ that contains three \ntypes of learning outcomes:\n• \ncognitive, acquisition\
    \ of new or restructuring of existing knowledge;\n• \nnormative, changes in norms,\
    \ values or paradigms, as well as convergence \nof group opinion; and\n99\nHow\
    \ a tangible user interface contributes to desired learning outcomes of the \n\
    4\n• \nrelational, improved understanding of others’ mind-sets, building relation-\n\
    ships, and enhancing trust and cooperation with others\nThe typology is beneficial\
    \ as it separates social learning outcomes by their nature—\ncognitive, normative\
    \ or relational—as opposed to their perceived value—learning \nmay in fact have\
    \ a negative effect on taking collective action. Moreover, the typology \nrecognizes\
    \ relational learning as a separate, explicit learning outcome, which is of \n\
    particular importance to the multi-stakeholder setting found in river management\
    \ \nand learning about its socio-political complexity. We therefore used the typology\
    \ \nby Baird et al. (2014) to distinguish between learning outcomes in connection\
    \ to the \nliterature on tangible interaction.\n4.3.2 \nTangible interaction\n\
    Tangible interaction is a theoretically informed interaction design framework\
    \ that \ncombines physical object manipulation and digitally controlled interactive\
    \ behavior \n(Hornecker and Buur, 2006; Ishii, 2008). As a response to the increasing\
    \ digitaliza-\ntion of everyday life, tangible interaction starts from the point\
    \ of view that human \nbeings have evolved to deal with the physical world and\
    \ that physical objects as a \nresult have a specific cognitive, affective, and\
    \ social interaction quality. This qual-\nity may easily get lost in the transition\
    \ to purely graphical (screen-based) interfaces \n(Klemmer et al., 2006). In response,\
    \ tangible interaction proposes to combine the \nfamiliar physical and social\
    \ world with the digital world in a way that preserves the \ndesired properties\
    \ of each and that achieves a seemingly “natural” human-computer \ninteraction\
    \ (Jetter et al., 2014). A tangible user interface can therefore be defined as\
    \ \nan interface that provides physical forms to digital information (Ishii, 2008).\
    \ Known \nexamples of tangible user interfaces include the reacTable, a musical\
    \ instrument \nwhere users can caress, rotate, and move physical objects on a\
    \ tabletop surface to \ncreate music (Jordà et al., 2007), and Illuminating Clay,\
    \ where users apply landscape \nanalysis directly by manipulating the clay model\
    \ of a landscape (Piper et al., 2002).\nPrevious research suggests that tangible\
    \ user interfaces offer qualities to facil-\nitate learning and collaboration\
    \ (see e.g. Antle and Wise, 2013; Marshall, 2007 for \nmore elaborate overviews),\
    \ both of particular interest to the design of a serious game. \nFirstly, by using\
    \ physical objects as part of the interface’s interaction invites hands-on \n\
    engagement (Marshall et al., 2003; Price et al., 2003; Price et al., 2008; Resnick,\
    \ 1998; \nZuckerman et al., 2005), providing users with tools to engage in new\
    \ ways of think-\ning (Resnick et al., 1998). Secondly, a tangible user interface\
    \ invites trial-and-error \nbehavior (Xu, 2005) and experiential learning through\
    \ exploration, discovery, and \nreflection (Marshall et al., 2003; Price et al.,\
    \ 2009; Price et al., 2003). Thirdly, from \n100\nVirtual River serious game \n\
    4\nthe perspective of cognition, by using physical objects as external representations\
    \ \neases problem solving as processing the representations does not have to be\
    \ done in \nmind, but can simply be inspected in the world (Zhang and Norman,\
    \ 1994), aiding \nusers to grasp abstract concepts through the interaction with\
    \ physical objects (Antle, \n2007; Clements, 2000; O'Malley and Fraser, 2004).\
    \ Lastly, tangible user interfaces \nalso enable users to engage in collaborative\
    \ activities (Fernaeus and Tholander, 2006; \nHornecker and Buur, 2006; Price\
    \ et al., 2009) – a prerequisite to social learning – by \noffering a multi-user\
    \ interface where control is shared (Xu, 2005; Zuckerman et al., \n2005) and making\
    \ the actions and activities of other users visible (Stanton et al., \n2001; Suzuki\
    \ and Kato, 1995). Specifically, the social-collaborative value of tangible \n\
    interaction has been emphasized since its initial formulation (see Dourish, 2004),\
    \ \nfocusing on how users working with tangible objects in social settings may\
    \ contrib-\nute to creating a shared understanding of the problem at hand (Arias\
    \ et al., 2000).\n4.4 \nVirtual River \nAs part of the RiverCare research programme\
    \ (Hulscher et al., 2014), we are devel-\noping the Virtual River, a multiplayer\
    \ serious game, which aims for players to \nexperience how the river system functions\
    \ and what the implications of different \nmanagement choices and interventions\
    \ are. In addition, we are particularly focus-\ning on facilitating stakeholders\
    \ to exchange perspectives following previous research \nthat analyzed the different\
    \ perspectives held and used by river management stake-\nholders in decision-making\
    \ (den Haan et al., 2018a). By playing the Virtual River, \nplayers learn about\
    \ the socio-political complexity as they engage in active collabora-\ntions and\
    \ negotiations with other players playing different river management roles. \n\
    On the techno-physical complexity, players learn about how management measures\
    \ \naffect the system and how such measures impact indicators like flood safety,\
    \ biodi-\nversity, and costs. Moreover, players learn about the trade-offs that\
    \ measures present \nbetween these indicators.\n4.4.1 \nInitial game design and\
    \ paper prototype\nIn the Virtual River game, players are given specific roles\
    \ and tasked to manage a \ntypical Dutch river stretch in turns representing time\
    \ steps of five years each. Each \nplayer role has its own goal, its own budget,\
    \ and a special rule it can use through-\nout the game. Players have to make decisions\
    \ collectively on the whole game area as \nwell as individually on floodplain\
    \ areas they own. Management interventions for the \nwhole area include applying\
    \ spatial measures such as creating side-channels or rein-\nforcing dikes. Both\
    \ these choices increase the discharge capacity of the river stretch, \npositively\
    \ contributing to the indicator of flood safety. Spatial measures generally \n\
    101\nHow a tangible user interface contributes to desired learning outcomes of\
    \ the \n4\nhave the added benefit of positively contributing to the indicator\
    \ of biodiversity. \nHowever, to increase the same discharge capacity, spatial\
    \ measures generally cost \nmore than dike reinforcement—and players need to reach\
    \ an agreement on how to \nshare the costs either way—and spatial measures need\
    \ to be constructed on flood-\nplain land owned by players.\nManagement choices\
    \ for the floodplain areas relate to how individual players \nmanage the land\
    \ under their control. For the flood safety indicator, the best option \nwould\
    \ be to turn all floodplain areas to grass—which has low hydraulic resistance\
    \ \nand therefore leads to a high river discharge capacity—and performing active\
    \ main-\ntenance—in the case of grass, mowing and making sure no other type of\
    \ vegetation \nstarts to grow. However, for the biodiversity indicator, floodplains\
    \ with mixed vege-\ntation—including grass, bushes, and trees—that is allowed\
    \ to grow and develop \noffers a much wider variety of plant species and a much\
    \ richer habitat for animals. \nWhereas the nature manager, a role in the game,\
    \ prefers to stimulate the latter, \nthe water manager could be opposed to such\
    \ arrangements when flood safety is at \nstake. Therefore, the water manager has\
    \ a special rule that says that it can enforce \nother participants to lower hydraulic\
    \ resistance—basically, remove vegetation like \ntrees and bushes—on their lands\
    \ whenever flood safety is at stake, a rule that corre-\nsponds to reality in\
    \ terms of the Dutch Public Works Authority’s powers. \nIn a previous design iteration,\
    \ we developed a board game prototype of the \nVirtual River to evaluate its scope,\
    \ game indicators, and initial rules and roles (den \nHaan et al., 2018b) (Figure\
    \ 4.1). Formative evaluations showed that participants \nfound the game engaging\
    \ and insightful, and that players understood the link to \nreality. However,\
    \ participants, in particular non-expert participants, found the game \nFigure\
    \ 4.1 Paper prototype impression with the main game board on the left with a river\
    \ stretch, \ngame score indicators on the right, and a role card on the left bottom.\n\
    102\nVirtual River serious game \n4\ncomplex and perceived the game’s models—calculations\
    \ on the flood safety, biodi-\nversity, and costs indicators and how players were\
    \ scored on these—as a black box. \nThis prevented these participants from gaining\
    \ the techno-physical insights into \nhow a river system functions and responds\
    \ to changes. However, expert participants \nquestioned the realism of the models\
    \ behind the paper prototype, finding these \ninstead to be oversimplified and\
    \ unrealistic. \n4.4.2 \nTangible user interface\nFollowing the formative evaluations\
    \ of the paper prototype, our focus for the \ndesign and further development of\
    \ Virtual River shifted from addressing the gap in \ncomplexity perception between\
    \ participants to lowering or helping to navigate the \ngame’s complexity and\
    \ removing the perceived black box. Simultaneously, we aimed \nto increase the\
    \ link to reality and real-world models. On the one hand, although the \npaper\
    \ prototype used a highly simplified cause-effect model for the hydrodynamics\
    \ \nof the game, non-expert participants already perceived it as complex and as\
    \ a black \nbox. On the other hand, experts participants questioned the realism\
    \ of the model as \noversimplified. Simply incorporating a more elaborate model\
    \ in the next iteration of \nVirtual River could help solve the latter, but not\
    \ the first. Moreover, hydrodynamic \nmodels are in itself perceived as a black\
    \ box by non-experts. Therefore, we decided \nto look for ways to simplify the\
    \ interaction with hydrodynamic models. To address \nthis design challenge, we\
    \ looked to tangible interaction and are currently developing \na tangible user\
    \ interface where players are provided with a physical representation of \na river\
    \ stretch that players can alter to directly manipulate a hydrodynamic model.\
    \ \nAs a basis for the interface, we are using an existing framework called the\
    \ Sand-\nBox, an augmented reality collaborative modeling tool (Ottevanger et\
    \ al., 2017). \nInspired by the LakeViz project (Reed et al., 2016), the SandBox\
    \ consists of a box of \nsand, a color and depth camera (RGBD, Kinect), the relevant\
    \ hydrodynamic model, \nand a projector (Figure 4.2). The sand can be molded by\
    \ end users to design a river. \nThe sand is measured by the RGBD camera. This\
    \ information is used to change the \nschematization (the geometry of the river\
    \ stretch) of the numerical model. Delft3D \nFlexible Mesh, a 1D, 2D, 3D hydrodynamic\
    \ model, is used in this study for rivers, \nbut other models that use the Basic\
    \ Model Interface (Peckham et al., 2013) are also \nsupported. The model results\
    \ are visualized on the sand using the projector. The \nSandBox adds an easy to\
    \ use interface to real world engineering models and has \nshown to invite users\
    \ to experiment and, through trial and error, experience how a \nhydrodynamic\
    \ model works and generate understanding of how a river system func-\ntions. In\
    \ a group setting, the SandBox has contributed to enhanced communication \nbetween\
    \ stakeholders. \n103\nHow a tangible user interface contributes to desired learning\
    \ outcomes of the \n4\nFor the Virtual River, we replaced the sand with game pieces\
    \ of different heights \non a hexagonal grid. We took this approach to retain\
    \ the full benefit of the SandBox \nframework, while adding structure that limits\
    \ the amount of options for players to \nconsider in order to make it suitable\
    \ for gameplay. In our approach, we are trans-\nforming the board from the paper\
    \ prototype into a 3D game board, where the shape \nof the game board, based on\
    \ hexagon game pieces of different heights, correspond \nto the geometrical shape\
    \ of a river stretch. The geometrical shape is used as input \nfor a hydrodynamic\
    \ model and the output of the hydrodynamic model is projected \nback on the 3D\
    \ game board (see Figure 4.3 for an impression).\nTo address calibration issues\
    \ with the Kinect—and to eliminate the possibil-\nity of having to recalibrate\
    \ it during a game session—we developed an alternative \nFigure 4.2 SandBox setup\
    \ and interface (photo from Ottevanger et al., 2017). The SandBox uses \na Kinect\
    \ to measure the geometry of the sand, representing a river stretch. Molding the\
    \ sand \ninto a new shape changes the schematization used by the hydrodynamic\
    \ model and a projector \nprojects the model’s output back on the box of sand.\n\
    104\nVirtual River serious game \n4\nmethod to detect the game pieces on the board\
    \ based on markers and image process-\ning. Specifically, we constructed the game\
    \ board on a transparent underlayer and \nattached colored markers to the bottom\
    \ of all game pieces. There are two types of \ngame pieces: (1) geometry pieces,\
    \ different heights of hexagon shaped pieces assigned \nred markers; and (2) land\
    \ use pieces, different flat pieces representing different land \nuse that fit\
    \ on top of the geometry pieces assigned blue markers (Figure 4.4). A \nphotograph\
    \ is taken from beneath the game board and a Python script subsequently \ncalibrates\
    \ the picture to detect the correct positions of all hexagon grid cells and \n\
    analyzes the amount of both red and blue markers of game pieces at each grid cell\
    \ \nlocation (Figure 4.5).\nWe are currently developing a prototype for the Virtual\
    \ River’s tangible user \ninterface (Figure 4.6). At the time of writing, the\
    \ physical part of prototype is built \nb\na\nd\nc\nFigure 4.3 Game board impression\

    \ \nchannel next to the main river channel; (c) game board after constructing\
    \ a longitudinal train-\ning dam, a dam constructed in the main river in parallel\
    \ to the water flow; and (d) game board \nafter a dike relocation, moving a dike\

    \ not included in this impression.\n105\nHow a tangible user interface contributes\
    \ to desired learning outcomes of the \n4\nand we are in the processes of calibrating\
    \ and refining the detection script as well \nas the link to the SandBox framework.\
    \ As can be seen in Figure 4.6, all game pieces \nare only primed with a grey\
    \ color and although the geometry pieces can be identi-\nfied by their actual\
    \ height, we do plan to see if using a greyscale gradient, where a \nspecific\
    \ color value between white and grey corresponds to a specific height, can be\
    \ \nused to help identification. We intend to test if using different color values\
    \ do not \ninterfere with the projected visualizations. The land use pieces are\
    \ not yet identifia-\nble in Figure 4.6, these are all flat surfaces. We plan\
    \ to add icons to match different \nland uses, for example a tree to represent\
    \ a forest and a building to represent built \nenvironment. These icons could\
    \ be flat using physical shapes or stickers. Our pref-\nerence is the first, as\
    \ physical shapes add concrete representations, in line with our \napproach of\
    \ using tangible interaction, as well as help players to more easily grab \nand\
    \ move pieces on the board. However, this similarly requires testing whether this\

    \ user interface provides players with a \nshared gaming environment where players\
    \ directly interact with a hydrodynamic \nmodel by changing the arrangement of\
    \ game pieces. For example, by replacing \nhigher geometry pieces with lower ones—basically\
    \ excavating the area—increases \nthe discharge capacity of game area by creating\
    \ more floodplain areas, effectively \ncreating space for water. By changing land\
    \ use pieces that have high hydraulic \nresistance—therefore limiting water flow—with\
    \ pieces with low resistance similarly \nincreases discharge capacity. Based on\
    \ the arrangement of game pieces as input, the \nhydrodynamic model is updated\
    \ and the resulting output in the form of water flow \nis projected back on the\
    \ game board, providing players with instant feedback on \ntheir actions.\n4.5\
    \ \nDiscussion\nTangible user interfaces have been applied in other tabletop (serious)\
    \ game settings. \nBakker et al. (2007) developed Weathergods, a game where players\
    \ try to earn the \nfavor of weather gods in order to make it rain and save the\
    \ player’s village harvest. \nWeathergods uses a digital surface in combination\
    \ with tangible game pieces, physi-\ncal representations of for example players’\
    \ avatars, that can be moved between differ-\nent board positions. Speelpenning\
    \ et al. (2011) developed physical objects as tangible \ncontrollers for the serious\
    \ game Futura, a serious game where players experience the \ncomplexity of planning\
    \ for a sustainable future. In their approach, players use phys-\nical magnifying\
    \ glasses to open visualization layers in the game that provide play-\ners with\
    \ additional information. Inspired by The Incredible Machine, Leitner et al. \n\
    (2008) developed the IncreTable where players solve puzzles by combining physical\
    \ \nand virtual game pieces. The IncreTable allows users to combine and connect\
    \ for \nexample physical domino stones with virtual ones. All these applications\
    \ use a digi-\ntal surface as a game board in combination with tangible objects.\
    \ In our approach, \nthe game board itself is formed by physical objects that\
    \ serve as both the control of \nFigure 4.6 Game board prototype with (a) the\
    \ empty board showing the grid and transparent \nunderlayer; and (b) a filled\
    \ board with game pieces that combined form the geometry of a river \nstretch.\n\
    b\na\n107\nHow a tangible user interface contributes to desired learning outcomes\
    \ of the \n4\nthe hydrodynamic model and the representation of the river stretch.\
    \ The approach \nfollows the tangible user interface as an interactive surface\
    \ genre as explained by Ishii \n(2008), which focuses on supporting collaborative\
    \ design and simulation. \nIn the next subsections, we discuss the benefits of\
    \ the tangible user interface \nfor Virtual River from the perspective of  social\
    \ learning by presenting hypothe-\nses in relation to the three types of social\
    \ learning outcomes: cognitive, normative, \nand relational learning (see 4.3.1\
    \ and Baird et al., 2014). Specifically, the hypothe-\nses are presented from\
    \ the perspective of the Virtual River’s tangible interface, they \nare provided\
    \ with arguments from literature on tangible interaction, and they are \ndiscussed\
    \ in terms of intended assessment. The latter is based on earlier work that \n\
    analyzed the different approaches used to evaluate social learning outcomes (den\
    \ \nHaan and van der Voort, 2018). \n4.5.1 \nHypothesis 1: the Virtual River’s\
    \ tangible user interface enables \nplayers to gain an increased understanding\
    \ of how a river system functions\nThe first hypothesis relates to cognitive learning,\
    \ which covers the acquisition of \nnew knowledge and the restructuring of existing\
    \ knowledge. The hypothesis also \nrelates directly to our design challenge to\
    \ incorporate realistic hydrodynamic models \nin the Virtual River while at the\
    \ same time offer easy and intuitive interactions with \nhydrodynamic models.\
    \ To address the design challenge, we expect that especially \nnon-expert players\
    \ learn about how hydrodynamic models work and, therefore, \nhow the river system\
    \ functions. Furthermore we expect that, from the perspective of \ncognition,\
    \ the tangible user interface using a physical representation of a river stretch\
    \ \nhelps players to gain the increased system understanding. As part of the information\
    \ \nneeded during gameplay is not ‘kept in mind’, but can simply be inspected\
    \ in the \nworld, what Don Norman famously called ‘knowledge in the world’ (Norman,\
    \ 2013). \nFurthermore, knowledge in the world allows for ‘epistemic action’.\
    \ Players can use \ntheir embodied skills to manipulate the information in the\
    \ environment, the game \nboard itself, and can use their visual pattern recognition\
    \ routines to inspect the result \n– the visualized projection – which together\
    \ assists in making inferences. Instead of \nheavy mental gymnastics, players\
    \ can reorganize the world and then simply ‘see’ the \nanswer to a problem before\
    \ them (Kirsh, 2010). In other words, in line with the tradi-\ntion of Distributed\
    \ Cognition (Hutchins, 1995), using tangible interaction allows \nplayers to ‘offload’\
    \ information into the physical structure of the local environment, \nreleasing\
    \ the brain of work and making thinking easier (van Dijk, 2018).\nWe intend to\
    \ test this hypothesis by first applying pre- and post-game knowl-\nedge measurements,\
    \ including knowledge on hydrodynamic models. In addition, \nwe intend to compare\
    \ individual pre- and post-measurements with video recordings \n108\nVirtual River\
    \ serious game \n4\nof game sessions to observe if the use of the tangible user\
    \ interface contributed to \ndifferences in measurements. Open questions could\
    \ furthermore be asked directly \nto players in interviews or questionnaires after\
    \ game sessions to gain additional qual-\nitive insights into how the tangible\
    \ user interface enabled learning about the func-\ntioning of a river system.\n\
    4.5.2 \nHypothesis 2: Using a tangible user interface in the Virtual River \n\
    aids players in understanding each other’s perspectives\nThe second hypotheses\
    \ relates to relational learning, which covers understanding \nothers’ mind-sets,\
    \ building relationships, and enhancing trust and cooperation with \nothers. In\
    \ general, providing players with a shared environment where players engage \n\
    in collaboration and negotiation creates a setting where players exchange views\
    \ and \nopinions. Following the ethnomethodological tradition in sociology (Suchman,\
    \ \n2007), the use of tangible objects to express our thoughts makes these thoughts\
    \ \nbecome public. Therefore, we speculate that allowing players to literally\
    \ see another \nplayer think by how they are manipulating the game board, i.e.\
    \ representing that \nthought process, provides players with a platform that helps\
    \ them observe the point \nof view of others and empathize with it (Dourish, 2004;\
    \ Klemmer et al., 2006). More-\nover, we speculate that these insights could contribute\
    \ to the converging of group \nopinion, associated with normative learning, as\
    \ players may also intervene while \nobserving others, which leads to a shared\
    \ process of manipulating objects: a collab-\norative process of sensemaking (Arias\
    \ et al., 2000; Dourish, 2004). Therefore, collab-\noratively negotiating on how\
    \ to best structure the physical pieces on the game board \nmay help to not just\
    \ align the pieces as such, but also to align the different perspec-\ntives of\
    \ the players (Ehn, 2011; van Dijk and van der Lugt, 2013).\nTo test this hypothesis,\
    \ we intend to ask players self-reflective questions on \nwhat they learned about\
    \ the perspectives of others after game sessions in either \nquestionnaires or\
    \ individual interviews. In addition, game session recordings can \nbe analyzed\
    \ and observations can be compared to the players’ answers to these \nquestions.\n\
    4.5.3 \nHypothesis 3: Using a tangible user interface in Virtual River \ncontributes\
    \ to players building relationships and trust\nThe third hypothesis relates to\
    \ relational learning as well. While the literature \nacknowledges that using\
    \ tangible objects may create a shared understanding of the \nproblem at hand\
    \ (Arias et al., 2000), people engaging in collaborative efforts in itself \n\
    creates a dimension of relationship building and trust formation. Moreover, as\
    \ van \nDijk and van der Lugt (2013) showed, working together in a physical space\
    \ helps \n109\nHow a tangible user interface contributes to desired learning outcomes\
    \ of the \n4\npeople to interact nonverbally—look each other in the eye, ‘open\
    \ up’ to the other \nby turning the body, gesture to another to take their turn,\
    \ and so on. Looking at the \nsame screen together—even if it is a large projection—tends\
    \ to focus attention to the \ninformation on the screen, and away from the actual\
    \ people using that information \nand being together in a social situation. While\
    \ the tangible interaction literature has \nnot often emphasized this aspect,\
    \ we speculate that in the present context having a \ntangible river setting that\
    \ people can stand around, work with, and point to could in \nthis way help building\
    \ relationship and trust. \nWe intend to test this hypothesis by applying interaction\
    \ analysis (Jordan and \nHenderson, 1995) to recordings of game sessions to analyze\
    \ both interaction between \nplayers as well as between players and the interface.\
    \ This approach could be comple-\nmented with follow-up interviews some time after\
    \ game sessions to gain insights into \nif any relationship building led to any\
    \ cooperation.\n4.6 \nConcluding remarks and next steps\nWe are developing a tangible\
    \ user interface for the Virtual River, a serious game that \naims for players\
    \ to experience how the river system functions and what the implica-\ntions of\
    \ different management choices are. In particular, we discussed why we looked\
    \ \nto tangible interaction as a way to overcome the design challenge to incorporate\
    \ \nhydrodynamic models in Virtual River while providing players with an easy\
    \ to use \ninterface to manipulate these models. Moreover, we applied a theoretical\
    \ perspec-\ntive on why tangible interaction offers benefits from the perspective\
    \ of Virtual River’s \nlearning objectives, captured in three hypotheses. Firstly,\
    \ we speculate that the \nVirtual River’s tangible user interface contributes\
    \ to cognitive learning outcomes as \nit enables players to gain an increased\
    \ understanding of how a river system functions \n(hypothesis 1). Specifically,\
    \ the tangible user interface provides players what an tool to \ndirectly manipulate\
    \ a hydrodynamic model and see the results. At the same time, by \nusing physical\
    \ representations, the tangible user interface enables players to inspect \ninformation\
    \ ‘in the world’, releasing the brain of work and making thinking easier. \nSecondly,\
    \ we further speculate that Virtual River’s tangible user interface contrib-\n\
    utes to relational learning outcomes as it aids players in understanding each\
    \ other’s \nperspectives (hypothesis 2). By manipulating the physical game board,\
    \ players make \ntheir though process explicit and other players may be able to\
    \ observe their point \nof view and empathize with it. Lastly, we speculate that\
    \ that Virtual River’s tangible \nuser interface contributes to players building\
    \ relationships and trust (hypothesis 3). \nSpecifically, offering a physical\
    \ board to stand around, work with, and point to over \na screen-based interface\
    \ may be beneficial to building relationship and trust.\n110\nVirtual River serious\
    \ game \n4\nAs next steps, we plan to first operationalize the whole interface,\
    \ including \ndeveloping and testing representations, icons in either physical\
    \ or sticker form, for \nthe land use of each game tile. From there, we intend\
    \ to first run game sessions as \nformative evaluations; does the game design\
    \ achieve its design goal and does the \ninterface design effectively overcome\
    \ the design challenge. Afterwards we intend \nto hold summative game evaluation\
    \ sessions that focus on evaluating social learn-\ning outcomes of playing Virtual\
    \ River as well as evaluating how tangible interaction \ncontributes to these\
    \ outcomes.\nChapter 5\nThe Virtual River Game: Gaming using \nmodels to collaboratively\

    \ and participatory approaches are increasingly important \nin environmental decision-making\
    \ (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2008; Reed, 2008; Voinov et \nal., 2016). A recent shift\
    \ from sectoral towards more integrated natural resources \nmanagement has made\
    \ stakeholder participation essential to the pursuit of cross-dis-\nciplinary\
    \ objectives (Berkes, 2009; Pahl-Wostl, 2007; Reed, 2008). At the same time, \n\
    stakeholder participation is recognized as an effective way to improve the quality\
    \ of \nand acceptance in decision-making (Cundill and Rodela, 2012; Reed, 2008;\
    \ Voinov et \nal., 2016). One method that is receiving increasing attention to\
    \ facilitate stakeholder \nparticipation in environmental management is serious\
    \ gaming (Aubert et al., 2018; \nRusca et al., 2012; Voinov et al., 2016).\nSerious\
    \ games are generally referred to as games that have a primary purpose \nother\
    \ than mere entertainment (Michael and Chen, 2005; Susi et al., 2007). In the\
    \ \ncontext of environmental management and participation, serious games are defined\
    \ \nby Mayer (2009, p. 825) as “experi(m)ent(i)al, rule-based, interactive environments,\
    \ \nwhere players learn by taking actions and by experiencing their effects through\
    \ feed-\nback mechanisms that are deliberately built into and around the game.”\
    \ To provide \nfeedback on actions, such serious games include a simplified representation\
    \ of real-\nity in terms of both the environmental system and its stakeholders\
    \ (Harteveld, 2011; \nRedpath et al., 2018; Rodela et al., 2019). In this way,\
    \ serious games enable stakehold-\ners to explore environmental challenges, interventions,\
    \ and the effects of such inter-\nventions in an environment in which it is safe\
    \ to experiment. Furthermore, serious \ngames enable stakeholders to experience\
    \ the strategic interactions between stake-\nholders by explicitly including interaction\
    \ rules and assuming stakeholder roles in \nthe game. Therefore, serious games\
    \ facilitate stakeholders’ learning about both the \n114\nmanagement complexity\n\
    5\nphysical-technical and the inherent socio-political complexities (Bekebrede,\
    \ 2010; de \nCaluwé et al., 2012; Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer, 2009). The lessons\
    \ learned while play-\ning serious games can be both relevant and transferable\
    \ to real-world decision-mak-\ning (Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer, 2009).\nOne promising\
    \ opportunity for serious games in the context of stakeholder \nparticipation\
    \ in environmental management is their use as what Rodela et al. (2019) \ncategorize\
    \ as learning-based interventions. Such games are developed to engage \nstakeholders\
    \ in dialogue and activity in order to contribute to what is commonly \nreferred\
    \ to as social learning: changes in understanding through interaction in \ncollaborative\
    \ and participatory processes that go beyond the individual (see e.g. \nCundill\
    \ and Rodela, 2012; Muro and Jeffrey, 2008; Reed et al., 2010; Rodela, 2011).\
    \ As \nlearning-based interventions, games are therefore developed under the assumptions\
    \ \nthat these: (1) provide stakeholders with participatory environments that\
    \ facilitate \nthe stakeholder interactions and collaborative experimentation\
    \ that are essential to \nestablish social learning; and (2) contribute to individuals\
    \ or groups experiencing a \nchange in understanding as a result of the game’s\
    \ collaborative activity (Ampatzidou \net al., 2018; Flood et al., 2018; Medema\
    \ et al., 2016). In the literature, social learning \nis usually operationalized\
    \ as: (1) cognitive learning: acquiring new or restructuring \nexisting knowledge;\
    \ (2) normative learning: changing viewpoints, values, or para-\ndigms; and (3)\
    \ relational learning: increasing the understanding of the mind-set and \nperspectives\
    \ of other stakeholders as well as fostering the ability to cooperate among \n\
    stakeholders (Baird et al., 2014; Ensor and Harvey, 2015).\nIn the context of\
    \ environmental management, there are various examples of \nserious games as learning-based\
    \ interventions (see e.g. reviews by Aubert et al., 2018; \nden Haan and van der\
    \ Voort, 2018; Flood et al., 2018 for games on water management, \nsustainability,\
    \ and climate change respectively). As one of a few recent examples \n(from a\
    \ far longer list), Craven et al. (2017) developed SimBasin to bring stakeholders\
    \ \ntogether with the aim of developing a shared understanding and sense of urgency\
    \ \naround the management of the Magdalena-Cauca river basin in Colombia. They\
    \ \nshowed that the game was successful in creating an open discussion space to\
    \ bring \nstakeholders and scientists together. The Sustainable Delta Game (Valkering\
    \ et al., \n2013; van der Wal et al., 2016) challenges stakeholders to develop\
    \ collective strate-\ngies to manage a fictional stretch of a Dutch river and\
    \ aims to help them to learn \nabout the complex interactions between river management,\
    \ climate change, and \nchanges in society. Results from twelve sessions showed\
    \ that playing the game led \nto the convergence of the players’ perspectives\
    \ (van der Wal et al., 2016). Becu et al. \n(2017) developed LittoSim to enable\
    \ social learning among local authority manag-\ners on Oléron Island in France\
    \ about prevention measures to reduce the risk of \n115\nThe Virtual River Game:\
    \ Gaming using models to collaboratively explore river \n5\ncoastal flooding.\
    \ They showed that LittoSim facilitated stakeholder experimenta-\ntion with and\
    \ learning about risk prevention measures in relation to possible flood \nevents.\
    \ Van Hardeveld et al. (2019) developed the RE:PEAT game to explore collab-\n\
    orative management strategies to help reduce soil subsidence in the Netherlands.\
    \ \nResults from ten sessions showed that RE:PEAT improved cooperation among peat-\n\
    land stakeholders, increased their understanding of the problems, and led them\
    \ to \npossible strategies for reducing soil subsidence.\nRecent changes in Dutch\
    \ river management provide a valuable case study for \ndesigning and evaluating\
    \ a serious game as a participatory tool. Traditionally, river \nmanagement has\
    \ been dominated by dike strengthening and was therefore within \nthe field of\
    \ hydraulic engineering. A new management paradigm, involving spatial \nmeasures\
    \ and multifunctional design, brings in many other stakeholders that are \ntraditionally\
    \ not usually involved with river management. The challenge of collab-\noration\
    \ between these diverse groups of stakeholders, in what is still a rather tech-\n\
    nical field, demands a shared understanding of the physical system. In this paper,\
    \ \nwe present the Virtual River Game, a serious game to collaboratively explore\
    \ river \nmanagement complexity in the Netherlands. The game was played in five\
    \ sessions \ninvolving both domain experts and non-experts to assess its value\
    \ as a participatory \ntool. It was guided by the research questions: (1) to what\
    \ extent does the game facil-\nitate stakeholders collaboratively exploring and\
    \ experimenting with river interven-\ntions; and (2) to what extent does playing\
    \ the game lead to social learning outcomes? \nThe paper is structured as follows.\
    \ The next section discusses the game and \nparticularly the fact that it facilitates\
    \ stakeholders to apply river interventions on a \ngame board that has a bidirectional\
    \ link to computer models. Section 5.3 presents \nthe assessment approach of the\
    \ game, including an overview of the sessions and \nthe methods to collect and\
    \ analyze the data in order to address the research ques-\ntions. Section 5.4\
    \ reports on the factual game output of the sessions, observations \nof the in-game\
    \ discussions, and the participants’ self-reported learning outcomes. \nThe paper\
    \ ends with a discussion of the value of the game as a participatory tool as \n\
    well as on how the game’s hybrid interface combines those qualities found in board\
    \ \nand computer games that benefit and support stakeholder participation and\
    \ social \nlearning processes.\n5.2 \nGame description\n5.2.1 \nBackground and\
    \ aim\nTo protect the deltaic floodplains from flooding, the traditional approach\
    \ in the \nNetherlands has been to build and reinforce dikes. However, near-flood\
    \ events in the \n116\nmanagement complexity\n5\n1990s shifted the approach of\
    \ Dutch river management towards applying so-called \nspatial measures that aim\
    \ to create more space for rivers to safely discharge water \n(Rijke et al., 2012;\
    \ Warner et al., 2012); for example, by digging side channels, lower-\ning floodplains,\
    \ and moving back dikes (see e.g. Berends et al., 2019; Straatsma et \nal., 2019;\
    \ van Stokkom et al., 2005). In addition to lowering peak water levels, such \n\
    spatial measures also aimed to restore the local ecology (Fliervoet et al., 2013;\
    \ Klijn \net al., 2013; Straatsma et al., 2017). This paradigm shift, while still\
    \ retaining flood \nsafety as its primary focus, led to an increasingly more integrated\
    \ river management \napproach. As a result, it attracted new stakeholders to river\
    \ management (Verbrugge \net al., 2019) and emphasized the importance of stakeholder\
    \ participation in deci-\nsion-making (Edelenbos et al., 2017; Fliervoet et al.,\
    \ 2013; Zevenbergen et al., 2015). \nIn the context of the new Dutch river management\
    \ paradigm, we set out \nto develop the Virtual River Game as a tool to increase\
    \ and support stakeholder \nparticipation. The game can beneficially be played\
    \ at an early stage of a project, \nas an icebreaker activity but that is disconnected\
    \ from the project’s actual deci-\nsion-making. The game enables stakeholders\
    \ to collaboratively experiment with \nriver interventions in order to increase\
    \ their understanding of Dutch river manage-\nment – including both the physical\
    \ system and the effects and trade-offs of specific \ninterventions – and the\
    \ perspectives and interests of other stakeholders in relation \nto such interventions.\
    \ During the game’s design process, we found that some stake-\nholders – particularly\
    \ those introduced to river management as a result of the para-\ndigm change –\
    \ view the hydrodynamic models central to Dutch river management \ndecision-making\
    \ as mysterious black boxes (den Haan et al., 2018). Therefore, to \nsupport stakeholder\
    \ participation, we set out to develop the Virtual River Game to \nenable stakeholders\
    \ – regardless of background and expertise – to work with a hydro-\ndynamic model\
    \ that is widely used in practice. To that end, we developed a hybrid \ninterface\
    \ based on tangible interaction; linking physical forms to digital informa-\n\
    tion (Hornecker and Buur, 2006; Ishii, 2008). The interface features a bidirectional\
    \ \ncoupling of a physical game board to a hydrodynamic, ecological, and cost\
    \ model. \nAn impression of the Virtual River Game and its interface is shown\
    \ in Figure 5.1. The \nVirtual River Game uses hexagonal tiles to represent a\
    \ typical stretch of a Dutch river \nthat includes a main channel and floodplains\
    \ and dikes on both sides of the channel. \nThe changing of the tiles on the game\
    \ board provides input to the models, while the \nmodels’ output is visualized\
    \ both on the game board through projection and in a \ngame engine shown on a\
    \ touchscreen monitor. An overview of the game’s software \nand hardware components\
    \ is shown in Figure 5.2. In the following sections, we first \nintroduce the\
    \ models and their integration in the Virtual River Game, followed by a \ndescription\

    Delft3D Flexible Mesh hydrodynamic model\nTo model water flow and water levels\
    \ in the game area, we incorporated the Delft3D \nFlexible Mesh (FM) hydrodynamic\
    \ model to compute the hydrodynamic response \nto system change (Berends et al.,\
    \ 2019; Kernkamp et al., 2011). We use a rectangular \nFigure 5.1 An impression\
    \ of the game table, including the physical board, touchscreen monitor, \nprojector,\
    \ and webcam. The projection on the board in this figure shows the hydraulic rough-\n\
    ness of floodplain and channel locations, visualized in a green to red color range\
    \ to represent \nsmooth to rough. The touchscreen monitor has two functions: (1)\
    \ as a controller for players to \ninitiate model updates and to switch visualizations;\
    \ and (2) as an overview of the current state \nin the game by providing a virtual\
    \ world of the board as well as information on the in-game \nperformance.\n118\n\

    \ levels and Chézy friction coeffi-\ncients are determined at the start of a game\
    \ and are updated as the game progresses. \nThe boundary conditions are given\
    \ by an upstream constant discharge and a down-\nstream constant water level.\
    \ We use default parameter settings. Water levels and flow \nvelocities are the\
    \ model outputs of interest.\nBIOSAFE biodiversity model\nTo model the potential\
    \ biodiversity of the game area, we integrated the BIOSAFE \nmodel as developed\
    \ by Lenders et al. (2001), de Nooij et al. (2004), and Straatsma \net al. (2017).\
    \ The model calculates biodiversity scores based on the potential occur-\nrence\
    \ of protected and endangered species in each ecotope, the laws and regulations\
    \ \nprotecting the species, and the surface area distribution of the main channel\
    \ and \nfloodplain ecotopes between the dikes. Ecotopes are defined as “spatial\
    \ landscape \nunits that are homogeneous as to vegetation structure, succession\
    \ stage, and the \nFigure 5.2 Overview of the Virtual River Game’s hardware and\
    \ software. The software compo-\nnents shaded in gray are plug-ins.\n119\nThe\
    \ Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively explore river \n\
    5\nmain abiotic factors that are relevant to plant growth” (Klijn and de Haes,\
    \ 1994). As \ninput, the model needs the ecotopes and their surface areas. As\
    \ output, the model \nprovides potential biodiversity scores for seven taxonomic\
    \ groups: mammals, birds, \nherpetofauna, fish, butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies,\
    \ and higher plants.\nVRCost cost model\nTo model the costs of interventions,\
    \ we created a model in Python by translating unit \nprices for costs for interventions\
    \ in Dutch river management (Straatsma et al., 2019) \nto interventions in the\
    \ game. Unit prices relate to costs per volume, area, or length \n(hexagon cross\
    \ section). For example, a volume of soil may have to be excavated to \nconstruct\
    \ a side channel in the river’s floodplain. The model distinguishes four cost\
    \ \ncategories: excavations, construction of hydraulic structures, land use changes,\
    \ and \nland acquisition. As input, the model needs the elevation and land use\
    \ change. As \noutput, the model calculates the total costs for changes on the\
    \ board as well as the \ncosts per type.\n5.2.2 \nInterface design and model integration\n\
    For the Virtual River Game’s hybrid interface, we designed and built a physical\
    \ table \n(Figure 5.1) that includes the game board plus an off-the-shelf webcam,\
    \ touchscreen \nmonitor, and projector. The game board consists of 143 hexagonal\
    \ tiles representing \na stretch of river. The tabletop has an open aluminum mesh\
    \ into which the tiles slot, \nleaving the bottom side of each tile visible to\
    \ the webcam. Each tile contains infor-\nmation on terrain height and land use,\
    \ which can be independently varied. Table 5.1 \nshows the five elevation levels\
    \ and twelve land use types and their potential combina-\ntions. We chose the\
    \ five elevation levels as a representation of the varying elevations \nfound\
    \ in Dutch rivers. For the land use types, we took inspiration from the classifica-\n\
    tion of vegetation types used by the Dutch Public Works Authority (Rijkswaterstaat,\
    \ \n2012). Markers on the bottom of the tiles enable the conversion of the physical\
    \ board \nto a digital board, defining each tile’s elevation and land use in the\
    \ game’s software, \nbased on a picture taken by the webcam. Throughout the game,\
    \ the system can be \nupdated, triggering the software to process the latest board\
    \ state. In the following \nsubsection, we explain the additional processing steps\
    \ in the software needed to link \nthe board to the models.\nModel interface\n\
    The game software converts the digital board to a digital elevation model (DEM)\
    \ and \na roughness distribution as input to Delft3D FM. The DEM is created by\
    \ an inverse \ndistance interpolation (power of 2) of the terrain height at the\
    \ center of the three \n120\nmanagement complexity\n5\nnearest tiles to a regular\
    \ grid, indexed to the computational grid used in Delft3D FM. \nThe roughness\
    \ classes are based on a lookup table from land use to roughness class \n(Appendix\
    \ 5.A). Subsequently, the software calculates the hydraulic roughness by \nretrieving\
    \ the water levels of locations from Delft3D FM and applying the vegetation \n\
    friction model of Klopstra et al. (1996). The software sets the elevation and\
    \ rough-\nness coefficients and also retrieves water levels and flow velocity\
    \ from Delft3D FM \nthrough the Basic Model Interface (BMI) (Peckham et al., 2013),\
    \ using the Python \nBMI (Baart, 2017). \nFor BIOSAFE, the software converts the\
    \ digital board to an ecotope distribution \nthrough a lookup table that links\
    \ terrain height and land use to ecotopes (Appen-\ndix 5.A). A subset of 15 ecotopes\
    \ out of the 82 fluvial ecotopes defined in the Dutch \necotope classification\
    \ (van der Molen et al., 2003) are included. Composite land use, \nsuch as ‘main\
    \ channel with a longitudinal training dam’, are split up into their pure \necotope\
    \ classes in order to calculate the surface areas of all ecotopes. The Python\
    \ \nversion of BIOSAFE (Straatsma et al., 2017) is integrated in the game’s software\
    \ to \nenable sending of the ecotopes and retrieving the potential biodiversity\
    \ score for \nthe taxonomic groups.\nLand use types\nChannel with groins\nChannel\

    121\nThe Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively explore river\
    \ \n5\nFor VRCost, the software compares the previous and new board states to\
    \ detect \nchanges in elevation and land use. Changes on the board are sent directly\
    \ to the \nmodel and the costs of changes, including their breakdown into the\
    \ four categories, \nare retrieved.\nModel feedback\nThe Virtual River Game offers\
    \ model output in two locations: on the game board \nitself and on the touchscreen.\
    \ On the physical game board, the software visualizes \nthe DEM, water flow patterns\
    \ from Delft3D FM, and hydraulic roughness coefficients \nby converting these\
    \ into colormaps, which are subsequently projected on the board. \nThe flow pattern\
    \ is visualized as diffusive paint blobs that follow the flow lines. \nThe hydrodynamic\
    \ effects of changing tiles on the board are therefore visualized \nbased on the\
    \ model’s output and projected on the same location as which changes \ntake place.\
    \ Through these choices, we aimed at making the hydrodynamic model \nmore accessible\
    \ and transparent by providing a tangible, easy-to-use interface and \nby enabling\
    \ players to link their actions to the model’s output.\nOn the touchscreen, the\
    \ game shows the Tygron Geodesign Platform, a 3D \nspatial planning modeling tool\
    \ that is also used as a virtual game engine for those \nserious games that have\
    \ a spatial development component (Bekebrede et al., 2015; \nvan Hardeveld et\
    \ al., 2019; Warmerdam et al., 2006). The game interfaces with the \nTygron game\
    \ engine through its API (Tygron, 2018). The inclusion of the engine \nserves\
    \ two purposes. First, the DEM and land use types of the digital board are \n\
    converted to a virtual game world that matches the game board. For example, the\
    \ \nengine shows trees for tiles on the game board that represent the forest land\
    \ use. \nSecond, interactive panels in the engine provide players with the output\
    \ from and \ninformation about all three models.\nWe deliberately developed the\
    \ game in such a way that players are able to fully \ncontrol the interface without\
    \ needing the game’s facilitator. Players change tiles \non the board, switch\
    \ visualizations through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) \ndisplayed on the\
    \ touchscreen and inspect the virtual world as well as open panels \nin the game\
    \ engine. Updating the board state – which involves processing changes \non the\
    \ board, running the models, and updating both the visualizations and infor-\n\
    mation in the Tygron engine – only takes between 15 and 30 seconds, depending\
    \ on \nthe time needed for water levels in the hydrodynamic model to stabilize.\
    \ The update \ntimes are based on a dedicated, portable computer utilizing an\
    \ AMD Ryzen X3700 \ndesktop processor to run the game and models locally. \n122\n\
    management complexity\n5\n5.2.3 \nVirtual River Game\nIn the Virtual River Game,\
    \ players are challenged to manage a 3500 m long deltaic \nstretch of river incorporating\
    \ a navigable main channel that has floodplains and \ndikes on both sides. The\
    \ game scenario reflects a high river discharge as result of \nwhich the floodplains\
    \ are inundated. Three teams, each consisting of one or two \nplayers, play the\
    \ roles of flood manager, nature manager, and financial manager. \nCollectively,\
    \ the players are given a budget and are tasked to improve the flood \nsafety\
    \ status and ecological value of the area. Each team is given additional objec-\n\
    tives as well as special abilities to block implementations of interventions based\
    \ \non real-world stakeholders, legislation, and European Union development targets.\
    \ \nThe flood manager mirrors the Dutch Public Works Authority, which is responsible\
    \ \nfor ensuring and maintaining adequate flood safety levels. The flood manager\
    \ can \nblock interventions if these decrease flood safety levels or if land use\
    \ is changed to a \ntype leading to high hydraulic roughness (reed and brushwood,\
    \ shrubs, forest, and \nmixtype), which reflects the legislative power of the\
    \ Public Works Authority. The \nnature manager represents larger nature management\
    \ organizations such as the \nDutch State Forestry Agency, which own and manage\
    \ a large percentage of the Dutch \nfloodplains and aim to develop their ecological\
    \ value. The nature manager can block \ninterventions if those decrease the area’s\
    \ ecological value. To reflect the common \nview that nature organizations hold\
    \ less power than for example the Dutch Public \nWorks Authority in real world\
    \ decision-making, this ability can only be used once \nduring each game. The\
    \ financial manager represents a combination of the Dutch \nnational government,\
    \ which allocates budget for river projects, and regional govern-\nments, which\
    \ are the commissioners of river projects and responsible for managing \nthe floodplains\
    \ as Natura 2000 areas under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. \nThe financial\
    \ manager can block interventions if those would take more than half of \nthe\
    \ initial budget or if these require expensive land acquisition (buildings and\
    \ agri-\ncultural land), which reflects the interest of governments to pursue\
    \ cost-effective, \nwin-win solutions. If players are part of any of these or\
    \ similar organizations, they \nare assigned a role that is different from their\
    \ regular role to let them experience river \nmanagement from another point of\
    \ view. \nEach game consists of a maximum of four rounds. During each round, players\
    \ \napply one of six interventions: side channel construction, floodplain lowering\
    \ (grad-\ning), floodplain smoothing (changing the floodplain vegetation to lower\
    \ roughness), \nreplacement of groins (alternatively termed ‘wing dikes’ or ‘spur\
    \ dikes’) with longi-\ntudinal training dams, dike relocation, or dike reinforcement.\
    \ Players first discuss \n123\nThe Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to\
    \ collaboratively explore river \n5\nand agree which intervention they wish to\
    \ apply. They subsequently implement the \nchosen intervention by changing tiles\
    \ on the game board while following the inter-\nvention’s rules. During this implementation\
    \ phase, players can continually change \ntiles and collectively evaluate the\
    \ intervention’s effects before agreeing on a final \nimplementation. \nIn-game\
    \ scoring\nIn the Virtual River Game, we included performance indicators on flood\
    \ safety, biodi-\nversity, and budget. Therefore, interventions are evaluated\
    \ on hydrodynamics, ecol-\nogy, and costs, as in the Delft3D FM, BIOSAFE, and\
    \ VRCost models. Each indicator \nhas its own progress bar across a 0-100% score\
    \ range. Minimum (50%), good (65%), \nand excellent (80%) scores are provided\
    \ for both the flood safety and biodiversity \nindicators. We determined these\
    \ scores as a balance between the game’s representa-\ntion of reality and its\
    \ playability (see Harteveld, 2011) that: (1) reflects Dutch river \nmanagement\
    \ practice in terms of performance; and (2) corresponds to the difficulty \nof\
    \ attaining good scores in the game. Players can click each indicator’s progress\
    \ bar \non the touchscreen to see graphics on the effects of interventions on\
    \ that indicator. \nIn addition, separate information panels are available to\
    \ players where they can see \nsimplified scores after each tile change to anticipate\
    \ the effects of interventions. \n The flood safety score is based on the water\
    \ levels along the river axis in \ncomparison to the crest height of the dike\
    \ at each tile location on the board. The \nwater levels can be at or above, just\
    \ below, or well below the dike’s crest height, corre-\nsponding to that location\
    \ being considered unsafe, moderately safe, and substan-\ntially safe, respectively.\
    \ Unsafe, moderately safe, and substantially safe locations each \ncontribute\
    \ to the flood safety score as zero, half, and full score, respectively. Conse-\n\
    quently, the overall flood safety score is 0% when all dike locations are considered\
    \ \nunsafe and 100% when all dike locations are considered substantially safe.\
    \ Flood \nsafety is visualized in the indicator panel as a longitudinal profile\
    \ of the stretch of \nriver that includes initial and current water levels and\
    \ as a top view with each dike \ntile colored red, yellow, or green representing\
    \ unsafe, moderately safe, and substan-\ntially safe, respectively. \nThe biodiversity\
    \ score is based on the potential biodiversity, the sum of the \nscores on the\
    \ seven taxonomic groups, over the whole river reach. This sum is \nconverted\
    \ to a percentage in the 0-100% range for simplicity. We determined the \n0% and\
    \ 100% scores for biodiversity by running a Monte Carlo simulation to find \n\
    the board layouts that result in the lowest and highest potential biodiversity\
    \ scores \nrespectively that can be achieved in the game. In the indicator panel,\
    \ the poten-\ntial biodiversity of the taxonomic groups, the sum, and the corresponding\
    \ score are \n124\nmanagement complexity\n5\nprovided. Furthermore, a bar graph\
    \ shows the scores on the seven taxonomic groups \nfor both the initial and the\
    \ current game board. A second bar graph shows the change \nfor each taxonomic\
    \ group expressed as a percentage. \nThe budget score reflects the remaining budget\
    \ that players have available as a \npercentage of the initial budget that they\
    \ received at the start of a game. The initial \nbudget is therefore equivalent\
    \ to a 100% score. Spending the whole budget results in \na 0% score and spending\
    \ more than the budget results in a negative score. A graph \nshows the budget\
    \ spent per round as well as the remaining budget in the budget \nindicator panel,\
    \ expressed both in Euros and a percentage of the initial budget. In \na second\
    \ graph, the breakdown of the costs incurred per round is shown as stacked \n\
    bars.\nIn-game objectives\nTeams are scored on each indicator separately throughout\
    \ the game. As a collective \nobjective, the players have to achieve the minimum\
    \ score (50%) for both flood safety \nand biodiversity in the four rounds while\
    \ (preferably) staying within the budget. \nCollectively, the teams may decide\
    \ not to play all rounds if they reach the collective \nobjective before the fourth\
    \ round. Additionally, each team is given one main and \ntwo secondary objectives.\
    \ The teams receive the instruction that, in order to win the \ngame, they have\
    \ to reach both the collective objective and their role-specific main \nobjective.\
    \ The role-specific secondary objectives are presented as bonus points that \n\
    they can earn. The flood manager is given the main objective to achieve a good\
    \ flood \nsafety score (65%). The secondary objectives are to achieve an excellent\
    \ flood safety \nscore (80%) and ending the game without any unsafe dike locations.\
    \ The nature \nmanager has the main objective of achieving a the good biodiversity\
    \ score (65%) and \nthe secondary objectives of achieving an excellent biodiversity\
    \ score (80%) and to \nend the game with five or more forest locations within\
    \ the floodplains. The budget \nmanager is tasked to limit spending to the collective\
    \ budget. The secondary objec-\ntives are to achieve good scores for flood safety\
    \ and biodiversity (65%). The collective \nobjective is known to all players.\
    \ Each team is given its main and secondary objec-\ntives at the start of the\
    \ game by blindly drawing one of four role-specific objective \ncards. Players\
    \ do not know that these four cards all list the same main and secondary \nobjectives\
    \ for their team. Players are not told whether or not to share their team’s \n\
    objectives with other players.\n5.3 \nVirtual River Game evaluation\nWe developed\
    \ the Virtual River Game to support stakeholder participation in the \nnew Dutch\
    \ river management paradigm. In this study, we set out to assess the poten-\n\
    125\nThe Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively explore river\
    \ \n5\ntial of the game as a participatory tool guided by the research questions:\
    \ (1) to what \nextent does the game facilitate stakeholders collaboratively exploring\
    \ and experi-\nmenting with river interventions; and (2) to what extent does playing\
    \ the game lead \nto social learning outcomes? The research questions address\
    \ what Aubert et al. (2019) \nrefer to as the process-oriented (how are these\
    \ outcomes achieved) and variance-ori-\nented (what outcomes are achieved) assessment\
    \ of serious games.\nThe first research question focused on the game itself to\
    \ evaluate its ability to \nengage stakeholders in dialogue and activity – a prerequisite\
    \ to stimulating social \nlearning. Following the scope of the game and its interface\
    \ design, we were particu-\nlarly interested in evaluating the extent to which\
    \ the game facilitates both domain \nexperts and non-experts to engage in collaborative\
    \ experimentation with river inter-\nventions. We considered the game to be successful\
    \ as a participatory tool when \nparticipants – regardless of their background\
    \ and expertise – (1) developed a shared \nunderstanding of the problem; (2) developed\
    \ a collaborative strategy to address that \nproblem; (3) engaged in discussions\
    \ on how interventions affect indicators and role \nobjectives; and (4) applied\
    \ and tested various implementations of interventions.\nThe second research question\
    \ focused on evaluating to what extent playing \nthe game led to social learning\
    \ by individual participants. Following the game’s \nscope, we focused on learning\
    \ outcomes related to cognitive and relational learn-\ning (Baird et al., 2014;\
    \ Ensor and Harvey, 2015). Cognitive learning outcomes that \nwere assessed included\
    \ gaining an improved understanding of: (1) the function-\ning of the river system;\
    \ (2) the effects of interventions and their trade-offs; (3) how \nhydrodynamic\
    \ models work and are used in decision-making; and (4) the conflicts \nand opportunities\
    \ for cooperation between the various stakeholder roles. Relational \nlearning\
    \ outcomes that were assessed relate to gaining an improved understanding \nof\
    \ the mind-sets and perspectives of other participants. We considered the game\
    \ to \nbe successful when both domain experts and non-experts achieve cognitive\
    \ or rela-\ntional learning outcomes or both. As experts bring their knowledge\
    \ and experience \nto the game, we expected that they would achieve fewer cognitive\
    \ learning outcomes \nthan non-experts.\nTo address the research questions, we\
    \ organized five sessions playing the Virtual \nRiver Game. In the following subsection,\
    \ we describe the setup of the sessions and \ntheir participants. In Subsection\
    \ 5.3.2, we describe the data collection methods and \nthe data analysis used\
    \ to address both research questions.\n5.3.1 \nSessions and participants\nThe\
    \ description of a session playing the Virtual River Game is provided in Appendix\
    \ \n5.B. We invited both domain experts (professionals working in Dutch river\
    \ manage-\n126\nmanagement complexity\n5\nment) and non-experts (participants\
    \ without river management expertise) to the \nsessions. None of the sessions\
    \ were linked to a real-world river project. This made it \ndifficult to engage\
    \ with non-experts who are also real-world stakeholders in Dutch \nriver management.\
    \ Therefore, we invited design researchers and game designers \nto represent non-expert\
    \ stakeholders. We organized two sessions that included \nonly expert participants\
    \ and three sessions of experts and non-experts (Table 5.2). \nEach session had\
    \ between four and six participants in a total of 26 participants. \nThe length\
    \ of each session, including the explanations and debriefings, was around \nthree\
    \ hours. The actual length of gameplay ranged between 78 and 109 minutes. All\
    \ \nsessions had the same experienced facilitator and a trained observer. We prepared\
    \ \nan initial board (Figure 5.3) as a scenario that we used in every session.\
    \ The scenario \nreflected a stretch of river with a hydrodynamic bottleneck formed\
    \ by narrow flood-\nTable 5.2 Overview of the sessions and participants.\nSession\n\

    \ explore river \n5\nplains, higher floodplain terrain, and vegetation that causes\
    \ high hydraulic rough-\nness, resulting in unsafe water levels upstream from\
    \ the bottleneck. After the second \nsession, we changed one parameter of the\
    \ scenario by lowering the initial budget by \n30% to € 17.5 million because the\
    \ initial budget was found to be too high. Although \nreducing the budget between\
    \ sessions was undesirable, we aimed to stimulate more \ndiscussions that also\
    \ addressed the cost-effectiveness of interventions – one of the \nmain criteria\
    \ in real world decision-making. We chose the 30% reduction as this \naligned\
    \ with the budget spent during the first session.\n5.3.2 \nData collection and\
    \ analysis\nWe applied a multi-method approach to collecting and analyzing both\
    \ quantitative \nand qualitative data. Our approach consisted of: (1) a pre-game\
    \ questionnaire; (2) \nin-game data logging; (3) in-game observations; (4) a post-game\
    \ questionnaire; and \n(5) a post-game debriefing. Before starting the game, the\
    \ participants filled out a \nshort questionnaire stating their age, expertise,\
    \ experience related to river manage-\nment, and experience with serious gaming,\
    \ all so as to separate expert from non-ex-\npert participants. During the game,\
    \ the participants’ decisions and performance \nfor each update were stored in\
    \ a log file. In addition, we observed the participants’ \ndiscussions during\
    \ the game. We used an observation recording form to document \na timeline of\
    \ each session by linking discussions to the three indicators as well as to \n\
    intermediate and final decisions taken in the game. We used this timeline to analyze\
    \ \neach session’s outcomes (e.g. interventions applied, final layout, score progression)\
    \ \nand processes (e.g. discussions, consideration of options, contributions of\
    \ partic-\nipants) in order to address the first research question. Directly after\
    \ playing the \ngame, the participants completed a second questionnaire that focused\
    \ on their over-\nall impressions of the game and the insights gained by playing\
    \ the game. In closed \nquestions, the participants were asked to self-report\
    \ their experiences by rating their \nagreement with statements on a 5-point Likert\
    \ scale that ranged from ‘strongly agree’ \nto ‘strongly disagree’: a common approach\
    \ in game studies (Bekebrede et al., 2018; \nKeijser et al., 2018; Mayer et al.,\
    \ 2013). In one open question, the participants were \nasked to list a maximum\
    \ of three main insights obtained by playing the game. We \ncategorized the open\
    \ question answers in relation to cognitive and relational learn-\ning to determine\
    \ what experts and non-experts identify as the main insights from \nplaying the\
    \ game. We used the data from the completed questionnaires to address \nthe second\
    \ research question. One non-expert participant did not complete the post-\ngame\
    \ questionnaire and was therefore excluded from the results (Ntotal = 25 for the\
    \ \nquestionnaire). To conclude each session, we conducted a debriefing to collectively\
    \ \nreflect on the game activity. The debriefing was set up along the lines proposed\
    \ by \n128\nmanagement complexity\n5\nKriz (2010): six phases to structurally\
    \ reflect on the game activity. To confirm that the \ndiscussions and considerations\
    \ in the game reflect those encountered in practice, we \nexpanded the third phase\
    \ of the debriefing – which includes reflecting on the game’s \nexternal validity\
    \ (van den Hoogen et al., 2014) – in the two expert sessions. Following \ninformed\
    \ consent, we recorded the debriefings to transcribe these for later analysis.\
    \ \nWe used the debriefing data to further interpret the analyses to help address\
    \ both \nresearch questions. In addition, we compared the data to address the\
    \ two research \nquestions with each other to strive for data triangulation.\n\
    5.4 \nResults\n5.4.1 \nCollaborative experimentation with river interventions\
    \ (RQ1)\nThe first research question was to what extent the game facilitates stakeholders\
    \ to \ncollaboratively exploring and experimenting with river interventions. Here,\
    \ we pres-\nent the chosen interventions and indicator scores as the factual game\
    \ output, as well \nas the observations of the in-game discussions about and experimentations\
    \ with \nthose interventions.\nInterventions and scores\nThe choice and implementations\
    \ of interventions during the game sessions showed \nthat good scores (between\
    \ 65% and 79%) for both flood safety and biodiversity can \nbe achieved in several\
    \ ways (Figure 5.4). For flood safety, only the participants in the \nfourth session\
    \ (71%) did not achieve an excellent score (80% or higher). Excellent \nscores\
    \ for biodiversity were not achieved in any session. In all sessions, the partici-\n\
    pants first focused on increasing the flood safety scores, generally spending\
    \ most of \nthe budget during the first two rounds.\nIncreasing the biodiversity\
    \ scores became the focus during the later rounds. \nParticipants in the third\
    \ and fifth sessions used their remaining budget to achieve \ngood biodiversity\
    \ scores (between 65% and 79%), but only after achieving satis-\nfactory flood\
    \ safety scores. During all sessions, participants applied the floodplain \nsmoothing\
    \ intervention to increase their biodiversity scores while at times also opti-\n\
    mizing their flood safety scores. During the second and third sessions, participants\
    \ \nalso chose the side channel construction and replaced groins with longitudinal\
    \ train-\ning dams to increase their biodiversity scores.\nStrategies and discussions\n\
    At the start of each session, participants explored the game scenario by changing\
    \ \nthe board visualizations, inspecting the information on the touchscreen, and\

    \ River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively explore river \n5\ning the\
    \ information from these two sources. Initial discussions focused on establish-\n\
    ing a shared understanding of the flood safety bottleneck and on how flood safety\
    \ \ncould be improved. During the mixed sessions, expert participants were observed\
    \ \ntaking prominent roles in these early discussions. These experts supplemented\
    \ the \nin-game information by explaining what they saw as problems, for example\
    \ that the \nbottleneck caused higher water levels upstream, and suggested what\
    \ could be done \nto improve the indicator scores. Non-experts initially followed\
    \ their lead but then \nstarted to make their own suggestions as the games progressed.\
    \ During the sessions \nthat included only professionals, experts who regularly\
    \ work with hydrodynamic \nmodels were similarly observed to take more prominent\
    \ roles at the start of the \ngame. The discussions during these sessions moved\
    \ more quickly from identifying \nthe bottleneck to possible interventions than\
    \ in the mixed sessions. During these \ndiscussions, flood safety specialists\
    \ were observed to start the games as if they were \nin their real-world roles,\
    \ even though they had not been assigned to the flood safety \nmanager team. Game\
    \ discussions during the early rounds did include how tackling \nthe flood safety\
    \ bottleneck could simultaneously improve biodiversity without the \ncosts of\
    \ interventions rising unacceptably. However, no change in general direction \n\
    of these discussions was observed as a result of lowering the budget after the\
    \ second \nsession.\nAfter establishing a shared understanding of the problem,\
    \ the discussions \nduring all sessions focused on deciding which intervention\
    \ to implement in the \nfirst round. In no session did the participants develop\
    \ a collaborative strategy at the \nstart of the game. During the sessions, the\
    \ participants were observed to plan ahead \nby discussing how the intervention\
    \ they were implementing could be made more \neffective by applying a different\
    \ intervention in the next round. Experts continued \nto supplement the in-game\
    \ information, for example by explaining that changing \nland use to a type with\
    \ high hydraulic roughness to increase biodiversity (e.g. to \na forest) is best\
    \ done at locations where there is a low flow velocity (e.g. next to a \ndike)\
    \ to limit its effect on flood safety. Discussions during the later stages of\
    \ the \ngame featured more bargaining between the teams, each seeking to pursue\
    \ their \nmain and secondary objectives. For example, discussions during the third\
    \ and fifth \nsessions included teams agreeing on the choice of intervention in\
    \ one round only if \nthe other teams agreed beforehand on the intervention to\
    \ be made in the subsequent \nround. During these bargaining discussions, participants\
    \ started to share their team \nobjectives. Only in the fifth session did the\
    \ participants share their team objectives \nat the start of the game to establish\
    \ their own common objectives, guided mostly \nby one expert participant who advocated\
    \ forgetting about the politics. No notable \n132\nmanagement complexity\n5\n\
    differences in late-game discussions were observed between the expert and mixed\
    \ \nsessions. Non-experts were as active in proposing implementations of interventions\
    \ \nas experts were and their suggestions were also applied on the board. In the\
    \ three \nsessions after reducing the budget, the costs of interventions were\
    \ emphasized more \nduring the late-game discussions, in particular by the budget\
    \ manager teams. \nDuring the debriefings, participants confirmed that they did\
    \ not have a collec-\ntive strategy for the game, but that it felt natural to\
    \ them to plan ahead while testing \nimplementations of interventions. Additionally,\
    \ participants in the second, third, \nand fifth sessions explicitly indicated\
    \ that it seemed logical to them to start with the \nmost drastic intervention\
    \ and to subsequently optimize from there. Before asking \nabout the connection\
    \ of the game activity to reality during the third session (expert \nsession),\
    \ the following discussion took place:\nExpert A: “… and that [the game] more\
    \ or less reflects how things work in real-\nity. I am working together with Expert\
    \ D on an area, in which we have the same \ntype of discussions.”\nExpert B: “I\
    \ really liked that you could quickly update and inspect the results. \nLike,\
    \ how does this work out? How far are we now? That is very useful. The risk \n\
    is that you start micro-managing the environment, but yeah…”\nExpert C: “But that\
    \ is also realistic.”\nExpert B: “Yes, true.”\nExpert D: “[The game] feels very\
    \ realistic, because the discussions we were \nhaving, about the board where we\
    \ were working with, those are the same discus-\nsions you have in practice and\
    \ the advantage is that you can quickly update the \nsituation and inspect the\
    \ effects, so you really get a feel of what the interven-\ntions do.”\nThe discussion\
    \ illustrates that these experts found that using the board to apply \ninterventions\
    \ felt sufficiently realistic and elicited discussions similar to those occur-\n\
    ring in practice. Experts in other sessions provided feedback that supported these\
    \ \nfindings during the debriefings and in written statements made in the post-game\
    \ \nquestionnaire. Experts in the first, third, and fifth sessions did mention\
    \ that they \nmissed a role that directly represents the interest of agriculture\
    \ in the game. As a \nresult, although facing a financial penalty for the compulsory\
    \ purchase of land, they \nmentioned that they could convert agricultural land\
    \ into other land use types with-\nout the emotional discussions associated with\
    \ the compulsory purchase of land by \nthe government that would occur in real\
    \ life.\n133\nThe Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively explore\
    \ river \n5\nExperimentation approach\nIn all sessions, participants used the\
    \ opportunity to experiment with interventions. \nIn sessions 1 to 4, the participants\
    \ applied and evaluated between 17 and 20 imple-\nmentations of interventions\
    \ while playing the game (Figure 5.4). The number of \napplied interventions in\
    \ the fifth session was notably lower, which was probably \ncaused by internet\
    \ problems during the session that resulted in a loss of time to \nplay the game.\
    \ To help propose interventions, participants used the board as a map \nto suggest\
    \ interventions by hand gestures and used the information both from the \nvisualizations\
    \ as well as on the touchscreen to formulate arguments. Participants \nexperimented\
    \ with interventions both to test implementations at several locations, \ne.g.\
    \ constructing a side channel on the other side of the main channel (comparison),\
    \ \nand to improve the implementation at a chosen location (optimization). Especially\
    \ \nthe floodplain smoothing intervention led to experimentation, with participants\
    \ in \nthe second and third sessions trying eight and eleven implementations,\
    \ respectively. \nIn these experimentations, non-experts were observed to realize\
    \ that lowering the \nhydraulic roughness from locations with higher water flow\
    \ velocity is effective in \nincreasing the flood safety score. Furthermore, participants\
    \ were observed to realize, \nthrough experimentation, that changing a production\
    \ meadow (intensively managed \ngrassland) to a more natural setting (less managed)\
    \ is most effective at increasing \nbiodiversity.\nFigure 5.5 Overall impressions\

    5\n5.4.2 \nExperience and social learning outcomes (RQ2)\nThe second research\
    \ question was: to what extent does playing the game lead to \nsocial learning\
    \ outcomes? Here, we describe the participants’ overall impression on \nthe game\
    \ and their self-reported learning outcomes with respect to both cognitive \n\
    and relational learning. \nThe questionnaire results indicate that the game was\
    \ well received by both \ndomain experts and non-experts (Figure 5.5). Most participants\
    \ indicated that the \ngame’s goal was clear and that they enjoyed playing the\
    \ game. During the debrief-\nings, participants also frequently mentioned that\
    \ they regarded the game as a fun \nactivity.\nRegarding the learning outcomes,\
    \ the questionnaire results indicate that \nparticipants gained insights into\
    \ both cognitive and relational learning (Figure 5.6). \nCompared to experts,\
    \ an equal or higher percentage of the non-expert participants \ngave answers\
    \ to the statements that showed strong agreement. Below, we discuss the \nresults\
    \ for experts and non-experts separately.\nFigure 5.6 shows that non-experts mostly\
    \ agreed or strongly agreed with the \ntwelve statements. Non-experts agreed most\
    \ with statements 11 and 12 (µ = 4.40 and \n4.60 respectively) related to relational\
    \ learning. In relation to cognitive learning, \nnon-experts agreed most with\
    \ statements 1 and 10 (both µ = 4.20). Only on state-\nment 4 (µ = 3.40) about\
    \ the costs of interventions did two non-experts give answers \nthat showed strong\
    \ disagreement. These participants explained that they had diffi-\nculty interpreting\
    \ information about costs during the game. In the open question, \nnon-experts\
    \ most frequently mentioned insights related to the functioning of the \nriver\
    \ system (10) and interventions and trade-offs (6) categories, both associated\
    \ \nwith cognitive learning. Most of these insights were broadly formulated, such\
    \ as “the \nrelation between flow velocity and flood safety” and “trade-offs between\
    \ decisions”. \nExperts gave more mixed responses to the statements than non-experts.\
    \ Experts \nagreed most strongly with statement 5 (µ = 3.87) related to the trade-offs\
    \ between \ninterventions. They also rated statements 11 and 12 (µ = 3.67 and\
    \ 3.80 respectively) \non relational learning positively, with most experts only\
    \ agreeing but a few strongly \nagreeing. Statements 6 and 7 (µ = 2.67 and 2.93\
    \ respectively) on hydrodynamic \nmodels were rated poorly, with more experts\
    \ disagreeing than agreeing with both \nstatements. This was not an unexpected\
    \ result as experts regularly work with these \nmodels anyway. In the open question,\
    \ experts most frequently mentioned insights \nrelated to interventions and trade-offs\
    \ (8) and player perspectives (7), associated \nwith cognitive learning and relational\
    \ learning, respectively. On the interventions \nand trade-offs, insights were\
    \ formulated more specifically than by non-experts, such \nas “insight into the\
    \ ratio of costs of different interventions” and “more insights into \n135\nThe\

    \ that they gained such insights as a result of \nplaying a role different from\

    \ on what helped them \nto obtain their main insights and mentioned the game’s\
    \ feedback (all sessions), the \nshared exploration and experimentation with interventions\
    \ (sessions 2, 3, 4 and 5), \nexplanations from other participants (sessions 1,\
    \ 2, 4 and 5), and finding it easier \nto interpret information from the game\
    \ board than from a screen (session 5). In all \nthree mixed sessions, non-experts\
    \ explicitly pointed out that the experts had helped \nthem to understand the\
    \ problem as well as to predict the consequences of inter-\nventions. Experts\
    \ in turn indicated that collaborative experimentation with inter-\nventions –\
    \ in combination with the game’s feedback – helped them to explain river \nmanagement\
    \ principles to non-experts.\n5.5 \nDiscussion\nIn this section, we first reflect\
    \ on the potential value of the Virtual River Game as \na participatory tool based\
    \ on the study’s results. Next, we discuss the design of the \ngame and its interface.\
    \ We end the section by reflecting on the study and outlining \nits limitations.\n\
    5.5.1 \nGame as a participatory tool\nThe results of the sessions indicate that\
    \ the game was successful at engaging both \ndomain experts and non-experts in\
    \ collaboratively exploring and experimenting with \nriver interventions. In all\
    \ sessions, the participants developed a shared understand-\ning of the problem.\
    \ To address the problem, they applied and tested various imple-\nmentations of\
    \ interventions. Although the participants did not develop a collective \nstrategy\
    \ from the start, they did collaboratively plan ahead while applying inter-\n\
    ventions, discussing how future interventions could further improve the indicator\
    \ \nscores and contribute to achieving the various objectives. Experts and non-experts\
    \ \nwere both active in the games’ discussions, with experts taking more of a\
    \ leading \nrole, especially at the start of the games. Furthermore, experts noted\
    \ that the discus-\nsions and considerations that they had during the game reflect\
    \ well those found in \nreal-world projects.\nThe results further indicate that\
    \ the Virtual River Game stimulated social learn-\ning for both experts (N = 15)\
    \ and non-experts (N = 10). Considering the game’s scope \nand the operationalization\
    \ of social learning, we looked specifically at cognitive \nlearning (acquiring\
    \ new or restructuring existing knowledge) and relational learn-\ning (increasing\
    \ the understanding of the mind-set and perspectives of others) (Baird \n137\n\
    The Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively explore river \n\
    5\net al., 2014; Ensor and Harvey, 2015). With only a few exceptions, non-experts\
    \ rated \nall statements in relation to the game’s learning outcomes positively.\
    \ According to \ntheir comments, the main insights that non-experts emphasized\
    \ were almost exclu-\nsively associated with cognitive learning. However, experts\
    \ rated the statements in a \nmore mixed way, with some statements rated positively\
    \ but some statements associ-\nated with cognitive learning neutrally to negatively.\
    \ We expected that experts would \nreport less cognitive learning given their\
    \ background knowledge. The statements on \nrelational learning were rated positively\
    \ by experts, which was also reflected in their \nreported main insights. Taken\
    \ together, we conclude that both domain experts and \nnon-experts learned by\
    \ playing the game. However, the extent to which they learned \nand emphasis they\
    \ placed on it varied. The game appears to be particularly valuable \nas a participatory\
    \ tool to introduce non-expert stakeholders to river management \nin the Netherlands.\
    \ Keijser et al. (2018) reported similar results from their game on \nmarine spatial\
    \ planning, showing that their game worked well as an introductory \ngame to engage\
    \ non-experts on the topic.\nOn learning more generally, our results are in line\
    \ with evaluations of other \nserious games (see e.g. reviews by Aubert et al.,\
    \ 2018; den Haan and van der Voort, \n2018; Flood et al., 2018), which have shown\
    \ that serious games are an effective way \nof increasing the understanding of\
    \ physical systems (Becu et al., 2017; Carson et al., \n2018; Keijser et al.,\
    \ 2018), of raising awareness (Onencan and van de Walle, 2018; \nStefanska et\
    \ al., 2011; van Pelt et al., 2015), and of increasing the understanding of \n\
    alternative views and perspectives (Douven et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2018; Souchère\
    \ et \nal., 2010). Combining the results on collaborative exploration and learning,\
    \ this study \noffers further evidence that serious games are effective ways of\
    \ improving social \nlearning (Hofstede et al., 2010; Medema et al., 2016; Savic\
    \ et al., 2016).\n5.5.2 \nGame and interface design\nSerious games are increasingly\
    \ explored as learning-based interventions in envi-\nronmental management (Aubert\
    \ et al., 2019; Flood et al., 2018; Rodela et al., 2019). \nIn terms of the design\
    \ of such games, this work contributes to the growing body of \nliterature by\
    \ proposing a new, hybrid interface design concept: the bidirectional \ncoupling\
    \ of a physical game board to computer models. Whereas other serious games \n\
    on environmental management tend to use simplified, custom computer models that\
    \ \nare location-specific (e.g. Craven et al., 2017; Valkering et al., 2013),\
    \ our focus was on \ncreating a simplified – yet realistic – 3D representation\
    \ of a typical stretch of a Dutch \nriver in combination with models currently\
    \ used in practice. Designing serious \ngames always requires some form of simplification\
    \ to strike a good balance between \nan accurate representation of reality, the\
    \ playability of reality, and the meaning of the \n138\nmanagement complexity\n\
    5\ngame (Harteveld, 2011). In our approach, the biggest simplification of the\
    \ physical \nreality was not in the models, but in the fact that the board uses\
    \ a fixed, hexagonal \ngrid. We applied this simplification mainly to increase\
    \ playability; the fixed number \nand shape of the tiles reduces the level of\
    \ detail in relation to a real stretch of river \nand provides a manageable structure\
    \ by limiting the number of possible arrange-\nments in the game. The sessions\
    \ showed that the game board design facilitated \nparticipants working together\
    \ and, as an interface, enabled especially non-experts \nto work with models currently\
    \ used in practice. Moreover, experts determined that \nthe game triggered discussions\
    \ that also occur in practice. Therefore, simplifying a \nriver stretch to a hexagonal\
    \ grid proved to be a suitable approach to balancing a good \nrepresentation of\
    \ reality with playability. Increasing the level of detail in the game \ncould\
    \ be further explored, but is not necessary to facilitate the collaborative explo-\n\
    ration of and experimentation with river interventions.\nIn addition to serving\
    \ its specific purpose, the hybrid interface offers qualities \nthat we see as\
    \ beneficial to facilitating stakeholder participation in environmental \nmanagement\
    \ and to improving social learning. Serious games have been developed \nas board\
    \ games (Hertzog et al., 2014; Keijser et al., 2018; Speelman et al., 2014), as\
    \ \ndigital games (Ayadi et al., 2014; Carson et al., 2018; Craven et al., 2017;\
    \ Hill et al., \n2014), and as hybrid games combining elements of board and digital\
    \ games (Cleland \net al., 2012; Magnuszewski et al., 2018; Valkering et al.,\
    \ 2013; van der Wal et al., 2016). \nSuch games have a common feature that participants\
    \ are provided with an experi-\nmentation environment in which they can collaboratively\
    \ and safely explore both \nthe techno-physical and socio-political complexity\
    \ of an environmental system. \nWith the hybrid interface design of the Virtual\
    \ River Game, we combined three \nqualities that are separately found in board\
    \ and computer games. These qualities \nare described below.\nFirst, the hybrid\
    \ interface provides participants with a physical, tangible object \nto engage\
    \ with in shared exploration. Through the game board and touchscreen, \ncontrol\
    \ of the game is shared and not limited to a facilitator or one participant \n\
    controlling an input device. Participants engage in discussions by moving game\
    \ \ntiles or pointing to locations on the game board, making their views explicit\
    \ to other \nparticipants (Stanton et al., 2001; Suzuki and Kato, 1995). \nSecond,\
    \ as an interface, the game board appeared to lower the threshold for \nparticipating\
    \ while allowing participants to collaboratively work with computer \nmodels by\
    \ using tangible objects, removing the need to have specific expertise in \nusing\
    \ these models. Computer games have been developed as interaction layers \nto\
    \ models based on a GUI (Chew et al., 2013; Craven et al., 2017; van Hardeveld\
    \ \net al., 2019), but without the use of tangible objects as a direct source\
    \ of input. In \n139\nThe Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively\
    \ explore river \n5\nturn, games have been developed that use a non-digital board\
    \ in combination with \ncomputer models (Magnuszewski et al., 2018; Stefanska\
    \ et al., 2011), but without \neither a direct connection to the models or the\
    \ models’ output being visualized on \nthe board. In the Virtual River Game, the\
    \ bidirectional link between the board and \nmodels provides participants with\
    \ visualizations of their actions at the same location \nas where they made them.\
    \ \nThird, for a serious game in general, being able to experiment with interven-\n\
    tions is a valuable way of triggering learning (Becu et al., 2017; Ferrero et\
    \ al., 2018). \nMultiplayer serious games that focus on managing a spatial area\
    \ generally include \ninterventions as binary options that can be turned on or\
    \ off for defined locations \n(Carson et al., 2018; Craven et al., 2017; Rusca\
    \ et al., 2012). This can include a few \noptions of the same interventions at\
    \ the same locations, such as small, medium, and \nlarge versions (Onencan et\
    \ al., 2016; Savic et al., 2016; Valkering et al., 2013). In the \nVirtual River\
    \ Game, participants determine the location, direction, shape, and size \nof interventions\
    \ by replacing tiles on the board while following rules defined outside \nthe\
    \ software. Therefore, the interface increases the experimentation potential by\
    \ \nincluding the design of interventions rather than choosing predefined interven-\n\
    tion options. In serious games, similar functionality is found in tile-based computer\
    \ \ngames (e.g. Becu et al., 2017; Chew et al., 2013), but not in combination\
    \ with tangi-\nble tiles. This type of functionality is also found in planning\
    \ support systems in \nwhich participants can draw and apply interventions on\
    \ a tabletop surface (see e.g. \nLeskens et al., 2014; Vonk and Ligtenberg, 2010).\
    \ To summarize, the hybrid interface \ncombines the strengths of board games (accessibility,\
    \ tangibility) with the power and \nflexibility of computer games (modeling, visualizations)\
    \ which, in combination, are \nbeneficial to supporting stakeholder participation\
    \ and improving social learning.\n5.5.3 \nReflection and limitations \nIn all\
    \ sessions, the participants focused mainly on increasing the flood safety score\
    \ \nin the early game rounds and only focused on the biodiversity score during\
    \ later \nrounds. This approach is consistent with current Dutch river management\
    \ practice \nin which improving flood safety is the primary objective (see e.g.\
    \ Deltaprogramma, \n2019). However, some choices in the Virtual River Game’s design\
    \ and the choice of \nparticipants invited to the sessions may have influenced\
    \ the participants’ focus on \nimproving their flood safety scores. Although no\
    \ distinction between primary and \nsecondary objectives is made in the game,\
    \ the in-game interventions are based on \ninterventions implemented in reality\
    \ that do have the improvement of flood safety \nas the primary objective. The\
    \ sessions’ starting conditions may have further nudged \nparticipants to first\
    \ focus on the flood safety indicator as its initial score (29%) was \n140\nmanagement\
    \ complexity\n5\nlower than the biodiversity score (47%). In addition, some flood\
    \ safety specialists \nwere observed to approach the game as if they were initially\
    \ in their real-world roles. \nBesides these possible influences on the results,\
    \ the study has two other limi-\ntations. In general, a serious game aims to provide\
    \ participants with a safe space to \nexperiment, to take on another role, and\
    \ to defend positions that they may not take \nin reality (de Caluwé et al., 2012;\
    \ Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer, 2009). The results of \nthis study suggest that\
    \ the game provides this sense of safety as participants experi-\nmented with\
    \ interventions to pursue the objectives of their assigned role. In particu-\n\
    lar, domain experts were observed to propose and experiment with interventions\
    \ \nthat ran counter to objectives that they would normally pursue in their real-world\
    \ \nroles. However, the sessions were organized outside of a real-world policy-making\
    \ \nsetting. Therefore, the first limitation of the study is that we do not know\
    \ if the game \nwould also establish the same sense of safety in experimenting\
    \ with interventions \nand defending positions of other stakeholder roles when\
    \ played in the context of a \nreal-world river project. This needs to be explored\
    \ in future research. Before the game \nis used in a real river project, the roles\
    \ in the game must be reviewed. In particular, \nbased on the results of this\
    \ study, adding an additional role that actively defends the \ninterests of the\
    \ agricultural sector must be considered. This role was initially left out \n\
    to limit the game’s complexity. In order not to increase the game’s complexity,\
    \ an \nalternative could be to consider the current game as an introductory level\
    \ and add \na second game level with additional objectives, indicators, roles,\
    \ and interventions.\nThe second limitation lies in the limited number of sessions\
    \ and participants. \nConducting studies on serious games is time-consuming, both\
    \ for the participants \nand for the researchers. As a result, the number of expert\
    \ and non-expert partic-\nipants was too low to be able to draw statistically\
    \ significant conclusions. Conse-\nquently, we looked at these two groups separately\
    \ and have not made comparisons \nbetween the learning outcomes of experts and\
    \ non-experts. However, despite the \nlimitations, the results indicate that the\
    \ game may well be useful as a tool to help \nsupport stakeholder participation\
    \ in Dutch river management.\n5.6 \nConclusion\nIn this paper, we presented the\
    \ design of the Virtual River Game and investigated \nits potential value as a\
    \ participatory tool in Dutch river management. Based on the \nresults of five\
    \ sessions, we showed that the game was successful in: (1) facilitating \ndomain\
    \ experts and non-experts to collaboratively experiment with river interven-\n\
    tions that are commonly applied in the Netherlands and to elicit discussions similar\
    \ \nto those that occur in real-world river projects; and (2) establishing social\
    \ learn-\ning outcomes as both experts and non-experts indicated that they had\
    \ learned by \n141\nThe Virtual River Game: Gaming using models to collaboratively\
    \ explore river \n5\nplaying the game. Through self-reporting, non-experts indicated\
    \ that most gained \ninsights into the game’s learning objectives and emphasized\
    \ their learning about \nthe functioning of the river system and about river interventions\
    \ and their inevita-\nble trade-offs. Experts, in turn, reported more mixed results\
    \ regarding the learning \nobjectives and emphasized learning about river interventions\
    \ and their inevitable \ntrade-offs, as well as about the views and perspectives\
    \ of other participants. As a \nparticipatory tool, we conclude that the substantial\
    \ value of the game lies in intro-\nducing non-expert stakeholders to Dutch river\
    \ management.\nAppendix 5.A\nLand use options in the game and the translation\

    \ welcomes the participants and provides an overview of the \nsession.\n2. \n\
    The participants fill in the pre-game questionnaire.\n3. \nThe facilitator briefs\
    \ the participants on the game. The facilitator explains the \nscope of the game,\
    \ the game indicators, and models behind these, the collab-\norative objective,\
    \ the rules, and how the game interface works.\n4. \nThe participants engage in\
    \ a trial round, in which they select one intervention \nand implement it by making\
    \ changes on the board to familiarize themselves \nwith the game’s interface.\n\
    5. \nAfter the trial round, the participants take a short break, during which\
    \ the facil-\nitator resets the game system and rearranges the board to the game\
    \ scenario. \n6. \nBefore starting the game, the facilitator assigns the participants\
    \ to their roles in \nthe game and lets them draw their objective cards. The facilitator\
    \ explains the \nroles to all the participants, including their abilities to block\
    \ the implementa-\ntion of interventions.\n7. \nThe game starts, for a maximum\
    \ of four game rounds. During each round, the \nparticipants first discuss and\
    \ decide which intervention they want to apply \nusing any and all information\
    \ available to them*. If no consensus is reached, \nparticipants vote on the intervention\
    \ to apply, with each role having one vote.\n8. \nAs a second part of the round,\
    \ participants implement the chosen intervention. \nThey discuss and make changes\
    \ on the board based on the intervention’s rules. \nFor example, to relocate a\
    \ dike, participants move dike tiles further away from \nthe main channel, enlarging\
    \ the floodplains, in such a way that all dike tiles \non that side of the river\
    \ remain connected (i.e. no gaps are allowed). Partici-\npants are able to continuously\
    \ make changes on the board and update the game \nsystem to inspect the intervention’s\
    \ effects on the indicators*. The participants \ncan use their assigned role’s\
    \ abilities to block the intervention during this step.\n9. \nThe participants\
    \ end the round by finalizing the implementation of the inter-\nvention. Preferably,\
    \ the participants decide through consensus that they are \nsatisfied with the\
    \ intervention’s implementation*. If no consensus is reached, \nparticipants vote\
    \ on finalizing the implementation, with each role again having \none vote. No\
    \ implementation may be finalized under a legitimate use of an \nability to block\
    \ the intervention. Steps 7 to 9 are repeated until the fourth \nround finishes\
    \ or sooner if the participants are satisfied with their results before \nreaching\
    \ the fourth round.\n144\nmanagement complexity\n5\n10. \nDirectly after finishing\
    \ the game, participants fill in the post-game \nquestionnaire.\n11. \nTo conclude\
    \ the session, the participants collectively reflect on the game activ-\nity in\
    \ the debriefing, moderated by the facilitator.  \n* During all stages of a game\
    \ round, the participants themselves are in charge of deciding, \ntesting and\
    \ implementing interventions. Only if participants seem stuck in any phase of\
    \ the \nround does the facilitator pose a question or push for a decision. Otherwise,\
    \ the facilitator \nstays mostly passive apart from making sure that the game\
    \ rules are followed. The facilitator \nis available at all times to answer participants’\
    \ questions, but does not advise or tell players \nwhat to do or not do.\nChapter\
    \ 6\nDiscussion\n146\n6\nIn this thesis, we developed the Virtual River Game,\
    \ a serious game on Dutch river \nmanagement. We developed the game as a case\
    \ study to explore how a human \ncentered design of serious games contributes\
    \ to foster exploring complexity, facil-\nitating stakeholder participation and\
    \ stimulating social learning in environmental \nmanagement. In this chapter,\
    \ we discuss both the Virtual River Game case study as \nwell as its implications\
    \ towards the thesis’ aim. To do so, we first discuss the main \ncontributions\
    \ of the thesis. Next, we reflect on the overall research, on conducting \nthe\
    \ research as part of the RiverCare program and on the research’s limitations.\
    \ We \nend with brief concluding remarks.\n147\nDiscussion\n6\n6.1 \nMain contributions\n\
    We proposed that applying a human centered design approach to designing the \n\
    Virtual River Game may enrich its design and enhance its ability to foster explor-\n\
    ing complexity, facilitating stakeholder participation and stimulate social learn-\n\
    ing. We researched and developed an approach to evaluate the Virtual River Game’s\
    \ \nsocial learning outcomes and showed that the game was successful in facilitating\
    \ the \ncollaborative exploration of complexity and to stimulate social learning\
    \ (Chapters 3 \nand 5). As a whole, the Virtual River Game case study provides\
    \ further proof of the \neffectiveness to use games to stimulate social learning\
    \ in environmental manage-\nment to the existing literature (see e.g. Aubert et\
    \ al., 2018; Edwards et al., 2019; Flood \net al., 2018; Marini et al., 2018;\
    \ Medema et al., 2016; Savic et al., 2016). \nBelow, we discuss the four main\
    \ contributions of this thesis in regard to the \ndesign of serious games to collaboratively\
    \ explore complexity. These contributions \nare: (1) applying a human centered\
    \ design process to the design of serious games; (2) \ndeveloping a novel interface\
    \ design that uses a physical game board to make envi-\nronmental models accessible\
    \ and transparent; (3) adding the ability to experiment \nwith the design of interventions\
    \ as a game mechanic over selecting predefined inter-\nventions; and (4) creating\
    \ a platform through which the Virtual River Game can be \ncustomized and new\
    \ serious games with a spatial component can be developed. We \ndiscuss each contribution\
    \ and place it in context to existing literature. \n6.1.1 \nHuman centered design\
    \ process\nThe use of serious games in environmental management is receiving increased\
    \ atten-\ntion in environmental management (Aubert et al., 2018; Edwards et al.,\
    \ 2019; Flood et \nal., 2018; Marini et al., 2018; Medema et al., 2016; Savic\
    \ et al., 2016). Although serious \ngames have been successfully designed and\
    \ applied in environmental management, \nthe interest in serious games has mostly\
    \ been driven by advances in computational \npower and in developments in the\
    \ entertainment gaming industry (Aubert et al., \n2018; Bekebrede, 2010; Mayer,\
    \ 2009). Recently, scholars have advocated to consider \nthe stakeholders, the\
    \ policy context and the (social) processes of the problem at hand \nas the driving\
    \ force to design serious games rather than technical aspects (Aubert et \nal.,\
    \ 2019; Rodela et al., 2019). Taking the stakeholder needs and wishes as a design’s\
    \ \npoint of departure places emphasis on prospective users and context of use\
    \ and \nshould therefore lead to game designs that cater to the their actual needs.\
    \ Failure \nto take the prospective users into account in the design of serious\
    \ games may lead \nto limited adoption in practice, as has happened with decision\
    \ support systems \n148\n6\n(Borowski and Hare, 2007; Brugnach et al., 2007; McIntosh\
    \ et al., 2011; McIntosh et \nal., 2007; Vonk et al., 2005). \nThe application\
    \ of serious games in environmental management is generally \nassociated with\
    \ facilitating stakeholder participation and supporting decision-mak-\ning, e.g.\
    \ by exploring complexity and stimulating social learning (Furber et al., 2018;\
    \ \nMarini et al., 2018; Savic et al., 2016). Such associations imply expectations\
    \ that seri-\nous games provide meaning and value to the stakeholders and the\
    \ decision-making \nprocess (Aubert et al., 2019; Rodela et al., 2019). If we\
    \ are to meet the expectations \naround serious games in environmental management,\
    \ game designers therefore \nneed to understand what that meaning and value is\
    \ that their games offer to stake-\nholders. In our view, it is therefore imperative\
    \ that game designers gain understand-\ning of the actual needs and desires of\
    \ stakeholders and involve stakeholders in a \ngame’s design process.\nCore of\
    \ the human centered design philosophy is acknowledging the use \nrelated expertise\
    \ of prospective users and recognizing that prospective users should \ntherefore\
    \ be involved in a product’s design process in order to develop a product that\
    \ \nmeets their needs and wishes (Kujala, 2003; Sanders, 2002; Sanders and Stappers,\
    \ \n2008). To design the Virtual River Game, we gradually increased our understand-\n\
    ing of the real needs and desires by facilitating stakeholder involvement. Explicitly,\
    \ \nthe interviews enabled us to gain an initial understanding the needs and desires\
    \ of \nstakeholders (Chapter 2) and the iteratively developed prototypes facilitated\
    \ stake-\nholder involvement to further increase that understanding (Chapter 4).\
    \ Implicitly, \nunderstanding the stakeholder needs and desires went beyond the\
    \ formal studies \nand was also shaped by having one-on-one conversations, reading\
    \ articles and visit-\ning conferences. We critically reflected on the game’s\
    \ design based on the evolving \nunderstanding of needs and desires throughout\
    \ the design process. As a result, we \nexplored new avenues for the game’s design\
    \ as we increasingly understood how the \ngame could fulfill the needs and desires\
    \ of stakeholders. Only through the involve-\nment of stakeholders did we understand\
    \ that hydrodynamic models, which are used \nin Dutch river management to substantiate\
    \ decision-making, are perceived as black \nboxes to some (Chapter 4). In other\
    \ words, without facilitating the involvement \nof stakeholders in the design\
    \ process, we would have likely not realized or fully \nunderstood the stakeholders’\
    \ need to make hydrodynamic models more accessi-\nble and transparent. Consequently,\
    \ without critically reflecting on if and how the \ngame’s design met the stakeholders’\
    \ needs and desires, we would have likely not \nlooked beyond designing a computer\
    \ game nor explored new interaction designs. To \nconclude, by developing the\
    \ Virtual River Game, we showed how a human centered \n149\nDiscussion\n6\ndesign\
    \ approach can lead to more in depth identification of the meaning and value \n\
    a serious game can offer to stakeholders.\n6.1.2 \nMaking models accessible and\
    \ transparent\nModels and model-based tools are used in environmental management\
    \ to predict \neffects of interventions and thereby support decision-making (Ascough\
    \ II et al., \n2008; Liu et al., 2008; Schmolke et al., 2010). For example, hydrodynamic\
    \ models \nare used in Dutch river management to anticipate the effects of interventions\
    \ to the \nwater levels in the river for specific discharges (Berends et al.,\
    \ 2019; Straatsma and \nKleinhans, 2018; van Vuren et al., 2005). As discussed\
    \ in the previous subsection, \nwe set out to make such models accessible in the\
    \ game and to increase their trans-\nparency. In general, serious games are recognized\
    \ as a method to enable stakehold-\ners to interact with models (Bots and van\
    \ Daalen, 2007; Mayer, 2009; Voinov et al., \n2016). Therefore, we first looked\
    \ at other water and river management related seri-\nous games as a source of\
    \ inspiration. Some games include an interaction layer to a \nhydrodynamic (meta)\
    \ model based on a graphical user interface and provide insights \ninto effects\
    \ based on the model (Becu et al., 2017; Craven et al., 2017; Douven et al., \n\
    2014; Valkering et al., 2013). Other serious games that include water related\
    \ computer \nmodels also use a graphical user interface as an interaction layer\
    \ (Chew et al., 2013; \nHill et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2018; Learmonth et al.,\
    \ 2011; Onencan and van de Walle, \n2018; Rusca et al., 2012). Exception to this\
    \ approach are Stefanska et al. (2011) and \nMagnuszewski et al. (2018), who designed\
    \ a game board that players use to provide \ninput to models. The interface to\
    \ the models in their implementation was however \ncontrolled by a facilitator\
    \ who processed the player decisions. Although all these \napproaches provide\
    \ stakeholder with an interaction layer to computer models, these \ndo not show\
    \ how the models function or calculate effects. In other words, something \ngoes\
    \ in and something comes out. To make a model truly transparent requires that\
    \ \nplayers are able to experience how the input to a model is related to its\
    \ output.\nWe therefore looked beyond serious games to make a hydrodynamic model\
    \ \naccessible and transparent (Chapter 4). We found inspiration in the SandBox-FM\
    \ \n(Ottevanger et al., 2017), a tangible user interface to the Delft3D Flexible\
    \ Mesh hydro-\ndynamic model developed by Deltares. Tangible interaction is rooted\
    \ in linking \nphysical forms to digital information (Hornecker and Buur, 2006;\
    \ Ishii, 2008). Simi-\nlar tangible user interfaces as the SandBox-FM have been\
    \ used in connection with \nenvironmental models before (Piper et al., 2002; Reed\
    \ et al., 2016). In the Sand-\nBox-FM, users shape a literal sandbox as the geometry\
    \ of, for example, a river bed. \nThe geometry of the sand is turned into a digital\
    \ elevation model by a Kinect that can \nbe used by the hydrodynamic model. The\
    \ model subsequently returns the water flow \n150\n6\npattern and uses the pattern\
    \ to project and visualize how water would flow in the \nriver geometry on the\
    \ sand. Results of using the SandBox-FM showed that it provided \nan easily understandable,\
    \ accessible and interactive interface to the hydrodynamic \nmodel, especially\
    \ to those without a relevant background (Ottevanger et al., 2017). \nThis property\
    \ in particular was of interest for the Virtual River Game and the main \nreason\
    \ we explored the use of a tangible user interface for the game (Chapter 4). \n\
    The results of the Virtual River Game’s evaluation showed that the interface enables\
    \ \ndomain experts and non-experts to engage in shared exploration of river manage-\n\
    ment strategies (Chapter 5). By using the interface, non-experts gained insights\
    \ \nabout the functioning of hydrodynamic models and their use to make decisions.\
    \ \nMoreover, we saw that experts could enhance this learning by contributing\
    \ their \nbackground knowledge to further explain the visualized model output.\
    \ In addition, \nthe interface makes the views of both experts and non-experts\
    \ explicit to others as \nthey point to and make changes to the game board.\n\
    To our knowledge, using a physical game board as a tangible user interface for\
    \ \nserious games, at least in the type of games as the Virtual River Game, has\
    \ not been \nexplored before. Tangible user interfaces have been applied in (serious)\
    \ game design, \nbut only in combination between tangible objects and a digital\
    \ surface (Bakker et al., \n2007; Leitner et al., 2008; Speelpenning et al., 2011).\
    \ In turn, non-digital game boards \nas a representation of a river system or\
    \ segment have been used before (Lankford \nand Watson, 2007; Magnuszewski et\
    \ al., 2018; Rajabu, 2007; Stefanska et al., 2011), \nbut not in (direct) connection\
    \ to computer models or with model output visualized \non the board. The tangible\
    \ user interface described in this thesis is therefore a novel \napproach of combining\
    \ the accessibility of a board game to the power of computer \nmodels. As a result,\
    \ players interact with computer models by rearranging game \npieces and are in\
    \ full control of the interaction without intermediary facilitation. By \nvisualizing\
    \ model output back on the board, players observe the effects of chang-\ning game\
    \ pieces on the location where they made them. Combined, based on our \nresults,\
    \ tangible user interfaces can make computer models such as hydrodynamic \nmodels\
    \ accessible and transparent to stakeholders, regardless of their background.\n\
    Tangible interaction has intrinsic benefits to make models accessible and trans-\n\
    parent (Chapter 4). First, tangible interaction makes use of people’s ability\
    \ to grab, \nmove and change physical objects as an easy, intuitive and low-threshold\
    \ way to \ninteract with digital information (Hornecker and Buur, 2006; Ishii,\
    \ 2008; Jetter et \nal., 2014). Second, by using physical objects as external\
    \ representations reduces the \ncognitive load needed for problem solving. As\
    \ external representations are physical, \nthese can be inspected in the world\
    \ (Zhang and Norman, 1994) and thereby enable \npeople to more easily gain an\
    \ understanding of abstract concepts (Antle, 2007; Clem-\n151\nDiscussion\n6\n\
    ents, 2000; O'Malley and Fraser, 2004). Third, tangible user interfaces enable\
    \ people \nto engage in collaborative activities. The control of the interface\
    \ is shared (Xu, 2005; \nZuckerman et al., 2005) and taking actions with the interface\
    \ (or even pointing to \nan object) is visible to other people (Stanton et al.,\
    \ 2001; Suzuki and Kato, 1995). \nTo summarize, the use of tangible user interfaces\
    \ is of value to serious games that \ninclude digital models as they provide domain\
    \ experts and non-experts with a shared \nobject that: (1) enables players to\
    \ collaboratively work with models; (2) provides an \neasy to use and low-threshold\
    \ interface to models; (3) reduces the cognitive load for \nproblem-solving; and\
    \ (4) makes actions in the game visible to other players.\n6.1.3 \nExperimenting\
    \ with interventions\nSerious games are designed to be environments in which it\
    \ is safe to experiment \n(Bekebrede, 2010; Duke and Geurts, 2004; Geurts et al.,\
    \ 2007; Mayer, 2009; Zhou, \n2014). Decisions inside the game are only valid within\
    \ the context of playing the game \nand therefore stimulate as well as provide\
    \ safety to experiment. In serious games to \ncollaboratively explore complexity,\
    \ players apply interventions in order to pursue \ntheir objectives or improve\
    \ their scores. As serious games are representations of real-\nity, these interventions\
    \ are representations of management interventions applied in \npractice. In games\
    \ where players manage a spatial area, interventions are generally \nincluded\
    \ as binary options that can be turned on or off for defined locations in the\
    \ \ngame (Bathke et al., 2019; Bonté et al., 2019; Carson et al., 2018; Craven\
    \ et al., 2017; \nHill et al., 2014; Rusca et al., 2012). Sometimes games include\
    \ multiple options of the \nsame intervention on the same location, such as including\
    \ small, medium and large \nversions (Onencan et al., 2016; Savic et al., 2016;\
    \ Valkering et al., 2013). After select-\ning and applying one or more interventions,\
    \ players can inspect the interventions’ \neffects based on the game’s integrated\
    \ models. As a result, players gain insights into \nthe combined effects of the\
    \ predefined interventions and therefore learn about the \ntechno-physical complexity\
    \ of the environmental system through experimentation \n(Bathke et al., 2019;\
    \ Carson et al., 2018; Hill et al., 2014; Onencan et al., 2016; Valk-\nering et\
    \ al., 2013).\nWhereas most similar serious games enable experimentation with\
    \ combina-\ntions of predefined interventions, the Virtual River Game adds the\
    \ design of inter-\nventions (Chapter 5). Moreover, the interventions are not\
    \ hardcoded in the Virtual \nRiver Game’s software, but are implemented based\
    \ on game rules defined outside the \nsoftware. Players apply measures by replacing\
    \ pieces on the game board. Therefore, \nplayers determine the location, direction,\
    \ shape and size of the intervention. This \nin turn allows players to engage\
    \ in new forms of collaborative experimentation in \nthe game. Players learn about\
    \ how and when interventions are effective by thinking \n152\n6\nof, trying and\
    \ evaluating different implementations of interventions. Subsequently, \nthe new\
    \ insights can be used by players to think of, try and evaluate more effective\
    \ \nimplementations of the intervention. In effect, this trial and error experimentation\
    \ \nis a form of experiential learning (Kolb, 1984), where players move through\
    \ the circle \nof an experience, reflection on the experience, develop new ideas\
    \ based on the expe-\nrience, and apply the new ideas to gain a new experience.\
    \ We showed through the \nevaluation of the Virtual River Game that the ability\
    \ to collaboratively experiment \nwith interventions contributed to establishing\
    \ learning outcomes by playing the \ngame (Chapter 5). For serious games in general,\
    \ adding the ability to design inter-\nventions over selecting predefined interventions\
    \ is valuable to trigger experimenta-\ntion and (social) learning. \n6.1.4 \n\
    Platform for developing serious games\nIn environmental management, serious games\
    \ are typically tailor made to a specific \nenvironmental system, its physical\
    \ location, its unique policy-making setting and \nits cultural contexts (Bots\
    \ and van Daalen, 2007; de Caluwé et al., 2012; Duke and \nGeurts, 2004; Geurts\
    \ et al., 2007; Toth, 1988b). Researching, designing and devel-\noping serious\
    \ games in this context is therefore time consuming and the resulting \ngame is\
    \ not easily transferable to other systems or locations. The Virtual River Game\
    \ \nis tailor made to Dutch river management. Its development has indeed been\
    \ time \nconsuming, from understanding the field of river management and its policy-making\
    \ \nsetting to eliciting the real stakeholder needs to developing and testing\
    \ game proto-\ntypes. To develop the game, we created the hybrid, tangible interface\
    \ as a platform \n(Chapter 5). Although serious games will still need to be tailor\
    \ made, the platform \nand its customization options can be used to transfer the\
    \ Virtual River Game more \neasily to other locations and settings and to develop\
    \ new spatial serious games.\nThe developed platform can be summarized as a game\
    \ table setup comprising \na physical game board and hardware components in combination\
    \ with a software \npackage to process the physical board and link it to computer\
    \ models and a game \nengine (Chapter 5). Rather than base the design of a game\
    \ on specific models, the \nplatform uses the generic link to models that are\
    \ used in practice, creates schema-\ntizations based on the physical pieces that\
    \ form the game board, and uses the sche-\nmatizations as model input. This way,\
    \ the game pieces combined form an abstract \nrepresentation of a stretch of a\
    \ Dutch river in the Virtual River Game. The developed \nversion of the Virtual\
    \ River Game is therefore not immediately applicable to the \nmanagement of rivers\
    \ in the United States, Colombia, Bangladesh or other coun-\ntries. To transfer\
    \ the Virtual River Game, game designers can design game pieces \nthat represent\
    \ elevation levels and land uses found in other countries. In addition, \n153\n\
    Discussion\n6\nthe number and shape of the pieces can be changed to match the\
    \ game board to a \ndesired resolution for the stretch of a river. Tailoring the\
    \ pieces may therefore be used \nto create schematizations that serve as abstract\
    \ representations of stretches of a river \nthat are found in other countries.\
    \ Such changes would require only minor changes in \nthe platform’s software.\
    \ Beyond the game pieces, the rules, roles and interventions \nof the Virtual\
    \ River Game would also need to be tailored to the specific setting, but \nthese\
    \ are defined outside the game’s software. In addition, the game designers would\
    \ \nneed to consider linking models that are used in practice in other countries\
    \ to the \nplatform, which is supported as long as the models have an interface\
    \ option available \nsuch as the Basic Model Interface (Peckham et al., 2013).\
    \ Other software components \nsuch as the visualizations of model output are fully\
    \ customizable. As for the hard-\nware, the game table can be manufactured with\
    \ readily available materials and all \nhardware components are off-the-shelf.\
    \ The designs for the game table are available.\nNext to tailoring the Virtual\
    \ River Game to new locations, the platform can \nalso be used to develop entirely\
    \ new games with a spatial component. The platform \nconverts the physical board\
    \ to a digital board and processes the digital board into a \ndigital elevation\
    \ model and land use distribution. This principle is valuable for devel-\noping\
    \ serious games in river management and other environmental systems. Apart \n\
    from serious games on flood safety of rivers, the platform can be used to develop\
    \ \nserious games on water resources (Craven et al., 2017; Jean et al., 2018),\
    \ such as on \nirrigation management (Lankford and Watson, 2007; Rajabu, 2007)\
    \ and for consid-\nering constructing hydropower plants (Douven et al., 2014).\
    \ It can be used for seri-\nous games around coastal management, such as on delta\
    \ management (Bonté et al., \n2019), flood safety management (Becu et al., 2017)\
    \ or marine spatial planning (Keijser \net al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2013). Beyond\
    \ water, the platform can be used for serious \ngames on for example land use\
    \ management (Schulze et al., 2015; Sušnik et al., 2018), \nagriculture management\
    \ (Farrie et al., 2015; Sausse et al., 2013; Speelman et al., 2014) \nand biodiversity\
    \ conservation (Vasconcelos et al., 2009). Beyond environmental \nmanagement,\
    \ the platform is expected to be valuable to develop serious games for \nurban\
    \ planning (Ampatzidou et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2013). \n\
    To conclude, the developed hybrid, tangible interface offers potential value \n\
    as a platform to be used in environmental management and beyond to transfer the\
    \ \nVirtual River Game and develop new serious games with a spatial component.\
    \ The \nplatform cannot overcome the overall weakness that such serious games\
    \ need to be \ntailor made, but it does provide a proven basis. In context of\
    \ the argument to not \nmake technical aspects a driving force in the design of\
    \ serious games, the platform \nvalue proposition may sound as a paradox. To clarify,\
    \ game designers should first \ndetermine why using the platform helps to achieve\
    \ the designers’ intended purpose \n154\n6\nand adds meaning and value for stakeholders.\
    \ Only afterwards should game design-\ners seek to determine how the platform\
    \ can be used and customized to the environ-\nmental domain, physical location\
    \ and policy-making context. In other words, the \nquestions: (1) what are the\
    \ stakeholders’ actual needs; and (2) why to use the plat-\nform, should be answered\
    \ before answering how to use the platform.\n6.2 \nReflection\nBelow, we reflect\
    \ on the overall research conducted and presented in this thesis. We \ndo so by\
    \ reflecting on the overall research approach, the research as part of the River-\n\
    Care research program and the limitations of the research.\n6.2.1 \nResearch approach\n\
    In this thesis, we explored applying human centered design to serious games to\
    \ \ncollaboratively explore complexity. We therefore took the stakeholders’ actual\
    \ needs \nand wishes as the starting point of the Virtual River Game’s design.\
    \ We showed \nthat the identification of the actual stakeholder needs and wishes\
    \ led to exploring \nthe use of tangible interaction in the game. In turn, the\
    \ use of tangible interac-\ntion proved effective to develop an interface that\
    \ makes hydrodynamic models both \naccessible and transparent to stakeholders.\
    \ In that regard, human centered design \nhas shown its value to apply in the\
    \ design and research of serious games to collab-\noratively explore complexity.\
    \ At the same time, it was also time consuming to apply \nthe approach. \nBesides\
    \ designing a serious game, we were designing ways to facilitate stake-\nholder\
    \ involvement in the game’s design process. We used interviews as a method \n\
    to elicit stakeholder needs and wishes (Chapter 2). Interviews may not be consid-\n\
    ered a core human centered design method. However, in accordance with the \nhuman\
    \ centered design philosophy, we developed an interview method, informed \nby\
    \ Sense-making and Cultural Theory, to facilitate river management stakeholders\
    \ \nto structurally reflect on a self-introduced, challenging situation and subsequently\
    \ \nimagine how they would like to address the situation. The method proved effective\
    \ \nto gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and stakeholder perspectives,\
    \ while \nallowing to generalize the understanding to derive needs and desires.\
    \ The developed \ninterview method may therefore be used to gain an understanding\
    \ of how stake-\nholders frame issues and solutions in contested policy areas.\
    \ Developing the method \ntook time, as did the analysis of the interviews themselves.\
    \ A method that would \nhave engaged multiple stakeholders at once, e.g. a focus\
    \ group, may have taken less \ntime to execute and analyze, but would not have\
    \ enabled us to explicitly explore and \n155\nDiscussion\n6\nunderstand the “worlds”\
    \ of individual river management stakeholders. We iteratively \ndeveloped prototypes\
    \ of the Virtual River Game and evaluated these together with \nstakeholders (Chapters\
    \ 4 and 5). We deliberately evolved the prototypes from rough \nand low-fi to\
    \ the final stylized and high-fi prototype in order to match the proto-\ntypes’\
    \ completeness, presentation and aesthetics with the state of the design process\
    \ \nand the type of feedback that we sought from stakeholders. Although developing\
    \ the \nprototypes took time, iteratively developing and evaluating the prototypes\
    \ together \nwith stakeholders was both effective and efficient to determine possible\
    \ improve-\nments and design steps.\nMoreover, designing the prototypes enabled\
    \ us to involve stakeholders in the \ndesign of the Virtual River Game as well\
    \ as to shape our own design ideas. However, \nthe most important value of the\
    \ intermediate prototypes was its use as a form of \ncommunication of our design\
    \ ideas. Based on our experience developing the Virtual \nRiver Game, communicating\
    \ game design ideas through means such as presenta-\ntions on interface designs\
    \ or concept maps of qualitative models works poorly to \nboth get the desired\
    \ message across and facilitate stakeholders to provide mean-\ningful feedback.\
    \ Serious games have to be experienced in order to properly deter-\nmine if the\
    \ design is on the right path. In essence, playing and evaluating the game \n\
    prototypes ensured that we and the stakeholders spoke the same language. Subse-\n\
    quently informing stakeholders how we intended to use their feedback led to further\
    \ \ndiscussions on the game’s design and generated interest to be involved in\
    \ the design \nprocess at a later stage. To conclude, after developing an initial\
    \ idea and scope for a \ngame, designing rough, but playable prototypes is most\
    \ helpful as a form of design \ncommunication to gain further insights into next\
    \ steps in the game’s design. Our \nadvice to designers is therefore to overcome\
    \ their inherent (or natural) reluctance to \nshowcase unfinished or, in their\
    \ view, poor quality designs and to start the commu-\nnication early.\n6.2.2 \n\
    Research as part of RiverCare\nThe research presented in this thesis was executed\
    \ as part of the RiverCare research \nprogram (Hulscher et al., 2014). The RiverCare\
    \ program is a large research program \ncomprising five Dutch universities and\
    \ around twenty governmental and industrial \npartners. Embedding the research\
    \ in RiverCare defined the focus on developing \na serious game on river management.\
    \ Moreover, the large number of researches, \nsupervisors and partners involved\
    \ in the program equaled the number of different \nexpectations on the serious\
    \ game’s development. Most notably, the serious game was \nenvisioned as a tool\
    \ to integrate research results of RiverCare projects as a form of \nscience communication\
    \ and decision support.\n156\n6\nAs the purpose of the game was leading for all\
    \ design decisions, we were looking \nto integrate RiverCare research results\
    \ relevant to that purpose. We made attempts \nto generalize results of researchers\
    \ to so called rules of thumb; simplified, cause-ef-\nfect relationships that\
    \ we could embed in the game. We tried to find such rules of \nthumbs in both\
    \ workshops and one-on-one meetings with RiverCare researchers. \nHowever, it\
    \ proved difficult to: (1) take researchers out of their comfort zone to gener-\n\
    alize their results to rules of thumbs; and (2) explain exactly what we were looking\
    \ \nfor as game designers. Only after also playing game prototypes with researchers\
    \ did \nit become easier to discuss their potential contributions and build on\
    \ their exper-\ntise. The lesson learned here is that game prototypes should not\
    \ only be considered \nas a form of external communication to involve stakeholders\
    \ in the design process, \nbut also as internal communication to convey design\
    \ ideas in the research program. \nTo perform design research in a large, interdisciplinary\
    \ research program there-\nfore has its challenges, but the struggles that it\
    \ may bring do not outweigh the bene-\nfits. The points outlined above should\
    \ therefore be seen as helpful reflections for \nfuture design and game researchers\
    \ taking part in larger research programs. Design-\ning a serious game is inherently\
    \ an interdisciplinary effort (Harteveld, 2011; Ritter-\nfeld et al., 2009). The\
    \ RiverCare program included the needed interdisciplinary from \nthe start. The\
    \ main benefit of conducting the research in RiverCare was therefore to \ninvolve\
    \ researchers and form an interdisciplinary team to contribute to the Virtual\
    \ \nRiver Game’s design, reflected by the number and diversity of co-authors of\
    \ Chap-\nters 2, 4 and 5.\n6.2.3 \nLimitations\nAll research has its limitations.\
    \ The first limitation to this research relates to devel-\noping the Virtual River\
    \ Game as a RiverCare communication tool. As described in the \nprevious subsection,\
    \ the expectation was that RiverCare results could be easily inte-\ngrated in\
    \ the game and that the game would function as a decision support system. \nAs\
    \ we developed the game as a generic experimentation environment following the\
    \ \nresearch on stakeholder needs and wishes (Chapter 2), meeting those expectations\
    \ \nproved difficult. The knowledge and models generated as RiverCare results\
    \ were \nspecific, while the knowledge and models sought for the game were more\
    \ generic. \nMoreover, as this research was executed in parallel with other RiverCare\
    \ projects, \nnot all knowledge and models were readily available when we had\
    \ to make design \nchoices. As a result, the game is a result of the interdisciplinary\
    \ work of RiverCare \nresearchers and includes general messages that reflect RiverCare\
    \ results such as the \necologic value of spatial measures, but does not include\
    \ the specific results of the \nRiverCare program as initially envisioned. \n\
    157\nDiscussion\n6\nAs a second limitation to the research, we developed the Virtual\
    \ River Game \nwithout a real world case study in the form of a river management\
    \ project. As the \nRiverCare program was launched in response to the new type\
    \ of interventions \napplied in the Room for the River management program, most\
    \ of the Room for the \nRiver projects were (nearly) finished by the time it started.\
    \ On-going river manage-\nment projects that included spatial intervention measures\
    \ were few and sensitive \namong local residents (During et al., 2016; Van Buuren\
    \ et al., 2016). We attempted \nto develop and apply the Virtual River Game in\
    \ an on-going project, but the project \nmanagers were not eager to introduce\
    \ experimentation given the project’s sensitive \nnature. As a result, the Virtual\
    \ River Game has not been applied in a real policy-mak-\ning setting. We therefore\
    \ have not been able to study if the game provides a safe \nexperimentation environment\
    \ when applied in a real project nor if playing the game \nhas a positive contribution\
    \ to a project, i.e. if the game’s social learning outcomes are \ntransferred\
    \ to and applied in reality.\nA third limitation of the research relates to the\
    \ extent of stakeholder involve-\nment in the Virtual River Game’s design. As\
    \ part of the human centered design \napproach, we organized co-design workshops\
    \ with stakeholders early in the design \nprocess. The workshops aimed to facilitate\
    \ stakeholders to participate in the game’s \ndesign and as such to create a sense\
    \ of ownership of the game. These workshops were \nhelpful to us to gain a better\
    \ understanding of the stakeholders’ needs and desires, \nbut were not successful\
    \ to create the sense of ownership. The human centered design \napproach could\
    \ be further improved by informing the workshop set-up with tech-\nniques from\
    \ companion modelling (Barreteau et al., 2003; Étienne, 2013) and partici-\npatory\
    \ modelling (Voinov and Bousquet, 2010; Voinov et al., 2016). These approaches\
    \ \nare already applied in environmental management and could therefore facilitate\
    \ \nmore active participation in the design of serious games to collaboratively\
    \ explore \ncomplexity, fitting with the human centered design philosophy. Moreover,\
    \ in order \nto develop a sense of ownership of the game among stakeholders, the\
    \ availability of \na real world case study would have been crucial.\nConcluding,\
    \ it would have been beneficial to have a real world case both to \napply human\
    \ centered design and to develop the Virtual River Game. Although we \ndesigned\
    \ the game to be a generic representation of Dutch river management, the \navailability\
    \ of a real world case in early game development phases would have better \nfacilitated\
    \ stakeholders to contribute to the game’s development. Without this case, \n\
    it proved difficult to convince stakeholders of the value to participate in co-design\
    \ \nworkshops. Moreover, from a practical point of view, stakeholders had difficulty\
    \ to \njustify spending significant time on the game’s design without the co-design\
    \ work-\nshops being organized in relation to an existing project that they or\
    \ their organi-\n158\n6\nzation were involved in. These two barriers were easier\
    \ to overcome once we had \ndeveloped game prototypes and we could both explain\
    \ and show to stakeholders \nwhat we saw as the game’s potential added value.\n\
    Chapter 7\nConclusions and recommendations\n160\n7\nOur objective was to explore\
    \ how a human centered design of serious games \ncontributes to foster exploring\
    \ complexity, facilitating stakeholder participation \nand stimulating social\
    \ learning in environmental management. In this thesis, we \ntherefore applied\
    \ a human centered design approach to the Virtual River Game by: \n(1) researching\
    \ the actual needs and wishes of Dutch river management stakehold-\ners; (2) exploring\
    \ how the game’s design can meet these needs; and (3) evaluating to \nwhat extent\
    \ the game was successful to meet these needs. Based on the results, we \nare\
    \ able to determine how applying a human centered design approach enriches the\
    \ \ndesign of serious games to collaboratively explore complexity. Below, we first\
    \ draw \nconclusions on the thesis’ research objective. Afterwards, we draw conclusions\
    \ on \nthe research questions. We end with recommendations for both future research\
    \ and \nin regard to the outcomes of this thesis.\n161\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\
    7\n7.1 \nConclusion to the research objective\nFrom the outset, we proposed that\
    \ applying a human centered design approach \nto serious games may enrich their\
    \ design and enhance their abilities to foster: (1) \nexploring complexity; (2)\
    \ facilitating stakeholder participation; and (3) stimulating \nsocial learning\
    \ in environmental management. Based on the research, design and \nevaluation\
    \ of the Virtual River Game, we draw the following conclusions on each of \nthese\
    \ three aspects. On the first aspect of the research objective, the results from\
    \ the \nfive evaluation sessions show that game was successful to explore complexity\
    \ in river \nmanagement. To explore the techno-physical complexity, players rearranged\
    \ pieces \non the game board to apply river management interventions such as side\
    \ channels, \nlongitudinal training dams and dike relocations. Players could subsequently\
    \ inspect \nthe effects of these interventions on the flood safety, biodiversity\
    \ and costs indicators \nbased on computer models widely used in practice. Players\
    \ explored the socio-polit-\nical complexity by playing the role of flood safety,\
    \ nature or budget manager in the \ngame. In these roles, players pursued different\
    \ objectives and had protest abilities \nthat guided how players might propose\
    \ or block certain implementations of inter-\nventions. By using a physical game\
    \ board, players were provided with an environ-\nment that stimulated exploration\
    \ and experimentation. In comparison with existing \nserious games, the Virtual\
    \ River Game’s design increased the experimentation poten-\ntial as the game enabled\
    \ players to design interventions over selecting predefined \ninterventions.\n\
    On the second aspect of facilitating stakeholder participation, the Virtual \n\
    River Game was successful to engage both domain experts and non-experts and in\
    \ \nparticular to enable them to work together. The game expands on existing serious\
    \ \ngames by providing players with a tangible user interface to collaboratively\
    \ work \nwith environmental models, regardless of players’ background and expertise.\
    \ For \nexperts, it was important to include models as these form a basis for\
    \ discussions and \ndecision-making in practice. For non-experts, it was important\
    \ to be able to work \nwith these models to increase their understanding of how\
    \ these models are used in \ndecision-making. Moreover, players used visible actions\
    \ such as moving pieces or \npointing to locations on the game board to support\
    \ discussions, making their views \non both the problem and possible solutions\
    \ explicit to each other. As a limitation \nhowever, the game was evaluated in\
    \ sessions that were not related to a real world \npolicy context. We therefore\
    \ cannot conclude that the game is also successful to facil-\nitate stakeholder\
    \ participation when applied in an actual river management project. \nOn the third\
    \ aspect of the research objective, the results indicate that the \nVirtual River\
    \ Game was successful to stimulate social learning. By playing the game, \nboth\
    \ domain experts and non-experts gained insights through the shared explora-\n\
    162\n7\ntion and experimentation with interventions as well as from discussions\
    \ with other \nplayers. Non-experts indicated, mostly with strong agreement, that\
    \ they gained both \ncognitive and relational learning outcomes, and emphasized\
    \ outcomes associated \nexclusively with cognitive learning as their main insights.\
    \ Experts reported more \nmixed results, with many statements associated with\
    \ cognitive and relation learning \nrated positively and some rated neutrally\
    \ to negatively. Experts emphasized main \ninsights associated with both cognitive\
    \ and relational learning. Based on the evalua-\ntion, we discussed how the game’s\
    \ hybrid, tangible interface enhances social learning \nby combining strengths\
    \ of board and computer games. First, by using the physical \ngame board as a\
    \ tangible user interface, the players shared control of the game and \nwere not\
    \ dependent on a facilitator or one player using an input device. Second, the\
    \ \ninterface enabled players to collaboratively work with environmental models\
    \ without \nthe need to have expertise with these models. Third, enabling players\
    \ to experiment \nwith the design of interventions contributed to triggering learning.\
    \ \nCentral to the objective was to investigate how human centered design contrib-\n\
    uted to enriching the design of the Virtual River Game. By applying human centered\
    \ \ndesign, we gradually gained an understanding of an actual need of river manage-\n\
    ment stakeholders: To open up the black box of hydrodynamic models that are used\
    \ \nin Dutch river management practice. We therefore aimed to make these models\
    \ \naccessible and transparent in the game. We did not find satisfying design\
    \ solutions \nin existing serious games to do so and therefore looked for inspiration\
    \ to develop \ndesign concepts that went beyond existing solutions. Finding that\
    \ inspiration in \ntangible interaction, we developed the novel interface design\
    \ that links a physical \ngame board to digital models. The interface design makes\
    \ the hydrodynamic model \naccessible as it enables players to work with these\
    \ models by rearranging game pieces \non the game board. The model’s output is\
    \ subsequently projected and visualized on \nthe game board. As such, the interface\
    \ design makes the hydrodynamic model trans-\nparent as the game board is the\
    \ location for both the model’s input – the changes \nmade by players – and its\
    \ output – the projected visualizations. Evaluation of the \ngame showed that\
    \ Virtual River Game was successful to make the hydrodynamic \nmodel both accessible\
    \ and transparent. The human centered design of the Virtual \nRiver Game therefore\
    \ made the stakeholder needs and desires leading in the game’s \ndesign, placing\
    \ the game’s technical aspects second. Moreover, the human centered \ndesign approach\
    \ led to a game design that, as discussed above, contributes to explor-\ning complexity,\
    \ facilitating stakeholder participation and stimulating social learning \nin\
    \ environmental management.\nIn conclusion, human centered design fits recent\
    \ calls to make the stakehold-\ners, the policy context and the (social) processes\
    \ of the problem at hand the driving \n163\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\
    7\nforce in the design of serious games to collaboratively explore complexity\
    \ (Aubert et \nal., 2019; Rodela et al., 2019). Applying a human centered design\
    \ approach by explic-\nitly researching actual needs and wishes of stakeholders\
    \ can enrich the design of a \nserious game to collaboratively explore complexity\
    \ in environmental management. \nSpecifically, applying a human centered design\
    \ approach may lead to looking beyond \nexisting solutions and therefore lead\
    \ to novel game designs that provide meaning \nand value to stakeholders. \n7.2\
    \ \nConclusions to the research questions\n7.2.1 \nRQ1: What are the challenges,\
    \ needs and stakeholder perspectives \nneeded to collaboratively explore river\
    \ management complexity? \nTo design the Virtual River Game, we considered the\
    \ stakeholder needs and desires \nas the prominent drivers. We developed an interview\
    \ method that follows the human \ncentered design philosophy. Using the method,\
    \ we interviewed stakeholders to elicit \ntheir needs and desires. From these,\
    \ we determined that stakeholders should be able \nto explore the cost-effectiveness\
    \ of river management interventions such as dike \nreinforcement and spatial measures\
    \ to both increase flood safety levels and pursue \nsecondary objectives. In addition,\
    \ stakeholders should be able to experiment with \nfloodplain land use planning\
    \ to experience the spatial explicitness of floodplain vege-\ntation. These needs\
    \ and desires relate to the identified challenges of (1) formulating \nfuture\
    \ river management policies to adapt to climate change, and (2) creating flex-\n\
    ibility to allow natural dynamics in a controlled river system respectively (Chapter\
    \ \n2). We subsequently analyzed the stakeholder perspectives on these challenges.\
    \ The \nperspectives served as input to game design by further understanding what\
    \ players \nshould experience and explore while playing the game. On the first\
    \ challenge, we \nfound only one perspective that focused on defining specifications\
    \ for both: (1) the \ndistribution between the contribution of spatial measures\
    \ and dike reinforcement to \nreach flood safety norms; and (2) the inclusion\
    \ of secondary objectives next to reach-\ning flood safety norms. We identified\
    \ two stakeholder perspectives in regard to the \nsecond challenge: (1) to create\
    \ clear boundaries on the extent that natural dynamics \nin nature areas may take\
    \ place (the control perspective); and (2) to develop the river \nsystem following\
    \ natural processes (the flexibility perspective). In addition, we iden-\ntified\
    \ a third challenge in sustaining the integrated river management approach in\
    \ \nthe maintenance of floodplains. We also found two stakeholder perspectives\
    \ on this \nchallenge: (1) to accept public tendering, focusing on each own’s\
    \ responsibilities and \ndeveloping public tendering strategies together to pursue\
    \ integrated objectives; and \n164\n7\n(2) to reject public tendering, reducing\
    \ its negative effects or removing the mecha-\nnism altogether as it obstructs\
    \ long-term planning. As this challenge focused on the \ngovernance aspect of\
    \ river management rather than the new spatial interventions, \nwe did not aim\
    \ to design the Virtual River Game to explore this challenge.\n7.2.2 \nRQ2: How\
    \ can social learning through the serious games be \nevaluated and how can the\
    \ evaluation approach be used to distill game \ndesign guidelines for collaboratively\
    \ exploring complexity?\nFor the first part of the question, we looked at the\
    \ assessment of three types of social \nlearning outcomes: (1) acquiring new or\
    \ restructuring existing knowledge (cognitive \nlearning); (2) shifting viewpoints,\
    \ values or paradigms (normative learning); and \n(3) improving the understanding\
    \ of the other stakeholders’ views and mind-sets as \nwell as enhancing their\
    \ ability to cooperate (relational learning) (Baird et al., 2014). \nBased on\
    \ a systematic literature review (Chapter 3), we identified three evaluation \n\
    strategies to assess each type of learning outcome: (1) measuring participants’\
    \ knowl-\nedge before and after playing a game (measured learning); (2) participants\
    \ self-re-\nporting on learning after playing a game (self-reporting learning);\
    \ and (3) observing \nlearning by participants during a game (observed learning).\
    \ We discussed how all \nthree strategies are suitable for assessing cognitive\
    \ learning outcomes. For normative \nlearning outcomes, the use of the measured\
    \ and self-reported learning evaluation \nstrategies are suitable. For assessing\
    \ relational learning outcomes, the self-reported \nand observed learning strategies\
    \ are applicable. We further provide an overview of \nmethods applicable to each\
    \ evaluation strategy to assess each type of social learn-\ning outcome.\nFor\
    \ the second part of the question, we showed how considering the evaluation \n\
    of social learning outcomes as a design question is beneficial to designing a\
    \ serious \ngame to collaboratively explore complexity. Explicitly including the\
    \ evaluation of \nsocial learning outcomes as a design question created an objective\
    \ that we aimed \nto both attain and assess. This goal therefore served not only\
    \ to determine how \nthe game’s social learning outcomes can be evaluated, but\
    \ also to emphasize how \nthe game can be designed to enhance social learning.\
    \ On a practical level, consid-\nering the evaluation as a design question meant\
    \ that the required data collection \nwas included in the game’s design requirements.\
    \ As such, developing the evalua-\ntion approach did not become a retrospective\
    \ activity. Combined, we conclude that \nconsidering the game’s evaluation as\
    \ a design question increases the quality of both \nthe game and its evaluation\
    \ as well as saves time. We further conclude that consid-\nering the game’s evaluation\
    \ as a design question contributes to more systematically \nassess the effectiveness\
    \ of using serious games to stimulate social learning.\n165\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\
    7\n7.2.3 \nRQ3: How can the intended serious game be designed to meet the \nidentified\
    \ stakeholder needs and intended social learning outcomes?\nWe showed that involving\
    \ stakeholders throughout the design process of a seri-\nous game is a necessity\
    \ to meet their needs and desires. We discussed how game \ndesigners therefore\
    \ need to not only design the game, but also use design to facili-\ntate stakeholder\
    \ involvement. To do so, we explained how game prototypes – from \nrough, non-playable\
    \ and low-fi prototypes to stylized, playable and high-fi proto-\ntypes – should\
    \ be considered as a form of design communication. We showed that \ndeveloping\
    \ prototypes and facilitating stakeholder involvement led to the design of \n\
    the novel interface design that links a physical game board to digital environmen-\n\
    tal models (Chapter 4). We conclude that game designers need to therefore balance\
    \ \ncompleteness, presentation and aesthetics of the prototypes to reflect the\
    \ state of \nthe design process and the type of feedback sought for. We stress\
    \ the importance \nto clearly communicate both the state of the design process\
    \ and type of feedback \nsought for to stakeholders. We further emphasize the\
    \ importance and benefits for \ngame designers to communicate how they intend\
    \ to use the feedback to stakeholders \nthat participated in a prototype’s evaluation.\n\
    7.2.4 \nRQ4: How and to what extent does the Virtual River Game enable \nstakeholders\
    \ to collaboratively explore river management complexity and \nstimulate social\
    \ learning?\nWe showed that the Virtual River Game was successful to explore Dutch\
    \ river \nmanagement complexity (Chapter 5). In particular, we showed that the\
    \ game \nenabled domain experts and non-experts to collaboratively experiment\
    \ with river \ninterventions. We conclude that the game was therefore also successful\
    \ in facilitat-\ning participation of diverse types of stakeholders. In the game’s\
    \ evaluation, both \ndomain experts and non-experts indicated that they gained\
    \ insights by playing the \ngame, albeit to a different extent, through self-reporting.\
    \ Non-experts mostly agreed \nor strongly agreed with statements that they gained\
    \ insights in relation to topics \nsuch as the functioning of the river system,\
    \ the trade-offs between interventions, \nthe use of hydrodynamic models, and\
    \ the views and perspectives of other players. \nIn their comments, non-experts\
    \ emphasized insights that are exclusively associated \nwith cognitive learning.\
    \ Experts rated the statements in a more mixed way, with \nsome statements rated\
    \ positively but some statements, such as on the use of hydro-\ndynamic models,\
    \ neutrally to negatively. In their comments, experts emphasized \ninsights related\
    \ to both cognitive  and relational learning. We conclude that play-\ning the\
    \ game led to establishing social learning outcomes and that the Virtual River\
    \ \nGame’s interface design contributed to enhancing social learning by combining\
    \ three \n166\n7\nstrengths of board and computer games. First, the developed\
    \ tangible user interface \ngave the players shared control of the game. Players\
    \ were therefore not dependent \non a facilitator or another player using an input\
    \ device. Second, the interface enabled \nplayers to collaboratively work with\
    \ environmental models regardless of them having \nexpertise with these models.\
    \ Third, the game increased the level of experimentation \nby enabling players\
    \ to design river management interventions using tangible game \npieces over selecting\
    \ predefined interventions. \n7.3 \nRecommendations and next steps\nSerious games\
    \ are increasingly used in environmental management as tools to foster \nthe collaborative\
    \ exploration of complexity and to stimulate social learning. Through \nthe research\
    \ presented in this thesis, we have explored how human centered design \ncan enrich\
    \ serious games to collaboratively explore complexity. Of course, research \n\
    is never finished. Below, we present recommendations and possible next steps for\
    \ \nfuture research as well as for the Virtual River Game and its hybrid, tangible\
    \ interface.\n7.3.1 \nResearch\nTransfer of social learning outcomes\nSerious\
    \ games are designed with learning objectives in mind. Lessons learned by \nplaying\
    \ the game should be useful in the world outside the game. Therefore, applying\
    \ \nserious games is based on the assumption that learning through games is transfera-\n\
    ble to reality (Chin et al., 2009; Crookall and Thorngate, 2009; de Caluwé et\
    \ al., 2012; \nDuke and Geurts, 2004; Geurts et al., 2007; Mayer, 2009; Mayer\
    \ et al., 2014). To reuse \nan excerpt from the introduction: “Proving that simulation\
    \ games work reminds us \nof high school math in which one had to build a complicated\
    \ argument to prove that \ntwo triangles had the same shape when one glance at\
    \ the figure sufficed to confirm \nthat they did. The effectiveness of simulation\
    \ games is evident to those who work with \nthem (players and facilitators)” (Hofstede\
    \ et al., 2010, p. 825). As both players and \nfacilitators, we indeed see the\
    \ effectiveness of serious games and this thesis adds \nadditional evidence to\
    \ this claim. However, to prove that learning through games is \ntransferred to\
    \ the real world continues to be a challenge (Chin et al., 2009; Hofstede \net\
    \ al., 2010; Mayer, 2009; Mayer et al., 2014).\nInitially, we had set out to contribute\
    \ to this knowledge gap, but this proved \nincompatible with both researching\
    \ and designing the Virtual River Game. Specif-\nically, to evaluate if and to\
    \ what extent learning through a game is transferred to \nthe world outside the\
    \ game requires analyzing the long-term effects of playing the \n167\nConclusions\
    \ and Recommendations\n7\ngame in a real policy-making setting. Moreover, it may\
    \ require stakeholders to play \nthe game more than once during a period of time.\
    \ In a project that aims to design a \nserious game, the final, tested, and validated\
    \ prototype is likely going to be finished \ntowards the end of the project, leaving\
    \ (too) little time to conduct such evaluations. \nFor research, a next step is\
    \ to conduct more research on the transfer of in-game \nlearning to reality. Chapter\
    \ 3, the literature review on assessment of social learning \noutcomes, may serve\
    \ as a resource to do so. We recommend to do such research as a \nnext step with\
    \ the Virtual River Game.\nHuman centered design of serious games\nBased on the\
    \ results of this thesis, we recommend to apply human centered design \nin the\
    \ development of serious games to collaboratively explore complexity. Doing so\
    \ \nputs emphasis on designing games that meet the actual needs and desires of\
    \ stake-\nholders. As a possible next step, the value of applying human centered\
    \ design to seri-\nous games can be further explored. In particular, future research\
    \ could explore how \nstakeholders can not just be included in the design process,\
    \ but can become part of \nthe design team. In other words, a possible next step\
    \ is to explore how stakeholders \ncan be involved and facilitated to co-design\
    \ serious games to collaboratively explore \ncomplexity and thereby create a feeling\
    \ of ownership of the game. To do so, such \nresearch would benefit from developing\
    \ a game in a real policy-making setting. This \nway, the game development would\
    \ relate to a real project or policy implementation \nthat affects involved stakeholders.\
    \ Such research could moreover explore to merge \nthe human centered design approach\
    \ with techniques such as companion model-\nling (Barreteau et al., 2003; Étienne,\
    \ 2013) and participatory modelling (Voinov and \nBousquet, 2010; Voinov et al.,\
    \ 2016) that already look at games as a way to collabora-\ntively develop and\
    \ use environmental models in participatory settings.\n7.3.2 \nVirtual River Game\
    \ and platform\nReconsider roles\nConsidering the Virtual River Game as a product,\
    \ there are some improvements and \nnext steps to consider. An important outcome\
    \ of this research is the recommenda-\ntion to reconsider the roles in the game.\
    \ Specifically, as the game evaluation showed, \na more direct representation\
    \ of the interest of agriculture in the floodplains should \nbe considered (Chapter\
    \ 5). In development of the game, we had considered the \ninclusion of a fourth\
    \ role, the economic manager, that would represent the inter-\nest of agriculture\
    \ and could also include the interest of river navigation. Currently, \n168\n\
    7\nagriculture is represented indirectly through financial penalties to acquire\
    \ farms and \nagricultural land as well as by providing the budget manager with\
    \ a veto for these \nacquisitions. When presented with the economic manager proposal\
    \ in the evaluation \nof the game’s external validity, domain experts stated that\
    \ the current game setup \nwas very effective to demonstrate the effects of interventions\
    \ in the river system. \nAdding the role would improve the socio-political representation\
    \ of the game, but \nthe experts feared that it would change the type of discussions\
    \ and make the game \nfar more complex. \nAdditional game levels\nAs discussed\
    \ above, the inclusion of the roles in the game should be revisited, but \nanother\
    \ option worth exploring would be to create a second, more complicated game \n\
    level where additional roles, objectives, interventions and indicators are introduced.\
    \ \nThis way, the current game could serve as an introductory level to river management\
    \ \nand the economic manager role would be added in a second level. An option\
    \ to \nfurther consider including in this second level is to not only look at\
    \ possible flood-\ning, but also at droughts, i.e. low river discharge situations\
    \ which are becoming more \ncommon in the Netherlands (de Wit et al., 2007; Lenderink\
    \ et al., 2007; van Vliet \nand Zwolsman, 2008). Including low river discharges\
    \ would, in turn, make it logical \nto also include the interest of river navigation\
    \ as part of the economic manager role. \nRiverCare results related to floodplain\
    \ vegetation (Harezlak et al., 2020; van Iersel \net al., 2018) and morphodynamics\
    \ of both the main channel and spatial measures \n(Chavarrías et al., 2019; de\
    \ Ruijsscher et al., 2018; Duró et al., 2018; Van Denderen et \nal., 2019) could\
    \ be relevant to include in this level as well.\nAnother direction for an additional\
    \ level could be to specifically address the \nthird challenge identified in RQ1:\
    \ Sustaining the integrated river management \napproach in the maintenance of\
    \ floodplains. We did not focus on this challenge \nin the design of the Virtual\
    \ River Game as it relates to river governance rather than \nriver interventions.\
    \ The Virtual River Game as presented in this thesis could however \nserve as\
    \ an introductory game to river management and the additional level to subse-\n\
    quently explore river governance. In the design of this level, the focus would\
    \ be \non the roles to include in the level and place more emphasis on their interaction\
    \ \nrules. For example, the level could allow the exploration of how players,\
    \ based on \ntheir in-game roles, can collaboratively develop plans in relation\
    \ to the Dutch public \ntendering process around managing floodplain areas. For\
    \ this level, RiverCare results \nin regard to the governance of floodplain management\
    \ (Fliervoet et al., 2017), public \nparticipation (Verbrugge and van Den Born,\
    \ 2018) and public procurement strategies \n(Bout et al., 2019) would be relevant\
    \ to consider.\n169\nConclusions and Recommendations\n7\nGeneral improvements\n\
    Next to reconsidering the in-game roles and additional levels, the evaluation\
    \ showed \nthat there are some potential improvements to the Virtual River Game’s\
    \ design \n(Chapter 5). First, missing from the game was a go back option when\
    \ players wanted \nto undo an intervention implementation. This meant that players\
    \ had to remember \nwhat the previous board state was to go back, which is not\
    \ in line with the notion \nthat the interface reduces cognitive load. The proposed\
    \ solution is creating a visual-\nization of the board state before an update\
    \ that players can switch to when desired, \nwhich has since been added. Second,\
    \ the information panel for the costs of differ-\nent interventions requires a\
    \ redesign as some players found it difficult to interpret \nthe table. In the\
    \ current table, players first look which cost types are linked to which \ninterventions\
    \ and then look up what the costs are. The redesign should merge these \ntwo cognitive\
    \ steps to make the actual costs associated with interventions immedi-\nately\
    \ clear. Third, players indicated that the biodiversity information panel was\
    \ very \nhelpful and that they would appreciate a similar information panel for\
    \ how differ-\nent land uses affect hydraulic roughness. Fourth, although updating\
    \ the board state \nstops the water flow visualization on the board, the software\
    \ did not provide players \nwith direct feedback that the system is updating on\
    \ the touchscreen monitor. At \ntimes, players therefore did not realize that\
    \ the system was updating after initiating \nthe update on the touch screen. As\
    \ a result, players sometimes pressed the update \nbutton a second time, causing\
    \ the system to update twice. The solution is to make \na popup window appear\
    \ after pressing the update button, which has since been \napplied. The popup\
    \ window could be further improved by including information \non the status of\
    \ the update or with an indication of how much longer the update is \nexpected\
    \ to take. Last, the aesthetics of the Virtual River Game’s GUI, the window on\
    \ \nthe touchscreen that players use to trigger updates and switch visualizations,\
    \ reflect \nits prototype status and should be redesigned to match that it is\
    \ a finished product.\nLinking game tables to increase spatial scale\nBeyond these\
    \ improvements of the game design, one possible next step to consider is \nto\
    \ develop a larger Virtual River Game by connecting two game tables, transforming\
    \ \nthe game to manage a larger river section with two playable stretches of a\
    \ river. The \ngame would work similarly as its current implementation, with all\
    \ the roles played \nat both game tables, but choices on one board affect the\
    \ other. Interventions imple-\nmented on the downstream game table would have\
    \ effects on the upstream one and \nvice versa. Moreover, the decisions on both\
    \ game tables would influence the indica-\ntor scores, meaning that negotiations\
    \ between the managers of the two stretches of \nriver are required. Adding an\
    \ option to support the negotiations in the game – e.g. \n170\n7\nenabling the\
    \ exchange of budgets – would stimulate the players to collaboratively \nbalance\
    \ their performance in the stretch of river they are responsible for as well as\
    \ in \nthe larger river section. The Virtual River Game described in this thesis\
    \ enables play-\ners to experiment with river interventions and to inspect their\
    \ effects. By connecting \ntwo game tables, the Virtual River Game would add that\
    \ players also experience how \ninterventions in one river location affect another\
    \ and how therefore river manage-\nment encompasses different spatial scales (Gurnell\
    \ et al., 2016; Vreugdenhil et al., \n2010). Consequently, players would also\
    \ experience the need for collaboration on \ndifferent spatial scales.\nTransferring\
    \ and developing serious games\nConsidering the developed hybrid, tangible interface\
    \ as one of the thesis’ main \ncontribution, a possible next step would be to\
    \ further explore its use as a platform to \ntransfer or develop serious games\
    \ in environmental management. Of interest would \nbe to use the platform to tailor\
    \ the Virtual River Game to river management in other \ncountries with different\
    \ spatial properties and policy contexts. Beyond river manage-\nment, the platform\
    \ can serve as a basis to develop games on other environmental \nsystems. Staying\
    \ close to the Virtual River Game, such applications could be in other \nwater\
    \ systems, e.g. coastal, delta or urban water management. Other application \n\
    areas could be land use management and urban planning. Of initial interest would\
    \ \nbe to research how well the platform serves the design and transfer of serious\
    \ games. \nNext, exploring how the platform can be used the develop games in other\
    \ application \nareas would determine additional functionality and requirements\
    \ for the platform. \nFurther development of the platform should thereby increase\
    \ its value proposition.\n7.4 \nClosing\nSupported by the results of this thesis,\
    \ we strongly believe in the value of serious \ngames to collaboratively explore\
    \ complexity in environmental management. As we \nshow in this thesis, serious\
    \ games can provide a simplified yet accurate representa-\ntion of reality where\
    \ stakeholders can engage in a shared exploration of environ-\nmental complexity.\
    \ Moreover, we show how human centered design can contribute \nto designing serious\
    \ games that cater to the actual needs and wishes of stakehold-\ners. As a result,\
    \ the four main contributions of this thesis are: (1) applying a human \ncentered\
    \ design process to the design of serious games; (2) developing a novel inter-\n\
    face design that uses a physical game board linked to environmental models to\
    \ make \nthe models accessible and transparent; (3) adding the ability to experiment\
    \ with the \ndesign of interventions as a game mechanic over selecting predefined\
    \ interventions; \nand (4) creating a platform to customize existing or develop\
    \ new serious games with \n171\nConclusions and Recommendations\n7\na spatial\
    \ component. There is work to be done to further explore to use and potential\
    \ \nof serious games and we provide recommendations for both research in general\
    \ and \ntowards the outcomes of this thesis specifically. We hope that this thesis\
    \ encourages \nand inspires both design researchers and game designers to continue\
    \ exploring how \nthe design of serious games to collaboratively explore complexity\
    \ in environmental \nmanagement can add meaning and value to stakeholders.\n172\n\

    \ In India, agriculture plays an important role in development in food production.\
    \ In our country, agriculture depends on the monsoons \nwhich are not sufficient\
    \ source of water. So the irrigation is used in the agriculture field. Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) is a milestone in the evolution \nof technology. IOT plays an\
    \ important role in many fields, one of that is Agriculture by which it can feed\
    \ billions of people on Earth in future. \nThe objective of this paper is aiming\
    \ to overcome this challenge, the whole system is micro control based and can\
    \ be operated from a remote \nlocation through a wireless transmission so there\
    \ is no need to concern about irrigation timing as per crop or soil condition.\
    \ The sensor is used to \ntake sensor reading of soil like soil moisture, temperature,\
    \ air moisture and decision making is controlled by the user (farmer) by using\
    \ a \nmicrocontroller.Using wireless transmission, these data collected are sent\
    \ to the server database. The irrigation will be automated when the \nmoisture\
    \ and temperature of the field are reduced. The farmer is notified with the information\
    \ regarding field condition through mobile \nperiodically. This system will be\
    \ more useful in areas where there is a scarcity of water and will be worth efficient\
    \ with satisfying its \nrequirements. \n \nKeywords: Smart Irrigation, Sensors,\
    \ Bluetooth communication, Android. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n \nIn India, where\
    \ 60-70% economy depends on agriculture, \nthere is a great need to modernize\
    \ the conventional \nagricultural practices for the better productivity. Due to\
    \ \nunplanned use of water the ground water level is decreasing \nday by day,\
    \ lack of rains and scarcity of land water also \nresults in the decrement in\
    \ the volume of water on earth. \nNowadays, water shortage is becoming one of\
    \ the biggest \nproblems in the world. We need water in each and every \nfield.\
    \ In our day to day life also water is essential. \nAgriculture is one of the\
    \ fields where water is required in \ntremendous quantity. Wastage of water is\
    \ the major problem \nin agriculture. Every time excess of water is given to the\
    \ \nfields. There are many techniques to save or to control \nwastage of water\
    \ in agriculture. The objective of the system \nis to a) conserve energy & water\
    \ resources b) handles the \nsystem manually and automatically c) detects the\
    \ level of \nwater. \x1F \nDue to the climatic changes and lack of precision,\
    \ \nagriculture has resulted in poor yield as compared to \npopulation growth.\
    \ Irrigation is mostly done using canal \nsystems in which water is pumped into\
    \ fields after regular \ninterval of time without any feedback of water level\
    \ in the \nfield[1][2][6]. This type of irrigation affects crop health and \n\
    produces a poor yield because some crops are too sensitive to \nthe water content\
    \ in the soil.  \x1F \n \nA smart irrigation system, contrary to a \ntraditional\
    \ irrigation method, regulates supplied water. The \nfeedback mechanism of a smart\
    \ irrigation system is a \nmoisture sensor and temperature and humidity sensor\
    \ \n[3][7][10]. Evapotranspiration (ET), thermal imaging, \ncapacitive methods,\
    \ and neutron scattering method and \ngypsum blocks are some of the technologies\
    \ that enable \nmoisture sensing. Capacitive sensors, however instantaneous, \n\
    are costly and need to be calibrated often with varying \ntemperature and soil\
    \ type. Neutron probe based moisture \nsensors are very accurate but present radiation\
    \ hazards, \ncalibration difficulty and are costly.\x1F \n A large agriculture\
    \ field presents is a different part of \nareas, hence, moisture measurement at\
    \ a single locating in \nthe field does not make much sense. Consequently, what\
    \ is \nrequired is a distributed number of sensor nodes and \nscattered pumping\
    \ units to pump water to those specific \nlocations covered by the sensor units.\
    \ An automated \nirrigation unit, in conjunction with a low-cost moisture \nsensor,\
    \ is proposed in this paper. \n \n2. EXISTING SYSTEM \n \nA. Automated Irrigation\
    \ System using WSN and GPRS \nModule \nAutomated Irrigation system using WSN and\
    \ GPRS Module \nhaving the main goal is that optimize the use of water for \n\
    agriculture crop. This system[1] is composed of the \ndistributed wireless sensor\
    \ network with soil moisture and \ntemperature sensor in WSN. Gateway units are\
    \ used to \ntransfer data from sensor unit to base station, send a \ncommand to\
    \ the actuator for irrigation control and manage \ndata of sensor unit. An algorithm\
    \ used in the system for \ncontrolling water quantity as per requirement and condition\
    \ \nof filed. It is programmed in microcontroller and it sends a \ncommand through\
    \ the actuator to control water quantity \nthrough valve unit. The whole system\
    \ is powered by \nphotovoltaic panels. Communication is duplex take place \nthrough\
    \ the cellular network. Web application manages the \nirrigation through continuous\
    \ monitoring and irrigation \nscheduling programming. It can be done through web\
    \ pages. \n \nB. Crop Monitoring System based on WSN \nThe \nsubsequent \nsection\

    \ precision agriculture. The \napplication monitors the whole farm from a remote\
    \ location \nusing Internet Of Things (IoT). The application works on \nsensor\
    \ network and two types of nodes [3]. Energy saving \nalgorithm is used in the\
    \ node to save energy. The tree-based \nprotocol is used for data collection from\
    \ node to base station. \nSystem having two nodes one node that collects all \n\
    environmental and soil parameter value and the other consist \nof a camera to\
    \ capture images and monitor crops. In this \nSystem [4] Environmental changes\
    \ are not considered for \nsensor reading. The system user was not able to program\
    \ \napplication and no controlling system for the application.\x1F \n \nC. Automatic\
    \ Drip Irrigation System using WSN and \nData Mining Algorithm \nData mining algorithm\
    \ is used to take decisions on drip \nirrigation system. Automated drip irrigation\
    \ system having \nWSN placed in all over the farm and different type of \nsensors.\
    \ WSN uses an ad-hoc network which gives self-\nconfiguration and flexibility.\
    \ Sensor data is given to base \nstation is received using ZigBee [2][9][12].\
    \ Data processing \nis done at the base station for decision making. Data mining\
    \ \nalgorithm is used to take a decision on data from a sensor to \ndrip. All\
    \ observation is remotely monitored through a web \napplication. This system works\
    \ on Naïve Bayes algorithm for \nirrigation control. The algorithm works on previous\
    \ data set \nfor decision making if any attribute is not the frequent result \n\
    is zero [11].  \n \n3. PROPOSED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS \n \nD. Arduino Microcontroller\
    \ \nArduino is an open-source electronics platform based on \neasy-to-use hardware\
    \ and software [4][5]. An Arduino board \nare able to read inputs – light on a\
    \ sensor, a finger on a \nbutton – and turns it into an output – activating a\
    \ motor, by \nturning on an LED. A microcontroller is a small computer on \na\
    \ single integrated circuit containing one or more CPUs \nalong with memory and\
    \ programmable input/output \nperipherals. Microcontrollers are designed for the\
    \ embedded \napplications such as automobile engine control systems, \nimplantable\
    \ medical devices, remote controls, office \nmachines and other embedded systems.\
    \ \x1F \n \n \nFigure 1.  .Arduino Microcontroller \nFigure 1 shows Arduino microcontroller\
    \ was the Arduino \nboards can communicate at various baud rates. A baud is a\
    \ \nmeasure of how many times the hardware can send 0’s and \n1’s in a second.\
    \ The software used by the Arduino is Arduino \nIDE. \x1F \nE. Sensors \nIn this\
    \ system, two sensors are used in order to obtain the \ndata about the soil and\
    \ environmental condition, soil \nmoisture sensor and temperature and humidity\
    \ sensor [7][8]. \n1)  Soil Moisture Sensor: Soil moisture sensors measure the\
    \ \nvolumetric water content in the soil[6] shown in Figure \n2. Since the direct\
    \ gravimetric measurement of free soil \nmoisture requires removing, drying and\
    \ weighing of a \nsample, [7]soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric \nwater\
    \ content indirectly by using some other property of \nthe soil, such as electrical\
    \ resistance, dielectric constant, \nor interaction with neutrons, as a proxy\
    \ for the moisture \ncontent.\x1F \n \nFigure 2.  A Soil Moisture Sensor \n \n\
    As shown in the above figure, these sensors have two probes \nthrough which current\
    \ passes in the soil, then detect the \nresistance of soil for reading moisture\
    \ level[8][11].As we \nknow that water makes the soil more prone to electric \n\
    conductivity resulting in less resistance in the soil where on \nanother hand\
    \ dry soil has poor electrical conductivity thus \nmore resistance in soil.  \n\
    \ \n2)  Temperature and Humidity Sensor: The DHT11 is a \nbasic, ultra low-cost\
    \ digital temperature and humidity \nsensor shown in Fig 3. It uses a capacitive\
    \ humidity \nsensor and a thermostat to measure the surrounding air \nand spits\
    \ out a digital signal on the data pin.  \n It measures relative humidity. Relative\
    \ humidity is the \namount of water vapor in air vs. the saturation point of water\
    \ \nvapor in the air. At the saturation point, water vapor starts to \ncondense\
    \ and accumulate on surfaces forming dew. It detects \nwater vapor by measuring\
    \ the electrical resistance between \ntwo electrodes. \n \nFigure.3.Temperature\
    \ and Humidity Sensor \n3) Bluetooth Wireless Technology: Bluetooth is a high-\n\
    speed, low-power microwave wireless link technology, \ndesigned to connect phones,\
    \ laptops and other portable \nequipment together with little or no work by the\
    \ use. Unlike \ninfra-red, \nBluetooth \ndoes \nnot \nrequire \nline-of-sight\
    \ \npositioning of connected units.  \nAshwini B V et al, International Journal\
    \ of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 9 (1), Jan-Feb 2018, 86-90 \n© 2015-19,\

    \ Device \n \nThe Bluetooth device uses radio waves instead of wires \nor cables\
    \ to connect to a phone or computer. A Bluetooth \nproduct, like a headset or\
    \ a watch, contains a tiny computer \nchip with a Bluetooth radio and software\
    \ that makes it easy \nto connect. When two Bluetooth devices want to talk to\
    \ each \nother, they need to pair. Communication between Bluetooth \ndevices happens\
    \ over short-range, ad-hoc networks known as \npiconets. A piconet is a network\
    \ of devices connected using \nBluetooth technology. The sensors are connected\
    \ to the \nArduino board. This hardware communicates via Bluetooth. \n \n \n4.\
    \ SYSTEM DESIGN \n \nIrrigation is automated by using sensors, microcontroller,\
    \ \nBluetooth, the Android application as shown in Fig.5. The \nlow-cost soil\
    \ moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors are \nused. They continuously monitor\
    \ the field and are connected \nto the Arduino board. The sensor data obtained\
    \ are \ntransmitted through wireless transmission and are reached to \nthe user\
    \ so that he can control irrigation. \x1F \nThe mobile application is designed\
    \ in such a way to \nanalyze the data received and to check the threshold values\
    \ \nof moisture, humidity, and temperature. The decision can be \nmade either\
    \ by the application automatically without user \ninterruption or manually through\
    \ the application with user \ninterruption. If soil moisture is less than the\
    \ threshold value, \nthen the motor is switched ON and if the soil moisture \n\
    exceeds the threshold value, then the motor is switched OFF. \n\x1FHere the sensors\
    \ are connected to the Arduino board and \nthe hardware communicates through wireless\
    \ Bluetooth \ntransmission so that user can access the data through his \nmobile\
    \ that has an android application which can get the \nsensor data from the Arduino\
    \ via Bluetooth. As far as the \ncost of a device is considered Bluetooth technology\
    \ is used \nwhich can be replaced by wi-fi.  A motor is switched OFF.  \nThe Arduino\
    \ board is programmed using Embedded C in \norder to control the transmission\
    \ of sensor data and the \nworking of the motor according to the decision made.\
    \ The \ncoordination of the motor and 3 sensors is maintained by the \nprogram\
    \ fed into the Arduino. Water is supplied to 3 \ndifferent areas by using Servo\
    \ Motor, a motor that can move \nits head at different angles. Using this, the\
    \ head of the motor \nis made to move at 3 different angles so that water can\
    \ be \nsupplied at different areas where the sensors are placed. The \nsensors\
    \ continuously send data regarding moisture content of \nthe soil. Whichever sensor\
    \ indicates low moisture content to \nthat place motor is switched on and then\
    \ water is pumped if it \nindicates high moisture content pumping of water is\
    \ stopped \nby switching of the motor. All these are managed by the \nprogram\
    \ \nthat \nhas \nbeen \nwritten \ninto \nthe \nArduino \nMicrocontroller.  \n\
    \ \n \n \nFig.ure  5. System Architecture \nThe Arduino and the user communicate\
    \ via Bluetooth. \nThe range of Bluetooth technology is application specific.\
    \ \nThe threshold values for both soil moisture and temperature \nand humidity\
    \ will be set and stored in the Arduino and \nmobile application. The sensor value\
    \ varies according to the \nclimatic conditions. The soil moisture will be different\
    \ in \nsummer and winter seasons and so the temperature and \nhumidity values.\
    \ The threshold value is fixed after \nconsidering all these environmental and\
    \ climatic conditions.  \nThe motor will be switched on automatically if the soil\
    \ \nmoisture value falls below the threshold and vice versa. The \nfarmer can\
    \ even switch on the motor from mobile using \nmobile application. \nThe irrigation\
    \ system is automated once the control \nreceived from the mobile application.\
    \ Through Bluetooth, the \ndecision is sent to the Arduino and accordingly the\
    \ motor \nswitches are operated. \x1F \nThe ultrasonic sensor is used to monitor\
    \ the water level in \nthe reservoir. The ultrasonic sensor work based on the\
    \ \npiezoelectric method. It has trigger pin and echoes pin. The \ntrigger pin\
    \ act as a transmitter and the echo pin is a reflector. \nThe trigger pin sends\
    \ ultrasonic waves once it started \nfunctioning. The ultrasonic waves once it\
    \ started functioning. \nThe ultrasonic waves hit the water and reflected towards\
    \ the \necho pin. The duration to receive the echo is calculated and \nthat indicates\
    \ the water level.  \x1F \nThe duration is converted to the distance using the\
    \ \nfollowing equation (1) and (2). \nDistance in cm = (duration/2) / 29.1 \n\
    (1) \nDistance in inches = (duration/2) / 74 \n(2) \nBefore the motor is switched\
    \ on, the water level is \nchecked to ensure that required amount of water is\
    \ available \nfor irrigation. If the required amount of water is not present,\
    \ \nthe motor will not be switched on or only less amount water \nis supplied.\

    \ decision to be made. The farmer can also be able to \nswitch on and off the\
    \ motor from the mobile application.\x1F \n \n5. ANDROID MOBILE APPLICATION \n\
    \ \nAndroid is used to develop a mobile application for \nautomatic irrigation.\
    \ Android is a mobile operating system \ndeveloped by Google, primarily designed\
    \ for touchscreen \nmobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Figure 6 \n\
    Shows the user interface listing all the Bluetooth users. \nFigure 7 shows the\
    \ interface showing both options for \nmanual and automatic operation. The sensor\
    \ data and the \nthreshold value are stored in local memory of the mobile. \n\
    The user can read the sensor data and can set the system into \nan automatic mode\
    \ so that the system automatically switches \nmotor depending on the sensor data\
    \ and a previously set \nthreshold value. Also, the user can set the system to\
    \ manual \nmode and he himself can decide the switching of the motor. \nAnd he\
    \ can get the notifications regarding the water level in \nthe reservoir so that\
    \ he can make alternatives when there is a \nscarcity of water in the reservoir.\x1F\

    \ sensors are used water can be provided only to \nthe required area of land.\
    \  \nThis system reduces the water consumption to the greater \nextent. It needs\
    \ \nminimal \nmaintenance. The power \nconsumption has been reduced very much.\
    \ The crop \nproductivity increases and the wastage of crops are very \nmuch reduced.\
    \ \nThe extension work is to make the user interface much \nsimpler by just using\
    \ SMS messages for notifications and to \noperate the switches.   \n \n8. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\

    With the development of modern science and technology, the development of electrical\
    \ automation engineering has also\nbecome widespread. In the traditional sense,\
    \ the wiring of the electrical automation control system is complex, the cost\n\
    is high, the maintenance is difficult and failures may easily occur, and these\
    \ factors seriously affect the system efficiency.\nThe application of PLC technology\

    With the development of society and economy, electrical automation has come to\
    \ be widely used in many\nindustries; from industries in which merely basic construction\
    \ activity is involved to aerospace high-tech, there\nis no shortage of electrical\
    \ automation, and it has found the most extensive application in heavy industry\
    \ and\npower generation [1]. The improvement and effective use of electrical automation\
    \ can comprehensively improve\nwork quality and work efficiency, and maximise\
    \ the economic benefits obtained by enterprises [2]. A series of\nstandards has\
    \ been formulated in China to ensure the better development of electrical automation\
    \ and to improve\nthe versatility of related equipment [3]. In the 21st century,\
    \ electrical engineering and its automation technology\nare being continuously\
    \ improved and updated, and the effective integration of computer information\
    \ technology\nand electrical automation can comprehensively improve the quality\
    \ and work efficiency of the entire electrical\nautomation system, thus facilitating\
    \ it to become one of the important guarantees for the long-term development\n\
    of the Chinese economy [4].\n†Corresponding author.\nEmail address: limq@gsau.edu.cn\n\

    \ Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nIn traditional electrical control, most\
    \ components of the electrical system are controlled in the form of relay\ncontact,\
    \ but relay control has the disadvantages of slow response time, high average\
    \ repair rate, complicated\nwiring, low reliability, high power consumption and\
    \ poor flexibility [5]. Therefore, an automatic control system\nwith a wide range\
    \ of applications, powerful functions and convenient use is urgently needed. The\
    \ programmable\nlogic controller appeared in response to this requirement and\
    \ has been widely used in the field of automatic\ncontrol, which has greatly promoted\
    \ an enhancement in the levels of effectiveness and efficiency for industries\n\
    that have adopted this automation [6]. The working principle of PLC is fundamentally\
    \ the same as that of a\ncomputer, and it also realises a series of task controls\
    \ through the execution of certain user programs. In terms\nof time, the PLC controller\
    \ is different from the relay control system when performing tasks [7]. In the\
    \ work of\nPLC, the method of cyclic scanning is used. This method refers to sampling\
    \ the signals in each process during\nthe running time of the program, and then\
    \ performing operations and processing on the signals. The results are\nsent to\
    \ the relevant actuators [8]. During the operating cycle of the system, some of\
    \ the input data do not change,\nand similarly, some output data remain fixed\
    \ whereas others might or might not change. In the PLC, the cycle\nscanning method\
    \ is used to continuously sample and output the input variables and output variables,\
    \ so that the\ncorresponding execution actions can be made when the conditions\
    \ are met [9].\nElectrical automation based on PLC technology is widely used in\
    \ all walks of life. In the field of agriculture,\nthrough precise control of\
    \ the supply of water and fertiliser to crops, the waste of water resources can\
    \ be reduced\nand the level of agricultural modernisation can be improved [10],\
    \ Accordingly, several studies are available in\nthe literature describing the\
    \ impact of application of this technology in agricultural automation tasks. Leedy\
    \ et\nal. [11] designed a fertiliser distribution device for a sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system to realise the integrated irrigation\nof water and fertiliser. Colaco\
    \ and Molin [12] and Chandel et al. [13] equipped the fertiliser applicator with\
    \ a\nPDA and a vehicle-mounted computer, respectively, combined with technologies\
    \ such as sensors, cameras and\nGIS positioning, to achieve accurate measurement\
    \ and control of orchard fertilisation decision-making informa-\ntion. Sarangapani\
    \ et al. [14] used two-line decoding technology and cloud computing to realise\
    \ the intelligent\nirrigation of the water and fertiliser integrated delivery\
    \ machine. Dwinugroho et al. [15] designed and opti-\nmised the mixed fertiliser\
    \ system of the three-channel bypass fertiliser applicator, and verified the stability\
    \ of\nthe whole machine structure through simulation and experiments. Boobalan\
    \ et al. [16] combined fuzzy control\nand FPGA technology to design a greenhouse\
    \ water and fertiliser integration system for online fertiliser mixing.\nThe application\
    \ results show that the system has good control performance. Yang and Cheng [17]\
    \ developed\nan intelligent irrigation system controlled and monitored by the\
    \ Android platform. In applying this system, any\nAndroid-powered mobile phone\
    \ can be used to communicate with soil moisture and temperature sensors in real\n\
    time to realise automatic irrigation of farmland and online analysis of optimal\
    \ water volume or crop yield. Liu et\nal. [18] designed a soilless cultivation\
    \ irrigation cloud system based on EC sensors, which drives the single-chip\n\
    microcomputer to control the irrigation and fertilisation devices according to\
    \ the fertiliser parameters collected\nby the wireless sensors. Ouberri et al.\
    \ [19] designed a fuzzy controller for precision irrigation nonlinear systems,\n\
    using the T-S model to achieve continuous management of multiple input variables.\
    \ Rajkumar et al. [20] estab-\nlished an intelligent fuzzy inference model for\
    \ the randomness and nonlinearity of automatic irrigation systems,\nwhich can\
    \ effectively improve their accuracy. Yadav and Shevade [21] proposed using the\
    \ WebGIS framework\nto connect discrete agricultural systems to the Internet,\
    \ and use big data analysis, AI, drones and other tech-\nnologies to achieve sustainable\
    \ promotion of precision agriculture. Stavrakoudis et al. [22] used UAV remote\n\
    sensing technology to predict the data of rice yield and fertiliser requirement,\
    \ and established a nutrient content\ninversion model of rice growth period through\
    \ multiple linear regression method to ensure accurate diagnosis of\nrice fertiliser\
    \ application.\nIn the field of urban drainage automation, Chopade [22] studied\
    \ the adaptability of automatic control systems\nunder different environmental\
    \ conditions, and used experimental tests to obtain the results; Nie and Xu [23]\n\
    mainly designed and implemented BCI-based automatic control systems. Yang and\
    \ Fu [24] focussed on research\ninto the automatic display system of drainage\
    \ systems under certain conditions, using a mobile liquid crystal\ndisplay. After\
    \ years of development, the automation level of the current sewage treatment industry\
    \ has been\nApplication of PLC technology in electrical automation engineering\n\
    617\ngreatly improved, and the related technologies of the control system have\
    \ been gradually updated and improved\n[25]. At present, the three main control\
    \ systems in the control field are PLC programmable controller system,\nFCS fieldbus\
    \ control system and DCS distributed control system [26]. Among them, the structure\
    \ of the DCS\ncontrol system is divided into three levels, including the control\
    \ station, the operation station and the instruments\nin the process. FCS realises\
    \ the organic combination of field process equipment, PLC controller and upper\n\
    computer monitoring part through the established communication network, and thus\
    \ facilitates the automation\nof field-level industrial control. FCS system is\
    \ a relatively popular development point in the current control field,\nand it\
    \ is also a popular development direction [27]. The openness, dispersion, maintainability\
    \ and operability\nof the FCS system are relatively good, and it is also simple\
    \ and easy to implement in such a way as to achieve\ncomplete onsite control.\
    \ It is being increasingly used in current industrial production applications\
    \ [28]. As a\nresult of the effective development of the development platform\
    \ and configuration software, the PLC control\nsystem has a more friendly human–machine\
    \ interface, and at the same time, the cost is reduced; thus, by opting\nfor this\
    \ system, users can economically use a control system that offers a greater capability\
    \ for friendly (i.e.\nhassle-free) human–machine interaction. The improvement\
    \ of the communication level also makes the security\nand stability of the control\
    \ system develop by leaps and bounds. The openness characteristics of PLC systems\n\
    are also generally developed based on the customised needs of users, allowing\
    \ the integration of third-party\nsoftware and hardware to make PLC more powerful\
    \ and empowering its use in a wider range.\nBased on the findings from the literature\
    \ outlined above, it is observed that PLC technology is widely used\nin various\
    \ fields of electrical automation, which greatly improves the efficiency of the\
    \ control system and sim-\nplifies the installation, monitoring, management, maintenance\
    \ and other procedures. However, it still has some\nshortcomings, such as the\
    \ efficiency still not being very high, the response time being long and the control\
    \ ac-\ncuracy being low. Therefore, this paper studies the practical application\
    \ of PLC technology in various fields of\nelectrical automation engineering, analyses\
    \ its working principle in depth and optimises the automatic control\nsystem based\
    \ on the PLC principle.\n2 Mathematical model of PLC technology and electrical\
    \ automation\nIn the electrical automation control system, the RL network is a\
    \ common loop in the electrical system, in\nwhich the resistance R and the inductance\
    \ L are constants, the voltage U is the input quantity, the current I is the\n\
    output quantity and the differential equation expressions of the input quantity\
    \ and the output quantity are such\nas indicated in Eqs (1)–(4):\nur = Ldi\ndt\
    \ +Ri\n(1)\nT = L\nR\n(2)\nK = 1\nR\n(3)\nT di\ndt +i = Kur\n(4)\nIn addition,\
    \ the RC network structure is also a common loop of the electrical system. The\
    \ resistance R and the\ncapacitance C are both constants, the voltage Ur is the\
    \ input quantity and the voltage Uc is the output quantity.\nFurther, according\
    \ to the circuit theory, the differential equation expressions of the input and\
    \ output quantities\ncan be obtained as shown in Eqs (5) and (6):\nur = Ri+ 1\n\

    \ Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nwhere I is the current passing through the\
    \ capacitor C and the resistor R. After the equation transformation, the\ndifferential\
    \ equation expression between the input and output quantities can be obtained\
    \ as shown in Eqs (7) and\n(8):\nRCduc\ndt +uc = ur\n(7)\nT duc\ndt +uc = ur\n\
    (8)\nAt the same time, the PLC uses the armature voltage to control the DC motor\
    \ in the system, I is the excitation\ncurrent, Ua and Ia are the armature voltage\
    \ and current, M is the load torque on the motor, and are the displace-\nment\
    \ and rotational speed of the motor, respectively. Therefore, the equation expression\
    \ of the armature circuit\ncontrolled by PLC can be obtained as shown in Eq. (9):\n\
    ua = iaRa +La\ndia\ndt +ea\n(9)\nThe back EMF is proportional to the motor speed,\
    \ as shown in Eq. (10):\nea = Ka\ndθ\ndt\n(10)\nThe electromagnetic torque M generated\
    \ by the motor is proportional to the armature current I, as shown in Eq.\n(11):\n\
    M = Cia\n(11)\nThe torque balance formula on the motor is shown in Eq. (12):\n\
    M −ML = J d2θ\ndt2 + f dθ\ndt\n(12)\nEqs (9)–(12) are the dynamic and static correlations\
    \ of the armature controlled by the PLC, which is one of\nthe mathematical models\
    \ of the electrification system. The four equations mentioned above are transformed\
    \ by\nformulas to obtain the attitude equation between the input and output of\
    \ the motor, as shown in Eq. (13):\nJRa\nd3θ\ndt3 +(fRa + fLa) d2θ\ndt2 +(fRa\
    \ +CKa) dθ\ndt = Cua −RaML −La\ndML\ndt\n(13)\nSince the inductance of the motor\
    \ has little influence on the system, Eq. (13) can be simplified to Eq. (14):\n\
    JRa\nd2θ\ndt2 +(fRa +CKa) dθ\ndt = Cua −RaML\n(14)\nAt the same time, the rotational\
    \ speed of the motor is known as the input quantity, and it can be simplified\
    \ by\nusing the following Eq. (15):\nJRa\ndθ\ndt +(fRa +CKa)ω = Cua −RaML\n(15)\n\
    At the same time, PLC is in the motor drive control, in which the servo motor\
    \ drives the screw to rotate once,\nand the volume V of the object brought out\
    \ is shown in Eq. (16):\nV = FL = t (S−b)·π ·d/cosα\n(16)\nThen, every time the\
    \ screw rotates once, the mass M of the object brought out is shown in Eq. (17):\n\
    M = V ·γ ·n\n(17)\nApplication of PLC technology in electrical automation engineering\n\

    The transmission force formula of PLC-controlled servo motor is given by Eq. (19):\n\
    F = k(v−v0)\n(19)\nAfter Laplace transformation from Eqs (18) and (19), Eqs (20)–(22)\
    \ can be obtained:\nF =\n\0mS2 +CrS\n\x01\nv0(S)+F0\n(20)\nF = k[v(S)−v0(S)]\n\
    (21)\nv0(S) =\nkv(S)−F0\nmS2 +CrS+k\n(22)\nFor the motor controlled by PLC, if\
    \ the influence of the friction resistance of the screw is not considered, the\n\
    transfer function of the power model of the mechanical transmission of the servo\
    \ system can be written as shown\nin Eq. (23):\nG(S) =\nk\nmS2 +CrS+k\n(23)\n\

    \ of PLC technology in electrical automation\n3.1\nApplication of PLC in electrical\
    \ sequence control\nIn the engineering electrical automation control system, the\
    \ advantages of PLC technology are particularly\nprominent. Electrical automation\
    \ regards PLC technology as a sequential control system in many fields, and the\n\
    test practice effect of PLC is very significant. The automatic sequence function\
    \ is a feature of PLC technology,\nwhich can reasonably and effectively arrange\
    \ the sequence of electrical automation equipment, thereby reducing\nthe repetition\
    \ rate and the processing process related to electrical automation, further improving\
    \ the processing\nefficiency of electrical automation, effectively reducing the\
    \ production cost of electrical automation, and ensur-\ning that the automation\
    \ and efficiency targets are completed on time. The automation program includes\
    \ the main\nprogram and multiple functional sub-modules, and the electrical automation\
    \ sequence control is one of them.\nThe mutual assistance between the modules\
    \ can realise remote control, and can strengthen the management and\ncontrol of\
    \ related electrical automation equipment. The application of PLC technology in\
    \ sequence control can\nbe divided into primary and secondary stations, on-site\
    \ sensing and remote control, etc.; designers need to carry\nout the relevant\
    \ electrical automation program design scientifically and reasonably, so as to\
    \ achieve effective\nmanagement of electrical automation data, thereby improving\
    \ production efficiency. Also, the remote control\nfunction can reduce the occurrence\
    \ rate of safety accidents and realise the comprehensive improvement of the\n\
    control ability of electrical automation equipment.\n3.2\nApplication of PLC in\
    \ electrical control switch\nIn the operation of the traditional electrical automation\
    \ switch system, the system consumes a certain amount\nof time and a large amount\
    \ of power when starting control, and the electrical automation system is often\
    \ short-\ncircuited. The use of PLC technology can effectively solve such problems.\
    \ The rational application of PLC\n620\nLi Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences\
    \ 8(2023) 615–624\ntechnology in the control of switching electrical automation\
    \ system can effectively promote the integration of\nelectrical operation and\
    \ information editing, thereby ensuring the safety and stability of the electrical\
    \ automation\ncontrol system. At the same time, the application of PLC technology\
    \ can effectively shorten the response time\nof the relays in the electrical automation\
    \ system during operation, can control the frequency of short-circuit\naccidents\
    \ taking place in the system, and can also improve the production efficiency,\
    \ thereby avoiding the major\npitfalls or limitations typically associated with\
    \ electrical automation systems, namely loss of equipment control\nand resulting\
    \ safety issues.\n3.3\nApplication of PLC in electrical data control\nPLC technology\
    \ can strengthen the processing of electrical automation data, and is also the\
    \ main task of\nengineering electrical automation. PLC technology may be used\
    \ to carry out simple programming, conduct pre-\nliminary screening of electrical\
    \ automation information, and then perform an overall scan of the ladder diagram\n\
    inside the electrical automation equipment to obtain electrical automation data\
    \ information. In this way, the\nelectrical automation operation steps can be\
    \ optimised, the PLC running speed can be accelerated and the elec-\ntrical automation\
    \ data information can be processed more effectively. The digital information\
    \ age has imposed\nstrict requirements on data security, and given the background\
    \ of this requirement, it is noteworthy to emphasise\nthat accelerated data processing\
    \ can effectively manage data and improve the security of electrical automation\n\
    data. Since the electrical automation data control includes two parts, namely\
    \ the control part and the controlled\nobject, the electrical automation control\
    \ program can be used to collect the electrical automation data reasonably\nand\
    \ effectively, arrange the controller to compile the program, and then use statistical\
    \ methods and digitalisation\nto efficiently process data that control electrical\
    \ automation.\n3.4\nApplication of PLC in electrical closed-loop control\nThe\
    \ sequence of processing the electrical automation output information and returning\
    \ to the original begin-\nning is called electrical automation closed-loop control.\
    \ The electrical automation closed-loop control can start\nthe system operation\
    \ under the action of the feedback mechanism, and output relevant information\
    \ smoothly;\nand at the same time, it can re-input and output basic object information,\
    \ and achieve the expected effect through\nreasonable improvement. The application\
    \ of PLC technology in closed-loop control can effectively integrate the\nrunning\
    \ time of the motor in electrical automation and make a reasonable selection of\
    \ production tools, and\nthis ideally results in improvement in production quality.\
    \ PLC technology includes closed-loop control and se-\nquence control, which can\
    \ further improve the intelligence level of the control electrical automation\
    \ system, and\neffectively enhance the structure control and electrical automation\
    \ data closed-loop management.\n3.5\nApplication of PLC in automatic machining\
    \ control\nIn order to ensure the mechanical strength, the rivet necessitates\
    \ strict requirements on the processing pres-\nsure and temperature in the process\
    \ of hot pressing and forming. If the pressure is too low, the forming effect\n\
    of the rivet will be poor, which will affect its normal use. If the temperature\
    \ is too high or too low, it will affect\nthe stability of the internal structure\
    \ of the rivet and reduce its life and mechanical strength. In order to provide\n\
    the yield of rivet processing, PLC is used to automatically control the CNC machine\
    \ tool press in the process\nof rivet processing. The effect is shown in Figure\
    \ 1 and Table 1. An analysis of Figure 1 shows that when PLC\nis used to control\
    \ the pressure of the CNC machine tool for pressing rivets, when the control time\
    \ is between\n0 s and 10 s, the pressure curve of the rivet will overshoot during\
    \ the preparation process. However, with the\nincrease of PLC automatic control\
    \ time, the curve of rivet bearing pressure begins to maintain a smooth state,\n\
    and there is almost no fluctuation. Before PLC is used, the pressure change of\
    \ rivets will have a large amplitude\nand the curve will fluctuate greatly.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates the effect of temperature changes during rivet processing\
    \ on automatic control. During the\noperation of the PLC-controlled electrical\
    \ automation system, the flow of people and the changes in indoor and\nApplication\

    \ load disturbances in the rivet processing workshop. Therefore, when\nthe thermal\
    \ load disturbance multiples of the electrical automation system are different,\
    \ the effect of PLC on\nthe automatic control of CNC machine tools is tested.\
    \ The results are shown in Table 1. On analysing Table 1,\nit is inferred that\
    \ the thermal load disturbance multiple can have a certain impact on the automatic\
    \ temperature\ncontrol of the CNC machine tool. When using PLC to control the\
    \ temperature of the electrical automation\nsystem, when the disturbance multiple\
    \ is 1.0–1.6, it has no obvious influence on the PLC automatic control, and\n\
    the automatic control of the CNC machine tool temperature response time is short.\
    \ However, with the increase\nof the thermal load disturbance multiple of the\
    \ electrical automation system, there is a deviation when the PLC\nautomatically\
    \ controls the temperature of the CNC machine tool, but the maximum deviation\
    \ value is 1.49◦C,\nand the error percentage is only about 0.001. The results\
    \ show that PLC has a better effect on temperature\ncontrol of electrical equipment,\
    \ and higher precision.\n3.6\nElectrical application of PLC based on PID algorithm\
    \ in packaging\nThe control electrical automation system designed by this PLC\
    \ adopts Siemens S7-200 series PLC external\nanalogue input module EM235 to input\
    \ the signal obtained by the weighing sensor into the PLC. This module can\nconvert\
    \ the signal obtained by the sensor into (0–32,000) between the numbers. Therefore,\
    \ the design deviation\nof the electrical automation system can be converted into\
    \ (−32 to 32), and its absolute value is changed to (0–32)\n622\nLi Applied Mathematics\
    \ and Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nto simplify the programming, so that\
    \ the quantisation factor is 3/16; the PID control loop number is selected as\n\
    0, and VB100 as the starting address.\nIn order to edit the fuzzy controller,\
    \ Matlab mathematical simulation software is used to input the controller\ninto\
    \ the software, and then a two-dimensional fuzzy controller is determined with\
    \ two inputs and three outputs.\nThe parameters in the editing interface select\
    \ the FIS controller type as Mamdani, and the defuzzification method\nadopts the\
    \ centre of gravity method. The minimum method is selected for inference rules,\
    \ and the maximum\nmethod is selected for synthesis rules. Then, the membership\
    \ functions of the input and output variables are\nedited, the obtained control\
    \ rules are input into the controller, the Simulink simulation simulator provided\
    \ in\nMatlab is used to conduct electrical automation simulation experiments,\
    \ and a simulation model is established\nfor the control effect of fuzzy PID control.\n\
    After the simulation is completed, the weighing system of the electrical automatic\
    \ packaging machine is run\nand debugged. Table 2 shows the weighing data in the\
    \ experiment of weighing accuracy of 200 g with 200 g/bag\nas the experimental\
    \ basis. The distribution line of the deviation corresponding to the target quality\
    \ is shown in\nFigure 2. After the above experimental analysis, it can be known\
    \ that the accuracy of the weighing system of the\npackaging machine is within\
    \ the range of ±0.1%. The production line of the bag-feeding packaging machine\n\
    is in good operation, and the improved weighing system works stably and has good\
    \ precision, which meets the\npackaging requirements.\nTable 2 Packaging test\

    \ PLC technology can not only effectively improve various problems existing in\
    \ the tra-\nditional electrical automation control system, but also play a role\
    \ in controlling material loss and saving costs,\nwhich can also promote the production\

    \ and realises the system heat source that would enable effective and efficient\
    \ operation correspond-\ning to the least amount of resource consumption; however,\
    \ the electrical automation system Fan PID param-\neters have not yet achieved\
    \ self-matching and self-adaptive functions. Therefore, it is necessary to continue\n\
    to carefully analyse a large amount of electrical automation data that have been\
    \ collected, establish electrical\nautomation system models under various working\
    \ conditions, and combine fuzzy control rules, compile fuzzy\nprograms and add\
    \ them to existing programs. In this way, the electrical automation system can\
    \ independently\nchoose to change the motor PID parameters according to different\
    \ working conditions, so that the entire electri-\ncal automation system can always\
    \ maintain efficient operation.\nIn order to further improve the accuracy of the\
    \ weighing system of the bag packaging machine based on\nthe electrical automation\
    \ system, this paper studies and analyses the PLC control system, combines the\
    \ fuzzy\ncontrol with the PID control and proposes the fuzzy control based on\
    \ the traditional PID. The control of the\nfuzzy PID control electrical automation\
    \ system in the packaging machine weighing system is realised through\nthe powerful\
    \ control effect and programming ability of PLC. The experimental results show\
    \ that the improved\nelectrical automation control system has good accuracy, the\
    \ system overshoot is small and the weighing accu-\nracy is controlled at about\
    \ ±0.1%, which better meets the requirements of accurate measurement of electrical\n\
    automation packaging machines.\nThe automatic control system of electrical equipment\
    \ based on PLC technology is designed. The PID con-\ntrol algorithm is used in\
    \ the system, and it is written into the PLC programmable electrical automation\
    \ system\ncontroller in a self-programming way. The electrical automation system\
    \ controller is used to realise electrical\nThe device is automatically controlled.\
    \ The simulation test results show that the PLC is less affected by the num-\n\
    ber of threads, and its operation is relatively stable. The spectrum efficiency\
    \ curve of the electrical automation\nsystem coincides with the ideal curve, and\
    \ it has better communication performance and good applicability.\nAcknowledgements.\n\

    \ \n \n \n1 \nABSTRACT \n \nYasir Khalil:  Organization and Management for Efficient\
    \ Irrigation Water-Use  \n– An Empirical Study in the Sudan \nSudan, the largest\
    \ country in Africa, symbolizes the problems challenging the continent. \nThe\
    \ most threatening one is food security for an increasing population. Considering\
    \ the \ndrought conditions that built up in the area – culminating in the mid\
    \ 1980s – irrigation \nbecame a cornerstone to boost food supplies. This sub-sector\
    \ has historically played a \nsubstantial role in the production of food and cash\
    \ crops in Sudan. However, there is now \ngrowing evidence that the opportunities\
    \ for the further lateral expansion of irrigation \nschemes will be faced by the\
    \ limitations of the availability of foreign currency and the \navailability of\
    \ water resources. The former is dependent on the performance of the \nSudanese\
    \ economy and the later is, in addition, interdependent with the plans of other\
    \ \ncountries. Though the first limitation has reached a critical level, it is\
    \ recognized that water \nrather than other resources will be the main determinant\
    \ of irrigation development. \nThereby, if Sudanese agriculture is to develop,\
    \ there is a need to improve the utilization of \navailable water through improving\
    \ its management and the organizational contexts in which \nthis is practiced.\
    \ \nWithin this area of interest, the major task of the study has been to map\
    \ the factors that \nhinder this goal. The study is divided into two parts. The\
    \ first deals with the theoretical \nframework of key concepts and relevant issues.\
    \ It discusses, however, the different aspects \nthat have an influence on the\
    \ performance of irrigation systems and emphasizes, in \nparticular, those of\
    \ technology and the environment. In addition, the meaning and \nconditions of\
    \ institutional change are also discussed in detail. The second part of the study,\
    \ \nthe analytical section, comprises the methodology and the results of field\
    \ work which has \nbeen conducted under two irrigation bureaucracies – the New\
    \ Halfa Scheme in the eastern \npart of Sudan, and the Gendettu Scheme in the\
    \ north. \nThe results of the study stressed the need for a comprehensive development\
    \ approach which \nconsiders all natural resources. Furthermore, within the special\
    \ reference to the \nenvironment of the schemes, it has been found that the political\
    \ conditions are of particular \nimportance. This result highlights the question\
    \ as to what extent participation is applicable \nin bureaucratic irrigation schemes\
    \ in countries that have similar conditions. The study also \ncomes to the conclusion\
    \ that irrigation water efficiency has a socio-economic dimension \nand therefore\
    \ has to be linked with productivity and profitability. In this connection, \n\
    modernizing the relevant technologies and sustaining the integration with support\
    \ \ninstitutions are of relevant importance. Consequently, a central conclusion\
    \ of this study is \nthat the efficiency of water utilization also requires, at\
    \ the same time, the efficient \nutilization of other resources and inputs supplied\
    \ by support institutions. In addition, the \nabsence of tenants’ participation\
    \ and the dominance of the schemes administrations goals, \nas representatives\
    \ of the state, have resulted in a contradictory efficiency; the efficiency of\
    \ \nwater users vis-à-vis the efficiency of the state. \nConcerning communication,\
    \ a yawning gap has been registered between the different actors \nof the schemes.\
    \ This focus has tended to direct attention to the role of farmers’ \norganizations\
    \ in the articulation between water users and scheme management. The \nconclusion\
    \ that could be drawn from this analysis is that farmers’ organizations need to\
    \ \nplay this role independently. Finally the study stresses that, to achieve\
    \ the goals for \ncharging for irrigation water, these need to be accompanied\
    \ by institutional changes. \n \n \n2 \nABSTRACT \n \nYasir Khalil: Organisation\
    \ und Management zur verbesserten Wassernutzung in der \nLandwirtschaft des Sudan\
    \ - eine empirische Studie \nDer Sudan, das größte Land Afrikas, kann stellvertretend\
    \ gesehen werden für die Probleme, die den \nafrikanischen Kontinent bewegen.\
    \ An erster Stelle ist die Ernährungssicherung für eine steigende \nBevölkerungszahl\
    \ anzusehen. Bei Betrachtung der Dürre-Probleme dieser Region, die ihren \nHöhepunkt\
    \ Mitte der 80er Jahre hatten, wird das Thema Bewässerung zunehmend zu einem Pfeiler,\
    \ \nwenn es um die Verbesserung der Nahrungsmittelversorgung geht. Dieser Sub-Sektor\
    \ spielt, \nhistorisch gesehen, eine wichtige Rolle für die Produktion von Nahrungsmitteln\
    \ und \nlandwirtschaftlichen Exportprodukten im Sudan. Jedoch gibt es zunehmende\
    \ Anzeichen dafür, daß \ndie Ausdehnung der Bewässerungssysteme generell in Konfrontation\
    \ mit einer beschränkten \nVerfügbarkeit von Fremdwährung  und Wasserressourcen\
    \ stehen wird. Die erste Beschränkung ist \nabhängig von der Leistungsfähigkeit\
    \ der sudanesischen Wirtschaft und die zweite von den Plänen \nanderer Länder.\
    \ Da der erste Faktor seinen kritischen Punkt erreicht hat, ist es klar, dass\
    \ Wasser, \nund \nnicht \nandere \nRessourcen, \ndie \nentscheidende \nRolle \n\
    bei \nder \nEntwicklung \nder \nBewässerungssysteme spielen wird. Somit ist es\
    \ notwendig, wenn die sudanesische Landwirtschaft \nentwickelt werden soll, das\
    \ Management der Wassernutzung und die damit verbundenen \norganisatorischen Rahmenbedingungen\
    \ zu vervollkommnen. \nFolglich war es die Hauptaufgabe der Studie, die Faktoren,\
    \ die dem Ziel einer wirtschaftlichen \nWassernutzung hinderlich sind, herauszuarbeiten.\
    \ Die Studie teilt sich in zwei Abschnitte. Der erste \nTeil setzt sich mit den\
    \ theoretischen Rahmenbedingungen relevanter Konzepte und Ansätze \nauseinander.\
    \ Es werden die verschiedenen Aspekte, die Einfluß auf die Leistungsfähigkeit\
    \ von \nBewässerungssystemen haben, hervorgehoben. Dabei werden besonders Technologie\
    \ und Umwelt \nbetont. Zusätzlich werden die Bedeutungen und Bedingungen des Institutionellen\
    \ Wandels \ndiskutiert. Der zweite Teil der Studie widmet sich der Empirie, d.h.\
    \ den Methoden und Ergebnissen \nder Feldforschung. Diese wurde in zwei Bewässerungs-Schemes\
    \ durchgeführt: New Halfa Scheme \nin Ostsudan und Gendettu Scheme im Norden des\
    \ Landes. \nDie Ergebnisse dieser Studie zeigen auf, daß ein umfassender Entwicklungsansatz\
    \ alle natürlichen \nRessourcen einbeziehen muß. Weiterhin dürfen auch die politischen\
    \ Verhältnisse im Umfeld der \nSchemes nicht vernachlässigt werden. Das Ergebnis\
    \ weist besonders auf die Frage hin, in welchem \nAusmaß Partizipation anwendbar\
    \ ist in den bürokratisch organisierten Bewässerungs-Systemen in \nLändern mit\
    \ ähnlichen Bedingungen. Es konnte festgestellt werden, daß auch die sozio-\n\
    ökonomische Dimension beachtet werden muß, wenn die Effizienz der Bewässerung\
    \ betrachtet \nwird, d.h. Produktivität und Rentabilität müssen in die Kalkulationen\
    \ miteinbezogen werden. In \ndiesem Zusammenhang ist es von von äußerster Wichtigkeit,\
    \ der Modernisierung entsprechender \nTechnologien und der Einbeziehung unterstützender\
    \ Institutionen große Bedeutung zukommen zu \nlassen. \nDie zentrale Schlußfolgerung\
    \ dieser Studie ist also, daß die Effizienz der Wassernutzung auch die \ngleichzeitige\
    \ effiziente Nutzung anderer Ressourcen und Inputs, die von zuliefernden Institutionen\
    \ \nzur Verfügung gestellt werden, erfordert. Zusätzlich ist anzumerken, daß das\
    \ Nichtvorhandensein \nvon Pächter-Partizipation und die Vorherrschaft der Interessen\
    \ der Scheme-Verwaltung, als \nRepräsentanten des Staates, der Effizienz entgegenwirken,\
    \ das heißt, daß sich die Effizienz der \nWassernutzer und die des Staates diametral\
    \ gegenüberstehen. \nBesonders hervorgehoben werden muß die mangelnde Kommunikation\
    \ zwischen den verschiedenen \nBeteiligten der Schemes. Dieser Punkt führt die\
    \ Aufmerksamkeit direkt zur Rolle der \nBauernorganisationen als Verbindung zwischen\
    \ den Wassernutzern und dem Scheme Management. \nDie Schlussfolgerung, die aus\
    \ dieser Analyse gezogen werden kann, ist, daß die \nBauernorganisationen ihre\
    \ Aufgaben unabhängig wahrnehmen müssen. Schließlich betont die \nStudie, daß\
    \ zur Erreichung der Ziele, die mit der Erhebung von Bewässerungsgebühren verbunden\
    \ \nsind, gleichzeitig instutionelle Veränderungen erforderlich sind. \n \n \n\
    3 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nI m greatly indebted to Professor Dr. Dr. W. Manig for\
    \ his presice supervision of this study. \nI am also indebted to him, as student\

    \ and C.F. \nAnanda - the symbol of helpfulness and loyalty. Thanks are due also\
    \ to the staff of Institute \nof Rural Development. Particular thanks are of course\
    \ due to the DAAD who made this \nstudy possible in the first place. \n \nFinally,\
    \ I’m not sure if ‘thank’ is the right word that could be used for my family,\
    \ in \nparticular my mother and my sisters. I think the right word is congratulation.\
    \ This work is \nthe fruit of their long journey of giving and self-denying. \n\
    \ \nLast but not least, I would like to thank my friends who have contributed\
    \ in one way or \nanother to the success of this work. \n \nMost of all, I am\
    \ deeply grateful to God who gave me the craft and the light to end this \nwork.\

    \ water supply, which is directly related to the production and \nsupply of food,\
    \ is gradually becoming one of the crucial issues facing mankind. It is a fact\
    \ \nthat one clearly remarks in different studies, especially in those about the\
    \ future of \ndeveloping countries, that water as it used today will not be enough\
    \ to face the present and \nnew challenges of these countries. Herein lies a major\
    \ development dilemma. \n \nIt becomes clear that the major problem in the area\
    \ of water resources is not a Malthusian \nspecter of impending scarcity, but\
    \ one of instituting more rational and better management \npractices. In the case\
    \ of water, as of any other resource, the problem must be viewed in the \nwider\
    \ context of the rational use of natural resources for the achievement of a sustainable\
    \ \ndevelopment process, as envisioned by the New International Economic Order\
    \ proclaimed \nby the United Nations. A full understanding of such facts which\
    \ make it possible to increase \nproduction through improving the utilization\
    \ of available resources, without increasing the \nsupply of it, in addition to\
    \ other factors such as opening markets and adjusting price \nsystems, were important\
    \ factors through which many countries in Latin America and Asia \novercame their\
    \ economic problems in the 1980s and 1990s. It seems that, mainly because of \n\
    the nature of their national political systems, Africans were not in a position\
    \ to put these \nfactors in practice. It is to be argued, therefore, that much\
    \ of the difficulty that surrounds \nattempts to understand the reasons for the\
    \ low performance of national resources in Africa \nderives from the inadequate\
    \ treatment of, or the attempt to ignore completely, this dimension \nof natural\
    \ resource utilization.  \n \nMany developing countries, especially those with\
    \ arid and semi-arid conditions, are already \nseriously short of water. Because\
    \ of growing competition for the limited water resources, a \nheightened environmental\
    \ awareness, a continuously and rapidly increasing population, and \nscarce and\
    \ costly capital, this problem will become more acute in the future. This leads\
    \ to \nthe question whether successful agriculture indeed requires such large\
    \ quantities of water as \nare applied today. The answer, which has been empirically\
    \ prooved in different places in \nthese parts of the world, is that the present\
    \ level of water used in irrigation is, to some \nextent, wasteful. All these\
    \ facts have stimulated more interest in the careful use of water \nthan in simply\
    \ increasing its supply. \n \nThe foremost challenge related to water scarcity\
    \ in developing countries is the need to \nincrease generally efficient water-use\
    \ in agriculture, urban areas, and industry. Improved \nefficiency in agricultural\
    \ water-use is required both to maintain productivity growth and to \nallow the\
    \ reallocation of saving water from irrigated agriculture, which generally accounts\
    \ \nfor 80 percent of water diverted for use in developing countries, to urban\
    \ and industrial uses. \nExperience shows that using less water to grow grain\
    \ increases the water available for other \nuses as surely as building a dam or\
    \ diverting a river.  \n \nFor example, at a pilot project in Egypt funded by\
    \ USAID (US Agency for International \nDevelopment), an improved management of\
    \ irrigation systems is largely credited with \nboosting rice yields 35 percent.\
    \ In Pakistan, by some estimates, better irrigation management \ncould annually\
    \ save over 50 cubic kilometers – four times the storage capacity of the \nnations’\
    \ “Tarbela Dam” – at one-fourth the cost of developing new water supplies. \n\
    Similarly, in Sudan, according to a study by the National Council for Research\
    \ (1976), if the \ntotal irrigation system in the Sudan improved by ten percent,\
    \ the country could save – from \nits present irrigation water requirement – an\
    \ amount almost equal to its share from the \n \n14 \nJonglei canal project (phase\
    \ I). Another study conducted by the Hydraulic Research Station \n(1989) argues\
    \ that saving ten percent of the water consumption in the Gezira scheme by \n\
    improving water management would release the amount of water equal to the storage\
    \ \ncapacity of the “Sennar Dam.” \n \nAfrica is the major continent suffering\
    \ from the problems of water shortage. Two-thirds of \nAfrican nations have at\
    \ least one third less annual runoff than the global average. Drought \nconditions\
    \ that persistently plague the continent’s dry region have, in recent years, \n\
    threatened many nations, and Sudan in particular, with famine. The FAO (Food and\
    \ \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations) estimates that up to 80 percent\
    \ of the land \nin Africa is threatened by degradation, as rural people put their\
    \ own short-term survival \nahead of long-term natural resource sustainability,\
    \ and that two million hectares of forest are \nlost every year. In view of these\
    \ observations, forty-three African countries declared the \n1990s as The Decade\
    \ of Water Management in Cairo in 1990. \n \nWater management is one of the major\
    \ challenges in charting a course for environmentally \nsustainable development.\
    \ Population growth exacerbates water constraints. Yet, even if \nmore active\
    \ population policies were adopted, the average rate of population growth among\
    \ \nAfrican countries is expected to decline only slightly over the next 25 years,\
    \ from 2.8 \npercent today. This will render advances in poverty reduction extremely\
    \ difficult, and \nunderlines the fact that the fundamental issue in Africa’s\
    \ food-population equation in the \nforeseeable future is that of raising agricultural\
    \ resource productivity. Likewise, the Middle \nEast has a history of such contradiction\
    \ between population and water. There are many \nreasons, therefore, to believe\
    \ that the solution of dangerous problems in this area, like \nreligious fanaticism\
    \ hindering the peace process, is embedded in improving the performance \nof water-use.\
    \ The achievement of such a task will introduce an atmosphere and resources to\
    \ \nredress the causes that ”fuel” these problems, namely ignorance and poverty.\
    \  \n \nThe Nile Basin, with its nine riparian states, embodies all the challenges\
    \ that transnational \nmanagement of fresh water could possibly present. Most\
    \ of the course of the Nile traverses \nsemi-arid or totally arid regions, all\
    \ of its riparian states are agriculturally-based societies \nwith rapidly growing\
    \ populations, all are poor and to varying degrees aiming to sustain food \nsecurity.\
    \ All of them need, therefore, and to different extents, a higher share of water.\
    \ But, in \nthe light of the facts that several of the riparian states have been\
    \ and remain politically \nhostile to one another (the triangular contradiction\
    \ between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia) and \nthat cooperation between them concerning\
    \ the development of the river is only partial, and \nregarding the economics\
    \ difficulties that face all of these countries, it seems that increasing \nthe\
    \ supply of water, particularly in the short and medium term, is very difficult.\
    \ \n \nIt can be concluded that improving the technical and agro-economic aspects\
    \ are not enough \nfor the success of irrigation projects to face future challenges.\
    \ In addition, if not firstmost, \nthe institutional arrangements for managing\
    \ irrigation water play in this context a major role \nand should be made the\
    \ focus of dialogues and discussions concerning irrigated agriculture. \nThis\
    \ is the aim of this study through two empirical cases from the Sudan. The main\
    \ purpose \nof this research is to discuss comprehensively the institutional factors\
    \ that hinder improving \nthe irrigation water-use in Sudanese agriculture. \n\
    \ \nThe study is divided into two parts. Part I takes on the task of surveying\
    \ the major schools \nof thought and approaches to the characterization of irrigation\
    \ institutions and organizations \nin literature. Chapter 1 begins this task by\
    \ providing the definitions of key concepts used in \n \n15 \nthe study. The focus\
    \ is on analyzing the different dimensions of irrigation systems and the \ncomplex\
    \ interactions within these contexts. This chapter also outlines the different\
    \ \ndeterminants and criteria of the efficiency of irrigation systems. \n \nChapter\
    \ 2 critically scrutinizes the more rigorous dimensions and factors that affect\
    \ the \nmanagement of irrigation organizations. The emphasis has therefore been\
    \ directed at issues \nsuch as the objectives of irrigation organizations, the\
    \ contextual factors that describe the \norganizational environment, the relationship\
    \ between this environment and the organization \nstructure – the topic which\
    \ introduces the idea of institutional change – and finally the \nposition of\
    \ farmers in irrigation schemes. Among the different contexts that influence the\
    \ \nperformance of irrigation organization, special reference is given to the\
    \ technological facts \nthat have to be taken into consideration, the historical\
    \ factors, the socio-cultural dimensions, \nand the magnitude of the political\
    \ context in developing countries in general and Sudan in \nparticular. It emphasizes,\
    \ in addition, the human dimension of irrigation systems and the \nimportance\
    \ of water-users’ participation.  \n \nChapter 3 delineates in broad terms some\
    \ approaches and strategies for improving the \nperformance of irrigation systems.\
    \ The first section of this chapter elucidates the process of \ninstitutional\
    \ change and then traces the development of two theories that are bound with this\
    \ \nprocess – namely the theory of institutional innovation and transaction cost\
    \ theory, in \naddition to the concepts that constitute New Institutional Economics\
    \ (NIE), so called in \ninstitutional literature. The chapter delves into the\
    \ question of what makes these \ninstitutions/organizations more efficient, and\
    \ discusses in the following sections some key \nfactors to reach these goals,\
    \ i.e. institutional building and organizational development in \nirrigation systems\
    \ as well as the economic incentives represented in water pricing policy. \n \n\
    After having examined the various theoretical considerations of the study, these\
    \ aspects are \nrefuted empirically. The purpose of Part II is to delineate and\
    \ examine in broad terms some \naspects that hamper the efficient utilization\
    \ of irrigation water at the very lowest level – \nwater management within individual\
    \ farms sharing watercourses in two bureaucratic \nschemes in the Sudan. The management\
    \ of irrigation organization at project level has \nreceived scant attention in\
    \ literature. However, whereas the task is complex, it was clear that \nonly a\
    \ comprehensive analysis of all the factors that may contribute to poor performance\
    \ at \nthe lower levels of the system can indicate the correct mixture of remedies\
    \ required, in the \ncorrect sequence. In other words, organization and management\
    \ at project level has been \nfully reviewed as well as constraints at water-users’\
    \ level. \n \nPart II begins with an introductory chapter (Chapter 4) which briefly\
    \ draws attention to the \npresent situation and the future challenges of the\
    \ Sudanese agricultural sector in general and \nthe irrigated sub-sector in particular.\
    \ Chapter 5 looks more closely at the study areas and \nthe characteristics of\
    \ the two schemes. It elucidates, in addition, the methodology of the field \n\
    work and the factors that have governed the way of gathering data. \n \nChapter\
    \ 6 presents the results of the study. It begins by determining the responsibilities\
    \ of \nthe main configurations of the schemes (who is responsible for what?).\
    \ The second section \ndefines in detail the role of each one in the problems\
    \ of water management. Though water \ndistribution is clearly of central importance\
    \ in any irrigation project, it was long a relatively \nneglected subject. The\
    \ study analyses the allocation system in both schemes (6.4) and tries \nto find\
    \ answers to the questions: Who really controls water distribution between the\
    \ tenants? \nWhat role has the Tenant Farmers’ Union (TFU) in this connection?\
    \ And who takes over the \n \n16 \ntask of irrigation? This section also examines\
    \ the relationship that might exist between the \navailability of water and productivity.\
    \ The features of a communication system in the \nabsence of participation and\
    \ whether irrigation systems can operate efficiently under \ndespotism are discussed\
    \ in Section 6.5. In addition, the role of TFU (6.5.2) as well as the \nneed for\
    \ farmers to be provided with effective and integrated irrigation assistance and\
    \ an \nextension service is strongly emphasized in this section (6.5.3). Finally,\
    \ this chapter closely \nexamines the economic incentives through water pricing\
    \ as a means of improving water \nmanagement (6.6) in particular. It also rejects\
    \ a claim made by some officials that tenants \nare absolutely against charging\
    \ and/or increasing water fees. \n \nIn essence, from the theory and concepts\
    \ presented in Part I and the results of the empirical \nsection, the study arrives\
    \ at several conclusions relating to the organization and \nmanagement of irrigation\
    \ water-use in Sudan. \n \n \n \n \n17 \nPart I: Theoretical Framework \n \nHarvest\
    \ of Experiences: The Need of learning from the Past \n \nFor many decades of\
    \ development, the agricultural sector has been „the great white hope“ \nfor most\
    \ of developing countries to compensate the negative effects of rapid population\
    \ \nincreases and to put an end to what is known as vicious circle. To realize\
    \ this goal, many \ncapital-intensive irrigation projects and vast financial investments\
    \ have been made. \nMoreover, because of the scarcity of fertile land and developmental\
    \ water supplies still \navailable for irrigation development, the costs of new\
    \ projects have escalated significantly, \nwhence, irrigation decision makers\
    \ have been turning increasing attention to improving and \nmaintaining existing\
    \ irrigation systems, and the term (tendency toward) newly constructed \nhas been\
    \ mostly replaced by rehabilitated systems. In other words, it is now widely \n\
    recognized that the key to increase agricultural production in the future is the\
    \ improvement \nof existing irrigation systems. Unfortunately, the outcomes of\
    \ vast majority of these \nirrigation systems, either new or rehabilitated, often\
    \ fall short of expectations and differed, \nhowever, distressingly from those\
    \ that had been planned.  \n \nManifold reasons for this flat have been and still\
    \ the target for many researchers and \nstudies. Each one stresses specific reason\
    \ as a determinative. This way of thinking \ncoincides with the same approach\
    \ that has, sometimes, predominated within the scope of \neconomic development\
    \ literature during this period i.e., the 'one best determinative factor', \n\
    where one factor can be enough to explain the phenomenon of underdevelopment!\
    \ \n \nViewing the irrigation system itself has been, for a long, a debatable\
    \ question: is the \nirrigation system a technical process or scientific issue,\
    \ therefore, belongs to natural \nscience?, or socio-technical process having\
    \ several dimensions and, therefore, has to be \nconsidered and analyzed according\
    \ to its comprehensive nature? There is almost universal \nagreement in this field\
    \ that the tasks of irrigation management were seen, at one time, as \nessentially\
    \ ‘technical’ as being within the domain of certain specialists, particularly\
    \ \nengineers (UPHOFF 1991:17). Accordingly, we have used the concept of physical\
    \ or \nengineering irrigation efficiency as a substitute for knowledge of the\
    \ effect of the human \nelement in water management (LEVINE 1980:56). This is\
    \ exactly what is referred to as a \nweakness or defect within the bound of concept\
    \ and at the level of conversion in practice \nthat causes, therefore, the failure\
    \ of irrigation schemes (HUPPERT/WALKER 1988:11). It \nis almost taken for granted\
    \ that if the irrigation sector is developed the way it was done in \nthe past\
    \ (by improving efficiency of use of the land and water base), all other problems\
    \ \nfacing the farmers and the agency will be solved. In contrast, the result\
    \ that has been seen \neverywhere showed that re-orientation of this perspective\
    \ must be done. \n \nThe other theoretical perception of irrigation systems that\
    \ is now widely accepted is to \nunderstand it as a \"socio-technical enterprise\
    \ with organizational and cultural factors \nranking alongside physical and material\
    \ ones\" (UPHOFF 1991:17).11 The design and \noperation of many irrigation systems\
    \ in the developing countries are often inefficient \nbecause the importance of\
    \ the management component and of social constraints has been, \nor is, underestimated\
    \ (LEVINE 1980:51). Poor performance and the bottlenecks in the \n           \
    \                              \n1 For a more detailed discussion of this definition\
    \ see UPHOFF 1986 Chapter1.  \n \n18 \noptimal resource utilization in irrigation\
    \ systems are then not only a consequence of \ntechnical deficiencies in the design\
    \ of these systems but, basically, stem from weaknesses \nin the organizational\
    \ and level of management of the schemes (SAGARDOY 1986:1, \nMANIG 1989:19). A\
    \ conducive institutional arrangement, therefore, is highly required to \nhave\
    \ their full utilization (HAGE and FINSTERBUSCH 1987). \n \nAccording to this\
    \ approach, therefore, it is the management input that ultimately \ndetermines\
    \ the efficiency with which the other input factors...land, labor, and capital..,\
    \ are \nconverted into desirable outputs such as increased physical products,\
    \ higher financial \nreturns to private participation, and improved well-being\
    \ for society as a whole \n(FAIRCHILD and NOBE 1986:381). This management can\
    \ only be effective within an \nappropriate organization. Since that time, a great\
    \ deal of interest in the institutional and \norganizational dimensions of irrigation\
    \ management has overgrown and policy makers \nbegan to formulate strategies for\
    \ the organization of irrigation groups at various levels in \nthe irrigation\
    \ system. A major purpose of these organizations is to structure effective \n\
    linkages between the water users and the system authorities. \n \nAt project level\
    \ also, the center of focus has changed several times, changed. It has for \n\
    long been centered in planning and design on the physical main network of canals\
    \ between \nthe headworks and the tertiary outlets (WALKER/CLEVERINAGE 1989: M.XI.3)\
    \ and, \ntherefore, the control of water at this level. As a result, thinking\
    \ many that technical \nirrigation efficiencies and performances tend to be much\
    \ lower at the watercourse and farm \nlevels (the tertiary canals) than in the\
    \ main water delivery system, the area below the \nturnout has been and still\
    \ is, largely a \"no man's land\" (REDDY 1986:98). \n \nAt the same time, it becomes\
    \ clear though, that there was little use in introducing \nimprovement programs\
    \ at tertiary levels as long as a predictable, adequate and reliable flow \nthrough\
    \ the outlet was not guaranteed (WALKER and CLEVERINAGE 1989: M.XI.3). \nThis,\
    \ therefore, brings to a conclusion that only a comprehensive analysis of all\
    \ the \nnumerous reasons and factors that may be contributing to poor performance\
    \ at the lower \nlevels of a system can indicate the correct mixture of remedies\
    \ required in the correct \nsequence. In other words, organization and management\
    \ at the whole project level need to \nbe fully reviewed, as well as constraints\
    \ at the farmer's level. In this connection, feedback \nbetween all levels is\
    \ necessarily required and subjects like the ecological perspectives, \nparticipation,\
    \ the role of farmers in irrigation management, and the need to respect their\
    \ \ninterests and traditional knowledge, have to be fairly discussed. \n \nEquity\
    \ and allocation of water that consider one of the very important tasks of irrigation\
    \ \nmanagement, if not the most, have been also for long a raised issue. In almost\
    \ every case, \nthe problem of discrepancy along the canal concerning water distribution\
    \ was considered as \na participant factor that characterized, in the first place,\
    \ the large irrigation schemes in \ndeveloping countries. The reasons may have\
    \ a physical base, but often reflect problems in \nsystem management. This phenomenon\
    \ is complex and interlinked with the patterns of \nwealth and power in irrigation\
    \ communities. \n \nInterests and goals conflict of influential groups in irrigation\
    \ communities have also a \nconsiderable effect on determining the degree of technology.\
    \ Choosing appropriate \ntechnology in irrigation systems, as in other economic\
    \ activities, and trying to find a \npossible compromise between the advantages\
    \ and disadvantages of each alternative, is \nanother challenge in developing\
    \ countries. Irrigation development requires and depends on \n \n19 \nadequate\
    \ provision and successful joining of water management technology as well as \n\
    appropriate institutions and organizations for the governance of that technology\
    \ \n(COWARD 1980:27). \n \nAs a result of manifold and manifest problems experienced\
    \ by farmers in many irrigation \nsystems, and the problems experienced by the\
    \ systems themselves in addition to other \nconsiderations, a philosophy has developed\
    \ to the effect that irrigation modernization can \ntake place only with radical\
    \ departures from traditional practice. This results in improving \nthe efficiency\
    \ viewed from the perspective of engineering efficiency: efficiency in use of\
    \ \nwater, efficiency in mechanics of operation and maintenance, and efficiency\
    \ in irrigation \nsystem costs (LEVINE 1980:61). \n \nIntroduction of modern technologies\
    \ allows for a higher productivity and increasing \nsurplus that can be skimmed\
    \ off, although these forms do not correspond to the social and \ncultural systems\
    \ in most of developing countries (MANIG 1989:38). There are ample need \nnowadays,\
    \ for these countries, to thought-out and shape up the present concepts of \n\
    technology practiced in irrigation schemes as a condition for lasting efficiency.\
    \ For \nexample, modern technology is urgently required to solve problems concerning\
    \ land \npreparation, like land leveling, and the seasonal excessive workload\
    \ of farmers during \nperiods of increased water requirement. Moreover, some call\
    \ for resuming application-\noriented, interdisciplinary technological research,\
    \ to determine whether modern technique \nsuch as automated irrigation and leaser\
    \ leveling can guarantee sustainable irrigated \nagriculture in developing countries\
    \ (HÜBENER/WOLF 1991:18). The performance \ncapacity of such technology has to\
    \ be assessed in terms of productivity per unit area, water \nand labor. As more\
    \ furtherance for such idea, one design of sprinkler systems- the center \npivot\
    \ system- which was largely responsible for the rapid expansion of irrigation\
    \ on the \nU.S. high plains in the last decades (POSTEL 1984:39) is recommended\
    \ as a serious \nalternative for the future agriculture in developing countries,\
    \ because of the several \nadvantages regarding increasing labor productivity\
    \ and its considerable effects on the \nagricultural structure in the long run\
    \ (MANIG 1993)2. \n \nMore debatable among the discussions concerning the causes\
    \ of the ubiquitous \ndisappointment of irrigation schemes, is the issue of water\
    \ pricing - pricing adjustments \nversus quantitative control debate.  As we have\
    \ seen, much faith is placed on structural \nadjustment programs concerning water\
    \ pricing, to rescue water use in the irrigated projects \nfrom its predicament.\
    \ Many commentators concur in their view that the profligate waste \nand inefficiency\
    \ in use of irrigation waters are a result from the extraordinary extent to \n\
    which water is not treated as a ‘commodity’. Therefore, many view increasing the\
    \ high \nprice of water as an effective means for inducing optimum irrigation\
    \ water use efficiency. \nWhereas others, on the other hand, feel that high prices\
    \ may actually create a disincentive \nfor optimum water use in the long run and\
    \ recommended, oppositely, other methods like \nrationing or limiting the allowable\
    \ use and shutting off the supply accordingly (KELLER \n1986:346). \n \nWe conclude\
    \ the above by saying that the accumulated experiences show quite that all \n\
    these factors together must be considered, on an equal footing, in order to accomplish\
    \ the \n                                         \n2 The author stressed that\
    \ because of the characteristics of the farming systems in the developing countries,\
    \ \nsuch alternative is not generally recommended. \n \n20 \ngoals of irrigation\
    \ schemes and these can only be achieved through effective management \nand well-structured\
    \ organizations. \n \n \n \n1.  Irrigation Organization and Management: Definitions\
    \ of the Key \n \nConcepts \n \nBefore attempting to discuss and suggest how the\
    \ performance of irrigation organizations \nand management should be improved,\
    \ in order to optimize the use of water, we need \ndefinitions of a few terms\
    \ that will be used frequently. \n \n1.1  Irrigation Systems3  \n \nWell understanding\
    \ of irrigation system; its meaning, characteristics, and forms, is the first\
    \ \nstep in assessing improving the performance of irrigation systems. Kind of\
    \ involved \nsystem, its physical possibilities and constraints as well as the\
    \ human relationships \nassociated with it, sets certain limits on and provides\
    \ certain opportunities for water \nmanagement and its institutional framework\
    \ that one should know before trying to make \nany improvements. \n \n1.1.1  Nature\
    \ And Characteristics of Irrigation Systems \n \nCOWARD (1980a) certify the coordinated\
    \ nature of water management as a take-off \npoint for his definitions of irrigation\
    \ system. Management of water environment often \ndepends on the coordinated action\
    \ of two or more potential water users (for impounding the \nwater, conveying\
    \ it, disposing of the excess.....etc.). Irrigated agriculture therefore \ncharacteristically\
    \ requires coordination of activities. A system of irrigated agriculture then\
    \ \ncan be defined as a landscape to which is added physical structures that impound,\
    \ \ndivert, channel, or otherwise move water from a source to some desired location.\
    \ \nThese structures are operated cooperatively for the purpose of producing food\
    \ or fiber \n(COWARD 1980a:15-16).4 Irrigation units, according to these analyses,\
    \ may be viewed in \na variety of perspectives: as hydrologic entities, as engineering\
    \ networks, as farming \nsystems or as organizational entities. In actuality,\
    \ an irrigation unit is simultaneously all of \nthese perspectives, and irrigation\
    \ development is the task of creating these complex units. It \nis, consequently,\
    \ a task that is concerned with the development not only of landscapes and \n\
    physical structures but also of patterns of interaction and organization. Briefly,\
    \ it must \nconfront the issues of governance and enlist human and other resources\
    \ and procedures to \narrange appropriate institutions and organizations in addition\
    \ to appropriate irrigation \n                                         \n3  According\
    \ to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of the International Agricultural\
    \ Research Center, \nsystem is \"any set of elements or components that are interrelated\
    \ and interact among themselves. \nSpecification of a system implies a boundary\
    \ delimiting the system from its environment. Two systems may \nbe a subsystem\
    \ of another“  (SCHMEHL 1986: 68). A farming system is under managerial control\
    \ and the \nboundary represents the limits of that control (UPTON 1987:5). A functional\
    \ system is characterized by its \nsynergy i.e., all elements in the system (such\
    \ as people, things, and concepts) working together to produce a \ngreater output\
    \ than the sum of the outputs of these elements operating independently (SINGH\
    \ 1988:358). \n4  The basic elements of this definition has been found in VANDERMEER\
    \ (1968), \"changing water control in \na Taiwanese Rice-Field irrigation system,\"\
    \ Annals of the Association of American Geographers (58) pp. \n720-747. \n \n\
    21 \ntechnologies5. Similar to this line of thinking, MÜLLER (1979:59) links up\
    \ three factors in \nhis definition of irrigation system. An irrigation system\
    \ can be defined through the \napplication of water by the people with the object\
    \ of high agricultural production. \n \nLaying stress on the ecological perspectives\
    \ of the agriculture process (the system \nApproach), an irrigation delivery system\
    \ is defined, according to NOBE/SAMPATH \n(1986:5) as \"a created entity with\
    \ complex interdependent social, economic, legal, \nbiochemical and physical factors,\
    \ processes, and procedures designed to transport water \nfrom a source to the\
    \ root zones of plants and remove excess water through horizontal or \nvertical\
    \ drainage. At the farm level, the water input is combined with other farm inputs\
    \ and \nmanaged to produce crops of economic value.“ Thus, a system approach to\
    \ irrigation \nmanagement encompasses the total set of process and interactions\
    \ involved in irrigated \nagriculture- not just the water input. \n \nThis grasp\
    \ of the vital principle of interaction of systems components, which has been\
    \ \ndeveloped since the beginning of seventies, was necessary to overcome the\
    \ greatest \ntechnical and institutional handicap to agricultural development\
    \ in the newly developing \ncountries. \n \nWith a similar approach, EARLY (1983)\
    \ defined an irrigation system as \"the entire set of \nincreasing social, economic,\
    \ biological, and physical factors. objectives, and entities, from \nthe source\
    \ of water through the conveyances to the farm and the land that is irrigated,\
    \ \nincluding the drainage network that removes water excess from the boundary\
    \ of the \nirrigation service area . The fundamental objective of an irrigation\
    \ system is to increase \nagricultural output through improved management of water\"\
    \ (SCHMEHL 1986:86).6 \nThereby, a certain interest in harmony between irrigation\
    \ system and its whole \nenvironmental and experienced background is not only\
    \ necessary but also considered as a \ncondition which must be realized to achieve\
    \ full utilization of the available potentials. \n \nOn the other hand, the social\
    \ dimension of the agriculture process7 have a vital influence \non Walter and\
    \ Cleveringa's definition of irrigation system. It is, accordingly, a system in\
    \ \nwhich persons use water in an organized way and at a specific location so\
    \ that irrigation-\nspecific products and services produced will contribute to\
    \ fulfil the goal of the water users \nand other interested groups (WALTER and\
    \ CLEVERINGA 1989:Vol. 1 p. II.1.2). The \ncharacteristics of irrigation systems\
    \ then are as follows (HUPPERT and WALTER \n1988:35): \n \n− \nsocio-technical:\
    \ stress the coordinated cooperation of and the adapted \ninteraction between\
    \ the social and technical attributes of the system; \n− \nopen: that means, there\
    \ are mutual relationships between the irrigation \nsystem and its environment;\
    \ the ecological, technological, economical, \nadministrative, legal and socio-cultural\
    \ environment; \n                                         \n5  For a good discussion\
    \ of the role of irrigation development in the agricultural development see COWARD\
    \ \n1980a. \n6 One of the subsets of the irrigation system is the farm irrigation\
    \ system, which, in turn, is a subset of the \nfarming system.  \n7 The establishment\
    \ of International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) in Srilanka 1984, has\
    \ been \nindicated that the social dimensions of irrigation system should take\
    \ more attention in the future (KNOTH \n1989: 4).  \n \n22 \n− \ngoal oriented:\
    \ oriented towards goals which are determined through the \ninternal and external\
    \ interest groups. These goals are situational specific. \n \nParts of an irrigation\
    \ system has also, in many cases, the character of non-profit \norganization.\
    \ Goals like profits get back against ones like expanding the production \nsignificantly\
    \ beyond the level of subsistence. The achieved performances are often \nqualitative\
    \ and, thus, hard to be measured and controlled. It is also of interest to be\
    \ noted \nthat because irrigation systems are human enterprises, adaptability,\
    \ learning and \nimprovement should be part of irrigation systems' capacity. \n\
    \ \nIt is almost taken for granted recently, that irrigation systems are not pure\
    \ technical \nstructures, but, in the first place, complex socio-technical structures.\
    \ The technical and \nsocial dimensions of an irrigation system must be comprehended\
    \ as a complex and \ninteracted factors not as a substitute or alternative for\
    \ each other, or as a \"either ... or\" \nquestion. Therefore, any swing from\
    \ one to the other extreme is not useful.  A recent \ndiscussion of the magnitude\
    \ of understanding this vital feature of irrigation systems was \npresented by\
    \ UPHOFF (1991:198-204). He noted that, \"studies of irrigation management \n\
    have satisfied most observers that social and technical factors are so embedded\
    \ in each \nother that it makes no sense even to try to think of irrigation as\
    \ 'mostly' one or the other, or \nto decide that it is some percentage social\
    \ (x percent) and another percentage (100 - x) \ntechnical. This kind of zero-sum\
    \ thinking obscures the extent to which each set of factors \ninfluences the other.\
    \ The most tenable conclusion is that irrigation is best understood as a \ncompound\
    \ socio-technical process\" (UPHOFF  1991:198). \n \nConcentration on one set\
    \ of independent variables and ignore the others leads, certainly, to \nsub-optimal\
    \ outcomes. Optimization usually involves some combination of factors from \n\
    two or more sets to achieve the greatest production possibilities within accepted\
    \ constraints.  \nFor example, when an irrigation system encounters a drainage\
    \ problem with a growing \nextent of waterlogging, some combination of drainage\
    \ structures and changes in operating \nrules is likely to improve the situation\
    \ at less cost (or with most benefit) than if only \nphysical or only managerial\
    \ methods are employed. It is not a matter of solving problems \nfirst on one\
    \ side and then on the other. Rather, there should be concurrent, or at least\
    \ \niterative, examination of possible adjustments in both the socio-organizational\
    \ and \nphysical-technical realms. \n \nTaking these considerations of the nature\
    \ of irrigation system into account, in designing \nstage, make it possible to\
    \ operate and manage it efficiently both from the technical and \nsocial point\
    \ of view. They help in solving the problems which may be faced by improving \n\
    the management in ways that permit water users to participate and share better\
    \ the burdens \nof management with an agency. This approach was applied by OAD\
    \ (1987)8 who found \nthat: \n \n− \nin convential technical designs, if the farm\
    \ system is directly connected to \nthe main system, without intermediate storage,\
    \ this means that water users \ncannot take much responsibility for water distribution.\
    \ Objective of the main \nsystem managers to have maximum stability of flow, by\
    \ keeping discharge \n                                         \n8 For a more\
    \ detailed discussion of the results of applying this approach see: OAD (1982)\

    \ erosion and \nsedimentation, will conflict with those of the water users which\
    \ want \noperational flexibility. On the other hand, in contemporary system design\
    \ \nand operation, large single water sources can be broken down and buffered\
    \ \nby intermediate storage facilities -- stabilizing tanks or small reservoirs\
    \ \nwithin the system. These facilities can be operated by users fairly easily\
    \ \nbecause the volumes of flow from each source are fairly small, well within\
    \ \nfarmers' management capabilities. Such appropriate design of the system in\
    \ \nwhich farmers' participation in managing water is permissible will encourage\
    \ \nthem to develop their organizations. Therefore, dispersed storage facilities\
    \ \nare integrated into the organizational capacities of water users, so that\
    \ \nfarmers can easily vary their irrigation in frequency, duration and discharge.\
    \ \n \n− \nadoption of such approach is not only necessary to solve the problems\
    \ \nconcerning water capture and delivery between the main system level and \n\
    the tertiary or downstream level, and remove the conflict between the tasks \n\
    of systems' management and the users management, but also effective in \nresolving\
    \ the problems concerning water distribution at tertiary level - \nbetween the\
    \ farmers. In a system where the water issued does not respond to \ndownstream\
    \ conditions and depend only on what is done upstream, water \nusers will not\
    \ be able to regulate it and will have no incentive for efficient \nuse of water\
    \ unless the volume being issued is less than users would ideally \nwant for the\
    \ command area. Having gate or orifice control at the field \nchannel level to\
    \ get an adjusted flow is possible when the socio-technical \nconsiderations,\
    \ as applied under the OAD’ conditions, are practiced.9 In a \nsystem that places\
    \ value both on water use efficiency and on equal \ndistribution, with social\
    \ controls activated among farmers through their own \norganizations, one can\
    \ move closer to optimum water use, combining \nstructures that give physical\
    \ control over water with social organizations that \ngive some control over users.\
    \ \n \nIn the final analysis, adopting a socio-technical perspective does not\
    \ give any preordained \nanswers about how to improve irrigation management. Rather,\
    \ it is a way of thinking which \nif adopted throughout irrigation bureaucracies\
    \ can reorient subsequent behavior. It should \nresult in better management decisions\
    \ and strategies. In the same vein, focussing on \nirrigation management leads\
    \ one to view irrigation not only as a socio-technical enterprise \nbut also as\
    \ an organizational-managerial one. It requires drawing on disciplines like \n\
    organization theory and cognitive science. For irrigation management, technical\
    \ (physical \nstructures) and social (organizations, understood as a human activities)\
    \ factors, can be \ndramatized according to this approach, as the hardware and\
    \ software needed for \ncomputerized data processing. Some tradeoff is of course\
    \ possible between them at least in \nthe design stages (UPHOFF 1991:200). \n\
    \ \n1.1.2 Types of Irrigation Systems \n \nIrrigation system analogously vary\
    \ from large to small, and have different physical \nstructures resulting from\
    \ various combination and layouts of parts. COWARD (1980a:27) \n             \
    \                            \n9 The conditions he presumes are more like those\
    \ of Southeast Asia, where the water shortage is relative not \nabsolute as in\
    \ South Asia. \n \n24 \nclassified irrigation systems according to the 'take-over'\
    \ of the management into three \ntypes. They may be community systems, operated\
    \ and maintained by the water users \nthemselves and /or their representatives;\
    \ they may be bureaucratically managed systems, \nfully administered by an agency\
    \ of the government; or they may be jointly managed \nsystems, in which some functions\
    \ are performed by the irrigation agency while others or \nthe responsibility\
    \ of one are more water-user communities. Similarly, addition to the size \nand\
    \ property as a classifying factor, gravity flow irrigation systems10 could be\
    \ classified, \naccording to REDDY (1986:96-9 ) into: \n \n− Individually Owned\
    \ Irrigation Systems: in these systems, farmers manipulate and \ncontrol the water\
    \ on the farm. There is usually no interference from other farmers, \nand the\
    \ farmer-owner can irrigate at his convenience.  The supply of water is usually\
    \ \nfrom a well. \n \n− Community-Managed Irrigation Systems: in such systems,\
    \ performance on the \nfarm depends upon the farmers' ability to control the water\
    \ on his farm and to share \nwater with the other farmers in the command area.\
    \ The water distribution system and \nthe cooperation between the other farmers\
    \ in that command area decides the project \nperformance. \n \n− Large-scale Irrigation\
    \ Systems: A large-scale gravity flow system11consists of three \ncomponents,\
    \ as shown in Figure 1.1: main system, unit command area (similar to \ncommunity-managed\
    \ system), and farm system (individual ownership), each with \ndistinct properties.\
    \ \n \n \nFigure 1.1 Components of Irigation System \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Source: REDDY 1986:96 \n                    \
    \                     \n10 Gravity flow is the most widely used irrigation method\
    \ in the world. \n11 like Gezira Scheme in the Sudan, the major projects in northwest\
    \ Mexico, and the extensive systems of the \nIndian Subcontinent.  \n \n \n25\
    \ \n \nMain System extends from the dam to the various outlets which supply water\
    \ to a group of \nfarmers. The irrigation bureaucracy operates the system. \n\
    \ \nUnit Command Area refers to the piece of land commanded by an outlet. Usually,\
    \ a group \nof farmers is supposed to share the water available at the outlet\
    \ among themselves and \napply the water to their fields. They have not any control\
    \ of the flow rate, duration, or \ntiming of water received at the outlet. \n\
    \ \nFarm System refers to the individual farm in the command of an outlet. The\
    \ farmer \noperates and manages the farm system. The flow rate and its timing\
    \ and duration at an \nindividual farm are influenced by the operation of the\
    \ main system and the system below \nthe outlet. \n \nThe performance of large-scale\
    \ Irrigation Systems depends upon the integrated effort of the \nirrigation bureaucracy\
    \ and the farmers in the command area, and the rules and tools \nprovided for\
    \ operation of the irrigation system. The overall performance of any irrigation\
    \ \nsystem depends upon the performance of individual components (fields, unit\
    \ command \narea, and the main system). The relative magnitude of performance\
    \ of the three components \nvaries from irrigation project to irrigation project,\
    \ and for increased agricultural production \ngood water control and management\
    \ of all three components of the irrigation system is \nnecessary. \n \nIt is\
    \ supposed to be easy to associate irrigation development with large-scale activities12.\
    \ \nThe size of those projects requires the involvement of large-scale public\
    \ agencies that are \nable to recruit the technical personnel required to plan\
    \ and manage complex undertakings \nand to obtain the enormous financial resources\
    \ required for construction (COWARD 1980a \n:24). Some have maintained a very\
    \ elaborate administrative network that extends from the \nwater source to the\
    \ individual farmers' field. The extreme case has been the Gezira Scheme \nin\
    \ the Sudan, where the farmers may have a kind of \"invisible\" involvement in\
    \ actual \nsystem operations. \n \nOften, the organizational patterns of large-scale\
    \ irrigation systems may be characterized as \njoint. In such systems some management\
    \ functions are the responsibility of the agency and \nothers are lodged with\
    \ farmer groups within the command area. The irrigation system under \nsuch organization\
    \ has integrative character which links virtually many farming \ncommunities into\
    \ a unified national water grid that irrigates large scales of farmland. \n \n\
    UPHOFF (1991:32-37) also found that variables like size and organization are more\
    \ \nsuitable for classifying irrigation systems than their structures and technologies.\
    \ This is \n                                         \n12 It is of important also\
    \ to be noted that the small-scale irrigation systems can play a basic role in\
    \ leading \nsuccessful agricultural development. COWARD (1980b) discusses a number\
    \ of examples of \"silent \nsuccess\" traditional, usually small-scale systems.\
    \ These systems offer important insights regarding the \nsolution of organizational\
    \ problems, particularly at the level of the unit. Two interesting examples are\
    \ \nfound in the cases of Philippines and Indonesia. The so-called BISA Program\
    \ (Bario irrigation Service \nAssociation) is largely oriented toward the installation\
    \ of pump systems to service small command areas \n(usually several hundred hectares)\
    \ in the Philippine. The government assistance provide significant \nimprovements\
    \ to critical elements of the physical infrastructure. Approximately the same,\
    \ Indonesia's \nSederhana Program is aimed at developing command areas of 2000\
    \ hectares or less with the use of \nphysical structures that are simple to design\
    \ and construct. \n \n26 \npartly because the physical structure of irrigation\
    \ system is relatively similar across \nvariations in size and technology. He\
    \ noted that \"the main difference found in the layout of \nsystems is in the\
    \ number of level of operation and organization they have.“ This is defined \n\
    by the hierarchy of points at which water can be divided and controlled as shown\
    \ in Figure \n1.2. Number of levels correlates with size, but it does not translate\
    \ directly into size, or vice \nversa. Gravity flow and groundwater systems, when\
    \ one controls for size, are similarly \nconfigured as in Figure 1.2. All have\
    \ a water source with main and subsidiary channels that \ncarry, divide and spread\
    \ the supply. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.2 Irrigation System Structures By Number\
    \ of Levels \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Source:\
    \ UPHOFF 1991:32 \n \n \n \nAlternative modes of organization do diverge across\
    \ large and small sizes of irrigation \nsystems, at least to some extent, and\
    \ provide a basis for classifying it. The principal options \nfor operating an\
    \ irrigation system according to differences in organization are: management \n\
    by agency personnel, or management by water users. Differences in structure, that\
    \ \nmeans, the number of levels sketched in figure 1.2, interact with the variable\
    \ of \norganization and classified three scales of irrigation systems 13 as follows:\
    \ \n \n( a ) small-scale systems have one or two levels of operation and one or\
    \ a few point of \nwater control. These systems usually serve less than 100 acres\
    \ or only several hundreds of \nacres. \n \n( b ) medium-scale systems: have three\
    \ or four levels of operation at which water flow \ncan be reduced and/or divided\
    \ by control structures. Range from about 1000 acres upward \n               \
    \                          \n13 The reason for making these distinctions is that\
    \ management tasks differ considerably in such scale terms.  \n \n \n27 \nto several\
    \ tens of thousands of acres; the maximum is in the range 50,000 to 100,000 \n\
    acres14. \n \n( c ) large-scale systems: have five or more levels, with command\
    \ areas from 50,000 to \n100,000 acres or more, ranging up to a million or more\
    \ in some countries. \n \nUPHOFF et al. (1991) has subdivided these three size\
    \ categories again by mode of \norganization into five types of irrigation systems\
    \ as shown in Figure 1.3. Types (B, C and \nD) encompass the large majority of\
    \ irrigation systems and the largest share of irrigated \nacreage. Type (A) for\
    \ gravity flow systems is infrequent and the costs of its management \nare too\
    \ great. Agencies sometimes undertake tasks for pump systems where the technology\
    \ \nis unfamiliar to farmers and problems of maintenance and fuel supply must\
    \ be overcome. \nThe one type not found is large-scale, user-managed system with\
    \ more than four levels of \noperation and organization, a hypothetical type (F).\

    Source:  UPHOFF et al. (1991) p.36. \n \n \nIt now remains to say that, apart\
    \ from the size, the management of any irrigation systems \nentails the provision\
    \ of an operational framework which makes it possible for farmers to \ncombine\
    \ the water input with other required inputs in order to achieve their goals.\
    \ \n \n1.2  Irrigation Institutions and Organizations \n \n1.2.1.  Irrigation\
    \ Institution \n \nFor the purpose of the elaboration of the strategy of rural\
    \ development, it is necessary to \ndiscuss the terms institutions and organizations.\
    \ The term institution is used in the social \nscience literature to refer to\
    \ many concepts. It can refers to a specific organization or to a \ncertain established\
    \ human relationships, such as the family. Organizations are then one type \n\
    \                                         \n14 Medium-sized projects may by defined,\
    \ according to SAGARDOY (1986:15), as those which are too \nsmall to allow consideration\
    \ of unified or multipurpose project agencies (owing to their relatively high\
    \ \nadministrative costs) but which nevertheless require a substantial input of\
    \ professional staff to operate and \nmaintain them. A specialized water management\
    \ organization, in general, is likely to be most feasible on \nmedium-sized projects.\
    \ Small projects, in turn, are definable as those in which official staff are\
    \ either not \nrequired or not available to operate and maintain the main water\
    \ delivery system, except perhaps for the \nheadworks. They are typically in the\
    \ 50-200 ha size range, with between 40 and 100 members and depend \non simple\
    \ technology (e.g. simple diversion weirs of boulders or brushwood). \n \n28 \n\
    of institution (families and markets are other examples) (HAGE/FINSTERBUSCH 1987:2).\
    \ \nIt can be also used to denote the rules that individuals use to order specific\
    \ relationships \nwith one another. TANG/OSTROM (1993) asserts this last sense,\
    \ viewing an institution as \n\"the rules actually used (rules-in-use or working\
    \ rules) by a set of individuals to organize \nrepetitive activities that produce\
    \ outcomes affecting those individuals and potentially \naffecting others\" (p.\
    \ 4). An irrigation institution is therefore \"the set of working rules for \n\
    supplying and using irrigation water in a particular location.“ These working\
    \ rules as \ndefined by OSTROM (1986) are used to determine who is eligible to\
    \ make decisions in \nsome arena, what actions are allowed or constrained, what\
    \ procedures must be followed, \nwhat information must or must not be provided,\
    \ and what costs and payoffs will be \nassigned to individuals as a result of\
    \ their actions. They are, as pointed out by COMMONS \n(1957), „those actually\
    \ used, mentioned, and enforced when individuals make choices in \noperational\
    \ or collective-choice settings“ (TANG/OSTROM 1993:4). Institutions \ntherefore,\
    \ according to the above, shape human behavior and the pattern of human \ninteractions\
    \ and their results. \n \nInstitutions are the social rules, conventions, and\
    \ other elements of the structural framework \nof social interaction (BARDHAN\
    \ 1989:1). The close relationship and interaction between \ninstitutions and the\
    \ social processes were further stressed and implied as a focus to make it \n\
    easy to understand to what extent they influence each others. COWARD (1980a:17-9)\
    \ \ndefines institution as \"a concept associated with ideal behavior and expectations\
    \ and can \nbe used as a generic concept for the variety of rules that help to\
    \ pattern social behavior: \nnorms, folkways, mores, customs, convention, fashion,\
    \ etiquette, law\" He argues that an \nunderstanding of the basic relationship\
    \ between institutions and social structure requires \nrecognition of the frequent\
    \ inconsistency between 'what people believe should occur (the \ninstitutional\
    \ element) and what actually occurs (the structural element)' A major reason for\
    \ \nthis inconsistency is that „changes in the social or nonsocial environment\
    \ either make it \ndifficult or impossible to act in certain established ways\
    \ or make it easy or possible to act in \ncertain new ways“. Change in either\
    \ the institutional or the social structural component \ncreates demand for change\
    \ in the other. \n \nIn such analysis, where institutions are defined as „clusters\
    \ of roles, norms and societal \nconcepts“, organizations are then seen as „the\
    \ instrumental concretizations of institutional \npatterns“ (KÖTTER 1988:18).\
    \ In this respect, MANIG (1989:6-7) take the view that \ninstitutions are \"the\
    \ regulating mechanisms of social processes.“ These regulating \nmechanisms, that\
    \ are also assumed or implemented by organizations, are directly \ninfluenced\
    \ by society's values, norms and historical experiences. Institutions as defined\
    \ by \nMANIG are: „those stable regulatory and organizational principles and rules\
    \ which \ngovern interaction processes between the people themselves and, in this\
    \ context, the \nenvironment and which are recognized and sanctioned by the societies\
    \ in which they are \nfound“ They are, therefore, part of the culture. Organizations\
    \ and associations in this view \nare part of the institutional framework of a\
    \ society, as executive organs, put into practice \nand enforce institutional\
    \ regulative principles; they should not, however, be regarded as \ninstitutions\
    \ themselves, argued MANIG. \n \nWithin the scope of this discussion, some found\
    \ the distinction between the terms \ninstitutions and organizations, is a distinction\
    \ without a difference (RUTTAN 1978; \nRUTTAN and HAYAMI 1984). Where an institution\
    \ is defined as the set of behavioral \nrules that govern a particular pattern\
    \ of action and relationships, and an organization is \ngenerally seen as a decision-making\
    \ unit - a family, a bureau - that exercises control of \n \n29 \nresources (RUTTAN\
    \ 1978:328-9).15 The authors find the broad view which includes both \nconcepts\
    \ most useful for the purpose of their studies (RUTTAN/HAYMI 1984:204). \nInstitutions\
    \ in this analysis are then the rules of a society or of organizations that facilitate\
    \ \ncoordination among people by helping them form expectations which each person\
    \ can \nreasonably hold in dealing with others. They reflect the conventions that\
    \ have evolved in \ndifferent societies regarding the behavior of individuals\
    \ and groups relative to their own \nbehavior and the behavior of others16. In\
    \ the area of economic relations, they provide \nassurance respecting the action\
    \ of others, and give order and stability to expectations in this \ncomplex and\
    \ uncertain world. They must be, then, stable for an extended time period. But,\
    \ \nthey must also change, like technology, if development is to occur. \n \n\
    Irrigation agencies are variously referred to either as Organization or as Institution\
    \ as if \nthe two terms were identical (UPHOFF ET AL. 1991). Though distinction17\
    \ between both \nterms are necessary, one gains the most insight by regarding\
    \ them as overlapping. \nConsidering the irrigation agency as an organization\
    \ means „structures of recognized and \naccepted roles.“ As opposed to this, conceiving\
    \ of the irrigation agency as an institution \nmeans examining it with a view\
    \ to pinpointing the „complexes of norms and behaviors that \npersist over time\
    \ by serving collectively valued purposes“ (UPHOFF ET AL. \n1991:205).Whence,\
    \ an irrigation agency by definition is always at least an organization. To \n\
    be an Institution depends on the extent to which it has established its value,\
    \ solidly, \npervasively, even transcendently, in many if not all people's minds18.\
    \ HUNTINGTON \n(1965) views: „Institutions are stable, valued, recurring patterns\
    \ of behavior. \nOrganizations \nand \nprocedures \nvary \nin \ntheir \ndegree\
    \ \nof \ninstitutionalization... \nInstitutionalization is the process by which\
    \ organizations and procedures acquire value \nand stability“ (RUTTAN 1978:329)19.\
    \ \n \n1.2.2.  Irrigation Organization \n \n1.2.2.1.  Theoretical observations\
    \ \n \nDuring the first part of the twentieth century there developed many specific\
    \ concepts about \norganizations. But there is almost universal agreement within\
    \ the field that, over the last \n                                         \n\
    15 He argues, what one organization - a household or a firm, for example - accepts\
    \ as an externally given \nbehavioral rule is the product of tradition or decision\
    \ by another organization, such as organized labor, a \nnation’s court system,\
    \ or a religion. Thereby, a useful analogy can be drawn between these concepts\
    \ of \nthe institution and the organization, on the one hand, and external and\
    \ internal scale of economics, on the \nother analogy. This view based on that\
    \ of VINER (1932) who insisted that the external economies of \nscale enjoyed\
    \ by one firm or industry come about as a result of internal economies in some\
    \ other firm or \nindustry (RUTTAN 1978:329). \n16 This is consistent with the\
    \ view expressed by both COMMONS (1950) and KNIGHT (1952). This \ndefinition also\
    \ encompasses the classification employed by DAVIS and NORTH (1971:204). The purpose\
    \ \nof such inclusive definition, as the authors argue, is: „to be able to consider\
    \ changes in the rules of \nconventions that govern behavior (a) within economic\
    \ units such as families, firms and bureaucracies, (b) \namong economic units\
    \ as in the cases of the rules that govern market relationships, and © between\
    \ \neconomic units and their environment, as in the case of relationship between\
    \ a firm and a regulatory \nagency“ (RUTTAN/HAYAMI 1984:.204). \n17 The distinction\
    \ between 'Organization' and 'Institution' has been discussed in more detail in:\
    \ UPHOFF \n(1986), Local Institutional Development: An Analytical Sourcebook,\
    \ with cases. West Hartford, CT: \nKumarian Press. \n18 In this view, then, one\
    \ can refer to Gezira Scheme in Sudan as the sole irrigation institution and the\
    \ other \nschemes as organizations. \n19 See Chapter 3..... \n \n30 \ntwo decades\
    \ or so, the sociology of organizations has experienced a series of profound \n\
    changes as to the way in which its subject matter is defined and the manner in\
    \ which it is \nresearched (REED 1992). In this respect, both the way in which\
    \ the phenomenon of \norganization is characterized and the theoretical and methodological\
    \ equipment, though \nmost appropriate to its analysis, have undergone a series\
    \ of highly significant \ntransformation over the period20. \n \nThere are a network\
    \ of concepts that allow the researcher to identify the relationships \nbetween\
    \ selected components when he try to understand the nature of organizations and\
    \ the \nsocial processes through which they are produced and reproduced. Over\
    \ time, this network \nof concepts becomes more complex. Consequently, analytical\
    \ frameworks are never fixed \nand immutable, they necessarily change over time\
    \ to accommodate new ideas and empirical \nfindings (REED 1992:74). \n \nOrganization\
    \ theory, as WHITLEY (1988:65) has argued, is more like a \"fragmented \nadhocray\"\
    ; that is, a field of study characterized by: „limited reputational control over\
    \ \nintellectual goals and priorities, low degrees of coordination of research\
    \ strategies and \nresults around common theoretical purposes, and subject to\
    \ the conflicting pressures of \nspecificity and applicability on the one hand,\
    \ and generality and academic respectability on \nthe other\". In comparison with\
    \ the rationally structured and tightly controlled disciplinary \nregimes operative\
    \ in natural sciences, intellectual plurality and organizational fluidity are\
    \ \ninherent within the field of organizational studies (REED 1992:131)21. Anyhow,\
    \ the theory \nof organization is described as immature and known with the paucity\
    \ of clear definitions. \n \nAs broad generalization one can argue that, the definitions\
    \ of an organization differ \naccording to the difference in the criteria which\
    \ consider the basis of this definition e.g., \nviewing the organization itself,\
    \ the appropriate unit of analysis or the emphasized core \nissue within it, the\
    \ elements or subsystems which constitute the organizations, and above \nall,\
    \ the used analytical perspective. \n \nWithin the framework of their discussions\
    \ about the idea of organization, SCOTT and \nMITCHELL (1972:7-8), argued what\
    \ they refer to as the organizational Vehicle. The \norganization carries material\
    \ resources, technologies, human skills, and values. It provides \nthe vehicle\
    \ whereby productive factors are assembled, transformed into utilities of value,\
    \ \nand distributed in the form of consumable goods and services. Intimately associated\
    \ with \nthis vehicle is the management of an organization. Management here is\
    \ essentially the \nhuman instrumentality that activates organizations and controls\
    \ their course. Through \nmanagers, who well understand their roles, the organization\
    \ can optimally achieve the \nobjectives for which it is established. According\
    \ to the determinate role of human factors, \nthey view Organization as a human\
    \ invention, created by man to help him achieve ends \nwhich he could not possibly\
    \ accomplish individually. So, Organizations are not only \nvehicles but also,\
    \ with the help of the human instrument, factories. Organization is, in fact,\
    \ \nthe spot where the production function actually takes place. \n \n       \
    \                                  \n20 For a succinct review of the ”crisis”\
    \ thesis that applies to the branch of sociology concerned with \norganizations\
    \ see HASSARD, 1993. \n21 It was the target for most scholars of the institution\
    \ theory to overcome this problem. One of the prominent \nin this field refers\
    \ to that by saying: „I want to see us develop an economic theory similar to that\
    \ found in \nthe natural sciences“ ( COASE 1993:96). \n \n31 \nWithin the scope\
    \ of resemblance to a carrier, REED (1992:73), points out that reviewing \nof\
    \ the competing sociological interpretations which have been offered of complex\
    \ \norganizations, organizations can be viewed as \"the crucial 'carriers' and\
    \ 'products' of \nmodernity.“ The transition from traditionalism to modernity\
    \ is characterized in terms of \nan organizational revolution which has swept\
    \ away all vestiges of the moral foundation and \nprimary social institutions\
    \ that once integrated the individual into a wider community and \nprovided the\
    \ social bonds through which stable personal identities could be forged . He \n\
    speaks of Darwinian Struggle for survival and maintain the transformational feature\
    \ of the \norganization under the influence of social norms and fragmented institutions.\
    \ Organization \ntheory becomes both a celebration of and a warning against „the\
    \ structural transformations \nand cultural movements that modernity has let loose\
    \ through a process of institutional \ntransformation driven by the search for\
    \ universal rationality, efficiency and effectiveness“. \n \n1.2.2.2. Organizational\
    \ Perspectives \n \nMost debates in organizational analysis can be reduced to\
    \ discussions of the appropriate \nunit of analysis. Every perspective has emphasized\
    \ the unit which considered as the main \ninterpreter of the organization as an\
    \ idea and function. These units of analysis, or the focus \nof attention, can\
    \ be the whole organization; the individual; and the groups acting within the\
    \ \norganization. According to this approach, BACHARACH/LOWlER (1980:210-13) have\
    \ \ndistinguished three theoretical perspectives: \n \nThe Rational Managerial\
    \ Perspectives \n \nThe unit of analysis is the organization as a whole. Organization\
    \ according to this analysis \nis a rational system of interdependent units functionally\
    \ held together by a common \ngoal. Attention here is focused on organizational\
    \ structure (size, vertical and horizontal \ndifferentiation, role specialization,\
    \ span of control and so forth) and work processes \n(communication, interaction,\
    \ centralization, and the like). Such a perspective assumes a \nuniform effect\
    \ of structure and process across the organization, combining across to create\
    \ \none measure of each variable for the total organization. One of the limitations\
    \ of this \nperspective is its failure to depict organizations as dynamic entities\
    \ subject to conflict and \nchange. Structure has been refined in such a manner\
    \ that it, rather than action, has become \nthe focal point of analysis. Even\
    \ when attention is paid to processes, they are \nconceptualized as if they were\
    \ organizational structures. \n \nThe Individualistic Perspective \n \nThe unit\
    \ of analysis is the individuals acting within the organization and the role that\
    \ they \noccupy. This perspective casting the organization as a composite of individual\
    \ actors and \nindividual actions. Here, understanding the role of individual\
    \ is a precondition for \nunderstanding the organization. In contrast to the twin\
    \ assumptions of homogeneity and \nobjectivity that guide the rational managerial\
    \ perspective, the individualistic perspective \nassumes the organizations are\
    \ heterogeneous and subjective. Moreover, while this \nperspective is based on\
    \ a phenomenological bias that implies a focus on the individual, \ntheorists\
    \ tend to use the individual model as a metaphor for the functioning of the \n\
    organization. As limitations of this perspective, overemphasis on the chaotic\
    \ nature of \naction organization, and failure to consider the political and structural\
    \ context that impinge \non an individuals cognition and actions, are mentioned.\
    \ \n \n \n32 \nOrganizational economics (agency theory and transaction costs theory)\
    \ is to mention here \nbecause of the central role given to the action of individual\
    \ actors, that is to ‘rational \neconomic man’. The individual is seen to act\
    \ in his or her own self-interest, consistent with \nbeing a rational economic\
    \ ‘man’, and this leads to postulates of opportunism and guile in \nmanagerial\
    \ behavior. Thus, in contrast to more collectivity-level or structuralist models\
    \ in \norganizational studies which speak of the organization as a collective\
    \ entity pursuing the \norganizational goal, organizational economics desegregates\
    \ the organization into \nindividuals, each of whom pursues his or her individual\
    \ self-interest (DONALDSON \n1995:169-70). The lack of explanation of organizational\
    \ action by reference to the \nindividual action of motivated individuals has\
    \ been a persistent criticism of collectivity-\nlevel structuralist explanations\
    \ such as those in structural contingency theory. The new \nindividualism of organizational\
    \ economics has the potential to make good some of these \ndeficiencies.  \n \n\
    The Group Bias Perspectives \n \nBACHARACH and LOWLER (1980) believe, on the other\
    \ side, that the main void in \norganizational theory is the lack of concern with\
    \ politics. To fill this void, they have \nbroken from the perspectives that dominate\
    \ intraorganizational analysis22 which ignore the \npower politics involved in\
    \ interest groups and coalition bargaining. As empirical middle \nground between\
    \ concentrations on aggregate and on individual data, an alternative \nperspective\
    \ is an organizational model that based on the group as the unit of analysis.\
    \ It \nenvisions the work group as the primary focus for the study of organizations.\
    \ \n \nThe basic unit of traditional political analysis is the sub-group - for\
    \ example, class interests, \nclass relations, and class conflict; the basic unit\
    \ of apolitical perspective is the total system. \nThe current comparative interorganizational\
    \ research, with the exception of some cases, has \nonly peripherally treated\
    \ subgroups and has tended to ignore subgroup differences, thereby \npreventing\
    \ any systematic examination of the political tensions inherent in organizations.\
    \ \nThis perspective maintain, on the other side, the coalitions and bargaining\
    \ as a two \ninterrelated phenomena which form the foundation of an understanding\
    \ of organizational \npolitics. It has attempted to integrate the social psychology\
    \ of politics with the structural \nanalysis of organizations. Thereby, Organizations\
    \ are best conceptualized as political \nbargaining system. \n \nIn this respect,\
    \ where the organizational model is based on the group as the unit of analysis,\
    \ \nREED (1992:84-92), discusses two other analytical frameworks which view organizations\
    \ \nas negotiated orders and power relationships. The first framework, as opposed\
    \ to \nsystems theory, treat organizations as the temporary product or outcome\
    \ of interactional \nprocess between individuals and groups that is always open\
    \ to revision and \nreformulation by them. The emphasis, according to this framework,\
    \ is on the structure in \nprocess. Structures have to be configured, confirmed\
    \ and reconfirmed by the fundamental \nnegotiating processes that give them 'organizational\
    \ life' and meaning in the first place. \nOrganizational structures are seen to\
    \ be firmly embedded within a’dense‘ and intricate \n‘Web‘ of interaction which\
    \ gives them 'life' and relevance for the negotiation of social order \nbetween\
    \ individuals and groups with very different interests and interpretations of\
    \ what \n                                         \n22 He refers to three perspectives\
    \ where : organizational actors considered as the passive entities presented in\
    \ \norganizational psychology; organizations are viewed as loosely coupled systems;\
    \ organization are viewed \nas structurally coordinated monoliths.  \n \n33 \n\
    'ought to happen'. The recognition of conflicting interests and values as integral\
    \ features of \nthe process through which organizational order is negotiated leads\
    \ to a consideration of \npower relationships. \n \nThis framework concentrates\
    \ on the theoretical reconstruction of reciprocal processes of \nnegotiation over\
    \ time and the manner in which they lead to the fabrication of relationships \n\
    and arrangements that simultaneously facilitate and constrain the creation of\
    \ new \n'organizational orders'. The clearest articulation of this framework is\
    \ to be discovered in the \ndevelopment of a social action approach from the late\
    \ 1960s or early 1970s onwards. \nSocial action theorists called attention to\
    \ the social, historical and cultural contexts in which \n'organizational projects'\
    \ were mobilized. Therefrom, negotiated order theorists - whether \ntheir focus\
    \ is on ‘high’ or ‘low’ politics within the organization - view it as organized\
    \ \nanarchism or loosely coupled networks precariously held together by negotiating\
    \ process \nand the power relationships emerging out of them. This approach then\
    \ is focused on micro-\nlevel negotiating processes and the middle range structures\
    \ which they produce. In other \nwords, compared with the structural perspective,\
    \ this approach lay too much stress on \nstructure in process and not enough to\
    \ the structuring of process. This limitation was the \nstarting point for the\
    \ development of other perspective which views organization as \nstructures of\
    \ power and domination. \n \nThe power framework as argued by REED (1992:93-102),\
    \ is an attempt to overcome this \npolarization in preferred analytical logics\
    \ - between structural or environmental \ndeterminism and organizational choice\
    \ - by focusing on the more permanent configurations \nof power and domination\
    \ which simultaneously constrain and enable the technical and \npolitical activities\
    \ of social actors - whether these are constituted as individuals or as \ncorporate\
    \ groups. Formal or complex organizations must be approached initially as the\
    \ \ntools or mechanisms through which these dominant groups secure and maintain\
    \ the \nconditions necessary for their social reproduction and survival over time.\
    \ Accordingly, \norganizations are contested terrains in which various groups\
    \ and coalitions struggle to \nimpose their preferences on structural designs\
    \ and administrative processes. \n \nAs such, organizations are strategic sites\
    \ for the conduct of pervasive power struggles \nbetween opposing groups over\
    \ the control structures and practices - and their supporting \nrationales - through\
    \ which work is organized, and the distributional outcomes which these \nmechanisms\
    \ produce. In this sense, organizations are locales or arenas in which endemic\
    \ \nconflicts over the distribution of power and the allocation of resources flowing\
    \ from it are \ncarried on. Thus, enshrined within all work organizations there\
    \ lies a dialectic of control; \nthat is, a dynamic process of struggle between\
    \ contending groups to secure and command \nthe conditions through which collective\
    \ action is made possible. In this respect, the \ndialectic of control is the\
    \ dynamic process which underlies the changing balance of power \nexperienced\
    \ in all complex organizations and the crucial effect which it has on the capacity\
    \ \nto shape and reshape the structure and practices through which domination\
    \ is \nsimultaneously protected and challenged at the level of routine everyday\
    \ life or the level of \nstrategic decision-making and corporate governance23.\
    \ \n                                         \n23 In this connection, KARPIK (1978),\
    \ raises three questions; how ought we to study the social orientations \nof the\
    \ actors who make up the organization?, should the 'corporation' be considered\
    \ as a unitary power \nsystem or as the place where a plurality of  power systems\
    \ interlock?, and how can we explain the \nformation of collective choices through\
    \ the relationships of opposition or alliance which are formed \nbetween the individuals\
    \ and groups making up the organization? He concluded that power relationships\
    \ \nare not merely internal to the organization. \n \n34 \n \nThe Cultural / Symbolic\
    \ Perspective \n \nThe symbolic or cultural framework shifts the focus of attention\
    \ away from 'organizations' \nto organizing; it suggests that the process of organizing\
    \ is most appropriately \nconceptualized as the enactment of cultural development\
    \ and transformation. Culture \nbecomes the basic resources and process through\
    \ which social action and interaction are \ncontinually constructed and reconstructed\
    \ to form a shared 'organizational reality'. Here, the \nsubjective- rather than\
    \ the objective- aspects of organizational reality become the central \nfocus\
    \ for analysis in so far as they call attention to the socially constructed frames\
    \ of value \nand meaning through which coordinated social life becomes possible\
    \ \n \nThe fundamental process of cultural enactment and reaffirmation is dependent\
    \ on and \nexpressed through specific symbolic forms such as values, ideologies,\
    \ rituals and \nceremonies. As a social expression of human consciousness and\
    \ creation, complex \norganizations have to be sustained through generative processes\
    \ that yield and shape \nmeaningful interaction. Organizational structures and\
    \ the patterns of symbolic relationships \nand meanings sustained through the\
    \ constitutive processes of human interaction and the \ncultural forms by which\
    \ they are expressed such as language, symbols, myths and stories. \nOrganizational\
    \ membership usually offers the prospect of more than one cultural identity \n\
    and the forms of social conduct that it supports. The dominant cultures supported\
    \ and \nreinforced by management often contain contradictory messages as to what\
    \ to believe and \nhow to act.  This dominant cultures are unavoidably in competition\
    \ with 'unofficial' sub-\ncultures - such as those entailed in membership of departmental,\
    \ professional, craft and \npolitical groups - which offer alternative sources\
    \ of meaning and legitimation for action that \ndepart from approved norms. Any\
    \ large-scale organization will contain competing, not to \nsay conflicting, sources\
    \ of cultural creation, enactment and mobilization which make the \ntask of achieving\
    \ effective cultural control even more fraught with uncertainty and \nambiguity.\
    \ \n \nManagers play a pivotal role in this analytical framework. A dramatic illustration\
    \ of the \ndeep involvement of managers in processes of cultural production and\
    \ enactment can be \nseen in the contribution of PFEFFER (1981). He has argued\
    \ that \"technical rationality is \nthe 'religion' of formal or complex organizations\
    \ and managers are its ‘high priests’. But, \na conception of organizations as\
    \ cultural artifacts and symbolic constructions soon reveal \nthe ideological\
    \ status and political function of this religion“. 24 \n \nAs limitation of the\
    \ cultural/symbolic approach, as mentioned by some commentators25, is \nits very\
    \ focus on the micro-process through which organizational reality is defined and\
    \ \norganizational order constructed. They have argued that the cultural/symbolic\
    \ framework \nentails a logic of analysis which unavoidably directs attention\
    \ away from the extra-\norganizational structures of economic and political power\
    \ and domination in which \nideological production and identity work must be situated.\
    \ By focusing on the status of \norganizational participants and managers in particular\
    \ as creators of symbolic orders \nsupporting and legitimating shred meanings,\
    \ cultural theorists seem to neglect the \n                                  \
    \       \n24 In contrast, both agency theory and transaction cost theory see corporate\
    \ managers as inherently \nuntrustworthily (DONALDSON 1995:166). \n25 See, for\
    \ example, THOMPSON, P. and McHUGH, D. (1990), Work Organization: A Critical Introduction\
    \ \n(Macmillan, London). \n \n \n35 \nencompassing societal structures in which\
    \ these processes are located (REED 1992:103-\n12). This has encouraged the development\
    \ of an alternative approach that attempts to \novercome the theoretical separation\
    \ or duality between 'structure' and 'process' that seems to \npervade organizational\
    \ analysis. This analytical framework treats organizations as 'Social \npractices'\
    \ which require simultaneously reference to structure both as a constraint on\
    \ \nactions and as a resource facilitating action that transforms established\
    \ arrangements. \n \n1.2.2.3. Organizations as a Social Systems \n \nThe systems\
    \ approach is one of the cornerstone in the theory of organizations. It is the\
    \ most \nwidely perspective which considered the basis and point d'appui for the\
    \ latter perspectives. \nSystems theory became established as the intellectual\
    \ orthodoxy in the 1950s and shaped \nthe overall agenda to which alternative\
    \ perspective responded in a critical and creative \nfashion. The main assumption\
    \ of this framework is: organizations are social units \ndirected to the achievement\
    \ of collective goals or the fulfillment of institutional needs \nfor the wider\
    \ society or environment of which they are a constituent part. The starting \n\
    point for the systems framework is a conception of organization as a goal-oriented,\
    \ \npurposeful system constituted through a set of common underlying abstract\
    \ variables or \ndimensions relating to structural properties which are geared\
    \ to the functional needs of a \nmore inclusive social system. This framework\
    \ then present an institutional analysis of \nstructural forms. \n \nStarting\
    \ from this basis, MANIG (1989:5-6) defines the organizations as institutional\
    \ term \nhas specific characteristics with reference to the social process between\
    \ members, the \ndivision of labor, and their structures. Organizations, as he\
    \ pointed out, denote institutional \nentities in which persons or groups collaborate\
    \ in view of achieving their goals. The \nstructure is oriented towards duration\
    \ and stability and is set up systematically. \nOrganizations therefore are characterized\
    \ as goal-oriented social entities having a formal \nstructure and through which\
    \ the members orientate their activities towards achieving the \nobjectives. The\
    \ formal structure should be understood as a system of rules which \ndetermine\
    \ the relations between the members of the organizations. To point out the \n\
    relationship between organization and management he concludes the definition of\
    \ the \nformer as the framework within which the latter (as a function) is realized\
    \ and both of \nthem are always components of a society’s institutional systems\
    \ . \n \nIn this context, the strict definition used by HAGE/FINSTERBUSCH (1987:11)\
    \ summarize \nthe elements or subsystems which constitute and shape an organization\
    \ in seven elements. \nOrganization is \"a social collective which has existed\
    \ for at least five years, including at \nleast ten paid employees who work largely\
    \ full time throughout the year, use essentially the \nsame core technology, and\
    \ are arranged in a variety of prescribed positions designed to \nachieve some\
    \ specific collective output(s)“. The distinguishing elements then are: size,\
    \ \nduration, extent of reliance on salary, division of labor with occupational\
    \ skills, technology-\nproduct group and specific outputs or goals26. \n     \
    \                                    \n26 KAST and ROSENZWEIG (1974) have refereed\
    \ to five primary subsystems: goals and values, \ntechnology, structure, psychosocial\
    \ and managerial. \n \n36 \nThe systems approach facilities understanding the\
    \ important forces affecting organizations \nas well as the development of a comprehensive\
    \ body of knowledge concerning their \ninternal atmosphere and external environment.\
    \ This body of knowledge provides the \nfoundations for management practice. Organizations\
    \ therefore are a subsystems of their \nenvironmental suprasystems. They are,\
    \ accordingly, open systems in interaction with \ntheir environment and are continually\
    \ changing (KAST/ ROSENZWEIG 1974). \n \nThereby, the systems framework analysis\
    \ centers around the forms of structural design and \nthe environmental conditions.\
    \ Individual and group recalcitrance is a recurring problem that \nall organizations\
    \ must face and respond to. One of the roles of management here is to \nachieve\
    \ balance or equilibrium between the various segments or subsystems within the\
    \ \noverall structure. Management must be used as equilibrium mechanism to ensure\
    \ \nreadjustment for the disturbed balance between the individual and the organization\
    \ and \nbetween the latter and the environment under which it exist. \n \nPARSONS\
    \ (1956) constructs a theory of organization on the basis of the principle laid\
    \ \ndown in the social system (1951). PARSONS views organizations as system both\
    \ in the \nown right and as constituent parts of larger systems. He suggests that\
    \ ”while \norganizations are sub-units of larger environments, they themselves\
    \ possess several layers \nof, for example, individuals, groups and departments.“\
    \ The basic problem for organizations \nis then „to integrate, both vertically\
    \ and horizontally, the functions which operate at \ndifferent levels” (HASSARD\
    \ 1993:23-4). \n \nLater on, as innovation, to make the systems analysis more\
    \ dynamic - that is, better \nequipped to explain the causes and consequences\
    \ of organizational change, an 'open-\nsystem' view of the organization has been\
    \ developed. The most influential expression of \nthis approach in recent years\
    \ has been contingency theory. Both THOMPSON (1967) and \nLOWRENCE and LORSCH\
    \ (1967) developed their analysis of the interdependence \nbetween organizations\
    \ and their environments within an open-systems approach that \nregards the organization\
    \ as an 'indeterminate' structure interdependent with its environment \nand facing\
    \ the economic, informational, technological and social uncertainties which the\
    \ \nlatter presents. They maintain the initial logic of the systems framework\
    \ in viewing the \norganization as a reactive or adaptive social unit which is\
    \ largely determined by the \ncharacter of the environment in which it functions.\
    \ They continue, to a considerable extent, \nin an analytical tradition that sees\
    \ the organization as being largely, if not totally a \n‘prisoner’ or a ‘victim’\
    \ of its environment, rather than as a creator and manipulator of its \ntask and\
    \ institutional setting (REED 1992:75-84). \n \nThe most related perspective here,\
    \ which is always referred to in discussing irrigation \nsystems, is the socio-technical\
    \ systems perspective. Treating organizations as open socio-\ntechnical systems\
    \ is still a dominant perspective in organizational theory. It is to be found,\
    \ \nfor example, in the 'quality of working life' movement which is preoccupied\
    \ with the \nhumanization of work through socio-technical design. CHERNS/DAVIS\
    \ (1975) propose \nthat far from imposing economic costs humanizing work through\
    \ socio-technical design \nyields social, personal, and economic gains. This proposition\
    \ is also reinforced by MILLER \n(1975) who points out, \"the historical account\
    \ reveals that attempts to maximize efficiency \nof the technical system, if social\
    \ and psychological needs are not also satisfied, lead to sub-\noptimal performance\"\
    \ and that \"the converse is also true\" (BLUNT/JONES 1992). \n \n \n37 \nStudying\
    \ organizations from a socio-technical systems point of view began in earnest\
    \ in the \nearly 1950s in England. The approach differs from earlier ones, such\
    \ as scientific \nmanagement and human relations  27, in that it is not biased\
    \ towards either the technical or \nthe social aspects of work and organization,\
    \ but gives emphasis to both, and their \ninteraction with the environment. In\
    \ other words, the organization is perceived as an open \nsystem, susceptible\
    \ to external influences, and interdependent with its environment. \n \nRegarding\
    \ an organization as an open systems, as KATZ (1966) and BARKO/PASMORE \n(1986)28\
    \ have in detail exposed, means that it is seen as possessing similar attributes\
    \ to a \nbiological organism. More concretely, organizations take as their inputs,\
    \ people, \ninformation and materials; productive work is carried out within the\
    \ system to transform \nthese inputs, and a finished product or services eventually\
    \ emerge (BLUNT/JONES \n1992:87). Socio-technical organizations has been therefore\
    \ described, according to TRIST \n(1981), as \"ones in which the core interface\
    \ consists of the relations between a human \nsystem and a non-human system\"\
    \ (UPHOFF ET AL. 1991:218). \n \nAt the applied level, there are little detailed\
    \ analysis of socio-technical systems theory, \nparticularly in the developing\
    \ countries. KIGGUNDU (1986), based on his study in Kenya \n(1985), found that\
    \ applications of socio-technical systems theory in developing countries \nhad\
    \ been \"spotty and limited in scope.“ He asserts that, in contrast to the principles\
    \ of \nsocio-technical systems theory which espouse open systems and democratic\
    \ values and \npractices in the workplace, organizations in most developing countries\
    \ are bureaucratic, \nmechanistic and autocratic. He lists the factors which,\
    \ he claims, cause problems in \nattempting to apply socio-technical systems thinking\
    \ in developing countries, including29: \n \n\"Organization in developing countries\
    \ exhibit disfunctional modes of conflict management, \ncloser social and emotional\
    \ interactions, intergroup rivalry, little capacity for openness, \ntrust, and\
    \ the rational expression of feelings, and well established hierarchical and social\
    \ \nstatus barriers.“ \n \nOn the other hand, KETCHUM's experience (1984) may\
    \ appear to be divergent from this \npoint of view. He is decidedly sanguine about\
    \ the usefulness of socio-technical systems in \ndeveloping countries, based on\
    \ his experience in the Sudan30. In answer to the question: are \nthe socio-technical\
    \ principles yielding superior economic and social outcomes in developed \n  \
    \                                                           \n27 Scientific management\
    \ is the first major pillar in the development of classical organization concepts.\
    \ Its \ninitial input was given under the driving force of Frederick W. Taylor\
    \ (1856 - 1915) in the latter part of the \nnineteenth and early part of the twentieth\
    \ centuries. The primary emphasis of scientific management, \nwhich has been referred\
    \ to before 1910 as \"task management\", was on planning, standardizing and \n\
    improving human effort at the operative level in order to maximize output with\
    \ minimum input. Scientific \nmanagement was a micro approach. Latter, there developed\
    \ a body of knowledge during the first half of \nthe twentieth century whose primary\
    \ emphasis was on macro level. March and Simon have referred to this \nbody of\
    \ knowledge as \"administrative management theory.“ Other writers call it the\
    \ traditional or classical \ntheory of management (KAST/ROSENZWEIG 1974 : 54-7).\

    \ \n \nIt is finally to be concluded that each of the analytical frameworks reviewed\

    \ \nREED (1992:122-24) summarizes some overarching intellectual movements in \n\
    organizational analysis accruing over the last twenty years or so as presented\
    \ in Table 1.1. \nThe standard of comparison is the 'agenda' of organizational\
    \ analysis which has been \nestablished by the systems framework - the left-hand\
    \ side of the Table. The intellectual hold \nof this agenda has been, over the\
    \ last twenty years, superseded by the formulation of an \ninterrelated set of\
    \ issues and approaches which characterize the sociological analysis of \norganizations\
    \ in very different terms to that prevailing in the mid or late 1960s. The central\
    \ \nissue for the alternative agenda is the struggle to control the organizational\
    \ mechanisms \nthrough which order is realized and contested. Here, the political\
    \ and cultural process is \nseen as a primary point of reference. Also, the environment\
    \ is no longer seen as an \nindependent entity but is viewed as: „a resource to\
    \ be enacted and manipulated by those \nwho are in a position to control the cognitive\
    \ practices through which it is configured as an \ninterpreted reality to be acted\
    \ on by dominant coalitions within this organization.“ \n    \n \n \nTable 1.1\

    \ this analysis of the theoretical frameworks of \norganizations, i.e., both the\
    \ structure/environmental perspectives as well as the power and \ncontrol of dominant\
    \ groups perspectives, we are forced to maintain that each one represent \na specific\
    \ empirical case  within its structural setting and its interaction with specific\
    \ \neconomic forces, political cultures and communities. The position adopted\
    \ here, \ntherefore, will be that both point of view have something to offer.\
    \ We argue the \nimportance of the environment in which organizations inforced\
    \ their tasks, specially, \nthe political context as well as the role of people\
    \ associated with. \n \nAccording to the definition of irrigation system which\
    \ has been recognized from many \nresearchers as discussed in this chapter, and\
    \ the characteristics of organizations as discussed \nabove, it is very important\
    \ for an irrigation organization to be considered  as a socio-\ntechnical open\
    \ system, and to understand the complex interactions with its contexts, as \n\
    well as the human factors and all their backgrounds. The basic character of organizations\
    \ \n \n39 \nin the field of irrigation systems which should be maintained is that:\
    \ \"organizations are not \nimplemented in a social vacuum but should take into\
    \ consideration the institutional, social, \neconomic, and political structure\
    \ in a society as well as the conception of values, norms, \npredominant behavioral\
    \ attitudes, historical experience with specific methods and, \ntherefore, the\
    \ whole cultural system\" (MANIG 1989:4).    \n \n1.3  Irrigation Management \n\
    \ \n„public and some large-scale irrigation schemes are known to have failed in\
    \ many \ncountries due to poor management“ (FAO, 1994:36). \n \nThe word theory\
    \ refers to „a body of fundamental principles underlying a science.“ \nThereby,\
    \ before making an attempt to discuss the definitions of irrigation management,\
    \ it is \nof a great importance to note that the aim of this part of the study\
    \ is not to find or establish \na \"master definition\" for irrigation organization\
    \ and irrigation management to be used in \nevery case. But, first of all, it\
    \ aims to underline the fundamental considerations and \nconditions of this two\
    \ concepts which one have to keep in mind especially when the \nconcerning theme\
    \ is irrigation system in an ‘underdeveloped’ country. Two reasons, in this \n\
    respect, can be argued:  \n \nFirst is the fact that the theoretical writings\
    \ on irrigation organizations and management are \nstill not enough, as well as\
    \ little empirical work has relatively been done in this field \nspecially in\
    \ Africa. COWARD (1980) and HUPPERT/WALTER (1989:8) have maintained \nthis conclusion.\
    \ The former has argued that \"the scholars of organizations will not find a \n\
    well-articulated theory of irrigation organization to be further tested and refined,\
    \ nor will \nthe administrator find a handbook on the organizations of water users\"\
    \ In the same vein, \nthe latters31 have noted that \"we must piece ideas and\
    \ arguments together because there is \nfor irrigation management no established\
    \ management theory to fall back on\" (UPHOFF \nET AL. 1991:33).  \n \nSecond,\
    \ the outcomes of the previous experiences, in general, emphasize other fact which\
    \ \nview the difficulty of generalization when we deal with different cases. Every\
    \ case study is \ndependent on its own and specific situation which is difficult\
    \ to transfer, and this is what is \nreferred to as the Situational or Contingency\
    \ Approach. Thereby, different situations \nmake different demands on management,\
    \ and thus must be countered with different \nmanagement-concepts. The irrigation\
    \ management and organizations are the most \nindigenous aspects of irrigation.\
    \ Therefore „no single model or methods can be applied \nuniversally, even in\
    \ the same state or region„ (LOWDERMILK 1986:438). Indeed, some \ncommentators\
    \ have argued that from the management point of view, it would be ideal if \n\
    specific management actions could be recommended for each situation. In real terms,\
    \ \nhowever, this is not possible (WALKER and CLEVERIHG 1989:II.2,1). \n \nOne\
    \ of the first attempts, which have been made to develop workable appraisal approaches\
    \ \nand have been conducted on system performance at the field level, is the interdisciplinary\
    \ \napproach to diagnostic analysis (DA) developed by the Colorado State University\
    \ On-\nFarm Water Management team during the 1970s, working with an integrated\
    \ surface and \ngroundwater irrigation water supply in the Punjab area of Pakistan\
    \ (CLYMA and COREY \n                                                        \
    \     \n31 HUPPERT/WALKER (1989: 14), Situation conformity and service orientation\
    \ in irrigation Management: \nBasic concepts, Eschborn: Deutsche Geselschaft für\
    \ Technische Zusammenarbeit. \n \n40 \n1977). According to this approach irrigation\
    \ management (IM) „is not water resources, \ndams, canals, command areas, soils,\
    \ engineering, agronomy, economics, watercourses, \nsocial science, farmers, or\
    \ plants. Instead, it is how these resources are manipulated and \norchestrated\
    \ by these disciplines to bring water to the root zones of crops with other inputs\
    \ \nat the proper time, the proper rate, and the proper place and cost to produce\
    \ food and \nfiber\" (NOBE and SAMPATH 1986:6). Irrigation management is then\
    \ not only control \noriented but also the orchestration of scarce physical and\
    \ biological resources, using the \nskills of several disciplines to bring water\
    \ to the root zones of plants for increased food and \nfiber production for all\
    \ classes of farmers32. \n \nA more recent definition (SECLER and NOBE 1983) states\
    \ that irrigation management is \n\"a process that has at its core an efficiency\
    \ objective of improving a production system's \nperformance by adjusting inputs\
    \ to produce a more desired level or mix of outputs .... an \ninterdisciplinary\
    \ system process with built-in learning mechanisms to improve system \nperformance\
    \ by adjusting physical, technological, and institutional inputs to achieve the\
    \ \ndesired levels of output\" (NOBE AND SAMPATH  1986:6). \n \nIn the context\
    \ of viewing the management process as a means of orchestrating, \nmanipulating\
    \ and adjusting inputs into outputs, management also refers to the organization\
    \ \n(as a functional term) that: (1) transforms general policy goals into specific\
    \ objectives \ndefined as desired project inputs and (2) designs, prioritizes,\
    \ and schedules program \nelements to produce output objectives (FAIRCHILD/NOBE\
    \ 1986). Success in \nmanagement, as has been emphasized by FAIRCHILD/NOBE, should\
    \ be judged by output \nfrom the systems rather than by inputs to the system.\
    \ They refer to the concept as \n\"management by results\" (MBR). In the MBR approach,\
    \ the farmer is the \"transformer\" \nof inputs to outputs 33.  \n \nConsidering\
    \ the input-output mechanism of the irrigation system, management itself is yet\
    \ \nwidely recognized as the more important input that ultimately determines the\
    \ efficiency of \nthe other factor inputs as well as the whole system. The gathered\
    \ experiences through many \ncase studies evaluations, whether in public or private\
    \ agencies, show clearly that the quality \nof the management is the deciding\
    \ factor of prosperity or failure for the systems which have \nmore or less identical\
    \ levels of input endowments. The physical resources of land, labor and \ncapital\
    \ are not productive unless they are organized and coordinated. To this extent,\
    \ \nmanagement may be viewed as a productive resource. Without inputs of management,\
    \ a \nfarm would not exist (UPTON 1987:90). The salient characteristic of the\
    \ management input \nis, therefore, the long gestation periods associated with\
    \ the acquisition of skills useful in \nallocating \nagricultural \nresources,\
    \ \nor \nin \nperforming \ncomplicated \ntasks \n(BINSWANGER/ROSENZWEIG 1986:519).\
    \ \n \n                                                             \n32 Further,\
    \ by using a system approach to irrigation management which encompasses the total\
    \ set of process \ninteractions involved in irrigated agriculture - not just the\
    \ water input, defines (1981) the irrigation \nmanagement as \"the process by\
    \ which water is manipulated (controlled) and used in the production of \nfood\
    \ and fiber .... (it) is not water resources, dames, or reservoirs to capture\
    \ water; nor codes, laws, or \ninstitutions to allocate water; nor farmers' organizations;\
    \ nor soils or cropping systems. It is however, the \nway these skills and physical,\
    \ biological, chemical, and social resources are utilized to provide water for\
    \ \nimproved food and fiber production\" ( REDDY 1986 : 106 ). \n33 MBR as a system-wide\
    \ monitoring and evaluation approach, has been developed by SEKLER/NOBE \n(1983\
    \ ) to projects in India and Pakistan. \n \n \n41 \nIn addition, and based on\
    \ the socio-technical approach, management is defined as \"the \nprocess of designing\
    \ and controlling goal-oriented socio-technical systems in conformity \nwith a\
    \ given situational context.“ Designing means those activities aimed at creating\
    \ a \nsocio-technical system and sustaining its long-term viability. Controlling\
    \ denotes the \nability to influence the system in such a way that assumes a desired\
    \ state \n(WALKER/CLEVERINGA 1989:II.1, 2-3). Management here determine the problems\
    \ that \nappear in the designing and controlling the system and try to find suggestions\
    \ to solve these \nproblems. \n \nIn view of the identification of management’s\
    \ functions, in the irrigation literature, it has \nbeen noticed that the concentration\
    \ was on water management. The definition of the latter, \ntherefore, has connected\
    \ with the duties of specific input i.e., the water. According to this \ntradition,\
    \ FUKUDA (1976:104), represent the thinking in the 1970s, and defines water \n\
    management as: \n„Management as described here means comprehensive control of\
    \ such functions at taking-\nin, conveyance, regulation, measurement, distribution,\
    \ application at the proper time and \nin the proper amount, and drainage of surplus\
    \ water, aiming at a common target of \nincreasing production and improving techniques\
    \ of farming“.  \n \nSCHAAK (1984), with a more wide consideration, has concluded\
    \ the definition of water \nmanagement as follows: \n”water management as it pertains\
    \ to irrigation encompasses all aspects of providing the \nright amount of water\
    \ at the proper time and place. This entails effective management and \ncoordination\
    \ from the supply sources through the distribution system and to the farm field\
    \ ” \n(HUPPERT 1989:54).   \n \nOn the other hand, a second group of authors \
    \ has viewed the pertinent functions of water \ndistribution as the central for\
    \ management of irrigation systems and stressed especially, \nhowever, the personnel\
    \ related aspects. To this group belongs, for instance, LEVINE, \nCOWARD and MARTIN\
    \ 34. In this respect, emphasize COWARD (1980a:19) the \nfollowing irrigation\
    \ management activities: ”water allocation, system maintenance, and \nconflict\
    \ management BOTTRAL (1981) led on DRUCKER and defined the goal formation, \n\
    design and planning the budget, operation’s planning, administration and control\
    \ as the \nmost important management functions of irrigation. He added, however,\
    \ on these \n”specialized activities” the following responsibilities (HUPPERT\
    \ 1989:55): \n \n− water distribution; \n− system maintenance; \n− agricultural\
    \ extension; \n− watercourse improvement and advisory services; and \n− management\
    \ support activities: finance, personnel and monitoring. \n \nA more comprehensive\
    \ understanding of irrigation management that takes into \nconsideration the multiple\
    \ functions of management has been adopted by LOWDERMILK \n(19852.15). He argues\
    \ that not only water distribution, but also ”people, credits, inputs, \nprice\
    \ policy, other services for farmers .... must be managed in the true sense of\
    \ good \nmanagement”. Lowdermilk has found out , then, that  management includes\
    \ ”planning, \nsetting objectives, measuring, coordinating, integrating, monitoring\
    \ and evaluating”     \n                                                     \
    \        \n34 LIVINE et al. (1979), COWARD (1980), MARTIN et al. (1986). \n \n\
    42 \nHUPPERT/WALKER (1989) have outlined attributes of basic concept for management\
    \ \nof irrigation system as follows: \n \n− management is a process practiced\
    \ within organizational framework; it is the \nprocess of realizing and implementing\
    \ measures within the organizational \nframework (MANIG 1989:5); \n− system management\
    \ must be understood as a process, which permits interactive \nlearning from previous\
    \ steps; \n− irrigation system management has four functions; planning, organizing,\
    \ leading, and \ncontrolling . Each of which demands a continuous decision-making\
    \ process; \n− basically, management functions are performed by local water authorities,\
    \ water \nusers, and representatives of donor organizations. In many cases divided\
    \ or split \nmanagement responsibility between water users and authority is found;\
    \ \n− water user participation has hitherto been unsatisfactory; and \n− sustainability\
    \ and environmental compatibility must be duly taken into account by \nthe irrigation\
    \ system and be ensured by corresponding measures. \n \nAn important other attribute\
    \ has been mentioned by UPHOFF ET AL. (1991:53) in the \ncontext of his contribution\
    \ to the discussion about the role of management in improving the \nuse of scarce\
    \ resources, he states that: \"we should always keep in mind that management is\
    \ \nsomething to be optimized, not maximized. The costs of maximum management\
    \ are unlikely \nto produce enough incremental benefits to justify an all-out\
    \ effort by government staff and / \nor water users, and such efforts anyway are\
    \ not likely to be sustainable simply in human \nterms. So tradeoffs must always\
    \ be considered\". \n \nIn big similarity with the definition articulated by HUPPERT\
    \ and WALKER is that of the \nInternational Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI)\
    \ which viewed irrigation management \nas \"the process in which institutions\
    \ or individuals set objectives for irrigation systems; \nestablish appropriate\
    \ conditions and identify, mobilize, and use resources, so as to attain \nthese\
    \ objectives; while ensuring that these activities are performed without causing\
    \ adverse \neffects\" (KNOTH 1989:24). It is, in brief, as WEBSTER defines \"\
    the judicious use of \nmeans to accomplish an end.\" \n \nIrrigation management,\
    \ according to the functions and characteristics discussed above, \nsustain the\
    \ irrigation organization, irrespective of the size (water users organizations\
    \ or \nhousehold-farm), and enable it to accomplish the formal goals using different\
    \ resources, \nnamely crop production. Irrigation management is then a conditional\
    \ factor which enable \nthe organization or the farm to realize its ultimate goal.\
    \ At the level of the household-farm \n(the base of the analysis in the empirical\
    \ part), production management and water \nmanagement are carried out simultaneously\
    \ on the farm to achieve the production goals that \nare, finally, the purpose\
    \ of an irrigation system and, also the decisive criterion for assessing \nits\
    \ efficiency (MANIG 1994:249).   \n \n \n \n \n43 \n1.4  Efficiency of Irrigation\
    \ System \n \nThe quest for efficiency is so widespread in western society, since\
    \ a few decades, that it \nhas become almost synonymous with rationality itself\
    \ (SCOTT/MITCHELL 1972:5). \nEfficiency as defined by the latter requires ”continual\
    \ effort to minimize system inputs and \nto maximize system outputs”. This concept\
    \ is a goal of all organizations and applicable to \nany system level under consideration\
    \ (ranging from the smallest unit of an organization to \nthe largest and most\
    \ complex structure) and prevailed in all fields35. The quest is always \nfor\
    \ better and better methods to improve system input-output ratios by continuous\
    \ \nrefinement of managerial, engineering, and scientific techniques. \n \nAnother\
    \ major reason for concentrating on improving project management is to increase\
    \ the \nirrigation efficiency levels of available water supplies. Two facts should\
    \ be referred to at \nthe beginning of this discussion. First is that the definition\
    \ of ‘efficiency‘ is disputed. The \nsecond is that irrigation water can not be\
    \ 100 % effectively used. Despite these facts, until \nrecently, in the field\
    \ of irrigation, ”efficiency” was the most used indicator of system \nperformance.\
    \ Later on, there has been increasing consensus that broader concepts focusing\
    \ \non the use of water are more accurate performance indicators. Accordingly,\
    \ LENTON \n(1986:50) viewed that the two principal measures of irrigation system\
    \ performance are \nproductivity (measured by water delivery, yields or potential\
    \ yields) and equity (measured \nby productivity variations within an irrigation\
    \ system). \n \nIn this respect, ISRAEL joins the efficiency of water use with\
    \ productivity of irrigated \nagriculture and profitability of irrigated farming\
    \ as three objectives that are important \ncriteria for successful irrigation\
    \ management. He argued that the efficiency of irrigated \nsystems could be measured\
    \ in terms of water duty36 per acre or the extent of command area \nirrigated.\
    \ Efficieny and economic returen of irrigation schemesare closely related. Many\
    \ \nexamples of this realtionship are disussed in the works of CLARK (1970) and\
    \ \nCARRUTHERS/CLARK (1981). The hydraulic efficiency is then an important factor\
    \ but \nnot sufficient for successful irrigation management (necessary but not\
    \ adequate). ISRAEL \nrefers to that by saying ”hydraulic efficiency without agricultural\
    \ productivity serves no \npurpose. Likewise, productivity which is not profitable\
    \ is unwise because if achieved \nwithout regard to its cost, it may represent\
    \ a subtraction from total social welfare” \n(UPHOFF ET AL. 1991:211). In the\
    \ same vein, NOBE/SAMPATH (1986:4) considers \nimproving the irrigation management\
    \ as a condition for achieving these objectives. They \nargue that without improved\
    \ management, improved irrigation efficiencies, and increased \nagricultural output\
    \ higher returns to farmers will not occur. \n \nConsequently, terms relating\
    \ to Efficiency of Water Use reflect, as concluded by \nSHMUELI (1973:413), two\
    \ different approaches for expressing efficiency of water use in \nirrigation:\
    \ 1) An engineering-planning approach with emphasis on the water factor and \n\
    concerned primarily with evaluation of technical performance of the irrigation\
    \ system; and \n2) an agronomic-economic approach, emphasized in this study of\
    \ course, centered on yield \nas related to water input. \n                  \
    \                                           \n35 The measurement of efficiency\
    \ in agriculture has been investigated in much detail since FARREL (1957). \n\
    36 The terms duty of water and water duty were used at the end of the 19th century\
    \ and beginning of the 20th. \nThey referred to the amounts of water applied in\
    \ irrigation, according to the prevailing agricultural \npractices. In the 20th\
    \ century, other terms came into use: water use, water requirements, or irrigation\
    \ \nneed, defined as the quantity of water delivered to a crop (field), exclusive\
    \ of precipitation (SHMUELI \n1973:413). \n \n44 \nIt is very important also to\
    \ note here that the efficiency of irrigation organizations is more \nconnected\
    \ with the goals that predominate in such organizations. Here raised the question\
    \ \nof: which goals for which specific groups are achieved, and thus, which efficiency\
    \ is \nconsidered?37 Moreover, when Efficiency refers to how economically the\
    \ organization \nconverts its inputs into the desired outputs, Effectiveness refers,\
    \ on the other hand, to the \ndegree of goal attainment (FORD 1988:56). An efficient\
    \ organization, therefore, may not \nnecessary be effective. On the contrary,\
    \ an organization may view the attainment of certain \ngoals, no matter how long\
    \ it takes, as more important than efficiency.  \n \nIn irrigation systems where\
    \ the main goal is the maximization of production i.e., expansion \nof cash or\
    \ export cropping, the ‘efficiency’ is a more salient concern in managers’ thoughts\
    \ \nand actions than in other projects where the priority is oriented to ‘equality‘\
    \ in the spread \nof water38. Furthermore, in projects where the economists dominate,\
    \ the concern will not \nbe only with water, but also with all the other inputs\
    \ (labor, land, capital invested in \nirrigation facilities, managerial effort)\
    \ that are used in the production of the crop.  \n \nLIVINE (1982) used a standard\
    \ engineering criteria to focus on the relationship between \nwater supply and\
    \ demand, and its implications for system management. Levels or changes \nin Relative\
    \ Water Supply (RWS) -- the ratio between supply and demand -- explain many \n\
    actions by managers and water users and reflect inversely the amount of pressure\
    \ that users \ncan put on the staff controlling irrigation water. This function,\
    \ as the studies have \nsuggested, has been summarized as follows: \n \n− \nonce\
    \ RWS falls below 1.5 (which means supply is less than 50 percent above the \n\
    minimum in-field crop requirements), irrigation systems require more management\
    \ \neffort than is acceptable and sustainable from users and managers; \n− \n\
    RWS of 2.0 (twice as much water as minimally necessary) represents the equivalent\
    \ of \n‘50 percent efficiency‘ by standard engineering criteria; \n− \nraising\
    \ the level of ‘efficiency‘, operating with a lower RWS, demands much more \n\
    management effort, and depending on how the costs of management are calculated,\
    \ it \nmay not be an economically profitable strategy. The economic benefits from\
    \ more \nintensive water management may not be commensurate with the added costs\
    \ involved; \n− \nRWS and efficiency are the inverse of one another; \n− \nthe\
    \ RWS concept implies that 100 percent ‘efficiency‘ is undesirable as well as\
    \ \nunattainable; and \n                                                     \
    \        \n37 Through the discussion of institutional optimality and efficiency,\
    \ argued PAPANDREOU (1994:208-9), \nfor the institutions selected by the community\
    \ to be optimal a very strong assumption needs to be made: \nthat the very process\
    \ by which decisions are made by the group is optimal. That is, in order to have\
    \ faith \nthat the institutions selected by the community are efficient, one needs\
    \ to believe that formal voting \nprocedures and information gathering procedures\
    \ followed by the community will ensure community-\nwelfare-maximizing choices.\
    \ To reach this goal, assurances are needed that interest groups are not able\
    \ \nunduly to influence decisions, or similarly, that the representatives making\
    \ the decisions are not basing \ntheir votes on their own self-interests. On the\
    \ contrary, NORTH’s (1981:225) discussion of the abolition \nof slavery makes\
    \ the implicit assumption that slavery may at one time have been an efficient\
    \ institution. If \nso, it was efficient in achieving a specific welfare goal,\
    \ one that favored the slave-owners and not the \nslaves .     \n38 It is worth\
    \ noting that one of the main pillars of traditional neoclassical economics is\
    \ the separability of \nequity and efficiency. But this breaks down under the\
    \ theory of transaction costs because of the critical \nrole of property rights\
    \ that are recognized in this theory. \n \n45 \n− \nthe concept is useful for\
    \ thinking about irrigation management because it brings \nconsideration of cost\
    \ into evaluations in a way that standard notions of ‘efficiency’ do \nnot. \n\
    \ \nOther dimension is represented by MANIG (1989:30) who see that: ”the actual\
    \ discussion \nabout the insufficient performance in irrigation systems, especially\
    \ in macro-hydraulic \nsystems, and the resulting consequences for the organizations\
    \ assumes that the water users’ \ngoals are not taken into sufficient consideration\
    \ and therefore water, land, labor and \ncapital are not utilized according to\
    \ their potential”. In a heterogeneous social structure, \nimproving the farmers’\
    \ efficiency in land and water utilization, he argued, is no end in itself \n\
    for the influential urban-oriented elite.  \n \nIt is finally to be concluded\
    \ that beside the importance of increasing the efficiency of water \nuse, it has\
    \ to coincide with other steps that increase the productivity in order to achieve\
    \ the \nefficiency of irrigation system. These steps should be, of course, in\
    \ the field of improving \nthe irrigation management and its organizational framework,\
    \ which coordinate the input-\noutput relationship and take into consideration\
    \ all influential groups.    \n \n2.  The Relevant Dimensions and Factors that\
    \ Influence Irrigation \nOrganization and Management \n \n \nIn this chapter the\
    \ relevant factors that exercise an influence on irrigation management and \n\
    its organizational context are treated. Before one can discuss these factors,\
    \ it is important to \nview briefly the contingency approach which constitutes\
    \ the basis of this discussion. \n \n2.1  Contingency Theory \n \nAs discussed\
    \ previously, the core conceptualization of an organization as ‘a purposive \n\
    social system geared to the fulfillment of a relatively stable set of environmentally\
    \ induced \nneeds for security, integration, continuity and survival’, has formed\
    \ the theoretical bedrock \nof the system framework in organizational analysis.\
    \ \n \nContingency approach is one of many theoretical innovations that have been\
    \ developed to \nmake the system analysis more dynamic to explain the causes and\
    \ consequences of \norganizational change. It is equally applied to organization\
    \ and management and used also \nin the analysis of Third World cases. Contingency\
    \ approach, then, concentrates on the \nimmediate pressures that organizations\
    \ face in their task environments and the internal \nstructural accommodations\
    \ which they have to make to meet these challenges. Factors such \nas volatile\
    \ technological and political realignments within the environment- beside market\
    \ \nchange - have been identified as key contingencies which organizations have\
    \ to respond to \nin the appropriate manner if they are to ensure their long-term\
    \ survival. REED (1992:80) \nargued that change in these factors is likely to\
    \ exert considerable pressure on the \norganization's production system to realign\
    \ its goals and structures so that it maintains \ncompatibility with its niche\
    \ and to ensure continued satisfaction of the system's needs. \n \nThe writings\
    \ of THOMPSON, BURNS/STALKER, and LOWRENCE/LORSCH, in the \nlate 1960s provided\
    \ a codification of the system/contingency framework, based on \nempirical work\
    \ and theoretical innovations undertaken in the 1950s and early 1960s and \n \n\
    46 \nconsidered the base for the researchers working within this perspective in\
    \ the 1970s and \n1980s39. The core assumptions of these writings can be summarized\
    \ in the following \nmanner: \n \n− the analysis is developed within an open-system\
    \ approach; \n− different environmental contingencies call for different organizational\
    \ forms; \n− technology and market are seen, by many authors, as the most influential\
    \ \ncontingencies. Accordingly, they view that when the two contingencies are\
    \ \ncrisscrossed they produce four major organizational forms that are effective\
    \ in four \ndifferent sets of contingencies. These forms are craft, mechanical,\
    \ organic, and \nmechanical-organic organization. Of course, considering other\
    \ contingencies would \nlead to other forms of organization; \n− all complex organizations,\
    \ as THOMPSON argued, need to achieve a suitable \nbalance between their internal\
    \ operational core and their external environmental \ncircumstances, if they were\
    \ to ensure their long-term survival and effectiveness; \n− management had, here,\
    \ a key role to play in designing, implementing and \nmonitoring mechanisms; \n\
    − it is the task of the managers, in the opinion of LOWERENCE/LORSCH, to achieve\
    \ \nthe appropriate balance between functional differentiation (specialization)\
    \ and \nstructural integration (coordination) which will equip them to the changing\
    \ they \nface; and  \n− a major thesis of contingency theory is that organizations\
    \ can not be both efficient \n(low cost per unit of output) and innovative (number\
    \ of new outputs or producers) \nat the same time. Often , however, organizations\
    \ overemphasized one and encounter \nproblems from the lack of the other, then\
    \ they must be changed in the other \ndirection (HAGE /FINSTERBUSCH  1987:4,5,59,\
    \ and REED 1992:80-3). \n \n2.2.  Objectives of Irrigation Management \n \nOrganization,\
    \ as viewed by organizational theorists, is not treated as an end. Organization\
    \ is \na human invention, created to enable people to achieve important goals\
    \ or objectives. It is, \nas often defined, a group of people who come together\
    \ to accomplish certain ends (a \ncommon purpose) (POTTER 1972:153; FORD et al.\
    \ 1988:40). Objectives refer then to the \npurpose of an organization, i.e., to\
    \ the effects or impacts it is expected to have. Therefore, \nthey provide the\
    \ criteria according to which management is undertaken and to be evaluated. \n\
    \ \nIrrigation systems vary not only physically and organizationally but also\
    \ in terms of the \ngoals they are to serve. So, for an irrigation system, understanding\
    \ what and whose values \nare to be achieved; their directions and priorities,\
    \ is the second step - after understanding \nthe irrigation system itself - for\
    \ assessing the performance of irrigation management. Yet, \nthey determine, within\
    \ the irrigation contexts the relative importance of different irrigation \nactivities\
    \ and outcomes. \n \n                                                        \
    \     \n39 For more informative review of contingency theory see BURREL/MORGAN,\
    \ Sociological Paradigms and \nOrganizational Analysis (HEINEMANN, London, 1979).\
    \  \n \n47 \nSimilar to the context of irrigation, vary the specific objectives\
    \ which an irrigation \norganization must deal with according to the system, country,\
    \ and over time. There are a \nnumber of influences on goals. The environment\
    \ - individuals, groups, and institutions \nbeyond the organization’s strict boundaries\
    \ - is always an influence to some extent on \norganizational goal setting and\
    \ achievement. Furthermore, the organization’s achievable \ngoals may be restricted\
    \ by its physical environment and technology. Because of \ntechnological limitations,\
    \ certain goals simply cannot be achieved, no matter how badly the \ndominant\
    \ group wants to achieve them. The goals then depends on the contextual factors\
    \ \nwhich affect the organization and on the interactions among three different\
    \ sets of actors: \nnational policy makers, water users, and the agency. Each\
    \ of these sets have various \ninterests that have different priorities, and this\
    \ results in complex multiple goal systems. At \nthe same time, within each, there\
    \ is likely to be some diversity and even conflict of \nobjectives e.g., the engineers\
    \ vis-a-vis the economists40. \n \nHere arise underlying question: to what extent\
    \ it is possible to find a „compromise“ \nbetween these multiple goals: the macro\
    \ development goals, the government’s, the \nproject’s, manager’s, and water users’\
    \ goals? and who should be the victim of this \ncompromise?, asked MÜLLER (1979:60-70).\
    \ He argues that goal-conflicts between the \ndifferent target groups is the central\
    \ social problem in large irrigation schemes. SEERS see \nthis problem as “negative\
    \ correlation between economic growth and development“ For this \nreason, it is\
    \ to be supposed that the purpose of organizations within a differentiated society\
    \ \nis lastly to „articulate and defend the interests of the specific groups within\
    \ the society„ \n(KÖTTER 1988:15). KÖTTER argues that ideally, in many developing\
    \ countries where the \nrural poor are economically, socially and hence politically\
    \ too weak, the state or the \ngovernment is supposed to act as an ‘honest broker‘\
    \ between the conflicting interests. He \naccounts for: „there is, however, a\
    \ permanent danger, particularly if the state is weak, that \ncertain groups wield\
    \ such an amount of power that they become able not only to suppress \nthe interests\
    \ of other groups, but also, openly or secretly, to creep into the organization\
    \ \nitself and divert its activities in the direction of their own advantage„.\
    \ \n \nPARSONS (1956), in his theory, defines organization in functionalist 41\
    \ terms, and suggests \nthat ”primacy of orientation to the attainment of a specific\
    \ goal is the defining \ncharacteristic of an organization” (HASSARD 1993:23-4).\
    \ His analysis highlights both the \nwide variation in sub-unit goal-orientations\
    \ and the numerous ways in which sub-units \nadapt to changing environments. As\
    \ organizations are situated at the cultural/institutional \nlevel, the corollary\
    \ for PARSONS is that the systems analyst should determine the goals \nand values\
    \ of formal organizations. The initial concern then is that, organization's goals\
    \ \n                                                             \n40 An interesting\
    \ comparison with the differing attitudes of the engineers and the economists\
    \ in the field of \nwater resources development has been argued by BOULDING (1965:82-3).\
    \ The distinction, he said, can \nbe summed up by saying that, on the whole, the\
    \ engineer is project-oriented whereas the economist is \nsystem-oriented. The\
    \ economist is always concerned with „might-have-been„, the engineer is always\
    \ \nconcerned with „what will be„; the engineer is concerned with plans, the economist\
    \ with unrealized \nalternatives. Hence, on the whole, the engineer is talking\
    \ about „what is„ or „what shortly will be„- the \neconomist is always talking\
    \ about „what is not„ - giving the economist a certain disadvantage in the \n\
    argument. One is tempted to say also, he argues, the engineer thinks mainly in\
    \ physical terms whereas the \neconomist is interested primarily in values. The\
    \ more distinction between the mode of thinking of the \neconomist and the engineer\
    \ according to Boulding is: the engineer tends to regard his activity as a kind\
    \ of \n„war against nature„; the economist, on the other hand, thinks of nature\
    \ as a factor of production to be \ntreated gently in a cooperative manner. \n\
    41 The functionalist vein of social science reefers to the approach in which all\
    \ regular patterns of social \nbehavior are perceived as having some function\
    \ to perform in relation to the creation and maintenance of \norder in societies.\
    \   \n \n48 \nmust be legitimated by organizational values, which in turn must\
    \ be consistent with social \nvalues. While the organization must federate its\
    \ goals with those of the sub-systems which \ncomprise the organization, its own\
    \ goals must, in turn, federate with those of the wider \nsystem. It is indeed\
    \ these processes which are at the heart of PARSONS’ analysis in the \nsocial\
    \ system. \n \nAs example for the variations in objectives, the macro-economic\
    \ considerations shape the \nobjectives that national decision-makers seek to\
    \ achieve such as: \n \n− the rate of return on public resources invested in the\
    \ irrigation system; \n− minimization of the recurrent costs of operation and\
    \ maintenance; \n− ensuring year-to-year stability of production; and \n− political\
    \ considerations related to external interests (e.g., earning foreign exchange\
    \ \nthrough export, production to satisfy urban consumers) and domestic ones (e.g.,\
    \ \nproviding large commercial agriculturists with water for their crops) (UPHOFF\
    \ ET \nAL. 1991:58). In addition, they are also interested in aspects like elections\
    \ and \nregime stability.  \n \nWater users, who are the beneficiaries of public\
    \ irrigation systems, on the other hand, have \ndifferent interests vis-a-vis\
    \ the other two. Their objectives are shaped more by micro \nconsiderations: the\
    \ maximization of household benefits (e.g., adequacy and reliability of \nwater\
    \ deliveries and the productivity per unit of land) and minimization of household\
    \ costs \n(e.g., less time expended in weeding, or fewer water-borne diseases).\
    \ Here come also into \nplay many other considerations; political, health, status\
    \ and others, besides the economic \nfactors of the farm. Whether the organization\
    \ take these goals into sufficient consideration \nor not depends mainly on the\
    \ form/nature of this organization. \n \nIrrigation agency managers and staff\
    \ members constitute the third set of actors, which \nare established to further\
    \ the objectives of the other two. They considered also, in addition \nto the\
    \ water users, the internal goals (individual goals) definers of irrigation organization.\
    \ \nThe objectives of managers, therefore, come in the middle between the government\
    \ and \nthe public, whose goals do not always coincide. They are concerned with\
    \ maximizing \nbenefits and minimizing costs both for their agency (e.g., maximizing\
    \ their returns: \nsecurity, amount of income, stability, and power; and minimizing\
    \ their own costs: budget, \nefforts, embarrassment,..etc.) and for themselves\
    \ (e.g., higher, more secure incomes, or \nfewer postings to places where facilities\
    \ are inadequate). Furthermore, productivity of \nresource utilization, equity\
    \ of resource distribution, and stability of water supply without \nenvironmental\
    \ depletion, can be mentioned as irrigation organization’s goals (MANIG \n1989:28).\
    \ \n \nWALKER (1981) classify other influential groups and refers to as external\
    \ interest \ngroups such as suppliers and buyers of the organization input and\
    \ output, customers, \ninvestors, advisors, and so-called regulating groups in\
    \ societies, such as politicians, \nadministrators and local, regional and national\
    \ elite. The concealed goals of these groups \nset expectations in, and exercise\
    \ an influence at, all levels of the organizations i.e., during \nthe planning,\
    \ the design, the establishment, and the execution and determine therefore the\
    \ \nirrigation organization’s official goals (MANIG 1989:27). Of course, each\
    \ group has its \npower means, to achieve their goals, which vary according to\
    \ the importance of the \norganization for this group.   \n \n \n49 \nBecause\
    \ these goals are manifold, complex, and interrelated, the conflict is therefore\
    \ often \nexpected42. There are objectives, on the one side, which all interests\
    \ groups agree upon, \ne.g., increasing production, productivity, and increasing\
    \ the reliability and predictability of \nadequate and timely water flows as an\
    \ aspect of improving water distribution. On the other \nside, objectives like\
    \ equitable distribution may vary because of the relativity of the fairness’ \n\
    of understanding. For example, the upstream/downstream relationship is more related\
    \ with \nthe interests of influential political actors. In the light of this,\
    \ KELLER (1986:350) viewed \nthe dichotomy of the operational objectives of the\
    \ public irrigation systems and the private \nbeneficiaries as the root cause\
    \ of many problems in managing them. He asserts that, for an \nindividual farmer,\
    \ water may not be his scare resource unless it is rationed, allocated, \nand/or\
    \ distributed inequitably. Therefore, he is not usually concerned about water-use\
    \ \nefficiency or fair and equitable distribution of water to other farmers, although\
    \ these are the \ntypical operational objectives for public irrigation system.\
    \ Oppositely, reducing conflicts is \nmore important objective for farmers and\
    \ normally not stressed from the national policy \nmakers and irrigation managers\
    \ because it implies some deficiency in management. For the \nlatters, is an objective\
    \ like resource mobilization or sustaining system performance of first \npriority.\
    \ \n \nWhere irrigation system management cannot achieve all of these goals, or\
    \ cannot achieve \nthem all fully because of physical, economic, political, social\
    \ or other constraints, some \nranking or weighing is needed. In other words,\
    \ an ordering of aims has to be tailored with \nsome knowledge of the context\
    \ and of capabilities for system management. In addition, if \nequity of water\
    \ distribution is discussed as an objective, for example, all actors groups \n\
    should know any differentials, even if there is disagreement about what constitutes\
    \ \n”fairness” in distribution (UPHOFF ET AL. 1991:62, 66). \n \n2.3.  The Context\
    \ of Irrigation Management \n \nAs discussed previously, each management process\
    \ is conducted in a specific environment \nand a successful manager or policy\
    \ maker tailors this approach to fit the environment early \nin the managerial\
    \ process. Also, the concepts that are viewed in the previous chapter, shows \n\
    clearly that the proper performance of irrigation systems does not exclusively\
    \ depend on the \noperational efficiency of the irrigation institution but it\
    \ needs, in addition, adequate \nunderstanding of factors bound to the environment\
    \ or context of the institution that impede \nand impinge on the achievement of\
    \ objectives and therefore the irrigation performance. \n \nAfter reading the\
    \ organizational environment's literature, one is impressed by the variety of\
    \ \nwords used to describe the same concept. For example, WALKER/CLEVERINAGA \n\
    (1989) refers to market conditions, water laws and indigenous knowledge of water\
    \ users as \nenvironmental factors that influence the successful performance of\
    \ irrigation system. \nUPHOFF ET AL. (1991) lists six major categories as contextual\
    \ factors that describe the \norganizational environment: (a) agro-ecological,\
    \ (b) technical, (c) economic, (d) historical, \n(e) socio-cultural and (f) political-legal.\
    \ Yet, MANIG (1989) used the term Situation \nVariables to refer to these factors\
    \ and adopt the KIESER/KUBICEK's (1976:8-9) \nclassification of the various dimensions\
    \ that influence the situation. These dimensions are: \n \n                  \
    \                                           \n42 For more detailed reviews of\
    \ the major categories of irrigation management objectives see UPHOFF \n1986:15-18\
    \ and 199: 59-60. \n \n50 \n− dimensions of the organization's internal Situation\
    \ including factors such as: \nachievement program, size of the organization,\
    \ applied technologies (production \nand information technologies), legislation\
    \ and ownership titles, age of the \norganization, type of foundation and development\
    \ stage of the organization; \n \n− dimensions of the organization's external\
    \ Situation, basically included the global \nenvironment (natural, social and\
    \ cultural conditions). These dimensions and factors \nare connected with each\
    \ other and with the structure of the organization in a \ncomplex multicausal\
    \ pattern. \n \nWhen we try to draw conclusions from this analysis, the first\
    \ one then will be that the \ncontext or the environment of the irrigation management\
    \ is manifold and complex, even for \nsmall systems. In addition, it is the organization's\
    \ source of inputs and sinks of outputs. \nHowever, and above all, the organizational\
    \ context or environment is described, in most of \nthe relevant literature, with\
    \ the general and global concept of uncertainty. Uncertainties \ndenote randomness,\
    \ unpredictability or lack of information with which the organization has \nto\
    \ deal. In global terms one could classify the environmental aspects as having\
    \ either \n'informational' or 'energetic' contingencies which define the amount\
    \ of uncertainty to be \ndealt with. In view of these facts, irrigation as a mode\
    \ of agriculture production can be \nviewed as a \"socio-technical adaptation\
    \ to particular habitat features and population \ncharacteristics“. At a more\
    \ micro level, the ecological perspective suggests that apparently \nirrational,\
    \ unarticulated, or random activities in a particular irrigation system may be\
    \ \nunraveled and made more intelligible if they are examined in relation to the\
    \ habitat and \nsociopolitical context in which they occur (COWARD 1980a:21).\
    \ Furthermore, \nTHOMPSON (1967) and LAWRENCE/LORSCH (1967) have argued that \"\
    organizations \nare inherently uncertainty-absorbing instruments created for the\
    \ pursuit of certain goals \" \n(PENNINGS and TRIPATHI 1978:173). \n \nAmongst\
    \ the ‘systems‘ approaches there are studies which emphasize the systemic \nrelationships\
    \ of environmental, technological and demographic conditions, and social \nresponses\
    \ to them. A notable example of such an approach is that of BOSERUP (1965) \n\
    who presents the bold thesis that increasing population density explains the development\
    \ of \nincreasingly intensive systems of cultivation, involving also changes in\
    \ technology and in \nsocial institutions. Another contribution is CHAMBERS and\
    \ HARRISS (1977) who sought \nto explain variations between villages in a small\
    \ region of South India in terms of the inter-\nrelations of environment (especially\
    \ the availability of irrigation water) and population \ndensity, and found certain\
    \ fairly distinct patterns of variation of wage rates, labor \nrelationships and\
    \ rural livelihoods that could be related to the basic dynamics of \nenvironment\
    \ and population (HARRISS 1982:18). \n \nThe conclusion that can be drawn from\
    \ the above is that an organization’s environment \nconsists of virtually everything\
    \ outside the organization: the store of knowledge upon \nwhich it must draw its\
    \ geographical location, and the economic, political, and social \nconditions\
    \ in which it must operate. But, the organization’s internal environment is also\
    \ \nimportant, particularly in so far as the skills and commitment of its members\
    \ are concerned \n(BLUNT 1992:138). So, in the light of these facts, the position\
    \ may be that the organization \nis faced with a hostile environment as well as\
    \ friction from within (HASSARD 1993:29). \nThis leads also to inforce what the\
    \ experience has pointed out, and that is „an \nundifferentiated transfer of institutions\
    \ and organizations from one system into another is \nlikely to cause a lot of\
    \ problems„ (KÖTTER 1988 : 18 ). \n \n51 \n \nIt is not the intention here to\
    \ delve into the social ecology of irrigation systems i.e., the \ninterrelation\
    \ between people, and their physical and political surroundings in depth. But,\
    \ \nour emphasis in this section will be directed at factors which are system-specific\
    \ (and play a \nsignificant role in the two case studies of this research) and,\
    \ at the same time, broader \nfactors that impinge on the management of all irrigation\
    \ systems within a country or region. \nThese factors are technological, historical,\
    \ social, cultural, and political ones. \n \n2.3.1  The Organization’s Applied\
    \ Technology  \n \n2.3.1.1  The Appropriate Technology: Continual Debate  \n \n\
    The debate on the ”quality” or the ”degree” of  technology in the developing countries\
    \ is \nrelatively old and complex. On the one hand, the economical theory recommended\
    \ that \neach country has to use more the production factor which constitute a\
    \ relative advantage to \nhave an efficient allocation for their resources. This\
    \ means, logically, that most of the \ndeveloping countries have to use labor-intensive\
    \ techniques in the irrigated agriculture \nbecause of their relative advantage\
    \ in the labor factor. \n \nOn the other hand, if we agree that the more important\
    \ technical criteria to assess the \nperformance of irrigated projects are the\
    \ regularity and symmetry of water distribution \nand the efficiency of water\
    \ use, then raised the question, whether the practiced technology \nin these fields\
    \ in the developing countries is capable of realizing this performance? \n \n\
    Some international organizations (the World Bank and the International Commission\
    \ for \nIrrigation and Drainage (ICID) and researchers (POSTEL 1984, REPLOGLE\
    \ 1986, \nHÜBENER and WOLF 1991 and MANIG 1993), on the other hand, suspected\
    \ that the \nprevailed irrigation technique in the developing countries can make\
    \ them able to use \neffectively the available potential. That is why, they argued,\
    \ those countries couldn’t face \nthe challenge of development that require increasing\
    \ the labor-productivity beside the \nproductivity of soil and water to meet the\
    \ increasing population and improving the standard \nof living as well. For a\
    \ sustainable efficiency for irrigated agriculture in the developing \ncountries,\
    \ the up to now technical concepts should be well thought out and modernized.\
    \ \nThis means strengthening the orientations towards the wishes/requests, ideas,\
    \ attitudes and \nthe basic requirements of the water users. They believe also\
    \ that improving the \nmanagement concepts of the traditional irrigation systems\
    \ alone is not enough and therefore \nthey view that the modern technology should\
    \ be strengthened as a strong alternative. \nModernization of the technology then\
    \ must not be seen as expensive solution but also as \nthe’useful’ solution. \
    \ \n \nTherefore, modernization of the irrigation technique can help to: \n− achieving\
    \ greater production and productivity43 (through increases in yield, \ncultivated\
    \ area and cropping intensity) and, at the same time, fewer costs (through \n\
    decreases in labor costs); \n                                                \
    \             \n43 Because of the economical and social conditions prevailing\
    \ in the developing societies, the effects of \ntechnology use are not neutral.\
    \ The benefits of utilizing modern technologies have reached all the groups \n\
    more equally only in the countries whose development policy was based simultaneously\
    \ on a broad \nincome distribution and which, therefore, strive after better adjusted\
    \ societal mode of distribution. In \ncontrast, the use of modern technologies\
    \ in the agricultural sector in developing countries has only shown \nclearly\
    \ the unequal societal modes of distribution that still prevailed, since social\
    \ differences were \n \n52 \n− solving the problems of labor shortage in the top\
    \ seasons; \n− more efficiency in water use and in the mechanics of operation\
    \ and maintenance; \n− fewer environmental problems; and \n− make the organizational\
    \ and managerial problems in the field easier. \n \nIn the final analysis, it\
    \ is very important to say that using relative modern technology is not \na substitute\
    \ for improving irrigation management but, on the contrary, the latter is a \n\
    condition or guarantee to get the advantages of the former. Furthermore, choosing\
    \ the mode \nof this technology is connected with the goal structures that prevailed\
    \ in organization. \nEvery interest group is trying to choose, of course, the\
    \ technologies that provide it \nadvantages. \n \nAs stage during the development\
    \ of these ideas, others have frequently viewed the \n”appropriate technology”\
    \ as a solution for this dilemma. The opinion here was: addition \nto the high\
    \ costs that is considered unbearable and the introduction of sophisticated \n\
    irrigation technologies into traditional systems may serve to make them more dependent\
    \ \nupon the outside bureaucracy. That is why- may be- the term ”appropriate technology”\
    \ has \nbeen sometimes understood in the developing countries as an equivalent\
    \ to the simple or \nthe ”cheap” technology. \n \nThe decision in this field,\
    \ in fact, has to pay attention to the interaction between the \nprospects of\
    \ profitability of irrigation schemes and the technical surveys. Thus, there has\
    \ to \nbe a continual reciprocal action between technical surveys and economic\
    \ consideration, so \nas to reach in each case the solution which will ensure\
    \ maximum profitability from the \npoint of view of the national economy (BERGMANN\
    \ 1967:48). \n \nFinally, it seems that according to the recognized fact water\
    \ is now a very critical factor for \nmany developing countries, and the other\
    \ which say that the misuse of it was responsible \nfor the law rates of productivity\
    \ there, then sustaining the available amount of water and \nthe efficiency of\
    \ its use have to be considered as determinative factor for the choice of the\
    \ \nirrigation technology. Indeed, it is very important to use the technology\
    \ that suit the \nprevailing social and individual values systems in the society,\
    \ but one is tempted to say also \nthat sometimes it is necessary to change some\
    \ of these values when the modern technology \nis the sole alternative. To put\
    \ it in another way, we have to do some rethinking about, and \nrevaluation of,\
    \ the term ”appropriate technology”44. \n \nIt is not recommended here, therefore,\
    \ to use very modern irrigation methods as a substitute \nfor one like gravity\
    \ system when the latter is, technically and socially, more suitable for the \n\
    intended project. But, we argued that steps on the way of modernization or improving\
    \ this \nirrigation method should be done. Specially in the field of regulators\
    \ systems, land \n                                                           \
    \                                                                            \
    \                                                   \nintensified and polarization\
    \ has expanded. Therefore, institutional innovations as well as changes in the\
    \ \nsocietal modes of distribution are always necessary in order that technological\
    \ modernization contribute to \nthe optimal achievement of objectives. Some of\
    \ the structural effects that lead to an unequal distribution of \nthe benefits\
    \ resulting from the utilization of the modern technologies in agriculture and\
    \ other effects are \ndiscussed in MANIG 1988: 44-8. \n44 „... no great improvements\
    \ in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the\
    \ \nfundamental constitution of their modes of thought... John Stuart Mill“ quotation\
    \ from WATERSTON \n1965:249. \n \n53 \npreparation and harvest45 machines, and\
    \ outlet (field channel) control (e.g., installing a new \ntype of control gate).\
    \  \n \nOne of the important problems - may be the most important - in the traditional\
    \ gravity-flow \nsystem, as HÜBENER and WOLF (1991) viewed, is the unleveled land.\
    \ This problem need \na lot of work and high costs, otherwise the water user will\
    \ lose the control over water at the \nfield and this, consequently, leads to\
    \ dramatic results: some parts of the field become \nmarshy and others die from\
    \ the shortage of water46. On the other hand, increasing the cost \nof irrigation\
    \ will result in decreasing the amounts allocated for the other agricultural \n\
    processes. Using advanced technology will reduce the quantity of water, costs,\
    \ and increase \nthe productivity. The expected positive results will compensate\
    \ then the high costs resulting \nfrom introducing such technical improvements.\
    \ For instance, a recent study of ODA in the \nNile Province of Sudan has found\
    \ that: „with spot irrigation, demand for water is only 14% \nof that required\
    \ by the open channel method, assuming no losses from source to point of \nuse“\
    \ (WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON, 1985:20)47.  \n \nThe experience in U.S. has shown also\
    \ that farmers using conventional gravity-flow \nsystems can cut their water demand\
    \ by 30 percent by capturing and recycling the water that \nwould otherwise run\
    \ off the field (POSTEL 1984:40). These reuse systems are required in \nsome U.S\
    \ jurisdictions where the farmers have also findings, however, that they often\
    \ make \ngood economic sense because pumping tailwater back to the main irrigation\
    \ ditch generally \nrequires less energy. \n \nLining irrigation canals is other\
    \ step that can also help reduce water wastage, prevent \nwaterlogging, and eliminate\
    \ the erosion and weed growth that makes irrigation ditches \ndeteriorate.  \n\
    \ \n2.3.1.2 Technology and Irrigation Management \n \nConsidering the field crop,\
    \ water may be placed in the root profile zone by a wide variety \nof surface\
    \ or flood system; sprinkler system; and subsurface and surface drip irrigation\
    \ \nsystem. Each method can present different difficulties for management. In\
    \ other words, all \nmethods can be managed to similar degrees of high efficiency,\
    \ or mismanaged to similar \ndegrees of low efficiency. Likewise, the water requirement\
    \ of crops do not materially \nchange for the various systems, but rather, the\
    \ apparent differences really represent \nmanagement losses, not crop-water use\
    \ changes (REPLOGLE 1986:135) 48. \n \nSprinkler systems, which come in many varieties,\
    \ use more energy than gravity systems \nand require a large capital investment\
    \ to install, but they have brought irrigation to rolling \nand steep lands otherwise\
    \ suited only for dryland farming. One design of these systems is \nthe center\
    \ pivot system. REPLOGLE (1986:135-8) considers the built-in control and \n  \
    \                                                           \n45 The problem of\
    \ ‘after harvest’ loss for many crops is known in most developing countries. It\
    \ has been \nestimated that these losses are approximately 15-25 per cent of the\
    \ crops. In New Halfa, the tenants \nreported that more than one fourth of the\
    \ total wheat crop is lost because of the bad quality of the harvest \nmachines.\
    \ \n46 See Chapter 6.1.2.1 \n47 The introduction of such technology, on the otherhand,\
    \ can be faced with socio-economic aspects. See \nChapter 5.3.6.4. \n48 Although\
    \ drip irrigation may be inherently more efficient by design, the wide average\
    \ range of efficiency \nfor each system - 40-80 percent for gravity flow, 75-85\
    \ percent for a center pivot sprinkler, and 60-92 \npercent for a drip system\
    \ - shows that management is a key determinant (POSTEL 1984:40). \n \n54 \nmanagement\
    \ ease that are usually installed as part of the system, as one major attraction\
    \ for \nthe large center pivots and the drop systems that are independent of the\
    \ system efficiencies. \nHe counts these advantages and asserts that the flow\
    \ meters installed with both systems \nprovide the farm operator with much of\
    \ his water management information. Pressure \nregulators provide steady flow\
    \ for convenient water management and general ease of \noperation. Granted, maintenance\
    \ problems peculiar to each system exist, but the water \nmanagement decisions\
    \ were frequently provided by equipment preprogramming by the \nfarm operator\
    \ himself, at his leisure. The feeling of control has positive selling points.\
    \ \n \nAs conditions to get the expected organizational and managerial advantages\
    \ concerning the \nintroduction of such systems, we have to focus the attention\
    \ on the following considerations \n(MANIG, 1993): \n \n− the organizational structure\
    \ must be reformed. In this respect, a unit to manage the \n”Station”; operation\
    \ and maintenance; and water distribution may be necessary; \n− furthermore, attached\
    \ to this organization, should be established a conflict-solving \ncorporation\
    \ to coordinate between the different interests of water users. This condition\
    \ \nis more urgent when the Station is managed through water user organization;\
    \ and \n− as a result of the considerable consequences on the agricultural structure\
    \ in the long \nterm, the encouragement of producing export or cash crops instead\
    \ of food crops may \nbe considered as probable disadvantage. \n \nSurface systems,\
    \ on the other hand, have often been constructed with minimum or \nnonexistent\
    \ flow metering and rather haphazard flow control that place sever requirement\
    \ \non a farm operator. Therefore, these systems need to be attractive from the\
    \ operational \nstandpoint, economical, have simple but accurate open-channel\
    \ flow measuring and control \nmethods. \n \nDrip or trickle irrigation is other\
    \ advanced system. This system that is developed in Israel \nin the sixties, supply\
    \ water and fertilizer directly onto or below the soil. An extensive \nnetwork\
    \ of perforated piping releases water close to the plant’s roots, minimizing \n\
    evaporation and seepage losses. These costly systems thus far have been used mainly\
    \ for \nhigh-value orchard crops in water-short areas. They have been used on\
    \ about 10 percent of \nIsrael’s irrigated land in the middle of eighties where\
    \ experiments in the Negev Desert have \nshown per-hectare yield increases of\
    \ 80 percent over sprinkler system. Introduced into the \nUnited States in the\
    \ early seventies, these systems have been used latter on row crops too \n(POSTEL\
    \ 1984:39-40). \n \nIsrael has pioneered the development of automated irrigation,\
    \ in which the timing and \namount of water applied is controlled by computers.\
    \ The computer not only sets the water \nflow, it also detects leaks, adjusts\
    \ water application for wind speed and soil moisture, and \noptimizes fertilizer\
    \ use. The systems typically pay for themselves within three to five years \n\
    through water and energy savings and higher yield (POSTEL 1984: 41). \n \nInnovative\
    \ water-saving technology is - according to the Israel’s experience - one of two\
    \ \nmeasures that are needed to accomplish the efficiency of water use49. The\
    \ first one, which \nconsider a key determinant, is the ”careful management techniques”\
    \ (LEES, 1986:612). \n                                                       \
    \      \n49 In Malaysia’s Muda irrigation system, real time management of water\
    \ releases from the dam, keyed to \ntelemetric monitoring of weather and streamflow\
    \ conditions, has significantly improved water use \nefficiency (ROSEGRANT 1995:2).\
    \  \n \n55 \nIsrael’s overall gains in agricultural water use efficiency, through\
    \ these measures, have \nbeen impressive: the average volume of water applied\
    \ per hectare declined by nearly 20 \npercent between 1967 and 1981, allowing\
    \ the nation’s irrigated area to expand by 39 \npercent while irrigation water\
    \ withdrawals rose by only 13 percent (POSTEL 1984:41). \nFarmers there are induced\
    \ to adopt this technology in part by the attraction of saving money \non water\
    \ fees or profits to be gained with additional water saved, but to a large extent\
    \ also \nby government incentives that reward the innovator with subsidies under\
    \ writing the cost of \nnew technology. It is valid also to say that the technology\
    \ of pressurized extraction makes \npossible Israel’s high degree of centralized\
    \ monitoring of use, but also confers upon \nfarmers considerable autonomy in\
    \ on-farm control. The farmer can turn water on and off at \nwill, but not a drop\
    \ can be legally used without its being metered (LEES 1986:611). \n  \n2.3.2 \
    \ Historical Factors \n \nThe history of an irrigation system -- the course of\
    \ its development, who planned and \nfinance it -- and the past experience of\
    \ managers and water users, have significant \ninfluences on the course of performance\
    \ of irrigation organizations. It is going to effects \nwho is entitled or obliged\
    \ to undertake the activities (decision-making, resource \nmobilization,...etc.)\
    \ at different levels of the system. In addition, the past experience of the \n\
    organizations’ individuals influence their perceptions and expectations, their\
    \ willingness to \ncooperate. \n \nThe evolution of irrigation (indigenous irrigation\
    \ by water users or governmental agency) \nwill shape the goals and orientations\
    \ prevailing within the system. If irrigation was \nestablished: to minimize the\
    \ effects of drought and famine (parts of India during British \nrule), to deal\
    \ with land tenure and overpopulation problems (Sri Lanka), to support the \n\
    expansion of cash or export cropping (Sudan during British rule), to achieve self-\n\
    sufficiency or whatever the ground, the physical design (e.g., scale of project,\
    \ water \ndistribution structure) and the management pattern will be different\
    \ in each case . Also the \ndominant role of the agency in irrigation management\
    \ will vary according to who is entitled \nto take over the irrigation development\
    \ (the government, colonial government, or foreign \ndonor assistance). Yet, it\
    \ is of interest to know whether the agency has been part of a \nMinistry of Agriculture\
    \ where the agricultural considerations dominate in managing \nirrigation activities,\
    \ or within some other ministry like ministry of irrigation where the \nagency\
    \ is likely to regard irrigation as essentially a hydraulic exercise. Another\
    \ historical \ninfluence derives from the role that irrigation has played in the\
    \ development of the \nagriculture sector as a whole. \n \nOne of the studies\
    \ which make use of certain basic ecological concepts and the role of \nhistorical\
    \ aspects in development is that of Geertz’s analysis of the economic history\
    \ of \nIndonesia (1963). Geertz accounts for the differences between the patterns\
    \ of development \nin Java on the one side, and in the Outer Islands on the other,\
    \ in terms of their contrasted \nenvironmental and demographic contexts. He examined\
    \ these contrasts historically and in \nrelation to Dutch colonial policy. Such\
    \ interests in the historical development of cultivation \nsystems at a very broad\
    \ level is matched by that of some historians who have also sought to \nexplain\
    \ long-term patterns of agrarian development. HARRISS (1982:19) summarize the\
    \ \nargument of Geertz as follows: \n  \n”the physical conditions of Java have\
    \ allowed production to be increased so as to keep \npace with the rapidly growing\
    \ population, though at constant levels of output per head. \n \n56 \nThis has\
    \ required the use of more and more labor-intensive cultivation practices and\
    \ also \nsome ‘ sharing of poverty ‘ - as in the sharing out of access to land\
    \ or of opportunities for \nwage work . He describes this whole pattern as one\
    \ of ‘ involution ‘ - in the sense that \nthere has been increasing elaboration\
    \ of existing social and economic structures - in \ncontrast with the kind of\
    \ transformation of older structures, and increasing inequality, \nwhich has occurred\
    \ in parts of the Outer Islands ”50. \n \n2.3.3  Socio-Cultural Factors \n \n\
    Social and cultural factors affecting both water users’ and irrigation bureaucracies’\
    \ role in \nmanagement. These factors are based on caste and religion, social\
    \ customs and traditions, \nmores and taboos, local employment generated by the\
    \ project, contribution of project \nbenefits among the clientele of the project,\
    \ contribution of the project to civic amenities, \nimpact on environment, and\
    \ impact on the quality of life in general. Many projects have \nfailed because\
    \ they did not meet the social objectives of their clientele. \n \nREVANS (1967:174)\
    \ stressed the importance of some of the cultural issues. As long ago as \n1967\
    \ he was in Sudan, warning: “Many of the development problems of Africa can be\
    \ \nunderstood and treated only by those who share the culture of the African,\
    \ who understand \nhis value system, his sense of fairness, his attitude to authority,\
    \ and, what is often \noverlooked by the western observers what he wants out of\
    \ life and what effort he is \nprepared to make to get it” . In the same context,\
    \ the Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations (FAO) has rightly\
    \ attributed the failure of planning in India to „ its lack \nof cohesion with\
    \ social factors and the impediments imposed by political, social, \nadministrative\
    \ and cultural forces„ (SINGH 1986:349). \n \nAnother examination of these variables,\
    \ according to experiences in Asia and Africa, has \nbeen discussed in UPHOFF\
    \ (1991:97-8, and 1986:51-2). He views residence patterns, \nsocial diversity\
    \ within the cultivating community, social homogeneity in bureaucracies, \ninterpersonal\
    \ relations, and what he refers to as ‘propensity for conflict‘ or conversely,\
    \ \naversion to conflict as most important socio-cultural variables. \n \nTasks\
    \ of communication and coordination are more complex when residence patterns are\
    \ \ndispersed rather than nucleated and do not correspond to the channel layout\
    \ of the irrigation \nsystem i.e., when field neighbors are not village neighbors\
    \ (as the case in the first case in \nthis study - Gendettu). On the other side,\
    \ in settlement schemes, system managers may \nhave control over water users’\
    \ living arrangements as well as over their water (the second \ncase - New Halfa).\
    \ \n \nHeterogeneity in ethnic, cultural, and/or in economic terms, make the cooperation\
    \ among \nwater users may be more difficult and more management effort must go\
    \ into conflict \nresolution. Differentiation can also occur in a homogeneous\
    \ social situations. Experience \nsuggests (in Gal Oya, Sri Lanka and New Halfa,\
    \ Sudan) that conflict will be less if settlers \nare brought into an irrigation\
    \ scheme from different areas located together homogeneously \nby place of origin.\
    \ Whereas, in Mwea system in Kenya, managers thought that it would be \nbetter\
    \ to mix up original clans when assigning houses and fields to new tenants. \n\
    The important cultural variable to be considered here is the ways that community\
    \ used to \ndeal with conflict. The experiences here says that some communities\
    \ have effective roles \n                                                    \
    \         \n50 For a useful critique of Geertz’s notion of ‘involution‘, see AASS\
    \ (1980) \n \n57 \nand procedures for resolving conflict, while others do not.\
    \ SINGH (1986:167), in this \ncontext, asserts that the experience in Zambia has\
    \ shown „if the community accepts only the \nauthority of religious or tribal\
    \ leaders, then these leaders should be consulted and asked \nnot only to solve\
    \ these problems but also to endorse the development of their villages.“ He \n\
    has also noted, based on the experience in Israel (the settlers in a village in\
    \ the northern part \nof the country) that any attempt by the development authorities\
    \ to undermine the authority \nof local leadership „is likely to result in undesirable\
    \ situations„. \n \nThe cardinal rules that can be drown from these and other\
    \ experiences (e.g., Bas Bosen \nproject in Haiti) are the importance of understanding\
    \ the background of the population, \nespecially in settlement areas where development\
    \ authorities select the settlers. The \nplanners here cannot afford to isolate\
    \ themselves from the people they are to serve. \nSensitivity to the abilities\
    \ and sensibilities of the people is the key to success. The dignity \nof the\
    \ population must always be upheld, and their communities of values must be \n\
    respected and accommodated. The latest rule is that „if there is a conflict between\
    \ the \nabilities of the people and a development project, it is the project that\
    \ must be changed, not \nthe people„ (SINGH 1986:169). \n \nJust like the situation\
    \ among water users, socio-cultural factors influence bureaucracies in \nthe same\
    \ way. Some bureaucracies are heterogeneous with regard to status and \nspecialization\
    \ of members, in addition, the social homogeneity has similar consequences as\
    \ \nin communities for their smooth functioning. \n \nInterpersonal relations\
    \ prevailed (egalitarian, hierarchical, or deferential relations), viewed \nUPHOFF\
    \ et al. (1991:98) as, ”probably the most important cultural norm”. Societies\
    \ differ \nconsiderably in this regard and can change over time. Hierarchical\
    \ norms give any staff \nmore ‘power‘ over water users to regulate irrigation\
    \ behavior. But, they also reduce the \ncontent and effectiveness of communication\
    \ in both directions, contributing to gaps in \nknowledge and understanding on\
    \ both sides of the management equation. They are \nespecially important to consider\
    \ within an irrigation bureaucracy; how superiors and \nsubordinates relate to\
    \ one another, and how much control and accountability there is within \nthe organization.\
    \ Some changes in these relations is sometimes necessary for achieving \nirrigation\
    \ goals but it is also of importance to keep in mind that hierarchical norms and\
    \ \nbehaviors in bureaucracies are not very malleable. They ”arise from and are\
    \ reinforced by \nthe larger cultural context” (p.98). \n \n2.3.4  The Political\
    \ Context \n \nIt is a known fact at the present that political realities, may\
    \ be more than the other factors, \nare a crucial element of the contexts in which\
    \ irrigation organizations function. Although \nthis statement is relatively valid\
    \ in the three main continental areas of the third world, \nconsider Africa is\
    \ considered as good field to examine the crucial influence of the broader \n\
    external political environment on the functioning and management of development\
    \ \norganizations. Here the intensity of government’s engagement in irrigation\
    \ sector plays a \nfundamental role. This engagement is therefore more close in\
    \ countries where the following \nconditions dominate: the trade deficit is growing,\
    \ the agriculture sector constitute a major \npart in the GDP, the water is a\
    \ limited production factor in agriculture, and where the \nirrigated agriculture\
    \ area is great. The more important indicator for the engagement \nintensity of\
    \ the government according to HUPPERT (1989:86) is the ”frequency of \npersonnel\
    \ transfer”. The transfer of personnel in ministry of agriculture, irrigation\
    \ \n \n58 \nadministration and project management represent an environment of\
    \ insecurity which \nhave, considerably, negative effect on the efficiency of\
    \ irrigation management. \n \nIn this respect, LEONORD (1988:908) according to\
    \ his experience in Kenya notes that the \nstate in Africa is still a fragile\
    \ institution and that political systems depend heavily on \npatronage: ”politics\
    \ still dominates all other organizational and policy considerations”. \nBROWN’S\
    \ (1989) Liberian case study also confirms this result. He concludes: ”there is\
    \ \nlittle to suggest that the dominant influence was attitudinal , and much to\
    \ suggest that \nattitudes and behavior were conditioned primarily by political\
    \ influences” (BROWN \n1993:99). These arguments51 are extension, in the same\
    \ direction, to those argued by \nHOWELL (1974:99-100) in his wide-ranging survey\
    \ of approaches to third world \nmanagement. HOWELL questions the assumptions\
    \ of conventional approaches and stress, \nfor example, cultural and psyche-social\
    \ influences and structural weakness. Such \napproaches, he argues, have some\
    \ explanatory value but are collectively inadequate; \nindeed, he contends, ‘they\
    \ have all contributed to a harmful misdirection of interest in the \nstudy of\
    \ the role of management in development planning‘. His own thesis is that it is\
    \ the \npolitical environment which is the critical influence on managerial performance,\
    \ and that \nthe way forward for managerial development is in the building upon\
    \ existing organizational \nresources rather than the preoccupation with their\
    \ shortcomings. \n \nIn his discussion on this important element of the irrigation\
    \ management’s environment \nconcentrate UPHOFF ET AL. (1991:98-102) upon three\
    \ visible aspects: \n \n− the policies of government which set for the bureaucracy\
    \ the objectives of \nirrigation management; the orientation of the political\
    \ ‘masters‘; what sort of \nobjectives preferred by government leaders (self-sufficiency,\
    \ minimizing \nexpenditures or create a more equitable society);  \n \n− the extent\
    \ of interference by politicians in management i.e., whether there are \ncomplains\
    \ about pressure for irregularities in water allocation or distribution (to \n\
    benefit certain privileged groups), or about intervention in the operation of\
    \ the \nagency, affecting staff transfers, promotion, etc.. Interference may be\
    \ also practiced \nthrough unsanctioned payments extracted from water users for\
    \ irrigation services, \ncommonly referred to as ‘corruption‘; and  \n \n− the\
    \ extent of water users’ influence on the management decisions. This depend \n\
    partly on the importance of farming sectors in the political-economic strategy\
    \ and \non the extent that water users are organized and able to make their collective\
    \ voice \nheard. Whether they have electoral significance as a bloc or pressed\
    \ to become \n‘clients‘ subordinate to rural or urban elite ‘patrons‘. \n \nWithin\
    \ the scope of discussing the political environment, increase often the talking\
    \ about \ncorruption. A remarkable example here has been noted by WADE (1982,\
    \ 1985). He \nargued that the irrigation engineers who are responsible for the\
    \ canal systems in India, keep \nintentionally the predictable level of water\
    \ down to get ‘bribe’ money (HUPPERT 1989: \n86).52 \n                       \
    \                                      \n51 These and other examples are discussed\
    \ in greater detail in BLUNT/JONES 1992, and BLUNT et al 1993. \n52 Bribe must\
    \ not be in term of money. The experience in Gendettu showed also the political\
    \ bribe (Chapter \n6.1.3).  \n \n59 \n \n2.4  Organization Structure \n \nFor\
    \ a time, specifically since the notion of the contingency theory that have been\
    \ developed \nby KATS/KAHN and THOMPSON, it is a rather common assumption that\
    \ environment is \nrelated to the structure of complex organizations. The implication\
    \ of this notion is that: for \na given environment a particular structure is\
    \ appropriate (PENNINGS and TRIPATHI \n1978:171). In other words, there is no\
    \ single ideal structure which is best for all \norganizations in all circumstances\
    \ (SAGARDOY 1986:12). Although most of the research \non this structure-environment\
    \ relationship has been conducted in the industrialized nations \nof the west,\
    \ it is valid to say that it is also relevant to the developing countries. This\
    \ \nrelationship is therefore regarded to as being culture-free. By the same token,\
    \ there are \ncertain relationships, such as the relationship between technology\
    \ and organizational \nstructure and that between organizational size and formalization\
    \ which have yet to be \ndirectly and consistently refuted by empirical research\
    \ (BLUNT/JONES 1992: 21). \n \nThe changes in the social or nonsocial environment53,\
    \ as mentioned before, are the reason \nfor the inconsistency which often occur\
    \ between the institutional element and the structure \nelement (COWARD 1980a:19).\
    \ Change in either the institutional or the social structure \ncomponent creates,\
    \ however, demand for change in the other. Furthermore, since the \nstructural\
    \ elements show a great inertia in the face of changes, the strategically decisions\
    \ \nconcerning the organizational structure of an irrigation system have long-term\
    \ effects. This \nmeans a stable function-specific organizational structure constitutes\
    \ the framework for the \nsituation-specific management of such systems (MANIG\
    \ 1989: 4). The formal organization \nstructure, however, describes the system\
    \ of regulations and stipulations within the \norganizations which are important\
    \ for the members’ attitudes. \n \nAccording to the two basic principles of work\
    \ organization, i.e., the division of labor and \nthe coordination, BLUNT/JONES\
    \ (1992:111) defines the structure of an organization as \n”the way in which it\
    \ chooses to divide its labor into separate work groups, and how it \ncoordinate\
    \ their activities”. These two basic activities are also widely referred to in\
    \ the \nliterature as differentiation and integration and considers the more important\
    \ aspects that \nare relevant to the form of organization structure (HUPPERT 1989:70).\
    \ Furthermore, the \nway in which the various activities essential to the achievement\
    \ of an organization’s \nobjectives can best be differentiated (in accordance\
    \ with the specialist skills required for \neach activity) and then coordinated\
    \ in order to produce the necessary unity of effort among \nthe resulting specialist\
    \ units, is referred to often as the horizontal dimension of the \norganizational\
    \ structure. The vertical dimension, oppositely, is concerned with the way in\
    \ \nwhich responsibilities are distributed among members working at different\
    \ levels of the \norganization and its component units, from the project to the\
    \ small group level. \n \nIn addition to the structural differentiation (the degree\
    \ of specialization) and integration (the \ncoordination within and between organizations),\
    \ KIESER/ KUBICEK had mentioned three \nother dimensions for the organizational\
    \ structure namely ( MANIG 1989:7): \n \n− the management system (configuration);\
    \ \n                                                             \n53 One of the\
    \ ways to subdivide the environment from the social scientist’s point of view\
    \ has been to refer to \nthree kinds of systems-the cultural system, the personality\
    \ system, and the social system. This helps to \nseparate and to keep in mind\
    \ that there are different kinds of phenomena which we confront (POTTER \n1972:157).\
    \ \n \n60 \n− the competence distribution; and \n− formalization    \n \nIn search\
    \ of the more variables that influence the organizational structure, CHILD \n\
    (1972,1984 ) criticize the studies that had given insufficient attention to the\
    \ role of senior \nmanagers or decision-makers in the whole process of an organization’s\
    \ structural \ndevelopment e. g., Aston Studies (see p.47). Executives, he argues,\
    \ interpret the same \nenvironmental or contextual factors differently, and to\
    \ some degree organization’s structure \nreflect these differences. Therefore,\
    \ senior management acts, according to this line of \nthinking, as a mediating\
    \ variable between contextual factors and organizational structure, \nas depicted\
    \ in Figure 2.1. Senior management make strategic choices about what they \nconsider\
    \ to be appropriate structures for the contingencies they perceive (BLUNT/JONES\
    \ \n1992:127). \n \nFigure 2.1: The Relationship Between \n Context and Structure\
    \ According To Child (1972) \n \n \n  Environment \n \n \n \n \n \nContextual\
    \ factors:    Technology------Senior Management ---OrganizationalStructure \n\
    \ \n  Size  \n \nSource: BLUNT/JONES 1992:127 \n \nA more comprehensive view is\
    \ argued by COWARD (1980a:25-6) who take into \nconsideration the two important\
    \ organizational configurations in irrigation system i.e., that \ncomposed of\
    \ the role of water users and the other which is relevant to the various water-\n\
    authority roles. The boundaries between the two configurations in community irrigation\
    \ \nsystems are thin and sometimes unclear because ”they are guided by similar\
    \ socio-cultural \nrules and because of the temporal circulation of individuals\
    \ between the two \nconfigurations”. In contrast, he argues, in irrigation systems\
    \ where water authorities are \nmore specialized and differentiated from the water\
    \ users, develop an urgent need to an \nefficient articulation between the two\
    \ configurations. In these systems, assert Coward that \nthe major organizational\
    \ feature influencing system management is the degree of \nintegration of water\
    \ users and water authorities. \n \nIt is valid to say that this line of thinking\
    \ is in between other two lines. One is represented \nby SCOTT/MITCHELL (1972:222)\
    \ and the other in UPHOFF et al. (1991). SCOTT and \nMITCHELL refer to a school\
    \ which bind organizational effectiveness and control. This \nrelationship is\
    \ in detail discussed and illuminated by empirical research in PRICE (1968). \n\
    Organizational effectiveness in this context is taken in the sense of BARNARD54\
    \ who \ndefines it as ”the dispatch with which an organization achieves its goals”.\
    \ Although this \ndefinition has no distinct signal to the value of participation,\
    \ it considers that the \norganizational control systems can implicitly lead to\
    \ participation. But, this is not bound to \nhappen. This means that participation\
    \ here is not an inevitable consequence for the \nexistence of control systems\
    \ and their implementation. PRICE argues then that integral \nwith control systems\
    \ are, of course, the means or techniques by which an organization \nexercises\
    \ influence over participation behavior, and he gives the sanctions a central\
    \ role in \nthis techniques. \n                                              \
    \               \n54 BARNARD, C. I. (1939), The Functions Of The Executive. \n\
    \ \n61 \n \nUPHOFF et al. (1991), on the other hand, has discussed the factors\
    \ that determine the \ndifferences in what can be called the height and gradient\
    \ in organizational system. Both \nreflect and in turn affect the extent and ease\
    \ of cooperation and communication within the \nstructure. These factors are:\
    \ the distance between persons and levels, the relationship \nbetween them, directions\
    \ of the decisions and information flow, the degree of participation, \nand accountability.\
    \  \n \nAccording to the height and gradient UPHOFF et al. (1991:38-42) distinguished\
    \ two forms \nof structures (p. 38-42) as in Figure 2.2. The first one is relatively\
    \ tall and narrow, steeply \nsloped pyramid (A). This form refers to large systems\
    \ which have more levels. The length \nhere is more influenced through the distance\
    \ between levels than the number of levels itself \nwhich is fixed by its system\
    \ physical layout and size. The cooperation and communication \nbetween levels\
    \ is, on the other hand, either promoted or impeded by social and \npsychological\
    \ factors. The steeper gradient, in addition, means that: \n \n• \nthe flow of\
    \ decisions and information is more downward than upward; \n• \nthe authority\
    \ is concentrated at the higher levels; \n• \nlow or little participation at lower\
    \ levels in decisions making; \n• \nlittle accountability of persons at higher\
    \ levels to those at lower levels; and \n• \nthe ”angle of interaction”, measured\
    \ in terms of the ratio of downward flows of \n \ndecisions and information to\
    \ upward flows, is great.  \n \n \nFigure 2.2: Alternative Shapes of Organizational\
    \ Pyramids \n \nSource: UPHOFF et al. 1991:38 \n \nThe second pyramid (B) is shorter\
    \ and broader with flatter gradients. Mostly, this is the \nform of structure\
    \ in small-scale systems and means that: \n \n• \nthe spatial distance between\
    \ persons who have different responsibilities for \n \noperational and maintenance\
    \ is short; \n• \nthe flow of decisions and information is fully two-directional\
    \ ; \n• \ndelegation of authority to lower levels and more degree of participation\
    \ by \n \nsubordinates in decisions-making at the higher levels; \n \n \n \n \n\
    62 \n• \nmore accountability of persons at higher levels to those at lower levels,\
    \ and \n• \nthe angle of interaction between levels is a little. \n \nUPHOFF et\
    \ al. (1991:44-50) based on the Aston Studies55 analyses four variables that are\
    \ \n”the most meaningful ones for comparing and assessing structural variation\
    \ in irrigation \nbureaucracies”. The first two variables are those of Aston Studies;\
    \ concentration of \nauthority and structuring of activities. The other two additional\
    \ major variables are \naccountability and responsiveness. The former (accountability)\
    \ denote the extent to which \nthe performance of managers and staff is monitored\
    \ and can be controlled, either by senior \nofficials and / or by water users\
    \ in an agency-managed system (or by farmer in user-\nmanaged systems); the opposite\
    \ end of this scale is personnel autonomy. Whereas, \nresponsiveness means the\
    \ extent to which the organization has information flows and \ndecision-making\
    \ mechanisms at all appropriate levels that permit informed changes in \noperation\
    \ for modifying water and other resource use; the opposite of this is \nunresponsiveness,\
    \ or rigidity. \n \nAlthough responsiveness may seem to be the opposite of structuring\
    \ which have in the most \nthe precedence in all bureaucracies, a bureaucracy\
    \ in fact ”could be structured with \nstandardized procedures to make it responsive”.\
    \ In Peru, for example, it has been found that \nresponsiveness could be ‘routinized‘\
    \ that establish certain kinds of organizational \ncapacities. The structural\
    \ feature associated with this variable would be ”information flows \nand mechanisms\
    \ for making changes in organizational structure and operation according to \n\
    change either in the context or goals management” 56. \n \nThe variable responsiveness\
    \ has been also characterized in the literature as a signal factor to \nwhether\
    \ the organization is well or poorly ‘joined’ and ‘communicated‘. Communication\
    \ \naccording to UPHOFF is concerned between levels instead of between system\
    \ and sub-\nsystem of the organization. Finally, responsiveness is also said to\
    \ reflect the ”degree of \nopenness” in an organization, that means its flexibility\
    \ and response to the stimulants from \ntheir environment. Whether the organization\
    \ operate as ”open system” respond more \nreadily to stimuli from its environment,\
    \ which suit an irrigation agency as discussed in \nChapter 1, or as a ”mechanistic\
    \ closed” one which is more self-contained, seeking to \ncontrol all external\
    \ changes 57. This seems to be, for the most part, identical with the \norganic\
    \ organization in contingency theory.  \n                                    \
    \                         \n55 Aston's studies are some of the most widely respected\
    \ studies within the field of organization theory, that \nhave been done at the\
    \ University of Aston in England. The Studies have been aimed at identifying the\
    \ \nfundamental dimensions of Structure in bureaucratic organization that are\
    \ essentially independent of each \nother. Towards this, the Studies have singled\
    \ out two variables (from six) that represent two major \ndimensions of any management\
    \ structure; namely: concentration of authority, and structuring of activities\
    \ \n(specialization, standardization, and formalization). The researchers found\
    \ these variables to be inversely \ncorrelated; the more concentration, the less\
    \ structuring. UPHOFF et al. (1991:44) has nevertheless found, \naccording to\
    \ the cases considered in his study that the opposite appears to be true in irrigation\
    \ \nbureaucracies: concentration and structuring usually go together. \n56 The\
    \ example illuminated here is from Taiwan. Taiwan irrigation systems exemplify\
    \ this variable with well \nestablished procedures for changing the rules of water\
    \ allocation and distribution in periods of water \nstress. Control over water\
    \ can pass upward within Taiwanese systems in what can be called a default \n\
    upward pattern of management. In these systems, responsiveness is linked to increasing\
    \ concentration of \nauthority to handle shortages whenever these arise. \n57\
    \ The organizations are viewed also as self-sufficient entities. The emphasis\
    \ in this approach is upon the \ninternal operation of the organization and the\
    \ adoption of rationalistic approaches taken from physical \nscience models. The\
    \ organization is considered as sufficiently independent that its problem can\
    \ be \nanalyzed in terms of internal structure, tasks and formal relationships.\
    \ In organization theory, the closed \n \n63 \n \nThe conclusion that UPHOFF has\
    \ drawn from the above is: \n \n1. concentration of authority and structuring\
    \ of activities refer to the internal processes \nof bureaucratic functioning,\
    \ and tend to coincide with higher gradients; whereas \n2. accountability and\
    \ responsiveness are more oriented to external context and \ncorrespond to lower\
    \ gradients. \n \nEmpirically, through RONDINELLI’s study (1986) of the USAID’s\
    \ projects undertaken in \nAfrica in the decade up to 1986, it was found that\
    \ high on the list of problems identified by \nthese analyses were those associated\
    \ with organizational structure and design. Furthermore, \na corroborative result\
    \ has been argued by KIGGUNDU (1989). On the basis of studies \nconducted by others\
    \ in Africa and his own experience of organizations in Uganda, Kenya \nand Ghana,\
    \ KIGGUNDU has drawn up a structural profile of a ‘typical organization‘ in a\
    \ \ndeveloping country. He has divided the organization into three parts (top\
    \ management, \nmiddle management, and operating levels) and analyzed the characteristics\
    \ of each as \nfollows (BLUNT/JONES 1992:131): \n \nTop managers in a typical\
    \ organization in a developing country are authoritarian and \npaternalistic,\
    \ autocratic, overworked, and highly educated. Organizations typically do not\
    \ \nhave clearly stated and widely understood missions or objectives; they are\
    \ heavily \npoliticized, and have weak executive support systems. Senior managers\
    \ also devote too \nmuch of their time to extra-organizational activities which\
    \ have little to do with the \norganization’s interests, such as political, tribal,\
    \ religious, or personal family and business \nactivities. \n \nMiddle managers,\
    \ on the other hand, are seen in the above analysis as possessing \ninadequate\
    \ management and administrative skills, insufficient specific knowledge and \n\
    experience, low levels of motivation, and to be risk averse, unwilling to take\
    \ independent \naction or initiative and like senior management, to be unwilling\
    \ to delegate. As a whole, \nmiddle lines in developing country organizations\
    \ are understaffed and are characterized by \nweak and/or inappropriate management\
    \ and organization systems and controls. \n \nAt the operational levels, developing\
    \ country organizations are judged by KIGGUNDU to \nbe inefficient and costly,\
    \ and overstaffed. Operators tend to be underutilized, underpaid, \nand not to\
    \ be rewarded according to performance. This results in low morale, lack of \n\
    commitment, high turnover and absenteeism. The conclusion of such profile is:\
    \ inadequate \ncoordination and communication between the different parts of the\
    \ organization. \n \nIt is also worth noting that other commentators have recently\
    \ arrived at very similar \nconclusions to those of KIGGUNDU. For example, JREISAT\
    \ (1988 :85-97) has described \na number of structural and administrative deficiencies\
    \ common to seven Arab Countries, \nincluding Sudan, which broadly corroborate\
    \ KIGGUNDU’s conclusions.  \n \n                                             \
    \                                                                            \
    \                                                                 \nsystem perspective\
    \ is frequently one where analysis is directed toward general laws of sociology\
    \ or \npsychology and thus where the variables being researched are assumed to\
    \ be unaffected by environmental \nforces. At the heart of this perspective is\
    \ the positivist assumption that objective forces, detected by \ncontrolled scientific\
    \ observation, can exert a direct influence on human activity. This is typically\
    \ the case \nin experimental or laboratory approaches. This perspective emphasis\
    \ therefore upon maximizing the \ninternal efficiency. Further details in HASSARD\
    \  1993: 30-1. \n \n64 \n2.5 Farmers Involvement in Irrigation Management \n \n\
    Perhaps the most serious institutional and organizational issues in irrigation\
    \ development are \nthose related to the articulation between water users and\
    \ the irrigation bureaucracy \n(COWARD 1980a:25). It is agreed upon now in irrigation\
    \ management literature that one of \nthe major reasons for poor performance of\
    \ irrigation systems is the lack of feedback from \nthe field to the center of\
    \ decision-making. Top-down orders are easily given, but feedback \nflows are\
    \ more restricted and liable to distortion (WALKER 1989:348). Unlike industrial\
    \ \nsystems, irrigation systems, argues KELLER (1986), are managed not only from\
    \ the top \ntoward the bottom, but also from the bottom up. This is because the\
    \ very act of irrigation \nrequires farmers to be entrepreneurs and take risks.\
    \ Farmers are not in the „payroll“ but must \ngamble their time, capital, and\
    \ talents in the real present, in hopes of accruing future \nbenefits. Because\
    \ of this, a top-down management system is unworkable, since the \nbureaucracy\
    \ and its employees do not take the risks.58 \n \nThe communication and decision-making\
    \ structure and information channels that are used \nand respected by the farming\
    \ society are very important issues in irrigation organizations. \nIn addition\
    \ to the speculation on the nature of organizations and their role in society,\
    \ \ndiscussed in Chapter 1.2.2.1, other fact can be drawn from the organizational\
    \ theory; this is: \n„Theories about organizations typically treat communication\
    \ in an implicit or a tangential \nmanner“ (EUSKE/ROBERTS 1989:42). Most definitions\
    \ offered by organizational \ntheorists are vague shorthand statements that lack\
    \ precision and specificity in determining \nwhich variables should be the focus\
    \ of message exchange59. In its broadest sense, \ncommunication is „the social\
    \ glue that ties members, subunits, and organizations together“. \nWithout communication,\
    \ organizing could not occur. \n \n2.5.1  The Human Side of The Organization and\
    \ Operation of Irrigation systems \n \nIt is now more recognized that irrigation\
    \ systems are human systems. As opposed to the \ntechnical or physical perspectives,\
    \ conceiving of the irrigation system as a human system, is \nexamining it with\
    \ a view to pinpointing the role of human side in irrigation. CHAMBERS \n(1980:28)\
    \ refers to this human side as „the management of those who manage the water,\
    \ \nthe procedure for irrigation control, the processes of allocation of water\
    \ groups or \nindividuals, and the distribution of water within groups”. Within\
    \ this area of interest and, \nconsidering the irrigation as a ‘happening’, asserts\
    \ KELLER (1986:334) that „a traditional \nirrigation system does not irrigate.....\
    \ it is merely a network of channels feeding prepared \nfields. Human enterprise\
    \ does the irrigation“. Furthermore, the control and allocation of the \nwater\
    \ to the field also requires continuous and direct human action. The human action\
    \ is \ndefined here as the ‘men‘ in organizations and communities; the labor and\
    \ management. \nConsidering the human aspects is then not only essential to facilitate\
    \ the management of \nirrigation, but also is a  precondition for the efficiency\
    \ of irrigation water utilization. \n                                        \
    \                     \n58 To elaborate on the above, he compares an irrigation\
    \ system with free school. Merely putting the building \nin place and providing\
    \ staff does not produce education. Education occur when students take the risks,\
    \ the \ntime, and the effort to attend the school and learn, in hopes that what\
    \ they have learned will be of benefit \nto them in the future. Thus to get the\
    \ students into a program, they must be attracted to it. \n59 Some theorists conceive\
    \ of communication as written versus oral channels or the transmission of messages\
    \ \n(the mechanistic perspective). Others view organizational communication through\
    \ the locus of message \neffects, filtered through cognitive processes of senders\
    \ and receivers. Other theorists, although fewer in \nnumber, treat communication\
    \ as the interpretation of information, the meaning of symbols, or the \nredundancy\
    \ of message patterns. \n \n65 \n \nThis point is reinforced by CRIDDLE (1975:139):\
    \ „ohne  Berücksichtigung der jeweiligen \nBewässerungsmethoden besteht ein enger\
    \ Zusammenhang zwischen der menschlichen \nKomponente und der Bewässerungseffizienz.\
    \ Je grösser der Spielraum für menschliche \nEntscheidungen und Aktivitäten ist,\
    \ desto grösser ist die Gelegenheit zum Missbrauch des \nWassers“. Therefore,\
    \ disregard of this important component as many argue (CHAMBERS \n1980; LOWDERMILK\
    \ 1986; WEITZ 1986, and SINGH 1986), is considered as \nresponsible for the failure\
    \ of many projects in developing countries (e. g., India, Sri Lanka, \nand Israel).\
    \ \n \nIn this context, NOBE and SAMPATH (1986:7), are confining their attention\
    \ to the \ntraining of professionals and farmers which received little attention\
    \ during the 1960s and \n1970s60. They have argued that the most economic resource\
    \ for irrigation development \ntoday may not be financial capital for new schemes,\
    \ but rather „require the abilities of \npeople to do the job- their knowledge,\
    \ skills and professional commitment„. In this regard, \nWIENER (1976:8), formerly\
    \ the chairman of the famous Tahal National Water Program in \nIsrael has also\
    \ stated the importance of training farmers for operating successful irrigation\
    \ \nsystems: \n \n„Engineering is not the fundamental problem underlying irrigation\
    \ development in LDCs. \nEngineering principles are known and can be adapted,\
    \ but the major problem, however, is \nto discover ways to utilize farmer clients\
    \ more effectively in operations and maintenance \nand development programs which\
    \ create rural transformation. Rural transformation \nessentially requires changes\
    \ in farmers’ behavior, motivations, and expectations, which is \nhardly possible\
    \ until institutions exist to provide them with the improved production \npossibilities\
    \ and incentives”. \n \nIn the concrete, one is able to say that among the general\
    \ interest of the human side in \nirrigation systems, the role of farmers as final\
    \ water users- their knowledge, motivations \nand initiatives have been more highlighted.\
    \ This has been strengthened by, as CHAMBERS \n(1992:7) argues, „the growing recognition\
    \ by development professionals of the painfully \nobvious fact that rural people\
    \ were themselves knowledgeable on many subjects that \ntouched their lives”.\
    \ He refers here to what is known as Indigenous Technical Knowledge \n(ITK). CHAMBERS\
    \ (1992:20-1) describes the villagers’ knowledge and capabilities by \nsaying:\
    \ „villagers have a greater capacity to map, model, quantify and estimate, rank,\
    \ score \nand diagram than outsiders have generally supposed them capable of.\
    \ To enable these \ncapabilities to be expressed, the principle is to assume that\
    \ the people can do something \nuntil proved otherwise“.  \n \nBesides the fact\
    \ that the traditional irrigation systems themselves do not irrigate but the \n\
    farmer, it is also increasingly recognized that irrigation is not a task that\
    \ governments or \nagencies can or should do alone. As COREY (1981) has stated\
    \ from his experience in \nIndia: „Government should not do the farmers’ business\
    \ ... development experience \nworldwide indicates that field channel construction,\
    \ operation and maintenance, on-farm \nimprovements, and general management of\
    \ the irrigation water conveyance system below \nthe outlet can be accomplished\
    \ but with direct farmer involvement.“ In general, as \nCHAMBERS (1983) suggested,\
    \ government should unambiguously avoid doing that which \n                  \
    \                                           \n60 A recent survey of 63 world bank\
    \ and USAID irrigation projects, they noted, found that only 1 per cent of \n\
    the total project costs was developed to improving human capital. But, the situation\
    \ in the 1980s is \ndefinitely improving. \n \n66 \ncommunities can do for themselves\
    \ in their own interest, but should intervene when \nexceptional problems are\
    \ beyond a community’s power to overcome (LOWDERMILK \n1986:434-5). \n \nIrrigation\
    \ agencies, as noted by WALKER/CLEVERINAGA (1989:M.IV.1/1), „cannot \nfield enough\
    \ personnel to guard every gate, clean every canal, settle every conflict that\
    \ \narises throughout an irrigation system”. This is not only against the scare\
    \ available \nresources in the developing countries, but also, in the same time,\
    \ it is simply against the \nwishes of farmers themselves which need to share\
    \ an important part of these tasks. \nTherefore, it is the task of the agency,\
    \ to be effective, to know how to make the project’s \nclientele see themselves\
    \ as partners in the effort and how to encourage the individual \ninitiative dormant\
    \ in the people. In other words, the project authority must be capable of \ndiscovering\
    \ the active elements in the local population, to awaken their interests and \n\
    mobilize their initiative. These elements may be found in the ‘educated middle\
    \ class, in the \nrural leaders, in the political parties, or in other groups‘.\
    \ Their successful activation requires \nfirst hand knowledge of the population,\
    \ their customs and traditions and is often based \nmore on perceptiveness and\
    \ intuition than on direct rules and principles(SINGH 1986:353 ). \n \nWithin\
    \ the scope of the evaluation of the irrigation project’s performance until the\
    \ mid -\n1980s it has been found that the most underrated and misunderstood dimension\
    \ of irrigation \ndevelopment is that of the individual and collective irrigation\
    \ behavior of farmers. The \nsituation was briefly like that what LOWDERMILK (1986:428)\
    \ has pointed out: „while \nmuch is known about the different physical aspects,\
    \ the social and organizational aspects of \nirrigation continue to be the Achilles’\
    \ heel in system development, improvement and \noperation”. The lack of effective\
    \ farmer involvement in irrigation projects, he alleges, is \nconsidered responsible\
    \ for the high costs of systems, the perennial problems of operation \nand maintenance,\
    \ low irrigation efficiencies, and resulting low crop production. \n \nOn the\
    \ other hand, although participation can not be regarded as a panacea for problems\
    \ of \nirrigation projects, experiences shows that where farmers are organized\
    \ and have a sense of \nownership in the system, they will not only maintain the\
    \ system, but also assure that \nstructures and facilities are not damaged (Philippines,\
    \ Korea, Taiwan and Japan). This lead, \nof course, to higher crop production\
    \ and levels of living for rural families. \n \nAlthough much of the literature\
    \ on farmer participation is dominated by current efforts in \nsouth and southeast\
    \ Asia, in some countries, such as Chile and Argentina, there are long-\nestablished\
    \ practices whereby farmers participate actively and effectively in the \norganization\
    \ and management of large-scale irrigation projects (LENTON 1986:58). \nFurthermore,\
    \ evidence from many African countries such as Algeria, Tanzania, Kenya, \nZambia,\
    \ Senegal, Ivory coast, Nigeria (BLUNT and JONES 1992:167), Zimbabwe, Mali, \n\
    The Gambia, and Cameroon (FAO 1994:37) suggests that the redistribution of power\
    \ in \norganizations can lead to higher levels of effectiveness and improved quality\
    \ of working \nlife61.  \n \nFor these and other reasons some (TANG 1993:20) argues\
    \ that participation in management \nis not enough. In addition, farmers have\
    \ an important role to play in the governance of these \nsystems, „unless farmers\
    \ have the freedom to participate in both the governance and \n              \
    \                                               \n61 For more details on the Africans’\
    \ case, see for example the more recent studies of FAO in Malawi (1993), \nZambia\
    \ (1994), Zimbabwe (1994), and Tanzania (1994).   \n \n67 \nmanagement processes\
    \ of their irrigation system, they will have little incentive to \nparticipate\
    \ in collective efforts in operation and maintenance”. \n \nFinally, one is able\
    \ to say that the literature on development has seldom known agreement \namong\
    \ the development specialist, especially since the last decade, on specific theme\
    \ like \nthis concerning the importance of Participation. The extensive evaluation\
    \ process for the \ndevelopment projects in developing countries that have been\
    \ conducted in the 1980s by the \ndevelopment experts and donor organizations\
    \ were, of course, behind this remark. To this \nextent some commentators (OAKLEY\
    \ 1991) consider that we are currently, in terms of \nthinking and practice about\
    \ development, in the age of participation. \n \n2.5.2  Participation of Water\
    \ Users in Irrigation Management \n \nOAKLEY (1991) has followed the process of\
    \ development that have been attempted to find \nsolutions for the poverty in\
    \ some of the developing countries for the past 30 years . The \nliterature that\
    \ has accompanied this search, he argued, reflects the periodic emergence of \n\
    new strategies that have greatly influenced thinking and practice. He asserts\
    \ that the \ndisenchantment with the past major development strategies (for example\
    \ Community \nDevelopment, Integrated Rural Development, and Basic Needs) in the\
    \ mid-1970s, led to the \nemergence of ‘participation‘ as a major new force in\
    \ development thinking. Participation \nhere is considered hence as a „critical\
    \ element in tackling the problems of the poor in the \nthird world.“ Therefore,\
    \ because of the importance of the agency-managed irrigation \nschemes in solving\
    \ such problems, and the vital role of participation in the success of these \n\
    projects, one has to give more attention to this factor. The field study, as will\
    \ be presented \nin Chapter 6, was concerned with analyzing the degree of formal\
    \ participation and the \nconcert content of it in the irrigation bureaucracies\
    \ as well as the farmers' organizations.     \n \nDespite the widespread recognition\
    \ of the participation’s importance in attaining \ndevelopment, there is no agreement\
    \ among development specialists concerning the nature \nof development participation.\
    \ In this connection, WEITZ (1986:159), argues that: „since \nsocial factors have\
    \ been so neglected in the study of development, there is little theory to \n\
    guide policymakers in securing development participation among the masses.“ He\
    \ asserts \nhere what COHEN/UPHOFF have pointed out earlier: „Unfortunately, there\
    \ is little \nsystematic knowledge to draw on in the social sciences concerning\
    \ development \nparticipation. Indeed, there is even little consensus on what\
    \ constitutes political \nparticipation, despite much more work and writing on\
    \ that subject”. \n \nIn reviewing the available literature, it is valid to say\
    \ that the term ‘participation‘ in \ndevelopment literature, has been used to\
    \ refer to many meanings. It embraces a broad set of \nattitudes, behaviour patterns,\
    \ and activities. Because the task (defining participation) is not \neasy, many\
    \ researchers and writers talk about participation without defining the concept\
    \ \nand use it, more or less consciously, in different senses (SZELL 1992:603).\
    \ \n \nFrom a sociological standpoint, participation as defined by MÜLLER (1979:58)\
    \ is the \n„taking part in interactions within social groups or societies.“ From\
    \ a political standpoint it \nmeans „taking a hand in the process of political\
    \ consultation and decision-making”. Social \nand political participation, he\
    \ argues, overflow in each other. They look, at all events, like \ntwo analytical\
    \ views of the same action: „soziale und politische Partizipation fliessen \n\
    ineinander über, sind darum allenfalls als zwei analytische Betrachtungsweisen\
    \ der \n \n68 \ngleichen Aktion anzusehen„62. He refers also to the two dimensions\
    \ of participation that \nhave been distinguished by the political scientists\
    \ to simplify the analytical purposes, \nnamely the quantitative and the qualitative\
    \ dimensions. The first, which is stronger in the \nliterature, grasp only the\
    \ statistical aspect and the degree of formal participation, while the \nsecond\
    \ grasp the dynamic aspect, that means, the concrete content of participation.\
    \ The \nqualitative dimension, as MÜLLER argues, make the democratic trends clear\
    \ and show also \ntheir institutional bounds. It is, on the other hand, not an\
    \ easy task to evaluate the outcome \nof this dimension in particular and the\
    \ participation in general. \n \nThe indicators of these two important dimensions\
    \ have been counted and analyzed by \nOAKLEY (1991:248-9). As example for the\
    \ quantitative indicators he ranked: \n \n− Economic indicators: who is participating\
    \ in the project’s benefits; an analysis of \nthose sections of the rural population\
    \ who have directly benefited and a quantitative \nassessment of this benefit\
    \ on their future ability to sustain the level of activities. \nApplying in irrigation\
    \ systems these indicators could be through the analysis of the \nsection of water\
    \ users who benefited from the position of their farms on the water-\ncourse or\
    \ their position on the community (see Chapter 6, Section 6.4.5).  \n− Organizational\
    \ indicators: number of participants, attendance of meetings ...etc. In \nthe\
    \ case studies discussed in Chapter 6 (6.5.2), for example, these indicators are\
    \ the \nnumber of tenants’ representatives in the Scheme Administration and  the\
    \ frequency \nof the joint meetings between the representatives of the tenants\
    \ and the different \nlevels of the field staff.    \n− Participation in project\
    \ activities.  \n− Development momentum: number of project members aware of and\
    \ in contact with \ndevelopment agencies’ services. Number of project members\
    \ who receive some \nkind of formal training from the project. Number of links\
    \ established with similar \nproject groups.  \n \nThe other dimension, the qualitative,\
    \ involves the quality of the participation or the human \nand behavioural aspects\
    \ of the process of participation. It is refered to sometimes as the \nmissing\
    \ dimension. The qualitative indicators of a process of participation are directly\
    \ \nrelated to the rural people involved in the project, and particularly to the\
    \ change that occur \nin the nature, growth and behaviour of the project ‘group‘\
    \ as a result of the project \nactivities. OAKLEY (1991:250) has tempted to follow\
    \ the particular factors, phenomena or \nfeatures which would authentically represent\
    \ the qualitative process of participation and \nsuggested three broad areas of\
    \ qualitative indicators 63: \n \n− Organizational growth: internal structuring\
    \ of project group; allocation of specific \nroles to group members; emerging\
    \ leadership structures; formalization of group \nstructure. \n− Group behavior:\
    \ changing nature of involvement of project group members; \nemerging sense of\
    \ collective and solidarity; involvement in group discussions and \ndecisions.\
    \ \n                                                             \n62 For a fuller\
    \ discussion of the political context and its influence upon a process of participation\
    \ see UNDP: \nReport on an International Seminar on Popular Participation, Ljubljana,\
    \ Yugoslavia (New York, 1982). \n63 For a more detailed discussion see OAKLEY\
    \ (1985)„ A manual for the monitoring and evaluation of the \nPPP. Rome, FAO.“\
    \ \n \n69 \n− Group self-reliance: increasing ability of project group to propose\
    \ and to consider \ncourses of action; changing relationship of group with project\
    \ staff group facilitator; \nindependent action undertaken by the group. The next\
    \ and more difficult task after \nlisting these indicator, as OAKLEY argued, is\
    \ to determine how these indicators \nmight be observed and recorded. \n \nWithin\
    \ the framework of practice, one can distinguish between different kinds of \n\
    participation. The criteria here are how participation might be considered, the\
    \ extent to \nwhich it is practiced, and the group that undertakes the decision-making\
    \ process. Whether \nparticipation is simply another management device designed\
    \ to elicit greater productivity or \nwhether it is a genuine attempt both to\
    \ humanize work and to improve organizational \neffectiveness, PATEMAN (1970)\
    \ refers to three kinds of participation; pseudo, full and \npartial participation\
    \ ( BLUNT/JONES 1992:168): \n \nPseudo participation: describe situations in which\
    \ workers are offered full explanations of \ndecisions already made by management.\
    \ \n \nFull participation: existing only in circumstances where each member of\
    \ an organization, or \ndecision making body within it, has equal power to determine\
    \ the outcome of deliberations \nassociated with the decisions in question. \n\
    \ \nPartial participation: occurs where there is mutual exchange of information\
    \ and influence \nbetween two parties before a decision is taken, but the right\
    \ to decide finally resides in one \ngroup alone ( usually management ). \n \n\
    Through the different meanings of participation, HAGE/FINSTERBUSCH (1987:279)\
    \ \nhave used this which means participation in decision making. This type of\
    \ participation, \nthey argued, has been found to be very effective in helping\
    \ organizations change. It is, \nhowever, not desirable in all forms of organizations.\
    \ In other words, the value of \nparticipation depends upon certain contingencies\
    \ and related to a given situation. In \nmechanical organizations, which depend\
    \ on routines or assembly lines to coordinate \nspecialized tasks and on centralized\
    \ decision-making to direct the large organization, \nparticipation, decentralization,\
    \ and democracy are disfunctional. On the other hand, the lack \nof participation\
    \ in organic organizations would be fatal. HAGE/FINSTERBUSCH have \npointed out\
    \ situations that reveal places where participation, within and outside \norganization\
    \ as well, is especially effective. Within organization: \n \n− Whenever the tasks\
    \ are complex, as in organic forms, power should be \ndecentralized. Research\
    \ is the most common example. \n− Participation by terms in decision making is\
    \ necessary to make them effective either \nas task group or as quality work circles.\
    \ Over the long term this means some \nimplicit sharing of power but not necessarily\
    \ decentralization of the power structure. \n \nOutside the organizations, there\
    \ are also several situations where participation can \nhave an important impact:\
    \ \n \n− For voluntary associations to be effective, it is necessary for them\
    \ to rely upon \nwidespread participation among their membership. While organizations\
    \ can be both \ncentralized and effective, voluntary associations can not (see\
    \ the case of Tenant \nFarmers Union TFU Chapter 6.5.2). \n \n70 \n− For collaborative\
    \ relationships between a national service organization and \nvoluntary associations\
    \ to be effective, it is necessary that there be genuine \nparticipation between\
    \ them. In other words, the service organization must accept the \nrecommendations\
    \ of the voluntary associations and vice-versa. \n− For effective linkages between\
    \ independent agencies to achieve integrated \ndevelopment, it is necessary to\
    \ have participation between them, that is, each \norganization accepts the recommendations\
    \ of the others. Collaboration is essential \nto effective relationships and accepting\
    \ recommendations is essential to \ncollaboration. The absence of such linkages\
    \ and collaboration has resulted in the \nfailure of many irrigation systems (Chapter\
    \ 6.5.3). \n \nIn view of discussing the arguments for participation in development,\
    \ UPHOFF (1986) \nrefers to substantive ones as an essential ingredient in development\
    \ projects. He suggests a \nnumber of reasons, for example, why government might\
    \ gain some net benefit from \npromoting participation (OAKLEY 1991 :15-18): \n\
    \ \n− More accurate and representative information about the needs, priorities\
    \ and \ncapabilities of local people; more reliable feedback on the impact of\
    \ government \ninitiatives and programs; \n− adoption of programs to meet local\
    \ conditions so that scarce resources can be \nemployed more efficiently; \n−\
    \ lower costs of access to the public for agricultural extension programs, nutrition\
    \ \neducation, immunization, etc. through local organizations and institutions;\
    \  \n− improved utilization and maintenance of government facilities and services;\
    \ \n− cooperation in new programs, which is more likely to occur when local \n\
    organizations having the confidence of rural people share responsibility for the\
    \ \ninnovation.  \n \nIn addition OAKLEY add the following arguments: \n \n− Efficiency:\
    \ Participation infers a greater chance that resources available to \ndevelopment\
    \ will be used more efficiently; \n− Effectiveness: Participation allows the rural\
    \ people to have a voice in determining \nobjectives, support project administration\
    \ and make their local knowledge, skills \nand resources available which must\
    \ result in more effective projects; \n− Self-reliance: Participation helps to\
    \ break the mentality of dependence which \ncharacterizes much development work\
    \ and, as a result, promotes self-awareness and \nconfidence and causes rural\
    \ people to examine their problems and to think \npositively about solutions64;\
    \ \n− Sustainability: on a more general level, sustainability refers to continuity\
    \ and see \nparticipation as fundamental to developing a self-sustaining momentum\
    \ of \ndevelopment in a particular area.  \n                                 \
    \                            \n64 MASLOW (1954) distinguishes five types of the\
    \ needs: 1- physiological needs; 2- needs of security; 3- \nneeds of belong to\
    \ someone; 4- needs of recognition and finally; 5- needs of self-realization.\
    \ According to \nthis concept, these five types of needs are hierarchically built\
    \ upon each other in such away that people are \ninterested in and motivated to\
    \ satisfy their needs of higher order only when their needs of lower order have\
    \ \nalready been satisfied. Naturally this hierarchy is not rigid: the dividing-line\
    \ where the turn towards the \nneeds of higher order begins, is obviously not\
    \ at the point where the needs of lower order were fully met. \nIt is necessary\
    \ to reckon also with the fact that the dividing lines between the types of needs\
    \ are flexible \nand also a substitution process might take place (HETHY 1988:73).\
    \ \n \n71 \n \nSZELL (1992:605), in this connection, add two important advantages:\
    \ \n \n− Participation offers the possibility of solving, through individual and/or\
    \ collective \nbargaining, the contradictory interests of the different target\
    \ groups in organization. \nThis is considered the main social and organizational\
    \ utility of participation; \n− It helps to fight against what CROZIER has called\
    \ „the bureaucratic phenomenon“ \n(1964) or „the blocked society“ (1970) by democratization\
    \ of decisions, \nhumanization of interpersonal relations, and negotiating what\
    \ some scholars would \ncall today „all-win“ solutions.  \n \nMoreover, some have\
    \ suggested that the development approach must be turned around to \nsee its impetus\
    \ coming from below and not always directed from above. Another line of \nargument\
    \ suggests that rural people are not ignorant, idle or apathetic, on the contrary,\
    \ are \nresourceful and hard working. Finally, there is the argument that rural\
    \ people should \nactively participate in development in order for them to contribute\
    \ a countervailing force to \nthose elite groups who inevitably dominate development\
    \ resources and activities. People’s \nparticipation is then a necessary counteracting\
    \ force that should at least halt, if not reverse, \nthe progression of the dependence,\
    \ inequality, and centralization that seek the dominant \nforces to maintain in\
    \ many third world countries(OAKLEY 1991:16). Since 1979 the \nUNRISD inquiry\
    \ has laid particular emphasis upon this dimension of participation. \n \nIFAD’s\
    \ experiences with irrigation suggests that participation is particularly critical\
    \ in \nterms of sharing the costs of irrigation operation and maintenance. Others\
    \ (PATIL, 1987), \nin addition, see the advantages in efficiency terms, particularly\
    \ with regard to procedures \nand control of water distribution. Participation\
    \ is for the most an important factor to \nfacilitate the irrigation management\
    \ and therefore to increase the irrigation performance. \nFarmer participation,\
    \ as CHAMBERS (1985) has argued: \n \n \n \n72 \n„may be defined as an approach\
    \ (by irrigation agencies) to increase irrigation \nperformance by providing effective\
    \ incentives and conditions that enable farmers, both \nindividually and collectively,\
    \ to accept and fulfill irrigation management responsibilities \nwhere and when\
    \ appropriate“ (LENTON 1986 : 58). \n \nUPHOFF (1986) suggests that when this\
    \ commitment to participation in irrigation schemes \nis put into practice, it\
    \ appears to have three main elements: \n \n− first, participation in the structures\
    \ that develop the scheme; this includes \nparticipation in the design, construction,\
    \ operation and maintenance of the actual \nirrigation system; \n− second, participation\
    \ in the structures of water use within the system; the acquisition \nof the water;\
    \ its allocation between participants; its distribution on an agreed basis \n\
    and the tackling of any drainage problems; and \n− third, participation in the\
    \ organization of effort; vital for the day-to-day functioning \nof the scheme,\
    \ such as decision making and local resources mobilization.  \n \nHe also suggested\
    \ that farmer’s participation in irrigation management is directly linked to \n\
    the quantity of water available. In extremes of both drought and excess water,\
    \ farmers’ \nparticipation is less necessary; however, when just enough water\
    \ is available and its \ndistribution becomes a careful balance between conflicting\
    \ demands, then farmers’ \nparticipation reaches its peak. \n \nThe most common\
    \ participatory characteristic of irrigation schemes is the Water Users’ \nAssociation\
    \ (WUA), or other similar form of organization, which is the basic means \nwhereby\
    \ participants can become involved and carry out management functions. These \n\
    Associations are also in view of their terms of reference, comparable with services\
    \ \ncooperatives. They do management functions to support their members. These\
    \ functions, \nvery often, are not limited to operation and maintenance of the\
    \ irrigation system, they \ninclude as well complementary ones like supplying\
    \ the water-users with agricultural \nproduction means, arranging marketing and\
    \ processing of agricultural products (KNOTH \n1989:253). These kind of organizations,\
    \ that have a cooperative framework, according to \nthe experience of WEITZ (1986:163),\
    \ offer the best means to help peasants become \nfarmers: \n \n„they make production\
    \ more efficient; they expand the opportunities to acquire new \ntechnology and\
    \ equipment that is too costly for the individual farmer to obtain himself; and\
    \ \nthey serve to transform a community of small-scale farmer into a significant\
    \ economic bloc \nfor dealing with suppliers and markets”. \n \nOn the critical\
    \ point of view, it remains to explain that participation is complex matter \n\
    because of the complexity of involved interests, but also because it is the source\
    \ of new \ncontradictions between social actors. It is also a field full of paradoxes:\
    \ „the wishes of \nriskless participation (but participation is always risky),\
    \ the dream of participation for \noneself not for the other, the participation\
    \ desired and feared, participation as a costly gift„ \n(SZELL 1992: 609). Experience\
    \ reveals that participation, which by many is conceived of \nas a means of fighting\
    \ what has been called „the bureaucratic phenomenon“, very often \nbecomes the\
    \ source of new bureaucratic procedures or structures. Furthermore, in many \n\
    cases, participation is more evident as an emotional commitment than a practical\
    \ aspect of \n \n73 \nthe project. It can be, as UPHOFF (1986), and KÖTTER (1988)\
    \ have rightly argued: „more \nillusory than real“ or „more or less tokenism and\
    \ lip-service.“ \n \nWhen that happens people become frustrated and the idea of\
    \ participation quickly loses its \npsycho-social support. This will be the case\
    \ as long as the irrigation schemes are invariably \nstaffed by professionals\
    \ whose qualifications reflect the dominant physical activities and \nfew maintenance\
    \ of permanent cadre of social scientists. Participation as SZELL pointed \nout\
    \ responds to people’s needs but needs people’s support. To be successful, it\
    \ requires \nmature individuals with psychological, social, and strategic capacities65.\
    \ \n                                                             \n65 In the context\
    \ of  the debate between academics and practitioners in the field see the succinct\
    \ review of \nmany case studies in the practice of participation in the three\
    \ main continental areas of the third world \nwhich show how a number of projects,\

    \ for Improving the Performance of \nIrrigation Systems \n \n3.1  Institutional\
    \ Changes as a New Development Strategy \n \nThe importance of institutions in\
    \ the economic analysis is not a novel idea. Many \neconomists have recognized\
    \ this, and institutional economists have been stressing the need \nto place institutions\
    \ at the center of economic analysis for some time, and their analysis has \n\
    generated a wealth of insights (PAPANDREOU 1994:3). In his discussions of the\
    \ role of \ninstitutions, history, and theory on the development process, STIGLITZ\
    \ (1989:26-7) argued \nthat institutions have an impact on how developing economies\
    \ perform; although, he \nargued, it should be attempt to pierce the institutional\
    \ ‘veil’, to see beyond the forms to the \nreal substance of economic transactions.\
    \ And even after doing this the institutions have a \nlife of their own. At the\
    \ same time, he clearly pointed out, institutions should not simply be \ntaken\
    \ as given; they need to be explained. He further asserts the role of the history\
    \ by \nsaying that the fact that some institution serves an economic function\
    \ does not mean that it \nis, in any sense, ‘optimal’, and that historical forces\
    \ do not play an important role in \nunderstanding why we have certain institutions,\
    \ and not others, or why those institutions \ntake on the particular form that\
    \ they do. We will see how the different schools have based \non the historical\
    \ factors to interpret the process of institutional change. \n \nOn the other\
    \ hand, a rigorous analysis of the economic rational of the formation of the \n\
    institution itself has been very rare66. In spite of some methodological resistance\
    \ on the part \nof many institutionalists to endogenize institutions in economic\
    \ term, it is, however, \npossible to point out that in the long- run historical-evolutionary\
    \ process economic factors \ndo play an important role in the shaping of institutions\
    \ (BARDHAN 1989:3). This, of \ncourse, without denying that some exogenous irreducible\
    \ rules and conventions must be \npresupposed in any economic analysis, or without\
    \ ignoring the two-way feedback processes \nbetween economic and other historical-cultural\
    \ factors. \n \n3.1.1  The Process of Institutional Change: Why do Institutions\
    \ Change? \n \nJAMIESON (1987) argued that one view of development was of human\
    \ evolution as \nproblem-solving under pressure, as adaptive change. Change, he\
    \ said, had accelerated and \nunpredictability had increased, making accurate\
    \ and timely feedback more than ever vital \nfor effective adaptive change. At\
    \ the empirical level, changes in local and global conditions \n- ecological,\
    \ social and political - appear to be accelerating. In matters more even than\
    \ \nbefore to have timely feedback, prompt learning and rapid adaptive responses\
    \ \n(CHAMBERS 1992b:64-5). \n \nBERNSTEIN deals with the question of institutional\
    \ problems in his discussion about \ninstitutional birth control. He refereed\
    \ to whether the solution of problems lay in the \ndevelopment of new institutions,\
    \ or whether there may not already be enough institutions of \nsome kinds, and\
    \ that perhaps we should turn our attention to emphasizing quality building \n\
    within existing institutions (POTTER 1972:152). Resource enhancement, however,\
    \ is on its \nown not enough as solution to institutional deficiencies. It is\
    \ normally a short-term solution \nand should perfectly be supported by more basic\
    \ institutional change or upgrading. Changes \nin or upgrading of policies, strategies,\
    \ structures, administrative and management systems, \n                      \

    \ \n \n75 \nare far more difficult to achieve, require strong institutional support\
    \ and commitment, and \nconsequently a more extended time frame. On the other\
    \ hand, they have a more lasting and \npermanent \nimpact \non \ninstitutional\
    \ \nefficiency \nand \neffectiveness \n(WALKER \n/ \nCLEVERINAGA 1989:M.VI.4/1).\
    \ \n \nInstitutional change67 in societies means principle changes in the figuration\
    \ of the \nregulative and organizational principles and behavior and interaction\
    \ patterns. The direction \nthe change takes is usually towards an increasing\
    \ differentiation in formerly general \nprinciples and patterns in specialized\
    \ institutions that are interrelated, while at the same \ntime there is an increasing\
    \ necessity for integration in complex social systems. \nDifferentiation means\
    \ extending the chain of interdependencies that demand integration. \nDifferentiation\
    \ and integration are, thereby, complementary processes (MANIG 1992:79). \n \n\
    Institutional change in traditional social structures is caused by the multifarious\
    \ influences \nof external modernization factors and the increase in internal\
    \ tensions. Such factors result in \nbreaking up of the traditional production\
    \ and exchange systems and the political structure \nas well as changing the institutional\
    \ regulating mechanisms governing the relations of the \npeople among themselves\
    \ and to the resource utilization68. Of the important factors that in \nthe long\
    \ run induce institutional change are the following (MANIG 1991:16): \n \n• population\
    \ growth, \n• increased expectations among the population, \n• changes in the\
    \ demands, \n•  commercialization tendencies, \n• technological change, \n• government\
    \ policy, and \n• an increased in the endogenous social tensions as a result of\
    \ the effects of the above-\nmentioned factors. \n \nInstitutional change is a\
    \ continual process through its feedback mechanism and resulting in \nincreasing\
    \ the complexity of the society. It is an adjustment process and, therefore, a\
    \ part of \ndevelopment. The purpose of the institutional change as MANIG (1991:16-17)\
    \ argued is: \n„to internalize the greater productivity of the resource utilization\
    \ while creating new \nequilibrium, which - on the other hand - are the basis\
    \ for new change processes, etc. The \ntrend in institutional change takes place\
    \ in the direction of the division of certain functions \nfrom the old institutions\
    \ and the creation of specialized institutions which necessitate \nintegration\
    \ in subordinate social systems. The complexity of the society increases“. „Thus,\
    \ \ninstitutional changes have to be understood as adjustment to changed conditions\
    \ and as \npermanent social transformation processes, as well as immanent components\
    \ of \ndevelopment“. \n \nInstitutional change entails social costs and requires\
    \ time. The above mentioned factors, can \nlead to an increase in the social disparities\
    \ such as polarization, stratification, and poverty, \nwhich then induce institutional\
    \ change in the long run. Institutional change can be seen, \ntherefore, as the\
    \ result of the struggle between various groups that want a better share in the\
    \ \nutilization of the resources and income distribution and those who try to\
    \ hinder just that \n(MANIG 1992:10). \n                                     \
    \           \n67 We rely here heavily on MANIG: 1989:33-7; 1991:13-9; 1992:6-11.\
    \ \n68 A transformation from ‘inward-orientation’ to ‘outward-orientation’ is\
    \ an example of such change. \n \n76 \n \nIn this respect, we begin by reviewing,\
    \ briefly, the major schools of thought on the subject \nand then attempt to emphasize\
    \ those factors that are determinant in the Sudan. \n \nThe Marxian theory is\
    \ a well-known endogenous theory of institution. The central driving \nforce behind\
    \ institutions in this theory is the forces of production. Changing in these forces,\
    \ \nparticularly technological change, produce over time some tension between\
    \ the existing \nstructure of property rights and the productive potential of\
    \ the economy, and it is through \nclass struggle that this tension is resolved\
    \ in history, with the emergence of new \ninstitutions. The nature of this tension,\
    \ and the interaction between institutions and the \nutilization and development\
    \ of the forces of production, have been studied with much \ngreater rigor and\
    \ micro-analytic in two strands of recent non-Walrasian economic literature \n\
    (BARDHAN 1989:4)69. One strand is the neo-classical writers on property rights\
    \ and \ntransaction costs, refers to by Bardhan as (CDAWN) school (Coase-Demsetz-Alchian-\n\
    Williamson-North). These writers developed a well articulated endogenous theory\
    \ of \ninstitutions and traced changes in economic history to changes in the institutional\
    \ ground \nrules. The other strand grew out of the theory of imperfect information\
    \ (Akerlof-Stiglitz). It \nprovides framework for analyzing institutions as substitutes\
    \ for missing markets in an \nenvironment which, in some respect, similar to that\
    \ in developing countries; pervasive \nrisks, incomplete markets, information\
    \ asymmetry, and moral hazard. That is why, argued \nBardhan, it has to be seen\
    \ in the recent literature in developing countries a number of \nattempts to model\
    \ institutions, especially in agriculture, on these lines. \n \nAll three of these\
    \ approaches to the endogenous theory of institutions- of the Marxist, \nCDAWN,\
    \ and imperfect information schools – have, as BARDHAN pointed out, some \nbroad\
    \ similarities which may be not quite clear in all sides. \n \n3.1.2 Theory of\
    \ Institutional Innovation \n \nRUTTAN/HAYAMI (1984) draw upon some of the ideas\
    \ of the first two schools in \nbuilding their theory of institutional innovation\
    \ in which they treat institutional innovation \nas endogenous. Based on a concept\
    \ of institution include that of organization, and \nconsistent with the definition\
    \ used by COMMONS (1950), the term institutional \ninnovation, or institutional\
    \ development, in this analysis as RUTTAN elsewhere \nillustrated70 refers to\
    \ a change (1) in the behavior of a particular organization, (2) in the \nrelationship\
    \ between such an organization and its environment, or (3) in the rules that \n\
    govern behavior and relationships in an organization’s environment. \n \nThe authors\
    \ who have effective participation in understanding the processes that enable\
    \ a \nsociety to generate a continuous stream of institutional innovations in\
    \ response to technical \nand economic opportunities or constraints, used here\
    \ the same analytical tools that have \nbeen successfully used in the interpretation\
    \ of the theory of induced technical change. The \nrole of technical and institutional\
    \ change in the economic growth and the relationship \nbetween them can not be\
    \ seen through unidimentional perspective. \nThough the dialectical relationship\
    \ between changes in modes of production (technical \nchange) and changes in production\
    \ relationships, stressed in the Marxian historical \nperspective, Marx believed\
    \ the former provided the more dynamic source of change in \n                \
    \                                \n69 The Walrasian general equilibrium models\
    \ are based on the assumption of zero transaction costs. \n70  RUTTAN 1978, p.329\
    \ \n \n77 \nsocial organization. Thereby, historians working within the Marxist\
    \ tradition often tend to \nview technical change as dominating both institutional\
    \ and cultural change. WITTFOGEL \n(1957), for example, views the irrigation technology\
    \ used in wet rice cultivation in East \nAsia as determining political organization\
    \ (RUTTAN/HAYAMI 1984:217)71. As well as \ntechnological determinism has been\
    \ a dominant theme in the work of the American \ninstitutional school. It was\
    \ the dialectical struggle and conflict between dynamic technology \nand static\
    \ institutionalism which caused economic and political institution to undergo\
    \ \nhistorical change and adjustment, according to Veblen’s view. A similar tendency\
    \ has been \nalso registered in the literature of sociology and anthropology (RUTTAN\
    \ 1978:330-1). In \naddition, institutional innovation has been viewed in the\
    \ field of development economies \n(SCHULTZ 1964; HAYAMI and RUTTAN 1971) - where\
    \ the primary emphasize is on the \nsize of the income stream generated by technical\
    \ change - as a lagged response to the rising \neconomic value of man and the\
    \ growth of productivity. Also the institutionalists, the old \nand the new, while\
    \ they differ sharply on the welfare implications of technical change, both \n\
    seem to share a view of technical change as the product of an autonomous inner\
    \ logic of \nscientific discovery and technical innovation. \n \nThe other extreme\
    \ line of though is represented in POLANYI, 1957; NORTH and \nTHOMAS, 1970, 1973;\
    \ CHANDLER, 1972. The Polanyi’s analysis of the sources of the \nindustrial revolution\
    \ maintains that institutional rather than technical change is the dynamic \n\
    source of economic development. NORTH and THOMAS in their pioneering attempt to\
    \ \nexplain economic growth in terms attribute the major sources of western economic\
    \ growth \nto changes, brought about by the pressure of population against increasingly\
    \ scarce resource \nendowments, in the institutions whose rules govern property\
    \ rights. They attempt to \ndemonstrate that technical innovation and productivity\
    \ growth represent a lagged response \nboth to institutional changes induced by\
    \ long-run changes in relative factor and product \nprices and to changes in the\
    \ size of the market. Growth according to NORTH and \nTHOMAS can occur only if\
    \ the economic organization is efficient. They repeatedly \nemphasize their commitment\
    \ to the view that institutional change precedes, and is more \nfundamental than,\
    \ technical change. Moreover, they emphasize that an expanding market \neconomy\
    \ constitutes to rising per capita income even in the absence of technical change.\
    \ \nWorking on a less cosmic scale, CHANDLER views that the economies of scale\
    \ in \nAmerican industry are far more a product of institutional innovation than\
    \ a product of \ntechnical change (RUTTAN 1978:332-3). \n \nFinally, arguments\
    \ over the relative priority of technical or institutional change are \ngenerally\
    \ unproductive. Technical and institutional change as DE JANVRY, et al. (1989)\
    \ \nargues, are highly interdependent and therefore must be analyzed within a\
    \ context of \ncontinuing interaction. \n \n \n                              \
    \                  \n71 A serious ‘misunderstanding’, as the authors refereed\
    \ to, can be observed in contemporary neo-Marxian \ncritiques of the ‘green revolution’.\
    \ These criticisms have focused attention almost entirely on the impact of \n\
    technical change on labor and land tenure relations. \n \n78 \nBoth the theory\
    \ and the experience of agricultural development in western and nonwestern \n\
    economies have shown that the rate and direction of technical change are responsive\
    \ to the \nrate of growth in demand and to relative resource endowments. In addition,\
    \ the transfer of \ntechnology among regions and countries is responsive to essentially\
    \ the same autonomous \nprocesses that induce the evolution of technical change\
    \ from new knowledge. In this \ncontext, RUTTAN (1978:327) points out: „The demonstration\
    \ that technical change can be \ntreated as endogenous to the development process\
    \ does not imply that the progress of either \nagricultural or industrial technology\
    \ can be left to an ‘invisible hand’ that directs \ntechnology along an ‘efficient’\
    \ path determined by ‘original’ resource endowments or by \nthe growth of demand.\
    \ The production of the new knowledge that leads to technical change \nis the\
    \ result of a process of institutional development. And technical change, in turn,\
    \ \nrepresents a powerful source of demand for institutional change“. \n \nThe\
    \ theory of induced technical change gaves rise, therefore, to the need for a\
    \ more careful \nconsideration of the sources of institutional innovation and\
    \ design. And this is what \nRUTTAN and HAYAMI (1984, 1985) have elaborated. In\
    \ the theory of induced \ninstitutional innovation, shifts in the demand for institutional\
    \ innovation are induced by \nchanges in relative resource endowments and by technical\
    \ change. In addition, advances in \nsocial science knowledge and culture endowment\
    \ are considered as factors influences the \nsupply of institutional change. \n\
    \ \nIn the demand side, in addition to the similarity with the Marxian view, concerning\
    \ the \nrole of technical change, the authors share also with DAVIS and NORTH\
    \ (1971) the view \nthat basic institutions such as property rights and markets\
    \ are more typically altered through \nthe cumulation of ‘secondary’ or incremental\
    \ institutional changes such as modifications in \ncontractual relations or shifts\
    \ in the boundaries between market and non-market activities \n(RUTTAN/HAYAMI\
    \ 1984:205)72. This view is reinforced through experiences from the \nagricultural\
    \ history of a number of countries that have showed that changes in factor \n\
    endowments, technical change, and growth in product demand have induced change\
    \ in \nproperty rights and contractual arrangements in order to promote more efficient\
    \ resource \nallocation through the market. Institutional change in this context\
    \ was directed toward the \nestablishment of a new equilibrium in factor markets.\
    \  \n \nInstitutional changes of this type are profitable for society only if\
    \ the costs involved in the \nassignment and protection of rights are smaller\
    \ than the gains from better resource \nallocation. If those costs are very high\
    \ (the use of communal land), it may be necessary to \ndesign non-market institutions,\
    \ in order to achieve more efficient resource allocation. In \naddition, RUTTAN\
    \ and HAYAMI (1984:211) argued that group action to supply public \ngoods may\
    \ work effectively if the size of group involved is small. In the other case,\
    \ where a \nlarge number of people are involved in the use of a public good, it\
    \ is more difficult to \nregulate their resource use. In this case, action by\
    \ a higher authority with coercive power, \nsuch as a government, may be required.\
    \ As example for such public goods the authors \ndiscussed the ‘socialization’\
    \ of agricultural research. New information or knowledge \nresulting from research\
    \ is typically endowed with the attributes of a public good \ncharacterized by\
    \ non-rivalness or jointness in supply and utilization, and non-excludability\
    \ \nor external economies. The public-good attributes of the agricultural research\
    \ product  \n                                                \n72 NORTH in his\
    \ neoclassical property rights theory of history seem to have integrated a significant\
    \ part of \nMarxist ideas (BARDHAN 1989). A major limitation of the Marxian model\
    \ according to NORTH (1981) is \nthe emphatic rejection of a causal link between\
    \ demographic change and technical and institutional change \n(RUTTAN/HAYAMI 1984:220).\
    \ \n \n79 \n \ntogether with the stochastic nature of the research production\
    \ function make public support \nof agricultural research socially desirable.\
    \ A socially optimal level of supply of such a good \ncannot be expected if its\
    \ supply is left to private firms. In such a case, the result would be \nserious\
    \ bias in the allocation of research resources73. \n \nTo note here is the role\
    \ of the new income streams released by technical change. It \nrepresents a powerful\
    \ motivation for private-sector research and development and for \npublic-sector\
    \ investment in the exploration of natural resources and the development of \n\
    science and technology. In addition, the portioning of the new income streams\
    \ that result \nfrom the efficiency gains associated with technical change or\
    \ improvements in institutional \nperformance represents a major incentive for\
    \ further institutional change. Moreover, \nadvances in technology can be expected\
    \ to set in motion attempts by individuals to \nreallocate their personal resources\
    \ and to organize and initiate collective action for the \npurpose of redefining\
    \ property rights so as to achieve greater equity in the portioning of the \n\
    new income streams (RUTTAN 1978:337).74 Likewise, advances in institutional efficiency\
    \ \nthat are associated with the rise of the corporate form of organization give\
    \ rise to growth \ndividends that induce a demand for the corporate organization\
    \ of labor, in the form of \nunions, and of farmers, in the form of cooperatives,\
    \ so that each group may participate \nmore effectively in the partitioning of\
    \ the new income streams75. \n \nChange in factor prices plays a role in the NORTH-THOMAS\
    \ and SCHULTZ models of \ninduced institutional change that is quite similar to\
    \ the role it plays in the model of induced \ntechnical change. However RUTTAN\
    \ (1978:338) argued that neither NORTH and \nTHOMAS nor SCHULTZ attempt to provide\
    \ a theory of the supply of institutional \nchange. Furthermore, he pointed out:\
    \ „we find little help in either the older institutional \nliterature or the newer,\
    \ neo-institutional literature“. It looks like as if the analysis of the \ndemand\
    \ factors for these schools was the determinant and enough to explain the \ninstitutional\
    \ change and/or as if the supply factors will - as a matter of course - follow\
    \ the \ndemand in the same direction. Anyway, there is an analogy between the\
    \ supply of \ninstitutional change and the supply of technical change. The supply\
    \ curve shifts to the right \nas a result of advances in knowledge in the social\
    \ science and related professions such as \nbusiness, planning, law, and social\
    \ services. Moreover, such advances reduce the cost of \ninstitutional change\
    \ just as advances in knowledge in the natural sciences and engineering \nreduce\
    \ the cost of technical change. Institutional change also do not wait for research\
    \ but \nmay occur as a result of exercise of innovative effort by politicians,\
    \ bureaucrats, \nentrepreneurs, and others as they conduct their daily activities.\
    \ The timing or pace of \ninstitutional innovation may be influenced by external\
    \ contact or internal stress. \n \n                                          \
    \      \n73 Resources would flow primarily to those areas of mechanical technology\
    \ that are adequately protected by \npatents and to those areas of biological\
    \ technology where the results can be protected by trade secrets. Other \nareas,\
    \ such as research on open pollinated seed varieties, biological control of insects\
    \ and pathogens, and \nimprovements in farming practices and management, would\
    \ be neglected.   \n74 The author refers to SCHULTZ’ discussion (1975) about the\
    \ individual responses to disequilibrea and used \nthe following quotation: „the\
    \ ability to deal with economic disequilibria is enhanced by education, and this\
    \ \nability is one of the major benefits to people privately in a modernizing\
    \ economy“.  \n75 An early and vivid examination of the role of institutions,\
    \ or of collective action, in the reallocation of the \nownership of material\
    \ and human resources and on the associated changes in the distribution of income\
    \ in \nthe process of economic growth, which dominate the COMMONS’ work, is K.\
    \ H. PARSONS: „John R. \nCommons’ Point of View,“ Journal of Land and Public Utility\
    \ Economics 17 (August 1942).   \n \n80 \nThe model of RUTTAN/HAYAMI (1984:213-4)\
    \ envisage political entrepreneurs as \nprotectors of institutions, as well as\
    \ instigators of institutional change. They hypothesize \nthat institutional innovation\
    \ will be supplied if the expected return from the innovation that \naccrues to\
    \ the political entrepreneurs exceeds the marginal cost of mobilizing the resources\
    \ \nnecessary to introduce the innovation. Thus the supply of institutional innovation\
    \ depends \ncritically on the power structure or balance among vested interest\
    \ groups in a society. That \nmeans, if the institutional innovation is expected\
    \ to result in a less to a dominant political \nbloc, the innovation may be forthcoming\
    \ even if it is expected to produce a large net gain to \nsociety as a whole.\
    \ And socially undesirable institutional innovation may occur if the \nreturns\
    \ to the entrepreneur or the interest group exceed the gains to society. \n \n\
    The other crucial issue to address is the Cultural endowments, including religion\
    \ and \nideology, which exert a vital influence on the supply of institutional\
    \ innovation. They make \nsome forms of institutional change less costly to establish\
    \ and impose severe costs on \nothers. The traditional patterns of cooperation\
    \ in the Japanese village community, for \nexample, have represented an important\
    \ cultural resource on which to erect modern forms \nof cooperative marketing\
    \ and joint farming activities. In other cultural resources, as in \nSouth Asian\
    \ villages, the caste structure inhibits cooperation and encourages specialization.\
    \ \nLikewise, religion as it has been understood and practiced by the elite, and\
    \ therefore by the \nmass, in rural Sudan, inhibits institutional innovation in\
    \ form of real participation and \ndemocracy76. \n \nNORTH (1981) has argued that\
    \ modifications of social values - that is, changing ideologies \n- are a major\
    \ factor in institutional change, and the so called New Institutional Economics\
    \ \n(NIE) is incomplete without a theory of ideology (EGGERTSSON 1990:75)77. The\
    \ \naspiration of new ideology may reduce the cost to political entrepreneurs\
    \ of mobilizing \ncollective action for institutional change. Egypt during the\
    \ ‘Nasserist’ era (specially during \n1954-70) can be added to the examples from\
    \ U.S.A, Japan, and China mentioned by \nRUTTAN and HAYAMI where ideology was\
    \ an important factor affecting the supply of \ninstitutional change78. \n \n\
    RUTTAN and HAYAMI (1984:215) stressed again that institutional change was, \n\
    throughout the history, generated through the process of trial and error much\
    \ in the same \nmanner that technical change was generated prior to the invention\
    \ of the research. And \nfrom this fact they maintain that with the institutionalization\
    \ of research in the social \nsciences and related professions the process of\
    \ institutional innovation has begun to \nproceed much more efficiency; it is\
    \ becoming increasingly possible to substitute social \nscience knowledge and\
    \ analytical skill for the more expensive process of learning by trail \nand error.\
    \ \n \n \n                                                \n76 For example, the\
    \ case of New Halfa’s Farmers Union (see Chapter 6.5.2.4). \n77 The successful\
    \ theory of institutional change require then, as NORTH argues, not only a theory\
    \ of the state \nand a theory of demographic change but also a theory of ideological\
    \ behavior and a theory of technical \nchange. \n78 Arabic Nationalism in Naser’s\
    \ Egypt, reflected in slogans such as ‘Freedom, Socialism, and Unity’, \nprovided\
    \ ideological support for land ordinances culminating in the Agricultural Reclamation\
    \ Laws, \ncultivation of the desert. This era has also witnessed the mobilization\
    \ of communal resources to improve the \nindustrial base through many projects\
    \ including the vocational and technical education. This ideology was \nmodel\
    \ for many countries in the Arabic Region and the Sudan (1970-84). \n \n81 \n\
    Research which make us more able to understand the behavior of people in the developing\
    \ \ncountries is an important example of the contribution of advances in social\
    \ science \nknowledge to the design of more efficient institutions. Similarly,\
    \ the diffusion of education \ndesigned to raise the intellectual level of the\
    \ general public and to facilitate better \nunderstanding of the private and social\
    \ costs of institutional change may reduce the cost to \npolitical entrepreneurs\
    \ of introducing socially desirable institutions and raise the cost of \nbiasing\
    \ institutional change in a manner that is costly to society. \n \nFrom the above,\
    \ RUTTAN/HAYAMI (1984) build a model of four elements that maps the \ngeneral\
    \ equilibrium relationships among resource endowments, cultural endowments, \n\
    technologies and institutions. The model goes beyond the conventional general\
    \ equilibrium \nmodel in which resource endowments, technologies, institutions,\
    \ and culture are given. One \nadvantage of this model is that it helps to identify\
    \ areas of ignorance e.g., the capacity to \nmodel and test the relationship between\
    \ cultural endowments and either technical or \ninstitutional change is relatively\
    \ weak. A second advantage of the model is that it is useful \nin identifying\
    \ the model components that enter into other attempts to account for secular \n\
    economic and social change. The unidimensional perspective of the relationships\
    \ bearing \non technical and institutional change is then, according to this analysis,\
    \ the result of failure \nto analyze historical change in a general equilibrium\
    \ context.  \n \n3.1.3  Transaction Cost Theory \n \nThe theory of induced innovations\
    \ postulates, in its pure neoclassical form, the existence of \nperfect markets\
    \ for all products and factors as well as for risk. Prices thus convey all the\
    \ \nrelevant information to decision-makers and all agents face equal prices.\
    \ Resources in this \ncase are efficiently allocated irrespective of the personal\
    \ distribution of assets. It is \nenvisaged, according to HAYAMI and RUTTAN’s\
    \ elaboration of the public role in the \nresource allocation of the agriculture\
    \ research, that the technology induced in such \ninstitutions for one particular\
    \ product will be uniquely determined by relative factor prices, \nthe size of\
    \ the research budget, and the state of scientific knowledge. That means, \nconsequently,\
    \ no room for collective action to influence the allocation of a research budget\
    \ \ntowards alternative technological innovations. This view refers to an idealized\
    \ vision of the \nworld, which abstracts from the pervasiveness of transaction\
    \ costs (DE JANVRY et al. \n1989:361). Taking transaction costs into account,\
    \ optimum technology becomes \nconditional on the distribution of assets and this\
    \ means the possibility of more than one \noptimum alternative. \n \nResearch\
    \ in this strand suggests that the cost of contracting and other transaction costs\
    \ have \nprofound implications for the allocation of resources and the structure\
    \ of economic \norganization. It is primarily the addition to the neoclassical\
    \ framework of positive costs of \ntransacting that distinguishes Neo-institutional\
    \ Economics (NIE) from traditional \nmicroeconomics and changes the agenda for\
    \ research: The cost of transacting makes the \nassignment of ownership rights\
    \ paramount, introduces the question of economic \norganization, and makes the\
    \ structure of political institutions a key to the understanding of \neconomic\
    \ growth (EGGERTSSON 1990:14,)79. Three areas are mentioned where the NIE \nattempts\
    \ to generalize and apply the economic approach (EGGERTSSON 1990:29-30): \n  \
    \                                              \n79 In many respects, the neo-classical\
    \ and transaction cost approaches are complements rather than substitutes, \n\
    addressing somewhat different issues and offering somewhat different ranges of\
    \ admissible explanations \n(POLLAK 1985:583). \n \n82 \n \nFirst, new constraints\
    \ have been explicitly added, the most important being the structure of \nproperty\
    \ rights and transaction costs. The economic approach has been used to analyze\
    \ \ntraditional market exchange; exchange within organizations; and exchange in\
    \ alternative \neconomic systems. In terms of formal theories, the focus is here\
    \ on the effects of change in \nconstraints on equilibrium outcomes. \nSecond,\
    \ attempts have also been made to explain or endogenize the organization of markets\
    \ \nand the structure of contracts. Economic organizations, such as the firm,\
    \ are modeled as a \nnetwork of contracts. Competition among organizational forms\
    \ leads to equilibrium \ncontracts. \nFinally, social and political institutions\
    \ are also seen as outcome of exchange between \nindividual agents. Competition\
    \ for survival among institutions leads to equilibrium \ninstitutions. Neo-institutional\
    \ economists have just begun to model social and political \ninstitutions and\
    \ attempt to derive testable propositions. \n \nIn the historical growth process,\
    \ there is, as BARDHAN alluded, a trade-off between \neconomies of scale and specialization\
    \ on the one hand and transaction costs on the other. In \na small, closed, face-to-face\
    \ peasant community, for example, transaction costs are low, \nbut the production\
    \ costs are high, because specialization and division of labor are severely \n\
    limited by the extent of market defined by the personalized exchange process of\
    \ small \ncommunity. In a large-scale economy, as the network of interdependence\
    \ widens, the \nimpersonal exchange gives considerable scope for all kinds of\
    \ opportunistic behavior \n(cheating, shirking, moral hazard), and the costs of\
    \ transacting can be high. In western \nsocieties over time complex institutional\
    \ structures have been devised (elaborately defined \nand effectively enforced\
    \ property rights, formal contracts and guarantees, cooperate \nhierarchy, vertical\
    \ integration, limited liability, bankruptcy laws, and so on) to constrain the\
    \ \nparticipants, to reduce the uncertainty of social interaction - in general,\
    \ to prevent the \ntransactions from being too costly and thus to allow the productivity\
    \ gains of larger-scale \nand improved technology to be realized80. \n \nAnother\
    \ issue to address is the impact of technical change on transaction costs. This\
    \ \nimpact, as EGGERTSSON discuss, is ambiguous. On the one hand, technical change\
    \ can \nhelp to lower transaction costs by introducing, for example, new and effective\
    \ methods of \n                                                \n80 In point of\
    \ fact, the variety in definitions of transaction costs as we will see, and the\
    \ variety of the \ntheoretical contexts through which these definitions apply,\
    \ have influence on such conclusions. NIEHANS \n(1987), for example, who understand\
    \ the transaction costs as the exchange costs of property rights on goods \nand\
    \ production factors speaks about the absence of transaction costs in a planned\
    \ economy and points out: \n“transaction costs arise from the transfer of ownership\
    \ or, more generally, of property rights. They are a \nconcomitant of decentralized\
    \ ownership rights, private property and exchange. In a collectivist economy \n\
    with completely centralized decision-making they would be absent; administrative\
    \ costs would take their \nplace“. On the other hand, CHEUNG (1987), who added\
    \ to the transaction costs those of the internal \ncoordination within organizations,\
    \ argues that transaction costs in such economies are prohibitive high: „we \n\
    therefore conclude that the poor economic performance of a communist state is\
    \ attribute to the high \ntransaction costs of operating that organization“ (citations\
    \ from LÖCHEL 1995:24).  \n \n83 \nmeasurement, but, on the other hand, technical\
    \ change is associated with more complex \ncommodities, and hence higher transaction\
    \ costs. Technical change provides an opportunity \nto design new structures of\
    \ economic organization that lower the costs of contracting, but \nthe little\
    \ systematic empirical evidence that exists suggests that the net effect of technical\
    \ \nchange has been to increase the cost of transacting in advanced industrial\
    \ economies. \n \nThe dominance of the economic theory in the so called organizational\
    \ economics (agency \ntheory and transaction costs theory) is a subject of critique\
    \ from some of the management \nand organization scholars who do not belong to\
    \ economics discipline. Their concern is \ndefending the boundaries of an autonomous\
    \ theory of management and organization \nwhich is not subservient to any, more\
    \ traditional discipline (here economics) and which is \nprepared to acknowledge\
    \ positive rather than just negative functions for managers. \nFurthermore, it\
    \ has been argued that the growing influence of agency and  transaction cost \n\
    theory presents a number of problems for organization studies:  \n \n• There is\
    \ a problem in the lack of relationship of organizational economics to pre-\n\
    existing traditions of inquiry in management theory.  \n• There is a problem that\
    \ organizational economics is a regressive simplification.  \n• Lastly, there\
    \ is a problem of the evaluation and ideological coloration of \norganizational\
    \ economics.  \n \nProponents of organizational economics, on the other hand,\
    \ argue that organizational \neconomics has already made an important contribution\
    \ to our understanding of the nature \nand purpose of organizations. They go on\
    \ to forecast that, as a result of organizational \neconomics, the prediction\
    \ of HIRSHLEIFER (1986) will be realized in the field of \norganizations, namely\
    \ that organization theory will become economics, as part of the \ndevelopment\
    \ that BARNEY (1990) terms ‘economic imperialism’81.  \n  \n3.1.3.1 Initiation\
    \ and Definition \n \nThe transaction costs theory derives from COASEs articles\
    \ (1937, 1960) on the firm and on \nthe social cost. COASE has summarized his\
    \ contribution in these words: „transaction costs \nwere used in the one case\
    \ to show that if they are not included in the analysis, the firm has \nno purpose,\
    \ while in the other I showed, as I though, that if transaction costs were not\
    \ \nintroduced into the analysis, for the range of problems considered, the law\
    \ had no purpose“ \n(EGGERTSSON 1990:xiii). \n \nAs many assert, including Coase\
    \ itself, WILLIAMSON (1975, 1979, 1981), building on the \nolder institutionalist\
    \ tradition; on the work of COASE and on the „CARNEGIE tradition“ \n         \
    \                                       \n81 BARNEY and OUCHI (1986) use the term\
    \ organizational economics to describe theoretical contributions to \norganization\
    \ theory from economics. Organizational economics (OE) presents itself as being\
    \ based upon a \npowerful, contiguous, established discipline, namely economics.\
    \ Because of the superiority of the \neconomics approach, the economist HIRSHLEIFER\
    \ (1986) has predicted the takeover of the whole of social \nscience: „As economics\
    \ ‘imperialistically’ employs its tools of analysis over a wider range of social\
    \ issues. \nit will become sociology and anthropology and political science. But\
    \ correspondingly, as these other \ndisciplines grow increasingly rigorous, they\
    \ will not merely resemble, but will be economics. It is in this \nsense that\
    \ ‘economics’ is taken here as broadly synonymous with ‘social science’“ (DONALDSON\
    \ \n1995:164-5). \n \n84 \n(e.g., SIMON 1957), has been primarily responsible\
    \ for developing of the transaction cost \napproach82. Other important contributions\
    \ are those of BARNEY, OUCHI, GOLDBERG, \nKLEIN, ALCHIAN, and DEMSETZ. In addition,\
    \ transaction cost, as Williamson hold, \ncombines the insights and arguments\
    \ of both HAYEK (1945) and BARNARD (1938) that \nadaptation is the central problem\
    \ of economic organization. Whereas HAYEK emphasized \nspontaneous coordination,\
    \ effected through the price mechanism, BARNARD confined \nhis attention to intentional\
    \ coordination, effected through hierarchy. The apparent \nopposition of these\
    \ two arguments notwithstanding, transaction cost economics avers that \nadaptations\
    \ of both kinds are needed in a high performance economy and joins both in a \n\
    common framework (WILLIAMSON 1993:102). The transaction costs approach was also\
    \ \ninspired by the contributions of STIGLER and others to the economics of information83.\
    \  \n \nThe transaction costs approach focus on the role of institutions in structuring\
    \ complex, \nlong-term relationships. It has been primarily concerned with firm\
    \ and the organization of \nproduction. It is as ARROW defined a microanalytic\
    \ enterprise. It requires that the details \nof governance structures and transactions\
    \ be examined at a higher level of resolution than \neconomists had hitherto though\
    \ to be necessary. The difference between the firm-as-\nproduction function and\
    \ the firm-as-governance structure, is one illustration. Although the \nformer\
    \ is the familiar and for many purpose the appropriate construction, there are\
    \ other \npurposes for which the firm-as-governance structure is more instructive.\
    \ Transaction cost \neconomics has been instrumental in bringing about this shift\
    \ in emphasis (WILLIAMSON \n1993:101-2)84. Applied to the family, the transaction\
    \ cost approach treats the family as a \ngovernance structure rather than a preference\
    \ ordering or a preference ordering \naugmented by a production technology (POLLAK\
    \ 1985:584). \n \nA clear-cut definition of transaction costs does not exist.\
    \ Yet, there are many definitions. \nNORTH, for example use two of them. On the\
    \ one hand, transaction costs are the \ninformation costs of the exchange of ownership\
    \ rights to goods and production factors. On \nthe other hand, transaction costs\
    \ are the costs that are necessary to have the ‘gains from \ntrade’. Furthermore,\
    \ he illustrate the relationships between transaction costs and the \ndivision\
    \ of labor as follows (LÖCHEL 1995:23): „Transaction costs are the costs of \n\
    specifying and enforcing the contracts that underlie exchange and therefore comprise\
    \ all \nthe costs of political and economic organization that permit economies\
    \ to capture the gains \nfrom trade“. In other definition, applied by WILLIAMSON,\
    \ transaction costs are \n                                                \n82\
    \ Commenting on the role of Williamson, who acknowledges Coase as the originator\
    \ of transaction cost \ntheory, the latter argued: „My discussion with researches\
    \ in this field has made it clear to me the \nWilliamson’s influence has been\
    \ immense. In a real sense, transaction cost economics, through his writing \n\
    and teaching, is his creation„ (COASE 1993:98). \n83 WILLIAMSON acknowledges also\
    \ the contribution of STIGLER and pointed out: (1) SIMON (1957) had \nalready\
    \ covered many of the pertinent issues and, prior to STIGLER (1968), stressed\
    \ the importance of \ninformation for the economic man. (2) the search for information\
    \ is crucial to the theories of rational choice \ndeveloped by both Stigler and\
    \ Simon. (3) transaction cost economics is especially indebted to a strand of\
    \ \ninformation economics, namely that originated by ARROW. (4) Arrow’s microanalytic\
    \ concerns with \ninformation (the ‘fundamental paradox’ of information; information\
    \ asymmetry; appropriability; and the \ndistinction between hidden action and\
    \ hidden information), as well as related concerns about tacit \ninformation examined\
    \ by POLANI (1962), are more central to transaction cost economics than are search\
    \ \ncosts (WILIAMSON 1993:110-112).    \n84 KREPS (1990) succinctly distinguishes\
    \ between the neoclassical and transaction cost economics conception \nof the\
    \ firm as follows: „The firm is like individual agents in textbook economics.\
    \ Agents have utility \nfunctions, firms have a profit motive; agents have consumption\
    \ sets, firms have production possibility sets. \nBut in transaction cost economics,\
    \ firms are more like markets - both (firm and market) are (governance \nstructures)\
    \ within which individuals can transact“ (WILLIAMSON 1993:102). \n \n85 \ncharacterized\
    \ as the costs of economic contracts. Unlike North and Williamson, ARROW \nchoose\
    \ more fundamental and very broad working definition. He sees transaction costs\
    \ as \nthe costs of running the economic system. Other very common definitions\
    \ are those of \nCOASE and DEMETZ. Coase speaks about the costs of price mechanism\
    \ while Demsetz \nunderstand the transaction costs as the internalization costs\
    \ of external effects (LÖCHEL \n1995:23-4). \n \nIn general terms, transaction\
    \ costs are the costs that arise when individuals exchange \nownership rights\
    \ to economic assets and enforce their exclusive rights. They are not the \n‘exchange\
    \ of commodities’ but, as defined by COMMONS, the alienation and the \nacquisition,\
    \ between individuals, of the rights of property (LÖCHEL 1995:25). These \ncosts\
    \ are seen, in addition, in terms of both resources and time, of market and nonmarket\
    \ \ntransactions (RUTTAN 1978:344). The fundamental idea of transaction costs,\
    \ according to \nthe definition offered by MATTHEWS (1986), is that they consist\
    \ of the costs of arranging \na contract ex ante and monitoring and enforcing\
    \ it ex post, as opposed to production costs, \nwhich are the costs of executing\
    \ a contract. The distinction between transaction costs \nand production costs,\
    \ according to ARROW, is that the former can be varied by a change \nin the mode\
    \ of resource allocation, while the latter depends only on the technology and\
    \ \ntastes, and would be the same in all economic systems. In another definition\
    \ (DAHLMAN \n1979), transaction costs are opportunity costs, just like other costs\
    \ in economic theory, and \nthere are both fixed and variable transaction costs\
    \ (EGGERTSSON 1990:14)85. On the \nother hand, some (PAPANDREOU 1994:254) use\
    \ the term organizational costs \ninterchangeably with transaction costs. \n \n\
    Transaction costs refer to a number of costs not typically considered in the neoclassical\
    \ \nconcept of production costs with atomistic agents, markets prices, and zero\
    \ cost of market-\nclearing. They include those costs of information, negotiation,\
    \ monitoring, supervising, \ncoordination, and enforcement of contracts (DE JANVRY\
    \ et al. 1989:362; BARDHAN \n1989:5). Transaction costs economics asserts that\
    \ they are significant determinates of the \norganization of production. And according\
    \ to this School, transaction costs, and institutions \nthat evolve to minimize\
    \ these costs, are the key to the performance of economies. \n \nThe tardy introduction\
    \ of transaction costs into economic theory is related to the fact that, \nuntil\
    \ recently, most economic theories and models assumed full information, and \n\
    transaction costs are in one way or another associated with the cost of acquiring\
    \ \ninformation about exchange. Information costs constitute an important part\
    \ of transaction \ncosts but the two concepts are not identical. When information\
    \ is costly, various activities \nrelated to the exchange of property rights between\
    \ individuals give rise to transaction costs. \nSuch activities, which are listed\
    \ above, illustrated by (EGGERTSSON 1990:15) as follows: \n \n1. The search for\
    \ information about the distribution of price and quality of commodities \nand\
    \ labor inputs, and the search for potential buyers and sellers and for relevant\
    \ \ninformation about their behavior and circumstances. \n                   \
    \                             \n85 For various definitions of transaction costs,\
    \ see DAHLMAN (1979) and LÖCHEL (1995). \n \n86 \n2. The bargaining that is needed\
    \ to find the true position of buyers and sellers when prices \nare endogenous.\
    \ \n3. The making of contracts. \n4. The monitoring of contractual partners to\
    \ see whether they abide by the terms of the \ncontract. \n5. The enforcement\
    \ of a contract and the collection of damages when partners fail to \nobserve\
    \ their contractual obligations. \n6. The protection of property rights against\
    \ third-party encroachment - for example, \nprotection against pirates or even\
    \ against the government in the case of illegitimate \ntrade. \n \nM-form corporation\
    \ and vertical integration are two concepts through which transaction \ncosts\
    \ approach solve the problems of market failure. Transaction cost theory holds\
    \ that \nmarket failure occurs such that the normal economic pressure on economic\
    \ actors to \nperform effectively breaks down and has to be replaced by hierarchical\
    \ controls. In the \nlarge corporation with a multi-level hierarchy, middle managers\
    \ enjoy a degree of \nindependence from top management and begin to subordinate\
    \ the corporate goals of the \nmaximization of profit and shareholder wealth in\
    \ favor of their personal self-\naggrandizement. The solution is to increase control\
    \ on middle managers by holding them \ndirectly accountable for the profitability\
    \ of their division as assessed by an investigator \ncontrol staff of head-office\
    \ accountants and the like, that is, the M-form corporation. \n \nMarket failure\
    \ can, again, occur in transactions where a supplier to a firm makes asset \n\
    investments specific to that transaction, therefore transforming the exchange\
    \ into bilateral \nmonopoly away from market-determined prices. Haggling over\
    \ price is liable to ensure and \nthe avoidance of such transaction costs is attained\
    \ by resource to administration of both \ntransacting parties through a common\
    \ hierarchy. This is achieved by the merger of the two \nfirms through vertical\
    \ integration; thus the duplicity and untrustworthiness of the \nmanagers in the\
    \ two firms is resolved by placing a common boss over them \n(DONALDSON 1995:165-6).\
    \ Note, in addition, that resource dependence theory sees \nvertical integration\
    \ as a means to increase control over resources whereas transaction \ncosts theory\
    \ sees it as a way to minimize transaction costs. \n \nA critiques of transaction\
    \ cost theory was provided by PERROW (1986) and ROBINS \n(1987) (DONALDSON 1995:167-9).\
    \ PERROW’s critique includes challenging the idea \nthat vertical integration\
    \ cuts costs. He pointed out several costs that may rise as a result of \ntwo\
    \ firms merging. Robins critiques, in this context, is a rather heterogeneous\
    \ and complex \nset of remarks. He states that economic theory cannot be used\
    \ to generate deductions about \nindividual firm behavior in the manner of transaction\
    \ cost theory. Robins argues against the \nuse of transaction cost theory to construct\
    \ causal, general propositions. He writes that this \ndetracts from the primary\
    \ thrust of institutionalism to offer an appreciation of the way in \nwhich specific\
    \ historical structures shape economic behavior. Again, he challenges the \npresumption\
    \ of transaction cost theory that the market is the natural medium of transaction\
    \ \nthat pre-dates efforts to organize transactions within hierarchy. \n \nROBINS\
    \ nevertheless, sees a useful role for transaction cost theory as part of a more\
    \ \ncautious approach of analyzing the specific forms of organization that arise\
    \ in each \nenvironmental setting: \n \n87 \n− transaction cost theory provides\
    \ the key mediation between the organization and its \nenvironment; \n− transaction\
    \ cost theory can be seen as the vehicle to integrate structural contingency \n\
    theory with his larger explanatory effort; and \n− transaction cost theory is\
    \ central for the reintegration of organization theory and \nfuture research.\
    \ \n \n3.1.3.2 Transaction costs and Efficiency \n \nAccording to welfare economics,\
    \ institutions can be called ‘efficient’ to the extent that \nthey are directly\
    \ associated with Pareto-optimal resource allocations (the basic \nneoclassical\
    \ model)86. Therefrom, outcomes that deviate from the outcomes of this model \n\
    will considered inefficient. The view of this model compare then between an ideal\
    \ norm \nand an existing ‘imperfect’ institutional arrangement. Such traditional\
    \ concept of optimality \nor efficiency found in welfare economics has come under\
    \ strong criticism from institutional \neconomists for using as its reference\
    \ point a world of fully defined exclusive rights and \nzero transaction costs87.\
    \ This criticism is closely associated with DEMSETZ who argues \n(1969) that the\
    \ nirvana approach of the welfare economics differs considerably from a \ncomparative\
    \ institution approach in which the relevant choice is between alternative real\
    \ \ninstitutional arrangements. Words like ‘non-optimal,’ ‘inefficient,’ and ‘over-’\
    \ or \n‘underutilization’ are, according to DEMSETZ, misleading and ambiguous\
    \ unless the \noutcome that they describe can be improved upon. He concludes that\
    \ „modern analysis has \nyet to describe inefficiency in a world where indivisibilities\
    \ are present and knowledge is \ncostly to produce“ (EGGERTSSON 1990:21-2). \n\
    \ \nDEMSETZ’s view of efficiency is based on individual rationality. Institutions\
    \ that evolve, \naccording to his analysis, will be efficient throughout maximizing\
    \ their net private \nbenefits. Inefficiency is seen, therefore, as the locomotive\
    \ of institutional change. Changes \nin knowledge, production functions, market\
    \ values, aspirations, and new techniques, lead to \na set of costs and benefits.\
    \ Property rights adjust to internalize potential gains. Stability \nwill be attained,\
    \ thereby, when institutions are efficient. Yet, inefficiency, to the extent it\
    \ \nexist, seems to be of a dynamic nature: a lag in adjustment to the new conditions.\
    \ The \nduration of this lag depends on how rational agents are, the slowness\
    \ of adjustment of \nsocial mores (PAPANDREOU 1994:201, 260-1)88. \n         \
    \                                       \n86 This model is derived from general\
    \ equilibrium models that show that an free market system tends to \ngravitate\
    \ toward an equilibrium where all opportunities for mutually advantageous exchanges\
    \ between \nindividuals have been used. In equilibrium, no exchange can take place\
    \ that makes someone better off \nwithout at the same time making at least one\
    \ individual worse off: Given the initial distribution of wealth, \nthe allocation\
    \ of resources is shown to be (Pareto) optimal (EGGERTSSON 1990:19).  \n87 WILLIAMSON\
    \ (1993) argued that COASE, in his 1960 article, was not the first who employed\
    \ the fiction \nof zero transaction costs. The idea that castles bargaining leads\
    \ to efficiency was employed von NEUMAN \nand MORGENSTERN (1944) and even earlier\
    \ by EDGEWORTH (1881). However, transaction cost, he \nadd, is a larger concept\
    \ than bargaining costs and, as presented by Coase, invites comparative institutional\
    \ \nanalysis (p. 101).  \n88 The ideas constitute DEMSETZ’s view of efficiency\
    \ was subject of fuller critique and vivid explanation \nfrom PAPANDREOU: The\
    \ fact that agents may form institutions by maximizing their net private benefits\
    \ \ntells us nothing about the efficiency of the resulting institutions, argued\
    \ Papandreou. In Demsetz’s model, it \nis not efficiency that leads to change,\
    \ but the maximization of net private benefits by individuals; these are \nnot\
    \ the same. It is not enough that individuals are wealth-maximizers to ensure\
    \ efficiency, they must be \nexchanging within a well-specified framework which\
    \ channels individuals self-seeking activity towards \ncollective ends. Individual\
    \ wealth-maximization is insufficient to explain optimal formation of institutions,\
    \ \njust as it is insufficient to bring about optimality in a market with too\
    \ few agents or too few markets. In \n \n88 \nEGGERTSSON (1990:102) add that the\
    \ logical rationale of contractual arrangements, \nthat failed in the neoclassical\
    \ model, becomes apparent when transaction costs are added to \nthe model. He\
    \ further argues that, ceteris paribus, various contractual arrangements are \n\
    designed to economize on transaction costs, and transaction costs reflect the\
    \ scarcity of \ninformation. Under the assumptions of NIE, it is not clear how\
    \ economic outcomes in a \nworld of full information can be used as a yardstick\
    \ of efficiency in real-world situation. \nThe question of efficiency as summarized\
    \ by EGGERTSSON is an unmeasurable \ncharacteristic of models. If we assume that\
    \ agents are rational maximizers, all models \nyield efficient outcomes - regardless\
    \ of whether transaction costs are zero or positive. \nEfficiency is a logical\
    \ consequence of the assumptions in models assuming maximizing \nbehavior. \n\
    \ \nInstitutions in neoclassical models provide the structure through which individual\
    \ action \nis channeled towards collective ends. Without a universal set of markets\
    \ and private-\nproperty rights, the Pareto-optimality of competitive private-ownership\
    \ economies would \nnot be, as the institutional economists view, possible. Importantly,\
    \ the achievements of \nprivate-ownership economies also require that there are\
    \ no costs of forming markets and \nprivate-ownership rights. Once this assumption\
    \ is dropped (as in a real world), then it \nbecomes important not just to consider\
    \ the efficiency of alternative resource allocations, but \nalso the efficiency\
    \ of the institutions themselves (PAPANDREOU 1994:221-2). They can \nno longer\
    \ be treated as exogenous elements in models of resource allocation. An optimal\
    \ set \nof institutions are needed, therefore, to have an optimal allocation of\
    \ resources. \n \nMany institutional economists advocate a notion of efficiency\
    \ that incorporates transaction \ncosts89. The focus of such a notion being whether\
    \ there exists some feasible reorganization \nof the economy that would afford\
    \ Pareto-gains when the institutional costs of \nreorganization are incorporated\
    \ in the evaluation of economic outcomes. The status of \nmonopolies is generally\
    \ not recognized in models that ignore transaction costs. A \nmonopoly would be\
    \ inefficient only if there existed some alternative institution that could \n\
    better exploit the untapped resources without at the same time imposing transaction\
    \ costs \nthat outweigh the ‘efficiency’ gains. Likewise a missing market, in\
    \ this case, would \nrepresent inefficiency only if the imposition of a market\
    \ were not too costly \n(PAPANDREOU 1994: 253). A particularly discouraging feature\
    \ of the models that \ncriticize the traditional notion of efficiency, argued\
    \ Papandreou, seems to be that they lead \nto the unpalatable conclusion that\
    \ any institution that exists must be optimal otherwise \nwealth-maximizing agents\
    \ would have exploited any ‘attainable’ improvements. \n \nA developed line of\
    \ argument, of the institutional economists, is represented by STATEN \nand  UMBECK.\
    \ If efficiency is defined as Pareto efficiency, they argue, then it is logically\
    \ \nimpossible to derive inefficient solutions from microeconomic models that\
    \ use the \nbehavioral postulate of constrained maximization. According to the\
    \ traditional definition of \nefficiency in neoclassical economies, a resource\
    \ is used efficiently when it has been \n                                    \
    \                                                                            \
    \                                 \naddition, once a departure from rational behavior\
    \ is allowed, there is no guarantee that ‘rational’ behavior is \nthe socially\
    \ optimal behavior. Optimality may no longer be a moot question, however, the\
    \ prescription that \nagents be ‘rational’ is not justified..... It is worth noting\
    \ that COASE shares POSNER his reservations about \nthe concept of ‘bound rationality’\
    \ espoused by WILLIAMSON and add: „as I do to any economic concept \nthat includes\
    \ the word ‘rational’“ (COASE 1993:98).  \n89 This notion is implicit throughout\
    \ the Law and economies literature and sometimes refereed to as \n‘transaction-cost-constrained\
    \ optimality. \n \n89 \nallocated to the user who has the highest value for it\
    \ as measured by the user’s willingness \nand ability to pay. Efficient outcomes\
    \ result from the view that individuals are seen as \nmaximizing utility functions\
    \ subject to constraints. Pareto efficiency is reached when all \ntransactions\
    \ that are mutually advantageous have been completed, and when, by definition,\
    \ \nagents complete all advantageous transactions, given the model’s constraints\
    \ \n(EGGERTSSON 1990:22-3). STATEN and  UMBECK argue, throughout an provocative\
    \ \nexample90, that in traditional neoclassical models, it is theoretically possible\
    \ to imagine \ndiscrepancy between the marginal social cost and the marginal cost\
    \ and this would be \ntreated as Pareto-inefficient. They stress, however, that\
    \ it is logically impossible to derive \nsuch a discrepancy from a microeconomic\
    \ model. An explanation for such unimaginable \nsituation must be that the model\
    \ is misspecified, that some constraint is missing, such as \nthe costs of collective\
    \ action91 or any other transaction cost preventing this discrepancy. \nThey conclude,\
    \ as long as the model is fully specified (all transaction costs are \nincorporated)\
    \ the equilibrium outcome must, by definition, be Pareto-efficient \n((PAPANDREOU\
    \ 1994:255). \n \nCHEUNG, prior to STATEN and UMBECK, makes the same point but\
    \ in passing and \nwithout developing it further: „in a world where each and every\
    \ individual is asserted to \nbehave consistently with the postulate of constrained\
    \ maximization, economic inefficiency \npresents a contradiction in terms. even\
    \ outright mistakes are traceable to constraints of \nsome type. the world is\
    \ efficient, if the model describing it sufficiently specifies the gains \nand\
    \ costs of making it so“ (PAPANDREOU 1994 256). PAPANDREOU, in turn, taking the\
    \ \nperspective of policy formation, push STATEN and UMBECK’s argument further\
    \ and \nargue: „one might not be daunted by their result“. \n \nWhile it might\
    \ be true that an equilibrium outcome of agents interacting within a fully \n\
    specified institutional environment (all transaction costs are incorporated in\
    \ the model) will \nbe Pareto-efficient by definition, policy makers, it would\
    \ seem, are able to alter institutions \n(the constraints faced by the agents)\
    \ and thus bring about new outcomes92. And \nacknowledging the constraints faced\
    \ by the policy-makers, there seem to be several \nalternative rules among which\
    \ an ‘optimal’ one can be chosen. The conclusion viewed by \nPAPANDREOU (1994:259)\
    \ says that any efficiency notion based on comparison of \nfeasible alternatives\
    \ become, for microeconomic models, meaningless, e.g. Pareto-\nefficiency, social-welfare\
    \ maximization: „Models with endogenous transaction costs could \nnot provide\
    \ insights for improving economic outcomes since, given the constraints of the\
    \ \nmodel, no other outcome is possible. Historical analysis of institutions would\
    \ take the form \nof uncovering the transaction costs faced by the agents that\
    \ generated the particular set of \ninstitutions. Discussion of the efficiency\
    \ or inefficiency of the institutions would be \nmeaningless“. \n            \
    \                                    \n90 If a factory were free to pollute, no\
    \ effort would be expended curtailing pollution and an excessive amount \nof pollutants\
    \ would be indicated by the discrepancy between the marginal social cost of pollution\
    \ and the \nmarginal cost of abatement.  \n91 According to BRETON, the new lines\
    \ of research on the problems of collective choice and action are \nencompassed\
    \ in four bodies of theory: the theories of public goods, democracy, decisions\
    \ rules, and \ntransaction costs (RUTTAN 1978:344). \n92 In the case of the factory\
    \ emitting deleterious substance, for example, policy makers could limit allowable\
    \ \nemissions by the factory, or apply a pigouvian tax. Alternatively, they could\
    \ set up a market for pollution \npermits with a limit on the number of permits.\
    \ The factory-owners, potential polluters, and those who suffer \nfrom the factory’s\
    \ emissions, could purchase permits (and/or bid up the price) for the right to\
    \ use the \natmosphere. given this new institutional framework air would be allocated\
    \ to those agents most willing and \nable to pay (PAPANDREOU 1994:256). \n \n\
    90 \n \nAnother deviation from the Welfare Theorems is needs to be made. In the\
    \ economic models \nthat endogenize transaction costs, the neat division between\
    \ distribution and efficiency \nmatters enshrined in the Welfare Theorems, is\
    \ lost. Any choice of institutions is not only \nlimited by initial distribution\
    \ of power, but also entail an implicit distributional choice. \nDAHLMAN sees\
    \ the function of property rights as (PAPANDREOU 1994:223): \n„determining income\
    \ or wealth distribution, on the one hand, and also serving as signals \nfor behavior,\
    \ thereby guiding incentives, on the other. If we accept the view that institutions\
    \ \nare really nothing but specific collections of attenuated property rights,\
    \ then it follows that \ninstitutions are also tied up with both income distribution\
    \ and incentive formation. the \nrelative efficiency of various institutions now\
    \ becomes dependent upon our ability to rank \nvarious income distributions“93.\
    \ \n \n3.1.3.3 Transaction Costs and the Agricultural Contracts \n  \nEGGERTSSON\
    \ (1990 :213-4) refers to three elements that are important for the coming \n\
    analysis and illustrate how the NIE approaches the study of economic organization.\
    \ First, it \nis assumed as a working rule that low-cost organizations tend to\
    \ supersede high-cost ones. \nSecond, when high-cost organizations appear to persist\
    \ and it seems that reorganization \nwould increase net output, the search will\
    \ be for hidden benefits at unexpected margins. \nSuch offsetting benefits may\
    \ involve a reduction in supervision costs or an increase in \noutput in a related\
    \ activity when a nexus of contracts ties several activities, or a host of \n\
    other factors. Costly behavior is also constrained by contractual stipulations.\
    \ Finally, if the \nsearch for hidden benefits or contractual constraints is in\
    \ vain, the search will be for \npolitical constraints that block the rearrangement\
    \ of property rights. It is recognized \nthat the polity may not adopt output-maximizing\
    \ property rights if the new structure might \ncause distributional losses for\
    \ those who control the state. And according to \nNeoinstitutional economics,\
    \ high (transaction) costs of collective action are the principal \nreason why\
    \ the members of a community cannot agree on new rules that would increase the\
    \ \ncommunity’s aggregate output. \n \n \n                                   \
    \             \n93 Transaction costs theory, based on the economic history, has\
    \ very interested contribution to the topic \nSlavery, as production form in the\
    \ agricultural societies. DOMAR argues that this form is possible only \nwhen\
    \ the cultivable free land and available labor force’ ratio is very high. In this\
    \ case the non-working \nlandowners will try to tie up the labor force (LÖCHEL\
    \ 1995:76). Taking the market in the background, this \ncriterion, rising labor/land\
    \ ratio, has been linked by BOSERUP and others to the emergence of individual\
    \ \nproperty rights in land. It is therefore no accident that the British legally\
    \ codified individual property rights \nfor India, but not for their sparsely\
    \ African colonies (BINSWANGER and ROSENZWEIG 1986:535). In \nthis respect, NORTH\
    \ has argued that that changing structure of transaction costs made slavery an\
    \ \ninefficient institution. Efficiency gains could be made by owners if they\
    \ changed from slave labor to wage \nlabor. By shifting to wage labor the farm-owners\
    \ could drastically reduce enforcement costs. The point as \nviewed by PAPANDREOU\
    \ is that institutional change does not require efficiency gains to be initiated,\
    \ it \nrequires gains to the initiators of change, which may or may not coincide\
    \ with an overall increase wealth, \nand would surely leave many potential efficiency\
    \ gains untapped. Furthermore, whatever efficiency gains \nare made they are intimately\
    \ tied to a distribution of wealth. An institution can be said to be efficient\
    \ if it \nbest attains some welfare goal. For a more detailed discussion of institution\
    \ of slavery, income \ndistribution, and efficiency see EGGERTSSON 1990:203-13;\
    \ PAPANDREOU 1994:223-6; and LÖCHEL \n1995:75-81.  \n \n91 \nSharecropping or\
    \ share tenancy is an contractual arrangement involving rights to the use \nof\
    \ land and is a traditional form of organization in agriculture. It was traditionally\
    \ \nconsidered that this form, in addition to the open-field system, is inefficient\
    \ and therefore \ninferior to other available forms of organization like wage\
    \ contracts and fixed rental \ncontracts. It is inefficient in achieving optimal\
    \ resource allocation because it reduces \ntenants’ incentives to apply their\
    \ own labor and other inputs (Marshallian inefficiency). \nThe sharecropper will\
    \ have less incentive to increase production as long as he receives only \na fraction\
    \ of the increase in output. Thus he would tend to under supply various inputs\
    \ and \nwould equate only a fraction of the marginal value product of a variable\
    \ input to its \nopportunity cost (see the case of cotton production in New Halfa\
    \ Scheme, Chapters 5.4.2 \nand 6.3.3). That is why some economists link economic\
    \ stagnation in third world countries \nto the prevalence of share tenancy in\
    \ their agriculture(EGGERTSSON 1990:223). \n \nThe paradoxical status of sharecropping\
    \ in conventional analysis has bee undermined \nrecently by the new land-tenure\
    \ economics started by CHEUNG and elaborated by \nSTIGLITZ, NEWBERY and others.\
    \ In his 1968 article, CHEUNG argues that equilibrium \ncontracts usually have\
    \ several dimensions, and the puzzle that share tenancy poses for \nneoclassical\
    \ economics can be solved by endogenizing the structure of contracts. His \nmodel,\
    \ which derived with the assumption of zero transaction costs, suggests that share\
    \ \ncontracts need be neither irrational nor inefficient, but the demonstration\
    \ that various types \nof contracts can give equivalent outcomes does not explain\
    \ why one type is preferred to \nanother or provide a theory of contracts. A theory\
    \ of contracts must take account of \ntransaction costs. Latter (1969) CHEUNG\
    \ develop his point further and argues: „The \nchoice of contractual arrangement\
    \ is made so as to maximize the gain from risk dispersion \nsubject to the constraint\
    \ of transaction costs (EGGERTSSON 1990:226). \n \nAccording to the new land-tenure\
    \ economics, if contractual terms can be enforced \ncostlessly, equal efficiency\
    \ will be established between share tenancy and other forms of \nland tenure such\
    \ as fixed-rent tenancy and owner farming. Marshallian inefficiency \ndepends\
    \ on whether there is a low-cost mechanism in rural communities to enforce the\
    \ \ncontractual terms of share tenancy. Taking the optimizing behavior of landlords\
    \ in \nconsideration, land rent under share tenancy is expected to be higher than\
    \ that of fixed-rent \ntenancy by a premium for risk and enforcement cost shouldered\
    \ by landlords. Where the \nenforcement cost is excessive, fixed-rent tenancy\
    \ will be preferred to share tenancy if both \nare available options (MOROOKA\
    \ and HAYAMI 1989:28). From the other side, it must be \nremembered, argues EGGERTSSON,\
    \ that the introduction of enforcement costs influences \nall forms of contracting.\
    \ In short, transaction costs are the key variables for explaining the \nvariation\
    \ in contractual arrangements in agriculture. \n \n3.1.4 Institution Building\
    \ (Institutionalization) \n \nLike Institutional Development (ID) or institutional\
    \ innovation, Institution Building (IB) is \none of the necessary approaches to\
    \ improve the performance in any agency94. It analyses \n                    \
    \                            \n94 An assessment of the World Bank’s twenty years\
    \ experience with rural development has examined the \nfactors that significally\
    \ affected the success or failure of a project. It was found  that by and large\
    \ there has \nbeen some loss of efficiency associated with the rural development\
    \ lending strategy and that successful rural \ndevelopment presents major challenges\
    \ for governments of which local organizing and institution building \nare the\
    \ most challenging (DONALDSON 1992:111). \n \n92 \nlinkages of various sorts between\
    \ the institution being considered and its environment, and \nhow to promote a\
    \ process of ‘institutionalization’ that gives an organization like an \nirrigation\
    \ bureaucracy more than narrowly instrumental capacities to achieve objectives.\
    \ \n \nUPHOFF (1991:205-6) refers to the view that institutionalization is always\
    \ a matter of \ndegree, referred to by PARSONS and latter by HUNTINGTON (Chapter\
    \ 1.2.1), and argues \nthat the capacity of an institution (or agency) to achieve\
    \ objectives derives from its ability \nto mobilize and deploy a variety of resources\
    \ associated with gaining compliance with its \ndirectives. Moreover, there are\
    \ direct relationship, in the same direction, between the \ndegree of legitimacy\
    \ and status (respect) that people accord to an institution and its \ndecisions\
    \ from the one side and the forthcoming acquiescence and acceptance of these \n\
    decisions from those people and, therefore, their ability to achieve the institution’s\
    \ goals in \nthe other side. This fact will explain the behavior of tenants farmers\
    \ in the two cases of this \nstudy (Chapter 6.2 and 6.3) \n \nResources in IB\
    \ model, as viewed above, are treated as one of five key factors in creating \n\
    capacity. The other four are leadership, doctrine, program, and internal structure.\
    \ The vision \nof resources here is not restricted on the ‘hard’ resources (goods\
    \ and services or coercion) \nbut compasses also the legitimacy and status as\
    \ ‘soft‘ ones, being based in people’s \nattitudes and values. The IB model, as\
    \ discussed by UPHOFF, recognizes that what makes \nan organization into an institution\
    \ is the valuation it receives from the public, resulting in \nrespect, loyalty,\
    \ commitment and other supportive behavior based on norms: „Managers \nwho want\
    \ to improve the performance capabilities of their agencies will plane and carry\
    \ \nout their activities with an eye to how these can enhance the status and legitimacy\
    \ of their \nagency, its staff and its program, in the estimation of the various\
    \ groups on whom it \ndepends for a steady flow of resources and for compliance\
    \ to achieve its objectives“. \n \nAnalysts of Institution Building have distinguished\
    \ several types of linkages that \nmanagers need to concerned with UPHOFF (1991:207-9):\
    \ \n \n(1) \nEnabling linkages provide the necessary resources (authority and\
    \ funds in particular) \nthat permit the institution to operate; \n(2) \nFunctional\
    \ linkages represent the working relationships that any agency must \nmaintain\
    \ with other institutions or groups, such as cooperative arrangements with the\
    \ \nMinistry of agriculture or Extension Department to coordinate irrigation activities\
    \ \nwith agricultural ones, or liaison with water user associations where they\
    \ exist; \n(3) \nSupportive linkages include interactions with various organized\
    \ sectors of the \npublic whose backing will strengthen the hand of an institution\
    \ when dealing with \ndecision-makers and others who control the resources needed\
    \ to accomplish the \ninstitution’s tasks; \n(4) \nDiffuse linkages refer to communications\
    \ and liaison with the public at large, to \nbuild up broad approval which will\
    \ create a favorable climate of opinion, for \nexample, through the press. Forecasting\
    \ and sustaining the last two linkages are \nnecessary for improving  managers’\
    \ ability to maintain and benefit from the first two. \n \nOne main objective\
    \ of institution building projects is to create an organization that is \nresponsive\
    \ to the needs of the society around it in some degree. It should help solve the\
    \ \nproblems of that society. Within this context, an organization becomes institutionalized,\
    \ \ni.e., it becomes a valued object (POTTER 1972:152-5). Institutionalization\
    \ as defined by \n \n93 \nESMAN and BLAISE is „the process by which normative\
    \ relationships and action patterns \nare established.“ PARSONS, et al; use the\
    \ term institutionalization to mean „the \nintegration of the expectations of\
    \ the actors in a relevant interacting system of roles, with \nshared normative\
    \ patterns of values. The integration is such that each is predisposed to \nreward\
    \ the conformity of others with the value pattern, and conversely, to disapprove\
    \ and \npunish deviance. Institutionalization is a matter of degree, not of absolute\
    \ presence or \nabsence“. The focus in both cases is on establishing and integrating\
    \ patterns of interaction \nso that they become expected and valued. For institution\
    \ building to take place, as Potter \nargued, these patterns of interaction must\
    \ occur between the organization and its \nenvironment. \n \nInstitution Building\
    \ accompanied with a project95needs high coordination and interaction \nbetween\
    \ all organizations that are related to the project. Two concepts are introduced\
    \ here \nas important for understanding such interaction; the totality of action\
    \ - working in concert \ntoward a common objective, and reciprocity - as you do\
    \ something for someone else, he \nbecomes obligated to you, that means he will\
    \ help you. This exchange is very important \naspect of the establishment of effective\
    \ working relationships. \n \nGoing a step further to apply these concepts to\
    \ the institutionalization of organization, \nPotter counts, from the traditional\
    \ and recent tests of institutionality, four indicators for the \ndegree of institutionalization:\
    \ the organization’s ability to survive, the extent to which it is \nconsidered\
    \ to have intrinsic value by its environment, the degree to which specific \n\
    relationship and action patterns of the organization have become normative for\
    \ other \norganizations of the society, and more recently it has been added whether\
    \ the institution can \nmaintain its innovative thrust. In addition, he talks\
    \ about three classes of indicators having \nto do with institutional development.\
    \ One is the kinds of inputs the institution receives \nfrom the society. Second,\
    \ there are outputs that the institution provides to the society. The \nthird\
    \ class are the facilitating mechanisms that the institutions must have to provide\
    \ these \nkinds of outputs96. \n \nA point here that of particular relevance is\
    \ that institution building has contributed to our \nunderstanding of the institutional\
    \ transfer process. The possibility of borrowing \ninstitutional innovations either\
    \ through processes of diffusion or through organized \nprograms designed to transfer\
    \ institutions across social, economic, and political \nconstituencies reduces\
    \ the cost of institutional change. Modern history has witnessed \ntransfer of\
    \ different forms of institutions among countries. Inappropriate institutional\
    \ \ntransfer results in biases in the supply of institutional change that are\
    \ similar to the biases \nthat inappropriate technology transfer introduces into\
    \ the supply of technical change \n(RUTTAN 1978:353). \n \n                  \
    \                              \n95 The case examined by POTTER is an technical\
    \ assistance-institution building project. \n96 A re-examination of ESMAN and\
    \ BLAISE’s definition of institution building (POTTER 1972:156) shows, \nargued\
    \ Potter, that they have not ignored output, as they refer to physical and/or\
    \ social technologies. They \nstate \nthat \n„the \nintroduction \nof \nnew \n\
    technologies \ntakes \nplace \nprimarily \nin \nand \nthrough \norganizations....institutions\
    \ as used in this context are organizations which incorporate, foster and protect\
    \ \nnormative relationships and action patterns, and perform functions and services\
    \ which are valued in the \nenvironment.“ Nor have they ignored the element of\
    \ input, although it is less apparent in their definition. \nThey state, „if there\
    \ is deliberate planning and guidance of institutional change concomitant with\
    \ induced \ntechnological change, then this will lead to a more effective utilization\
    \ of the society’s resources.“ They \nview the institution and its environment\
    \ as parts of a system. \n \n94 \nLiterature of institution building has evolved\
    \ out of an effort primarily in the field of public \nadministration, to provide\
    \ technical assistance agencies with an effective methodology for \nintervention\
    \ to induce more effective institutional performance. This body of knowledge \n\
    has typically adopted an explicitly normative orientation toward institutional\
    \ change. \nThereby the test of effective institutionalization is the normative\
    \ impact of the \norganization on its setting. The institution-building literature,\
    \ therefore, exhibits a pervasive \nconcern with the problem of transferring particular\
    \ organizational forms from the \ndeveloped to the developing counties and with\
    \ the institutionalization of capacity for \ntechnology transfer and innovation.\
    \  \n \nInstitution building approach, at the same time, has been criticized on\
    \ the grounds that it \ngive no more explicit attention to the development of\
    \ a typology by which opportunities for \nappropriate institutional change can\
    \ be differentiated on the basis of both technological and \nenvironmental characteristics.\
    \ As example, in this connection, RUTTAN (1978:354) refers \nto SIFFIN’s critique\
    \ who argues that it is easier to institutionalize an organization that \nfocus\
    \ on developing technology than an organization that is not technology-centered.\
    \ \nHe points out that the relatively „closed-system“ quality of many technologies\
    \ means that \nthe behaviors they require are quite particular to their operations\
    \ and not common to the \nsocio-cultural system at large. On the other hand, where\
    \ there is no closed-system \ntechnology, as in community development efforts,\
    \ effective institutionalization may be \nexceedingly difficult to achieve.  \n\
    \ \n3.1.5  Organizational Change and Organizational Development (OD) \n \nTwo\
    \ interrelated trends can be identified as emerging from the review of analytical\
    \ \nframework conducted in the last two Chapters. First, the shift away from deterministic\
    \ \nforms of explanation and towards explanatory logics which emphasize the crucial\
    \ \nimportance of human agency in shaping organizational structures and practices.\
    \ There is a \ngrowing recognition that of the fact that human agents both individually\
    \ and collectively \nenact social and organizational structures by engaging in\
    \ forms of reasoning and action \nwhich transform the conditions under which they\
    \ act. A second strand of development can \nbe identified in the refocusing of\
    \ attention on the problem of control. Within the \nproblematic of control, „organizations“\
    \ are redefined as power containers supporting \ninstitutionalized structures\
    \ of dominations and regulation, rather than functional units \nbuttressing the\
    \ established order, the legitimacy of which can be automatically taken for \n\
    granted97 (REED 1992:184-5). \n \nThe particular emphasis on the dynamics of control,\
    \ as REED (1992:186-7) concludes, has \nalso given encouragement and support to\
    \ perspective and programs geared to the analysis \nof change and transformation\
    \ in organizational forms. In contrast to the previous view - \norganizations\
    \ are seen as relatively fixed and permanent features of the institutional \n\
    landscape, change and the inevitable uncertainty and instability that it generates,\
    \ is now \nseen as an integral component of complex organization. The shift away\
    \ from order and \npermanence towards control and change has also favored a reorientation\
    \ of theoretical \ndevelopment in which the politics of organization, rather than\
    \ the technicalities of formal \nstructural design, now play a strategic explanatory\
    \ role. Indeed, this shift has strengthened \nthe shift towards a more well-developed\
    \ institutional focus in organizational analysis. \n                         \
    \                       \n97 For a succinct review of this analysis see REED 1992.\
    \ \n \n95 \nIn the light of this, and the analysis that has been dealt with in\
    \ this Chapter, we conclude \nthat organizations and institutions are not invariant;\
    \ they vary with time and location, \nwith political arrangements and structures\
    \ of property rights, with technologies employed, \nand with physical qualities\
    \ of resources, commodities, and services that are exchanged. \nInstitutional\
    \ change, as discussed above, means also a change in the organizations in order\
    \ \nto carry out the social functions more efficiently and in an improved way\
    \ and to realize \nmore effectively the organizations’ goals and those of the\
    \ members and of external groups \n(MANIG 1989:32). OD according to this analysis\
    \ then means improving the discharge of \nfunctions and change at the various\
    \ levels (members, goals, organizational structure) and \nfields (values, norms,\
    \ processes). It regards the normative factors not as abstract things but \nas\
    \ personalized, motivating forces affecting organization’ performance (UPHOFF\
    \ \n1991:188)98. OD then must concur with institutional change. \n \nAny strategy\
    \ of organizational change in developing countries, as stressed by HAGE and \n\
    FINSTERBUCH (1987:3-4), must confront the political realities and cultural values\
    \ which \ninfluence the organization. They refer to OD (or human relation) as\
    \ one of three schools of \norganizational change which focuses on individual\
    \ morale and motivation. It emphasizes \nchanging employee attitudes, group processes,\
    \ and job designs by means of training, group \ndiscussion, and problem-solving\
    \ groups. The other two schools are organizational theory \n(the sociology of\
    \ organization); and organizational design (Management). Organizational \ntheory\
    \ emphasizes restructuring the organization in the direction prescribed by contingency\
    \ \ntheory (a dominant perspective in both this and organizational design), as\
    \ best suited to \nachieving either efficiency or innovativeness in its market\
    \ situation. It usually utilizes the \nchange tactics of decree, data collection,\
    \ group discussion, and restructuring. \nOrganizational design, in turns, emphasizes\
    \ improving strategic planning, changing \nstructures for greater efficiency,\
    \ and improving managerial technologies. It favors the \nchange tactics of decree,\
    \ group problem solving, and restructuring. \n \nHAGE and FINSTERBUCH (1987:277-8)\
    \ stress power issues; the role of the influential \npeople and problem-solving\
    \ groups, in inducing organizational change. If these influential \nhave no interest\
    \ in productivity, efficiency, innovation, or adaptiveness, then, they argued,\
    \ \nour framework has little utility. But such cases, as has been found from the\
    \ experiences, are \nrare. Even when elites are unconcerned about the lack of\
    \ services for the poor, they will \nbecome interested when pressure for change\
    \ builds from below, and data gathering can help \nbuild this pressure for change\
    \ by documenting the gaps. In addition, the role of problem-\nsolving groups,\
    \ especially at the top of the organization, is to adapt the change to the \n\
    political and cultural realities of the organization. The authors frankly recognize\
    \ that the \nproposed change must leave undisturbed some benefits that powerful\
    \ elites derive from the \nexisting circumstances. Elites, in fact, should be\
    \ members of the high-level problem-\nsolving groups or work closely with them.\
    \ Furthermore, elite opposition is usually partial. \nNon-elites also, on the\
    \ other side, have power that can make or break an intervention; \nresistance\
    \ to change can occur at many levels and for many reasons. \n \n             \
    \                                   \n98 Opposite to Organizational Development,\
    \ where the normative factors are weighted, a more radical \napproach has recently\
    \ emerged known as Organizational Transformation (OT). This approach (discussed\
    \ in \ndetail in LEVY and MERRY 1986) gives more weight to subjective, value-oriented\
    \ influences (UPHOFF \n1991:196). \n \n96 \nOrganizational development discussed\
    \ by UPHOFF (1991:182) as one of the normative \napproaches that, together with\
    \ the structural changes, and incentives and learning, lead to \nimproving the\
    \ performance of agencies like irrigation organizations. Such approaches deal\
    \ \nwith what can affect people’s norms and values so that individuals within\
    \ the bureaucracy \nbecome more disposed to make persistent, innovative efforts\
    \ on behalf of organizational \nobjectives. This aspect of reorientation is more\
    \ uncertain because it deals with social \npsychology and ideologies, rather than\
    \ with rules and procedures or with allocation of \nbudgets and responsibilities.\
    \ The extent to which OD interventions are transferable across \ncultures is therefor\
    \ less clear. That means, one is able, perhaps, to take ideas, examples and \n\
    encouragement from one situation to another but not specific models, roles or\
    \ incentives. \nAnd like the view of HAGE and FINSTERBUCH the leadership in the\
    \ top levels of the \norganization is a key element in these transformations.\
    \    \n \nOrganizational change can results either in an improved effectiveness\
    \ of the services \nsupplied or in an increase in the tendency to innovate, but\
    \ not in both (MANIG 1989:32-4). \nApplying in irrigation systems, it aims to\
    \ fulfill the functions and achieve the goals of the \norganization and the influential\
    \ groups. According to this approach, organization forms \nought to change by\
    \ themselves. The real goal that should be the basis of the organization’s \n\
    development in irrigation system is improving the efficiency of land and water\
    \ utilization \nfor farmers and, furthermore, the increases in labor productivity\
    \ . Other goals are dependent \non achieving this real goal. However, improving\
    \ the goal achievement after an \norganizational change requires, stressed MANIG,\
    \ appropriate behavioral changes even \namong farmers: Hence social sanction and\
    \ reward mechanism should be introduced (e.g. \nincreased water taxes, but also\
    \ attractive prices). \n \nMany modifications are recommended for organizational\
    \ change and development. A well-\nknown scholar in this field, BENNIS, refers\
    \ to six forces at work which are demanding that \norganizations modify both structure\
    \ and climate in order to cope successfully with the \nrealities of modern environment.\
    \ These factors are (SCOTT and MITCHELL 1972:259): \n \n1. An acceleration in\
    \ change that requires rapid organizational adaptation. \n2. Increasing technological\
    \ sophistication which lends to the acceleration of change. \n3. Growing organizational\
    \ complexity which is partially attributable to technology and \npartially a result\
    \ of increasing organizational size. \n4. Changing character of the workforce\
    \ in which more highly educated, professionally \noriented people are going into\
    \ organizations. \n5. A growing expectation of the ‘new' employee for greater\
    \ freedom and discretion at \nwork. \n6. More disenchantment with traditional\
    \ authority, with emphasis based on a decline of \ncommand (superior-subordinate)\
    \ authority and the rise of functional authority vested in \nexpertise. \n \n\
    These forces speak for the liberalization of the organization. According to BENNIS,\
    \ the \nmain avenue for such modification is democracy. As such, democracy is\
    \ thought to \nrevitalize organizations making them better able to adapt to change\
    \ and making them more \nresponsive to the needs of their members99. \n      \
    \                                          \n99 The need for democratization is\
    \ one of the basic recommendations, for achieving the goals of \ndevelopment and\
    \ elimination of poverty, that dominate the studies of improving the role of United\
    \ Nations \nin the future (URQUHART and CHILDERS 1991). \n \n97 \nRecommendations\
    \ for organizational changes in macro-hydraulic systems tend towards \ndividing\
    \ the functions of a complex organization into various small ones. Coordination\
    \ and \nself-control mechanisms for the mutual control of activities resulted\
    \ from the separation of \nfunctions is, of course, necessary. Most of such recommendations\
    \ see in water users’ \ninvolvement and/or participation, especially in the system\
    \ of water distribution, the decisive \nkey to an increase in efficiency (MANIG\
    \ 1989:35-7). It should be noted here, in addition, \nthat change in irrigation\
    \ organizations must be accompanied by a comprehensive \ninstitutional change\
    \ in land property, land use and expansion of the structure of the \nsupporting\
    \ institutions in order to improve potential utilization and to achieve basic\
    \ \ndevelopment goals. It also requires different technique to achieve their aimed\
    \ objectives. \n \nAt the top of such techniques is laboratory training as a very\
    \ important one accompanied \nwith research, diagnostic, and consulting techniques\
    \ which are supposed to improve \norganizational climate. One could sum up that\
    \ OD can only be perceived within the global \ncontext of institutional change\
    \ at all levels and in all sectors. To emphasize this point a \nquote by FRENCH\
    \ is appropriate:“..successful organization development tends to be a total \n\
    system effort; a process of planned change-not a program with a temporary quality;\
    \ and \naimed at developing the organization’s internal resources for effective\
    \ change in the \nfuture.“100 \n \n3.2  Price Policy as a Means for Inducing Optimum\
    \ Water-Use Efficiency \n \n3.2.1  Water and The Market \n \nWater pricing is\
    \ one of the most important determinates of improving the performance of \nirrigation\
    \ systems in the future. It should be designed to encourage the optimal use of\
    \ water \nfrom the standpoint of the society. Most experts; engineers, hydrologists,\
    \ ecologists, and \neconomists agree that the inefficacy of water use and poor\
    \ maintenance of irrigation \nsystems are largely due to the extraordinary extent\
    \ to which water is not treated as a \ncommodity but as a free good (LINSLEY 1965:89).\
    \ In much of the Third World, policies \nthat promote an antiquated illusion of\
    \ abundance have resulted in: „people rarely pay the \ntrue cost of the water\
    \ they use“ (POSTEL 1984:47). While irrigation, there, consumes the \nmajority\
    \ of water supply, water generally has the lowest estimated marginal value product\
    \ \nin agriculture. The lack of farmer awareness of the economic cost of water\
    \ as a resource \nresults in waste of water and a loss of food-production potential,\
    \ which is directly \ntranslated to a drain on the meager financial resources\
    \ of these countries \n(FAIRCHILD/NOBE 1988:356). \n \nThe reason of such fact\
    \ was the absence of the market and its regulating mechanism; the \nprice. We\
    \ are facing here an exceptional case concerning a certain propensity in human\
    \ \nnature, which Adam Smith (EGGERTSSON (1990:3) referred to as „the propensity\
    \ to \ntruck, barter, and exchange one thing for another“. Such behavior has important\
    \ \nconsequences of the activities for the use of scarce resources and the creation\
    \ of wealth101. \n                                                \n100 Quotation\
    \ from SCOTT and MITCHELL 1972:269. \n101 BUCHANAN (1964) in an Article titled:\
    \ „What Should Economists Do?“ takes up this point from Smith \nand suggests that\
    \ economists should place the theory of markets and not the theory of resource\
    \ allocation at \ncenter stage. Economists, he argues, ‘should’ concentrate their\
    \ attention on a particular form of human \nactivity, and upon the various institutional\
    \ arrangements that arise as a result of this form of activity. Man’s \nbehavior\
    \ in the market relationship, reflecting the propensity to truck and to barter,\
    \ and the manifold \nvariations in structure that this relationship can take;\
    \ these are the proper subjects for the economist’s study. \n \n98 \nBOULDING\
    \ (1980) has observed, in this context, that in contrast to many other natural\
    \ \nresources, water has been viewed as too important to be left to the market\
    \ place, so that its \nadministration falls largely in the political realm (YOUNG\
    \ 1986:152-7).102 Most societies \nhave therefore chosen nonmarket administrative\
    \ mechanisms for water allocation.  \n \nSeveral reasons inhibit the adoption\
    \ of market institutions for water allocation. Of these \ndefined YOUNG three\
    \ major factors; physical; economic; and conflicting social values103: \n \n-\
    \ Physical: due to the nature of water and how it is used in production and \n\
    consumption activities. Because of its nature and the difficulty to identify specific\
    \ \nunits of it, water presents unique problems in the establishment and enforcement\
    \ of \nproperty rights; \n-  Economic: which stems from the fact that, until recently,\
    \ water has been in relatively \nplentiful supply; and \n-  Conflicting social\
    \ values: in that material well-being is not the only yardstick used \nby society\
    \ to measure success in water allocation. Rituals and religious teachings may\
    \ \nexplicity or implicity prescribe against market allocations of water104. \n\
    \ \nIn the context of his discussion about the non-profitable nature of most of\
    \ the irrigation \nsystems in the developing countries (the case of Gezira), RUTHENBERG\
    \ (1963:706) \nstressed the social factor as reason for the farmers’ rejection\
    \ of water charging. In the light \nof the low production, the untrained farmer,\
    \ who is deeply rooted in the traditional thinking \nof the society, will see\
    \ the water charge as very high. Other hindrance in the face of \nmaximizing collections\
    \ and implementing cost recovery schemes, as we will dwell on latter \nin the\
    \ discussion of the results (Chapter 6), is the unsatisfaction with water deliveries:\
    \ \n“unless water deliveries are satisfactory, water users will probably avoid\
    \ paying the \ngovernment irrigation fees if possible“ (UPHOFF 1991:61). Where\
    \ service is reliable and \nadequate, several other conditions will affect, he\
    \ argued, cost recovery. For instance, \nwhether the funds collected from users\
    \ in a particular system are spent for Operation and \nMaintenance O&M in that\
    \ system rather being siphoned into the central treasury; whether \n         \
    \                                                                            \
    \                                                            \nFor a more detailed\
    \ discussion of the theory of price (microeconomic theory) and its applying to\
    \ economic \nand political institution, and therefore the thought of the New Institutional\
    \ Economics (NIE) see \nEGGERTSSON (1990). \n102 BOULDING refers to the price\
    \ system as one of three major mechanisms - labeled as the „three P’s“ - that\
    \ \nmankind employs to reflect human values in the process of organizing human\
    \ utilization of the earth’s \nnatural resource endowment. Prices represent the\
    \ market system, operating through free exchange and a \nrelative price structure.\
    \ The other two „P’s“ are Policemen and Preachments. „Policemen“ -- the \nlegitimated\
    \ threat system or the political order - establish and enforce property rights\
    \ and administer public \nregulations, whereas „Preachments“ represent the moral\
    \ order, the process by which human values are \nlearned, conveyed, modified,\
    \ and employed in making choices. BOULDING argues that, in the case of \nwater,\
    \ the political and moral modes have had, up to the present time, the dominant\
    \ role (YOUNG \n1986:152).  \n103 SMALL and CARRUTHERS (1991:36) add tow others\
    \ factors: the presence of externalities (for example, if \nthere are uncompensated\
    \ side effects such as pollution); and if there are economies of scale that set\
    \ the \npreconditions for monopoly. These factors, along with the other mentioned\
    \ above, explain the lack of well-\ndeveloped water markets. \n104 There is general\
    \ thought in such societies, specially the Islamic societies, that water is „gift\
    \ of God“, \ntherefore it must be available for all irrespective of the costs.\
    \ \n \n99 \nfee-paying farmers have some control over the expenditure of O&M funds\
    \ so that they are \nproperly and efficiently used105. \n \nIn addition to the\
    \ importance of the price structure in resource allocation, there are at least\
    \ \nother two functions of it which may not be compatible one with another namely\
    \ in the field \nof distribution of income and direct technical change. LINSLEY\
    \ (1965:90-1) argued that \nthe third function of the price system seldom mentioned\
    \ in the textbooks, but in the long \nrun it may be perhaps the most important.\
    \ „Water should be dear and plentiful“. „It should \nbe dear because only it is\
    \ dear will people bother to economize; and if it is dear will \ntechnical change\
    \ more in the direction of water-saving improvements“. He sustained his \nargument\
    \ with an example from California106 where the value added per cubic kilometer\
    \ of \nwater was 65 times greater in industry than in agriculture (POSTEL 1984:47).\
    \ The easiest \nway to make water dear, according to this analysis, is to tax\
    \ it. Because „water is an \nexcellent commodity for tax“. It has a fairly inelastic\
    \ demand, so the yields of taxation \nshould be high. In the same time, it should\
    \ not be unduly regressive107. On the other hand, it \nis important to not that\
    \ if the prices of irrigation water exceed some limits, the farmers \nmight reduce\
    \ the irrigated area as registered in the cases of this study  (Chapt. 6.6). \
    \ \n \nInterest in water markets has recently increased reflecting growing pressure\
    \ on limited \nwater supplies, (realization) that institutional change will be\
    \ needed to improve water use \nefficiency, and the shift toward privatization\
    \ and market mechanisms to address resource \nallocation problems108. GARDNER\
    \ (1985) argues that water markets could promote water \n                    \
    \                            \n105 A suitable example is Gendettu Scheme where\
    \ the administration always claimed that the farmers do not \npay the charges\
    \ and that is why, view the administration, there is no fund to finance M&O. In\
    \ the same time \nmany of the staff who actually work in other irrigation Schemes\
    \ in the region tack their salaries from \nGendettu (See Chapter 6.2.2.1). \n\
    106 Because the agricultural water in the Los Angeles area is quite expensive,\
    \ there have been professions who \nteach farmers how to use as little water as\
    \ possible. Since water costs in the Central Valley are little, no such \noccupation\
    \ had been exist. The farmers used water as wastefully as they like and was hard\
    \ to blame them, \nfor there was no incentive to economize and particularly no\
    \ incentive to develop water-saving \nimprovements. \n107 The close relationship\
    \ between water pricing, water technology, and water control can be illustrated\
    \ through \nthe Israel’s experience. Water authority there is trying to accomplish\
    \ the twin objectives of water \nmanagement; equity and efficiency, through water\
    \ pricing and through the establishment of other incentives \nfor farmers to adopt\
    \ water-efficient techniques and technology (Chapter 2.3.1.2). Water prices are\
    \ adjusted \nto compensate farmers located in disadvantageous areas to reward\
    \ farmers who use water efficiently, and to \npenalize the inefficient. Other\
    \ incentives include, for example, subsidies for the purchase of innovative \n\
    water-efficient technology (LEES 1986:611). The most interested fact in this case,\
    \ which we will need in \nthe analyses of our empirical work (Chapter 6.6) is\
    \ that most of the water consumption in Israel’s \nagriculture (approximately\
    \ 80%) is used for cash-crop (profitable) production. In addition, the marketing\
    \ \nof these products is well organized.   \n108 In the context of a theory of\
    \ the demand for institutional change, NORTH and THOMAS (1973) explain the \n\
    economic growth of Western Europe between 900 and 1700 primarily in terms of changes\
    \ in the \ninstitutions whose rules govern property rights. These institutional\
    \ changes, in their view, were induced by \nthe pressure of population against\
    \ increasingly scarce resource endowments. More recently, the competition \nbetween\
    \ both agricultural and industrial production and from transportation, has resulted\
    \ in a dramatic rise \nin the economic value of common property resources that\
    \ had previously been regarded as free goods. The \nresult has been the emergence\
    \ of new institutions designed to clarify the property rights of individuals,\
    \ \nfirms, and communities in respect to these increasingly valuable common property\
    \ resources. The same \nsequence has been observed (JAY 1969) in a number of developing\
    \ countries, where the use of more \nintensive farming systems has led to an increase\
    \ in the economic value of water. And this increased value \nhas induced institutional\
    \ changes that have led to more precise definitions of property rights in respect\
    \ to \nirrigation water and to greater use of market mechanism in the allocation\
    \ of water (RUTTAN 1978:335-6). \n \n100 \nuse flexibility, establish a recognized\
    \ water value, and thus provide incentives for more \nefficient water-use (HAMILTON\
    \ 1989:64). But this efficient use is more connected with \nthe preferences of\
    \ the water users: “Vielleicht kann man sagen, daß eine effiziente \nwassernutzung\
    \ besser definiert ist vom Gesichtspunkt ‘was die Menschen mit dem Wasser \nanfangen\
    \ werden’, als vom Gesichtspunkt ‘wie gut das system geplant ist, um theoretischen\
    \ \nNormen gerecht zu werden’” (CRIDDLE 1975:142). \n \nWater charges can be one\
    \ of the viable policy solutions to the management problems of \ncanal irrigation\
    \ system, on condition that methods of cooperation and trust must be built \n\
    into the system. Such goal is then achievable only through the farmer involvement\
    \ and \nfarmer participation. In this case, charging farmers some share of system\
    \ costs give them, \nas POSTEL (1984:48) pointed out: „a stake in the system“\
    \ besides generating revenue to \nimprove operations. With other words, water\
    \ charges must be considered in the context of a \npackage of policies. Otherwise\
    \ the farmers will see it as fine109 not as price for water or the \nparticipation\
    \ in the Scheme as the case in the Sudan. In addition, the existence of water\
    \ user \nassociations to coordinate management tasks and the collection of fees\
    \ is necessary. \n  \nPAPANDREOU (1994:2-3) take the view a step further and argued,\
    \ rather than looking at \nhow the signaling devices (prices) of existing institutions\
    \ fail to do their work, it would be \nmore appropriate to ask how institutions\
    \ need to be formed so that many important \neconomic activities are explicitly\
    \ guided by the institutional structure. In a sense, one need \nto move from the\
    \ question of optimal prices to the prior question of optimal institutions. \n\
    Instead of seeking ways of correcting certain prices in the system, we would seek\
    \ to form a \nbetter overall ‘voting’ system, which would result in improved ‘prices’.\
    \ \n \nFinally, advocates of market solutions to the problems of irrigation efficiency\
    \ are \nconfronted with several potential shortcomings (SMALL and CARRUTHERS 1991:37-8):\
    \ \n \n• \nMarket imperfections exist that cause markets to function improperly;\
    \ \n• \nMarkets give wrong signals by ignoring externalities; \n• \nMarkets do\
    \ not work to provide the optimum level of public goods; and \n• \nMarkets may\
    \ yield undesirable results in terms of alternative objectives. \n \nAccording\
    \ to the author’s observations of government failure and market failure in the\
    \ \ndeveloping countries, they advocate the solutions that rely upon: \n \n• \n\
    Briefing of political leaders on the costs and benefits of policy options; \n\
    • \nEconomic analysis of options; \n• \nDecentralization of authority for financing\
    \ policy; \n• \nScheme level collection and retention of user fees, normally equivalent\
    \ to \noperation and maintenance costs; and  \n• \nEncouragement of collective\
    \ user-group action to increase agency accountability.  \n \n \n             \
    \                                   \n109 The sound of this word (call to mind)\
    \ remind the farmers in Sudan of the colonial time. \n \n101 \n3.2.2 Water Pricing\
    \ Systems and Institutional Change \n \nBecause irrigation is expensive, it is\
    \ agreed upon, then, that farmers should be charged for \ntheir participation\
    \ in irrigation systems. The problem is to what extent and in which form? \nShould\
    \ the farmers be required to repay the capital cost or part of it?, or only cover\
    \ the \nrecurrent O & M costs?, or whether the fees should be based on the benefits\
    \ received. Even \nmany who view water pricing and water law as the means for\
    \ creating an environment to \ninduce the system to evolve in a desirable direction\
    \ are cautious about the answer. \nIncreasing the price of water could not be\
    \ an effective means for inducing optimum \nirrigation water use efficiency. On\
    \ the contrary, high-priced water may actually hinder on-\nfarm development because\
    \ it captures resources needed for other activities. Consequently, \nhigh prices\
    \ may actually create a disincentive for optimum water use in the long run \n\
    (KELLER 1986:346)110. \n \n3.2.2.1 Bases for Setting Water Rates \n \nThere are\
    \ several bases for determining the amount to be paid as water fee. In some \n\
    countries, it can be based on theoretical calculation, but in many others the\
    \ water rates paid \nbear little or no relation to the calculated fees. To a large\
    \ extent this is due to the fact that \nrate setting is seldom a purely economic\
    \ activity, and non-economic factors often impinge \nupon the decision-making\
    \ process (SMALL and CARRUTHERS 1991:34). These ‘non-\neconomic’ \nfactors \n\
    are \nmore \ndefined \nby \nSAGARDOY, \nBOTTRALL, \nand \nUITTENBOGAARD (1986:127):“...water\
    \ rates are often a political issue rather than a \ntechnical one”. \n \nSMALL\
    \ and CARRUTHERS (1991:170-81) examine in this connection three issues that \n\
    often arise and pose the policy question that must be answered in any given situation.\
    \ They \nstressed, however, that there is no a single ‘correct’ answer exists\
    \ for all situations: \n \n• Should fees be project specific or uniform across\
    \ projects? To some extent, the \nnature of the fee structure depends on the financial\
    \ and organizational structure that \nexists for the delivery of irrigation services.\
    \ In decentralized financially autonomous \nirrigation associations, as is found\
    \ in South Korea, it must be possible for fees to be \nset independently by each\
    \ association. A single national structure for fees (Sudan) \nwould not be compatible\
    \ with the autonomy of the individual associations. It is \nsometimes alleged\
    \ that uniform fees are better than project-specific fees because \nthey are ‘fairer’.\
    \ From another perspective, in terms of location with respect to the \nwater supply,\
    \ the force of gravity makes the farms unequal. That is why charging \nthe farmers\
    \ at the high and lower elevation the same amount would be inequitable. \nAnyhow,\
    \ the uniform and project specific fee can practiced in one country. \n      \
    \                                          \n110 On the ground that; for farmers\
    \ to increase their water-use efficiency, they must usually increase the labor,\
    \ \ncapital, and management inputs to their own farm irrigation practices. Thus\
    \ it costs them considerably more \nto use water efficiently than to misuse it.\
    \ However, increasing the price of water actually allows them less \nleeway for\
    \ providing the additional on-farm cost of using it well. Conversely, according\
    \ to other hypothesis, \nit is assumed that, by means of an excessive increase\
    \ in duties, the farmers can be forced to increase their \nproductivity since,\
    \ otherwise, their income will be reduced (MANIG 1984).   \n \n102 \n• Should\
    \ rates differ among water users within a single irrigation project? If the cost\
    \ \nof serving some users is greater than the most of providing irrigation to\
    \ others, then \nthis economic logic dictates that higher fees should be charged\
    \ to those for whom \nthe cost of providing irrigation is greater. But it must\
    \ be kept in mind that as the \nnumber of distinctions increases, the administrative\
    \ costs also increase. A balance \nneeds to be struck between the differentiation\
    \ of the fees in accordance with \ndifferences in costs, and the administrative\
    \ ease of assessment and collection under \na less differentiated fee structure.\
    \ \n \n• How can the real value of irrigation fees be maintained in the face of\
    \ inflation? If, as \nis frequently the case, the rate of inflation is quite high,\
    \ the real value of the fees \nestablished under the fee structure will soon become\
    \ seriously eroded, so that the \namount of funds collected will no longer be\
    \ reasonable in relation either to the \nagency’s needs or to the amounts that\
    \ the users can afford. At the same time, \npolitical difficulties can hinder\
    \ raising the nominal fees111. Tying the nominal \nirrigation fees to some general\
    \ price index is one possible way to deal with this \nproblem. In the case of\
    \ a centralized irrigation agency, the advantage of establishing \nthe level of\
    \ fees in kind is particularly pronounced. On the other hand, in institutions\
    \ \nwhere decentralized autonomous irrigation agencies exist, the problems of\
    \ raising \nfees may be less severe because the decisions of individual irrigation\
    \ agencies to \nrise rates have only local, rather than national, impact.  \n\
    \ \n3.2.2.2 Methods of Setting Water Rates \n \nEconomists often suggest pricing\
    \ water at its marginal cost- the cost of supplying the next \nincrement from\
    \ the best available source (POSTEL 1984:47-8). Consumers would thus pay \nmore\
    \ as supplies become scarcer. With other words, the greater the depletion, the\
    \ greater \nthe allowance-hardly an incentive to converse. However, conflicting\
    \ revenue and income \nredistribution objectives often dictate alternative solutions\
    \ (YOUNG 1986:158). In practice, \nfarmers are seldom asked to pay fees that cover\
    \ the total costs of irrigation. Furthermore, \nwater, is rarely priced at marginal\
    \ cost; charges often bear little relation to the real cost and \nquantity of\
    \ water supplied. The governments in the developing countries pay all or most\
    \ of \nthe capital costs for major large-scale irrigation schemes and seek to\
    \ recoup only a small \nfraction of these costs. The focus is then more likely\
    \ to be on the costs of O&M. In this \nview, it would make sense to discuss some\
    \ of the water rate setting principles or methods. \n \nI. \nThe marginal cost\
    \ pricing principle. This rate-setting rule is applied where \nallocative efficiency\
    \ (maximizing net social product) is the primary objective. When \nrates are set\
    \ according to the schedule of marginal cost of supplying water, then the \nuser\
    \ will demand the commodity as long as marginal willingness to pay exceeds \n\
    incremental cost, and the optimal level of usage will result. On the other side,\
    \ the \nvariety of definitions of the appropriate marginal cost concept for pricing\
    \ policy \nmakes its application difficult. An example concerns the transactions\
    \ costs \n                                                \n111 Philippine is\
    \ a good example for such case. Irrigation fees, that have been levied since at\
    \ least 1946, were \noriginally established in monetary terms. But over time,\
    \ inflation severely eroded the real value of these \nfees, which, for political\
    \ reasons, were difficult to raise. Since 1975, the irrigation fees paid by farmers\
    \ have \nbeen denominated in terms of paddy. The farmers may pay either in kind\
    \ or in an equivalent amount of \ncash. The cash value of the fee is based on\
    \ the government’s support price of paddy, and therefore increases \nwith any\
    \ increase in the support price (SMALL/CARRUTHERS 1991.180).   \n \n103 \nassociated\
    \ with measuring, allocating, and monitoring a water pricing system112. In \n\
    addition, multi-part pricing systems (where marginal price is set equal to marginal\
    \ \ncost with no relation to output) often fail to account for the economically\
    \ correct \nconcept of opportunity costs, focusing rather on historical or embedded\
    \ costs. \nFurthermore, opportunity costs should be determined by a market mechanism\
    \ rather \nthan by administrative procedures (YOUNG 1986:158-9). \n \nII. \nThe\
    \ ability-to-pay principle. This principle rests heavily on the equity criterion.\
    \ \nCommonly, the rate here recoveries fully only operating costs, plus a small\
    \ fraction \nof the initial investment113. The concept, argued YOUNG, is inherently\
    \ subjective \nand political pressures arise to set the formula in ways which\
    \ redistribute income \nfrom taxpayers to water users. \n \nIII. \nPayment per\
    \ unit of water (volumetric method). Through this method, an \neconomical water\
    \ use is directly achieved. It encourage efficient water use by \nmaintaining\
    \ a constant relation between the amount of water used and the payment \nto be\
    \ made. Water use reaches its limit wherever the price corresponds to the \nmarginal\
    \ yield. In spite of the desirability of this method, its introduction often \n\
    meets resistance and difficulties. Volumetric method, called as potential price,\
    \ has \nthe disadvantage of requiring high administrative expenditure for measuring\
    \ and \ncontrolling water use and the collection of charges – especially for projects\
    \ serving \nnumerous small farmers under demand systems. Farmers find ways and\
    \ means to \nblock the devices, especially in open canal systems. On the other\
    \ hand, the cost of \neach device, its installation and subsequent monitoring\
    \ may not compote \nadvantageously with a less efficient system (payment per unit\
    \ of land) (MANIG \n1984:1105; \nKELLER \n1986:347; \nSAGARDOY, \nBOTTRALL, \n\
    and \nUITTENBOGAARD 1986:127). \n \nIV. \nWater charges related to land (flat\
    \ rate per area unit). This principle is seen as the \nsimplest regulation for\
    \ levying water charges and easy to administer. It can also be \nregarded as a\
    \ kind of land tax. In this connection argues ELLIS (1992:270) that the \nmost\
    \ practicable and equitable method of fixing the water fee can be then to apply\
    \ a \nuniform repayment levy per hectare of cultivated land irrigated by the scheme.114\
    \ \nHowever, investigations carried out in several countries (Pakistan, Mexico)\
    \ indicate \nthat more than 50 of the farmers deviate by more than 10 percent\
    \ of the average \n                                                \n112 For example,\
    \ in an irrigation system with plentiful water supplies and numerous small field\
    \ units, the \ntransactions costs of a volumetric pricing system may exceed the\
    \ value of water saved (YOUNG 1986:159). \n113 This because shadow prices, not\
    \ market prices, are used in the calculation of the economic return. Where the\
    \ \ntwo prices differ sharply, it is possible that the water users could not afford\
    \ to pay for the total cost of \nirrigation, even though the investment shows\
    \ a favorable economic return to the nation. SMALL and \nCARRUTHERS (1991:163)\
    \ refer to one significant administrative complication that may make it difficult\
    \ \nfor a public agency to collect the cost of irrigation services from the water\
    \ users, even if they can afford to \npay for it. This is the difficulty in estimating\
    \ what benefits each individual farmer receive, and accordingly \nadjusting the\
    \ irrigation charges.  \n114 Some variation in the rate, argued ELLIS (1992:271),\
    \ may be desirable to reflect visible differences in \nwater access by farmers\
    \ at differing distances from outlets. The disadvantage here is that some farmers\
    \ \nwould then feel entitled to receive more water than other farmers, and cooperation\
    \ between farmers as a \ngroup becomes more difficult. \n \n104 \ndepth of water\
    \ applied in the scheme (SAGARDOY, BOTTRALL, and \nUITTENBOGAARD 1986:129). Such\
    \ a method of payment is accordingly not \nequitable for many of the farmers.\
    \ Furthermore, argue the authors, this principle \ndisassociates the commodity\
    \ (water) from the rate paid which does not encourage \nthe efficient use of water.\
    \ It has, in addition, the disadvantage of producing a \nregressive effect (MANIG\
    \ 1984).    \n \nThe last two methods have been evaluated in a study in Egypt\
    \ (1986). The optimal pricing \ninstrument judged by the efficiency criterion,\
    \ according to the study, was the instrument \nthat maximizes returns to land\
    \ and water in the study area and net of social costs incurred in \nproviding\
    \ and charging for the irrigation water. At that time, aggregate irrigation water\
    \ \nsupply in Egypt was generally adequate to meet demand in the agricultural\
    \ sector. It is not \nsurprising, then, that the results of this study have shown\
    \ pricing systems with a zero \nmarginal charge to be most efficient under nonscare\
    \ supply. With other words, the study \nhas shown area-based water charges (in\
    \ particular flat rate) to be more efficient and just as \nequitable as volumetric\
    \ charges under the plentiful water supply conditions (YOUNG \n1986:174). \n \n\
    Finally, it is worth noting that for already existing schemes, the issue of capital\
    \ repayment \nis academic since the capital is a sunk cost. The issue here is\
    \ then how to encourage the \nschemes to cover their current costs and to ‘pay\
    \ their own way.’ This policy; self-\nsufficiency of irrigation systems, has been\
    \ declared in Sudan in December 1992 and \nthrough which user contributions should\
    \ cover O&M costs. \n \n3.2.2.3  Institutional Factors and Strategies Related\
    \ to Collection of Water Fees \n \nEven the best designed system of irrigation\
    \ fees can be destroyed by low rates of collection \nof the fees assessed. To\
    \ deal with this issue, argue SMALL and CARRUTHERS \n(1991:202), we need to be\
    \ concerned with all conditions, not only the enforcement, which \ncreate a willingness\
    \ to pay on the part of the water users. They occlude the following \nfactors:\
    \ \n \n- \ngiving the water users a perception that they own the irrigation facilities;\
    \ \n- \nmaking the personnel of the irrigation agency accountable to the water\
    \ users for the \nperformance of the irrigation systems; \n- \nearmarking fees\
    \ collected in a particular project for use in the operation and \nmaintenance\
    \ of that project; \n- \npaying water users’ organizations a commission to collect\
    \ the fees from its members; \n- \nproviding positive financial incentives, such\
    \ as discounts for prompt payment; \n- \nproviding positive social incentives\
    \ for payments; \n- \nproviding enforceable penalties for non-payment, such as\
    \ termination of water \ndeliveries or other financial, legal, and social sanctions;\
    \ \n- \nmaking direct contact with the water users, rather than waiting for the\
    \ water users to \ncome to pay their fees; \n- \ngiving responsibility for collection\
    \ to intermediaries who are in more direct contact with \nthe water users; and\
    \ \n- \nallowing the users to pay their fees in kind rather than in cash. \n \
    \ \n \n105 \nPart II: Irrigation Scheme Management Organizations in The Sudan:\
    \ The \nEmpirical Part \n \nSudan is the largest country in Africa covering a\
    \ total area of about 2.5 million sq. km. with \npopulation estimated of about\
    \ twenty-eight million in 1995115. The last census indicates that \nabout 69%\
    \ of the population is rural while about 20% live in urban and semi-urban areas.\
    \ \nThe remaining 11% constitute a nomadic population. According to the World\
    \ Bank \nestimates Sudan is one of the 48 world’s poorest countries116. The north\
    \ third of the Sudan is \nalmost a desert with an annual average rainfall of about\
    \ 20 millimeters. Due to the absence \nof rain in the northern Sudan, the population\
    \ depends completely on the Nile River - the sole \ntraditional source of water\
    \ – for irrigation. The rainfall increases steadily from north to south \nuntil\
    \ it reaches isohytes 400mm. to 800mm. Therefore, the water problem in the Sudan\
    \ \nrange from desert conditions to those of the huge swamps. \n \nAccording to\
    \ the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimate\
    \ \nof 1985 there were 33.6 million ha.117 (hectares) of irrigable land in Sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa. Out \nof 5.6 million ha. under irrigation only 2.7 million ha. consisted\
    \ of modern farms, and of \nthis, 1.7 million ha. were found in Sudan alone and\
    \ the other nine countries had 50 000 ha. \nof modern irrigation118. Therefore,\
    \ Sudan has about 63% of the modern irrigation in Sub-\nSaharan Africa (AHMED\
    \ ed. 1989:5). This indicate that Sudan has one of the greatest \npotentialities\
    \ for the world’s food production. A fact that has been firmly recognized in \n\
    Room’s International Conference on Food Problems. This recognition has put on\
    \ the Sudan, \namong other few countries, the responsibility of increasing their\
    \ agricultural yields. \n \nIn recent years, to sustain food security for increased\
    \ population, coupled with the desire of \nimprovement in living standards, there\
    \ is a fundamental need to look for additional \npossibilities of increasing agricultural\
    \ production. Theoretically, this is possible because of \nthe existing large\
    \ area suitable for agriculture. Considering the worldwide tightening of \nfunds\
    \ and the availability of (fewer) good sites for new irrigation development in\
    \ Sudan, the \ngoal of sustaining system performance become more serious. As stated\
    \ by FAO \n(1986:105), a major step toward improved land-use in the Sudan “would\
    \ be achieved by \nputting already available land resource information to work\
    \ at all levels of decision-making \nfrom national to project and farm level”.\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n115\
    \ The third national population census was conducted in 1983 and estimated population\
    \ at 21.6 million. \n116 According to the cross-country study of DASGUPTA (1993:112),\
    \ based on the strengths and limitations of \nthe BORDA Index, Sudan is the 21\
    \ of the lowest-ranked countries in 1980. \n117 1.0 ha. (hectare) = 2.381 feddans.\
    \ Feddans will be used more often as a mass in this and the next Chapters. \n\
    118 For a more detailed discussion of the social conditions in Sub-saharan African,\
    \ see CARR-HILL (1990). \n \n106 \n4.  Agriculture and The National Economy119\
    \ \n \nAgriculture, as is so often the case in developing countries, is the dominant\
    \ sector of the \nSudan economy, accounting for over the third of the county’s\
    \ GDP throughout the 1980s \n(38% in 1993), and about 97% of its exports. Eighty\
    \ per cent of the labor force is engaged in \nagriculturally related activities,\
    \ and agriculturally based industries represent 80% of the total \nmanufacturing\
    \ sector. It has, in addition a significant impact on other sectors of the \n\
    economy. Component of the sector include crop and livestock production, forestry,\
    \ fishing, \nand hunting. \n \nSudanese government budget and foreign currency\
    \ availability are based on cotton. The \ndistorting effects of this monocultural\
    \ production with its roots in empirical economic \nhistory, does not need underlining.\
    \ Cotton production is, however, limited by water \nresources and crop rotation.\
    \ Moreover, production of wheat and other staples are important \naims of government\
    \ to improve domestic food supplies and slow down increasing \ndependency on food\
    \ imports.  \n \n4.1  Structure of the Agriculture Sector \n \nSudan has virtually\
    \ unlimited agricultural resources with a potential for producing a wide \nrange\
    \ of crops. Approximately 35 million ha. in Sudan may be potentially arable, and\
    \ \nanother 100 million ha. are suitable for grazing land. From the total area\
    \ of Sudan, the more \nrecent salient land-use statistics (Ministry of Agriculture,\
    \ 1991) show that only 10.2 million \nha. (4.1%) are currently cultivated, about\
    \ 94 million ha. (37.6%) are occupied by forestry, \n66 million ha. (26.4) are\
    \ pastures and 80 million ha. (32%) are uninhabited (Table 4.1). \nFrom the total\
    \ cultivated area, 17.9 % is directly managed by the government, 0.3 % by the\
    \ \ncooperatives and 81.8 % is owned by the private sector in different sub-systems\
    \ of land \ntenure. \n \nThe majority of cultivated land in Sudan is rain-fed.\
    \ It constitutes 80% of the Sudanese \nagriculture comparing to about 86% in mid\
    \ 1980s. Rainfed agriculture is the prime source of \nfood grains for domestic\
    \ use. It contributes more than one-half of the aggregate agricultural \nproduction\
    \ and has, therefore, a higher share of the GDP than the irrigated sector. It\
    \ also \nmakes a substantial contribution to exports in the form of livestock,\
    \ gum Arabic, and \noilseeds such as sesame, groundnuts and cotton seeds. The\
    \ traditional and mechanized \nrainfed farming have been also contributed to a\
    \ large extent on the attainment of the \ncountry’s self-sufficiency in the main\
    \ subsistence food crops such as sorghum and millet. \n \nTraditional agriculture\
    \ in Sudan is characterized by shifting cultivation, the use of hand \ntools,\
    \ and lack of pesticides, fertilizers, and high-yielding crop varieties. The majority\
    \ of the \nSudanese population is engaged in traditional cultivation, including\
    \ almost the entire \npopulation of the southern Sudan. Crop yields are highly\
    \ variable to large fluctuations in \nannual rainfall, but are in general low.\
    \ Soil fertility is declining in many areas owing in part \nto reduced fallows\
    \ resulting from population growth and encroaching desertification \n        \
    \                                        \n119 The purpose of this Chapter is\
    \ to show, briefly as possible, the background of the agriculture sector, in \n\
    general and the irrigated sub-sector in particular, in Sudan. The main reason\
    \ for the brief portrayal is the \nuncertainty which shape the statistics about\
    \ Sudan e.g., most of these are either out-of-date or estimated. \n \n107 \n(WHITTINGTON\

    \ mechanized rainfed agriculture covers about 48% of the \ncultivated rain-fed\
    \ areas but productivity-wise it contributes much more. This percentage \nwas\
    \ 55 before two decades (SALIH and KHADAM 1976:104). The primary objective of\
    \ \nmechanization was to expand sorghum production initially to make the Sudan\
    \ self-sufficient \nbut later to produce an exportable surplus to cover the costs\
    \ of wheat imports. However, it is \nmaking a substantial contribution to the\
    \ economy, contributing about 50% of the country’s \nsorghum production120 and\
    \ 25% of its sesame.  \n \n Mechanization cultivation has witnessed success during\
    \ the period 1945-1984 (DAVIES \n1991a:312). It began in 1945 on an area of 12\
    \ 000 feddans on the clay plains at \nGhadambaliya near Gedarf (Fig. 4.1). This\
    \ site provided suitable land and was accessible to \nthe Port Sudan-Sennar railway,\
    \ which allowed the assembling of inputs and the marketing of \nthe crop. In 1957\
    \ development between the Niles started at Dali and Mazmoum. By 1960 \nmore than\
    \ one million feddans were demarcated mainly in private enterprise farms of 1000-\n\
    1500 feddans, under government supervision. Expansion of the system to new areas\
    \ in \nwestern Sudan, an area suffering constant food supply crises began in 1968\
    \ in the Habila \narea of Southern Kordofan. By 1981 the mechanized area topped\
    \ 6 million feddans. The \n1984/85 famine encouraged further expansion to over\
    \ 9 million feddans, but due to poor \nresults the figure for 1988 had fallen\
    \ back to 5.7 million feddans. \n \n                                         \
    \       \n120 In 1987/8, the ‘estimated’ total sorghum production for the Sudan\
    \ was 1 379 000 tonnes, of which 62 % \ncame from mechanized farms (DAVIES 1991a:314).\
    \ \n \n108 \n \nFig. 4.1 Central Sudan: Development of Mechanized Agriculture\
    \ \nSource: Davis 1991a:313  \n \nA serious disadvantage of cultivation in these\
    \ parts of the country however is the marked \nuncertainty of production associated\
    \ with unreliability, timing and localization of rainfall. \nSince the 1982/83\
    \ season, drought conditions built up in the Sudan as elsewhere in the Sahel \n\
    culminating in 1984/85, causing one of the most serious production shortfalls\
    \ and famines in \nSudanese history where about 20% of the population were classified\
    \ as ‘drought affected’ in \nthat year121. The shortage of rainfall was not the\
    \ sole factor responsible for the deterioration \nof this important sector. In\
    \ addition, this sector has been criticized severely (DAVIES \n1991a:315) in that\
    \ it has led to much needles destruction of the vegetation and to a new form \n\
    of bush fallowing, or land rotation, on a massive and disorganized scale, with\
    \ land cultivated \nto exhaustion and then abandoned. After the first flush of\
    \ new land fertility has been \ndissipated, yield per feddan have tended to decline\
    \ gradually. A limited number of absentee \nlessees have dominated this sector122.\
    \ By 1985, some 40 % of the cropped rain-fed had \nfallen into the hands of some\
    \ 4000 investors. \n \nThe Strategy for Development of Rain-fed Agriculture, declared\
    \ by the government in 1986, \nemphasizes the potential of the rain-fed sector\
    \ and describes the objectives of a strategy for \nits improvement and the basic\
    \ conditions for success. Unfortunately, this ambitious strategy \nhas not been\
    \ implemented. For these reasons, the role of irrigation in the future development\
    \ \nof the Sudanese agriculture becomes more important. \n \nIrrigated agriculture\
    \ for the production of cash and food crops is historically essential. The \n\
    permanent irrigated schemes total areas is about 4 million feddans (1.7 million\
    \ ha.) (USBR \n1986:9). The total irrigated area has risen continually since the\
    \ turn of the century - 1920: 40 \n000 feddans; 1935: 300 000 feddans, 1955: 1\
    \ 400 000 feddans.; 1965: 2 800 000 feddans; \n1975: 4 048 000 feddans (WHITTINGTON\
    \ and HAYNES 1985:132). Virtually all of the \nirrigated land is within the central\
    \ plain along the Nile River and its tributaries: \nGezira/Managil, New Halfa,\
    \ Rahad, Blue Nile, White Nile, El-Suki, and others (Fig. 4.2). \n           \
    \                                     \n121 The International Conference on water\
    \ resources needs and planning in drought prone areas, held in \nKhartoum 1986,\
    \ discussed and recommended issues and steps to ovecome the related problems of\
    \ such \nphenomenon and water management problems as such (ABDEL-MAGID et al.\
    \ (eds.) 1986).  \n122 A similar trend will be registered in New Halfa Scheme\
    \ (Chapter 6), in particulare between the Nubian \ntenants.   \n \n \n109 \nGezira-Managel,\

    \ 1992 \n \nAlthough several other crops are grown, cotton still plays a major\
    \ role, and is important to \nthe country as an earner of foreign exchange. It\
    \ constitutes 44% of the exports. The irrigated \nsubsector produces almost all\
    \ of the Nation’s cotton, a substantial amount of oilseeds and \nfood grains (wheat,\
    \ sorghum, groundnuts), vegetables and sugar. Cotton, sorghum, \nvegetables and\
    \ most of groundnuts crops are manually harvested, but wheat is mechanically \n\
    harvested. The areas devoted to the various crops vary widely from year to year\
    \ and from \nscheme to scheme owing to several factors. The most noticeable is\
    \ the fluctuations in the \narea of cotton (specially the long-staple) which has\
    \ constituted 7-8% of the irrigated area in \nthe first half of seventies (KHALIL\
    \ 1985:278). The area devoted to cotton at the beginning \n1970s was lightly over\
    \ one million feddans fell to 836 000 feddans in the season 1980/81 \nand then\
    \ reached a peak of 878 068 feddans in the season 1983/84. The provisional figure\
    \ \nfor 1990 to 1991 was only 427 276 feddans. On the other side, the area sown\
    \ to wheat in \n1984/85 fell to 40 239 feddans from between 200 000 and 300 000\
    \ feddans previously, and \nwas provisionally reported to have been 887 677 feddans\
    \ in 1990/91. Sorghum has similarly \nfluctuated between a high of almost one\
    \ million feddans in 1985/86 with a decline \nthereafter, and a return to 859\
    \ 452 feddans in 1990/91 (Ministry of Irrigation 1992). \n \n Cotton yields declined\
    \ dramatically over the last two decades, largely because of the poor \nmanagement\
    \ and pricing policies. The yields of medium-staple and long-stable have varied\
    \ \nfrom about 4 kantar/feddans to 5.5 kantar/feddans over the past decade. The\
    \ yield of the \nextra long-staple variety, appeared to have improved from about\
    \ 3.3 kantar/feddans123 in the \nearly 1980s but has fallen back again more recently.\
    \ Additionally, the area sown to this \nvariety has decreased to about half that\
    \ at the beginning of the decade. According to the \nAgricultural Research Corporation\
    \ (ARC), it considered that, with proper water control, \nmedium-, and long-staple\
    \ varieties should achieve 6 to 7 kantar/feddans (the former can \nachieve 18\
    \ kantar/feddans under optimum conditions) and that the extra long-staple variety,\
    \ \nalthough rather unpredictable, should yield about 5 kantar/feddans (Ministry\
    \ of Irrigation \n1992). This decline in cotton yields wreaked havoc with Sudan’s\
    \ economic development \nplans. \n \n \n \n                                  \
    \              \n123 Kantar = 141.5 kg. \n \n111 \nAs the Ministry of Agriculture\
    \ responsible for the Agricultural Corporations, the Ministry is \nrequired to\
    \ draw up the overall cropping program for each year. This program is finalized\
    \ in \nconsultation with the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) to ensure that the crop\
    \ water requirements \nare capable of being fulfilled, taking into account the\
    \ water expected to be available from the \nNile and the constructions of the\
    \ canals systems, pump stations, etc in actual conditions in \nwhich they exist.\
    \ It is one of the basis of MOI’s undertaking to provide the required water \n\
    that the programs of the various Agricultural Corporations are approved by the\
    \ Ministry of \nAgriculture (MINISTRY of IRRIGATION 1992, vol. 1 of 4:A26). \n\
    \ \nIt is important here to review some of the problems encountered by irrigation\
    \ practices in \nSudan during two decades as concluded in the Water Resources\
    \ Study of 1976 (SALIH and \nKHADAM 1976:126-8): \n \nI. \nProblems at storage\
    \ conveying system \na. Losses due to evaporation (evapotranspiration, seepage,\
    \ breakage and weeds both in \nreservoirs and canals. \nb. Scouring and erosion\
    \ problems downstream of dam (example: Kashm El Girba dam). \nc. Silting problems\
    \ at reservoirs and canals (example: Kashm El Girba Dam). \nd. Night storage versus\
    \ continuos flow in minor canals. \ne. Accuracy in water measurements. \nf. Working\
    \ out an efficient system of coordination \n \nI. \nProblems at the field. Work\
    \ in this side should generally concentrate in improving \nthe application efficiency.\
    \ In addition to the need of cooperation between different \ninstitutions, researches\
    \ should concentrates on the following: \na. Reduction of losses in farm distributors\
    \ and subdistributors (i.e. through lining, use of \npipe, etc.). \nb. Reduction\
    \ of field application losses (through wider appreciation of the physical \ncharacteristics\
    \ of the soils, etc.). \nc. Timing and depth of application (i.e. time of starting\
    \ and ending the irrigation period, \ninterval between irrigation, etc.). \nd.\
    \ Uniformity of application (lack of uniform distribution of water on the field).\
    \ \ne. Proper drainage and conversation of excess water. \nf. Introduction of\
    \ new methods of irrigation or improvement of present methods  \n  \n4.2  Irrigation\
    \ Schemes in the Context of the Sudanese Agriculture Development \n \nThe irrigation\
    \ schemes are derived historically from the initiation of the Gezira Scheme in\
    \ \nthe 1920s, to produce cotton. The scheme began in 1926 following pilot developments\
    \ from \n1911 at Tayiba and later Barakat on the Blue Nile, these in turn being\
    \ based on the Zeidab \nScheme. Gezira Scheme, at the early stage, was operated\
    \ on a tripartite basis: (a) the \ncolonial Sudanese Government making land available\
    \ for the scheme, constructing a dam on \nthe Blue Nile at Sennar, and undertaking\
    \ the major canalization; (b) the Sudan Plantations \nSyndicate (SPS), a London-based\
    \ company, managing the scheme; and (c) individual tenant \nfarmers taking responsibility\
    \ for the cultivation of crops under the direction of the company. \nThe Sudan\
    \ Plantation Syndicate’s concession expired in 1950 and its functions were taken\
    \ \nover by the Sudan Gezira Board (SIMPSON 1991:105). \n \n \n \n \n112 \nThe\
    \ government under the 1921 Gezira Land Ordinance entered into an agreement with\
    \ \nthe owners to lease the land for 40 years at a rental of 10 piasters per year,\
    \ representing the \nannual value of non-irrigated land. Land on lease could only\
    \ be sold or mortgaged to the \ngovernment and, as a result, most of the land\
    \ has come, finally, into government ownership. \nA part from direct compensation\
    \ for loss of their land, owners were given the first right to \ntenancies in\
    \ the scheme with a maximum of two standard tenancies (each of 30 feddans \ngross,\
    \ of which 20 were cropped). The tenancies consisted of several separate 10-feddans\
    \ \nplots (howashas) in a 90-feddans field (number) which formed the basic unit\
    \ for irrigation. \nEach number was planted to a single crop within a six- or\
    \ an eight-year rotation, a system \nwhich continues to the present. \n \nTenants\
    \ agree to grow a fixed area of cotton and other crops as laid down by management.\
    \ \nCotton and wheat are marketed by the scheme management and profits after the\
    \ sale of \ncrops are divided three ways between the Sudanese Government, scheme\
    \ management, and \ntenant. The tenant can dispose of other crops himself. Since\
    \ 1981, the share arrangement has \nbeen changed from what was known as a ‘joint\
    \ account’ system to an ‘individual account’ \nsystem, the later relating the\
    \ tenant’s rewards more closely to his input. \n \nThe principles of Gezira, that\
    \ have been introduced to the New Halfa and Rahad Schemes \nwere subject of criticism\
    \ (DAVIES 1991b:344-5). The first of the main criticism of the \nGezira replication\
    \ policy was the lack of freedom afforded to the tenants who, in practice, \n\
    were little more than agriculture labors. The second was the tendency for tenants\
    \ to find off-\nscheme jobs in towns or elsewhere, arranging for someone else\
    \ to cultivate the tenancy on \nsome sort of crop-sharing – what is refereed to\
    \ as the development of ‘landlordism’. In \naddition, problems escalated in the\
    \ Gezira and the other schemes because the system of \nmanagement did not evolve\
    \ as the situation changed.  \n     \nThe technical characteristics of the Sudanese\
    \ irrigation schemes as defined in the \nNational Irrigation Rehabilitation Program\
    \ of Ministry of Irrigation (1992:F9-11) are as \nfollows: \n \n- \nthey were\
    \ designed using criteria developed in the 1930s for Gezira, intended for \ndaytime-only\
    \ irrigation on deep vertisoils; \n- \nthey are water-limited (the area irrigated\
    \ is limited by the availability of water, not land); \n- \nthey have unlined\
    \ canals with few escape structures, and the escapes that do exist are on \nprimary\
    \ canals only and have capacities intended only to deal with local rainfall; \n\
    - \nthe larger canals were designed for continuous flow using the lacey-Matthews\
    \ regime \nequations, while the secondaries (Minors) are wide and shallow and\
    \ inevitably have less \nthan regime slope: these were originally intended for\
    \ night storage to enable irrigation to \nbe done in daylight only, but the same\
    \ cross-section is often used without that intention; \n- \nthe outlets from the\
    \ Minors, i.e., the tertiary head regulators called FOPs, were fitted \nwith a\
    \ type of disc gate which is not robust: it is easily damaged or removed; \n-\
    \ \nthe schemes receive significant quantities of sediment at their headworks,\
    \ particularly in \nJuly and August: the land slops are such that about 70% of\
    \ this sediment is deposited in \nthe canals and some passes to the field, where\
    \ it is not uniformly distributed124; \n                                     \
    \           \n124 Such characteristic is very important for the discussions of\
    \ land levelling (Chapter 6.2.1.2) and irrigation \nmethod (chp. 6.3.4).  \n \n\
    113 \n- \nthey originally had a disciplined but not very accurate system of estimating\
    \ crop water \nrequirements, with an indenting procedure to arrange delivery of\
    \ the requested quantities \nof water; and \n- \nthe earlier schemes once had\
    \ telephone systems for communication between the \noperators over large distances,\
    \ but this is generally lacking now (except Gezira-Managil \nwhere a new radio\
    \ telephone system works well). \n \nThese characteristics were in general appropriate\
    \ for the Gezira conditions of the 1930s. \nNowadays, concluded the final report\
    \ of the Irrigation Rehabilitation Program, conditions \nhave changed in several\
    \ ways, such as: \n \n- \nthe Blue Nile carries much more sediment (because of\
    \ increased erosion in Ethiopia), \nand further increases are likely in the future;\
    \ \n- \nthe cropping is more intensive and the crop calendar has changed; \n-\
    \ \nweed infestation is worse, and even the restoration of 1935 conditions in\
    \ other aspects \nwould not be bring the schemes back to the 1935 weed conditions;\
    \ \n- \nsome fields are higher than they were when the scheme was designed. \n\
    \ \nIn addition to the above, the capacity of the MOI and agricultural corporations\
    \ to maintain \nor improve the physical infrastructure of most schemes, have deteriorated.\
    \ The \nconsequences of all these facts is that the available water distributed\
    \ between fields and \nfrom weak to weak, even when total volumes delivered to\
    \ large blocks over longer time \nperiods are reasonably appropriate. The final\
    \ consequence is reduced agricultural \nproduction. \n \nThe expansion of irrigation\
    \ has failed to bring about the anticipated improvement in the \nSudanese economy\
    \ and can be described, then, as ‘development trap’, as it hindered the \nnecessary\
    \ structural change in the economy.   \n \n4.3  Limitations of the Irrigated Agricultural\
    \ in the Future  \n \nThe development of the agricultural sector in the future\
    \ is dependent on two factors that are \n(outside) the control namely the availability\
    \ of foreign currency within Sudan as a whole \nand the availability of water.\
    \ \n \n4.3.1  Performance of the National Economy \n \n The agricultural sector\
    \ is suffering from the repercussions of the most sever economic crisis \nsince\
    \ Independence (1956). This economic crisis which has been affecting the Sudan\
    \ since \n1977/8 is, argued WOLMUTH (1991:436), the result of unfavorable world\
    \ market trends, \nover-ambitious development programs in the 1970s and a failure\
    \ of policy reform at the \nmacro-and sectoral-levels in the 1980s. However, causes\
    \ and evidences according to this \ndiagnosis are: “the worsening balance of payments\
    \ situation, the increasing indebtedness, \nthe failure to come to terms with\
    \ the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the banks and \nother donors, the decrease\
    \ of official transfers from Sudanese workers abroad, the \ndecreasing level of\
    \ foreign aid, the increasing pressure on the Sudanese pound (£s),and the \ncapital\
    \ flight go parallel with unfavorable cotton marketing conditions and unstable\
    \ internal \npolitical developments”. \n \n \n114 \nThe other graph which is showing\
    \ upward trends beside population (at abut 2.8 % annually \noverall), is inflation.\
    \ It is very difficult to find the actually inflation rates in the Sudan. More\
    \ \ndifficult, however, is to depend on the official rates declared sometimes\
    \ from the \ngovernment. That is why, we have to depend instead on the exchange\
    \ rate as an indicator for \nthe performance of the national economy. \n \nThe\
    \ pressure on the Sudanese pound since 1977/78 has affected, first of all, the\
    \ agricultural \nsector. Due to the several devaluations after this date Sudan\
    \ was not able to secure the \nnecessary inputs for the agricultural sector. For\
    \ example, the annual increase in the price of \nfertilizers, due to the devaluation,\
    \ in the years 1978, 1979, and 1980 was 57%, 43%, and \n64% respectively. Insecticides\
    \ increased also during the same period 14%, 72%, and 84% \n(KHALIL 1985:422).\
    \ This trend has continued also, more sharply, during the 1980s and the \n1990s.\
    \ For example, the official exchange rate until the end of October 1988 was £S\
    \ 4.5 = \nUS. $ 1.0, decreased after three months 100% (in January 1989: £S 9\
    \ = US. $1.0). In \nFebruary 1992, the official exchange rate was set at £S 90\
    \ = US. $ 1.0, twenty times the \n1988 level (MINISTRY OF IRRIGATION 1992). The\
    \ negative consequences of these facts \non the agricultural production will be\
    \ discussed in chapter 6. \n \nAmong the discussion of the main problems of Sudan,\
    \ KASPAR and MOLL (1986:96) \nargued that the low level of infrastructural and\
    \ industrial development as well as the \nlack of national or private capital\
    \ resources complicate relief efforts and attempts to \ndistribute population\
    \ and promote economic development. Of note here is the special role of \ninfrastructure\
    \ in this context. It is known that poor countries usually suffer from the lack\
    \ of \ninfrastructure. At an extreme is the remarkable fact, even by the appalling\
    \ standards of the \nworst of poor countries, that the Sudan, with such population\
    \ size and area, even now has \nonly about 3000 miles of roads, 2500 miles of\
    \ which are gravel or unpaved  tracks. It is not \ndifficult to imagine, argued\
    \ DASGUPTA (1993:147), the role this paucity has played in the \nincidence of\
    \ famines there. \n  \n4.3.2  Demand-Supply Water Gap \n \nThe total amount of\
    \ Nile water allocated to the Sudan corresponding to the 1959 Nile \nWater Agreement\
    \ between Sudan and Egypt is 18.5 billion m³ (whereas Egypt is using \n55.5 billion\
    \ m³) of which over 90% is utilized in agriculture125. This allocation was based\
    \ on \nan assumed annual flow at Aswan of 84 billion m³. After Sudan withdraws\
    \ 18.5 billion m³ \nas measured at Aswan, the remaining 65.5 billion m³ enters\
    \ the Aswan High Dam reservoir. \nEvaporation and seepage losses are assumed to\
    \ average 10 billion m³ and Egypt is left with \nits annual allocation of 55.5\
    \ billion m³.126  \n                                                \n125 The\
    \ 1959 Nile Water Agreement established a more equitable distribution of water\
    \ between Egypt and \nSudan. The 1929 Agreement allocated only 4 billion m³ to\
    \ Sudan compared to 48 billion m³ to egypt, and \nreserved the entire ‘timely’\
    \ flow for Egypt, obliging Sudan to irrigate the Gezira scheme only during the\
    \ \nwinter months.  \n126 WHITTINGTON and HAYNES 1985 commenting on the sharing\
    \ basis by saying: “Actually, the mean flow \nat Aswan over the last century is\
    \ over 90 billion m³, not the 84 assumed in the 1959 agreement. The lower \nestimate\
    \ is clearly favourable to Egypt because the difference flows into the Aswan High\
    \ Dam reservoir for \nthe sole use. On the other hand, annual evaporation and\
    \ seepage losses are closer to 14 billion m³ rather \nthan the 10 billion m³ originally\
    \ anticipated (p. 136). In view of the variations in the annual flow of the \n\
    Nile, the lenght of time required to fill the new high dam reservoir and the knowledge\
    \ that Sudan would not \nneed the whole of its water allocation immediately, an\
    \ arrangement was made whereby Egypt could borrow \nup to 1.5 billion m³ a year\
    \ until 1977 and then pay back the excess drawings over the following ten years\
    \ \n \n115 \nThis share is not adequate to meet the water demand of the irrigation\
    \ development stipulated \nin the prospective short- and medium-term plans for\
    \ the Sudan. The total amount of Nile \nwater suffices only for the irrigation\
    \  of some 1.6-1.8 million crop ha. (3.8-4.3 million \nfeddans) per year. Even\
    \ if additional supplies become available, through further \ndevelopment particularly\
    \ in the south region, and taking into consideration flood irrigation \npossibilities\
    \ in the Gash and Toker deltas, the yearly irrigated area will not exceed 2.4\
    \ \nmillion ha. (5.7 million feddans), and this target can be achieved only by\
    \ an efficient water-\nuse. \n \nThe chairing of the Nile waters has long been\
    \ a problem between Sudan and Egypt, for \nwhile Egypt is totally dependent on\
    \ the Nile, much of the Sudanese major schemes (which \nare currently being overhauled\
    \ with the intention of expanded production) are based upon it. \nAs the water\
    \ of the Nile are finite, it appears unavoidable that at some stage Sudan and\
    \ \nEgypt will between them seek to use more water from the Nile than the river\
    \ contains. \nHerein lies, as many experts argued a major development dilemma.\
    \ That is why, the water \ndemand forecasts for both countries treat water as\
    \ a requirement which must be supplied \nirrespective to its costs. \n \nIn addition\
    \ to the Sudan-Egyptian problem, an additional complication may arise if, as \n\
    suggested, Ethiopia endeavors to make greater use of the water of the Blue Nile127.\
    \ \nAccording to the above, the inescapable conclusion is that Sudan is rapidly\
    \ approaching the \npoint where all future agricultural projects will be operated.\
    \ If at all, at the margin of \navailable water supply. This margin will be determined\
    \ by the implementation of the upper \nNile projects, including perhaps those\
    \ in Ethiopia in the supply side. In turns, demand will \nbe function on the pace\
    \ and extent of new irrigation schemes in Sudan, including crop \nchosen, and\
    \ the development of the non-agricultural use of water in industry and household.\
    \ \n \nSudan is currently using 15-16 billion m³. Almost (all of this) is for\
    \ irrigation. Irrigation \nschemes are planned which would use an additional 10\
    \ billion m³ - all of the new supplies \nwhich will be available from the upper\
    \ Nile projects. Both of the upper Nile projects and \nirrigation schemes require\
    \ financing128. Forecasting water supplies and demands is thus \nessentially an\
    \ exercise in forecasting Sudan’s macroeconomics and political conditions, and\
    \ \nthe priority these water development projects will receive in Sudan’s extremely\
    \ limited \ncapital investment program. On the light of these facts, argued WATERBURY\
    \ (1982) that, \ngiven the current economic morass and other pressing investment\
    \ priorities, in addition to  \n                                             \
    \                                                                            \
    \                        \n(DAVIS 1991b:342). Anyway, Egypt feel she has dealt\
    \ with the issue of nile water allocation honourably \nsince, untile the twentieth\
    \ century, she was the only state in the basin to rely upon irrigated agriculture.\
    \ \n127 The four major hydroelectric projects planned by Ethiopea, however, are\
    \ one the Blue Nile between Lake \nTana and the Sudanese border. Together these\
    \ four dams have an initial actine storage capacity of about 51 \nbillion cubic\
    \ meters and an estimated annual electricity generation of over 25 billion kwh,\
    \ about three times \nthe actual production of the Aswan High Dam. The annual\
    \ mean flow of the Blue Nile at the Sudanese-\nEthiopean border is about 50 billion\
    \ cubic meters, so that the combined active storage is approximately \nequal to\
    \ the mean annual flow. The results of this have indicated, however, that the\
    \ objectives of Ethiopian \nhydropower production and Sudanese and Egyptian agricultural\
    \ water use are not conflicting \n(WHITTINGTON 1985:3,4). \n128 According to other\
    \ Senario (MUSA 1991), it is estimated that 62% of Sudan’s cultivable area is\
    \ in need of \nirrigation, considering that rainfed cultivation is a resk due\
    \ to high variability of rainfall. To use its \npotintial, Sudan will then need\
    \ anually 23.4 billion cubic metters in addition to its present share in the Nile\
    \ \nwater. \n \n \n116 \nthe political conditions, Sudan will not be able to undertake\
    \ any additional upper Nile \nprojects after ‘Jonglei 1’. Even if the Jonglei\
    \ project is successful in providing the Sudan \nwith a future annual supply of\
    \ 3 or 4 billion m³ of water, it will only delay the day when \nfurther conventional\
    \ agricultural development will be impossible without new water \nresources. The\
    \ way a head will have to be in making better use of existing readily supplies,\
    \ \nincluding reducing evaporation and selecting crop plant species with low water\
    \ requirements \nper unit of yield and improving the irrigation systems (WHITTINGTON\
    \ and HAYNES \n1985:137,39). \n \nIn addition to the economic situation and the\
    \ financing bottlenecks, another hindrance for \nincreasing the supply of water\
    \ in Sudan is the capacity of the reservoirs. For example, \nsiltation is reducing\
    \ the storage capacity of Reseires much more rapidly than originally \nanticipated.\
    \ From the completion of the reservoir in 1964 to 1976, 75 % of the reserved dead\
    \ \nstorage was filled. The accepted solution is to heighten Roseires to 490 m,\
    \ thus adding \napproximately 4 billion cubic meters of storage (WHITTINGTON 1985:12).\
    \ The same \nproblem, as it will coming in the next chapters, prevent Khashm El\
    \ Girba reservoir from \nworking with its full capacity. \n \nFinally, it is to\
    \ note that, not only for crop production, water supplies will be a limiting \n\
    factor for the development of livestock production. Heavy concentration of grazing\
    \ around a \nfew good watering points might lead to overgrazing and erosion, and\
    \ the opening up of new \nareas will depend to a large extent on the availability\
    \ of water. Considering the socio-\neconomic objectives, the Sudan is indeed engaged\
    \ in a battle for more and better water for \nman, livestock and crops. \n   \
    \ \n \n \n117 \n5.  Implementation of The Field Study \n \n5.1  Purpose of the\
    \ Field Study \n \nThe empirical part of this study is implemented in two irrigation\
    \ schemes in East and \nNorth Sudan. The original aim of the field study has been\
    \ to analyze the two \norganizations and their management and, in particular,\
    \ the ways of making such \norganizations more effective and more efficient in\
    \ the water use. The focus has been \nfurther narrowed by concentrating on the\
    \ water users levels i. e. whether there is water \nshortage, wasted water, injustice,\
    \ co-operation or hassle between water users from one \nside and between them\
    \ and the levels at which decisions and actions affecting allocation \nand acquisition\
    \ are taken from the other, and what options are available to tackle the \nexisting\
    \ institutional constraints. To achieve such aims the analyst needs to distinguish\
    \ the \ncoming three layers of rules that, according to TANG/OSTROM (1993:5-6),\
    \ cumulatively \naffect the actions and outcomes achieved in irrigation systems:\
    \ \n \nOperational rules: (allocating water, clearing canals, and monitoring and\
    \ sanctioning the \nactions of irrigators and officials) affect the day-to-day\
    \ decisions made by users and \nsuppliers concerning when, where, and how to withdraw\
    \ water ; what information must be \nexchanged or withheld; and what rewards or\
    \ sanctions will be assigned to different \ncombinations of actions and outcomes.\
    \ \n \nCollective-choice rules: are the rules used by irrigators, their officials,\
    \ or external \nauthorities in making policies- the operational rules- about how\
    \ an irrigation system should \nbe managed. Here is also the level where the policy-making,\
    \ management, and adjudication \nof policy decisions occur. Therefore, they affect\
    \ operational choices; a change in ‘policy’ \nimplies a change in operational\
    \ rules.  \n \nConstitutional-choice rules: (formulation, governance, adjudication,\
    \ and modification of \nconstitutional decisions) results through their effect\
    \ on : 1) who is eligible to participate in \nthe system and (2) what specific\
    \ rules will be used to craft the set of collective-choice rules  \n129. \n \n\
    \                                                             \n129 UPHOFF (1991:18-9)\
    \ has also referred to three main points of reference which constitute the basis\
    \ of \nimproving the performance of irrigation system : (1) Irrigation system\
    \ (physical possibilities and the \nhuman relationships associated with it), (2)\
    \ the objectives of irrigation management (whose values \ndominate and whether\
    \ there is a conflict), and (3) the context of irrigation Organisation which determines\
    \ \nthe capacity for irrigation management. In contrast, the GTZ’s orientation\
    \ framework regarding irrigation \nsystems (HUPPERT/WALKER 1988) has developed\
    \ two packages of factors that exercise a considerable \ninfluence on the management\
    \ of organization and control of irrigation systems. The first package of these\
    \ \nfactors is concerning with „status of irrigation system“ and include therefore:\
    \ area, number of users, \nmanagement levels of the organization, production aims,\
    \ flexibility and divisibility of technology. \nSecondly, the package of factors\
    \ of situation variables, „management uncertainty“, contains the elements \nof\
    \ irrigation tradition, complexity and dynamic of the environment, availability\
    \ of resources, goal conflicts \n(MANIG 1989:17). Other package that should be\
    \ stressed, on its own, is concerning with the farmers \n(tenant farmers as in\
    \ the two cases of this study)  as water users and beneficiaries of the irrigation.\
    \ To \nthis package belongs factors such as the role of water users (as individuals\
    \ and organization) in water \ndistribution and water control, their way of communication\
    \ with field staff, their attitude towards scheme \nmanagement and polices. \n\
    \ \n118 \nFor a better understanding of the real causes of the poor or high irrigation\
    \ agency \nperformance, the analyst needs also to collect a considerable amount\
    \ of information about \nsome variable or aspects that MORIS/COPESTAKE (1993)\
    \ calls as ‘neglected’ or \n‘invisible’ variables. These variables, that are usually\
    \ omitted from farm-level field \nsurveys, are not only about farmers, villagers\
    \ and the environment but also about their own \nand other institutions operating\
    \ in the communities being served (p.25). They are founded \nat the two levels;\
    \ the agency level and the community level (p.25-34): \n \n− the agency level\
    \ consist of two clusters of concern. One relate to questions about \nother agencies\
    \ operating in the same territory; their coverage, reliability, staff \nmorale,\
    \ past relations with farmers, and specialties organizational variable. The \n\
    other task variables relate to questions concerning the operations of a particular\
    \ \nagency, its internal workings and ongoing performance e.g., are staff sufficiently\
    \ \nmotivated? do they feel their effort are seen and appreciated? and is the\
    \ program \nreaching all segments of the local community?  \n \n− The second level\
    \ - community level - concern with the key community traits which \nrural planners\
    \ may need to know about e.g., main sources of cash income, previous \ndevelopment\
    \ efforts, infrastructure, community leadership traits, degree of \ninequality\
    \ and factionalism, degree of corruption and security situation.  \n \nThese variables\
    \ and factors, in addition to those of the water users’ level, will be in-depth\
    \ \ndiscussed in this part of the study. According to the above, and considering\
    \ the \ncharacteristics of irrigation systems and the different dimensions of\
    \ their organizations and \nmanagement that have been discussed in the first two\
    \ chapters, the field study in the two \nschemes; New Halfa Scheme, and Gendettu\
    \ Scheme (elucidated in detail in the next \nsections) has concentrated upon:\
    \ \n \n• \nwhat is happening at the operational level: characteristics and attributes\
    \ of the \nexisting management of irrigation systems; \n• \ndiscussing and analyzing\
    \ the central and universal issue in irrigation systems: \nwater distribution/allocation\
    \ between farmers sharing a common watercourse, \nas defined by CHAMBERS (1980:33)\
    \ “who get what, when, and where“; \n• \nwhether the position of the farmers’\
    \ fields along the particular water course \n(head-middle-tail) is a critical\
    \ factor in determining water control; \n• \nbehavior of water users in different\
    \ schemes as to size, the distribution of tasks, \nand the ownership; \n• \nthe\
    \ relationship between methods of land use and water use;  \n• \nthe main distinguishing\
    \ features of the institutional form which carry out the \nmanagement functions\
    \ in different forms of schemes; \n \n119 \n• \narticulation and linkages between\
    \ the water users and the system authorities; the \ncommunication and information\
    \ canals that are used and respected by the \ninformation society; \n• \nthe degree\
    \ of identity between the current practice in water application at field \nlevel\
    \ and the official rules; \n• \nthe relationship between the water users, and\
    \ the project, with the other \norganizations related to agriculture; \n• \nthe\
    \ human dimension in irrigation system management (the socio-cultural \nfactors,\
    \ to what extent involvement in day-to-day system operation is practiced, \nand\
    \ participation of women); \n• \n the collective-choice entity in both schemes\
    \ (the different interest groups, \nwhose values dominate; diversity and conflict,\
    \ and arbitration); \n• \nto what extent influence the political conditions an\
    \ irrigation system; try to \nanalyze the effect of the despotism/tyranny or absence\
    \ of democracy upon \norganization structure; \n• \nthe technological situation\
    \ at the terminal units and the performance of water \nuse; which alternatives\
    \ are needed: modern irrigation techniques or \nimprovement of existing methods?;\
    \  \n• \nthe economic dimensions:, productivity of each crop, variation in yield\
    \ with \nrespect to the yield/water delivery relationship, and the relationship\
    \ between \nefficiency of water use and productivity; \n• \ncould water pricing\
    \ policies be used to encourage efficient water use? and \n• \nwhich role play\
    \ the supporting institutions (research extension, supply of farm \ninputs, credit,\
    \ marketing, and health institutions) in achieving the efficiency of \nwater use.\
    \ \n \nThe study is intended, therefore, to be a contribution in understanding,\
    \ from close up, the \nmanagerial and organizational factors that hinder the improvement\
    \ of irrigation water \nutilization, and trying, in the same time, to highlight\
    \ some aspects that may be help in \nestablishing organizational and managerial\
    \ ethics in the irrigated sector130. It is also one of \nits aims to examine the\
    \ related three main objectives of irrigation management- e.g. (1) \nefficiency\
    \ of water use, (2) productivity of irrigated agriculture, and (3) profitability\
    \ of \nirrigated farming- and to find to what extents are they dependent from\
    \ each other.  \n \n                                                         \
    \    \n130 DAHAL (1993:66) used the concept of managerial ethics as a target for\
    \ the leading sector in Nepal \n(forestry sector)  which consider, he argues,\
    \ very important for the development of the other sectors in the \ncountry.  \
    \ \n129 The various levels in a system, from field to headworks, are the farm\
    \ level (the outlet „field channel“ \nlevel), the distributary (Minor canal in\
    \ this case), and the main canal. This permits assessment of \ndifferences in\
    \ management within systems. \n \n120 \nThe focus will be on current water management\
    \ on the tertiary level, i.e., the penultimate \nstage in the field water distribution\
    \ system. That means from the field water-course (Abu \nXX) through the lateral\
    \ water-course (Abu VI) to the crop field- the geographic unit for the \nstudy131\
    \ (see the technical context in this Chapter: 5.4.4). The individual tenant is\
    \ the most \nimportant unit of analysis. Here, we stress the Tenant Farmers’ role\
    \ as water users i.e., \nwater and how they deal with; distribute between them,\
    \ and factors that influence these \naspects. \n \n5.2.  Study Areas \n \nTwo\
    \ schemes were chosen as case studies during 1992-93 season. The first is large-scale,\
    \ \nAgency-Managed system (settlement scheme) in the eastern region called New\
    \ Halfa \n(Khashm El Girba) Scheme. The second that can be referred to as Medium-scale132,\
    \ \nAgency-Managed system, lies in the governorate of Shendi, in north Sudan,\
    \ called \nGendettu (Fig. 5.1). \n \nFig. 5.1 Study Locations: New Halfa and Shendi\
    \ \n \nSource:O'KEEFE/WISNER 1977:134 \n \n                                  \
    \                           \n  \n132 Projects greater than 2000 ha and/or more\
    \ than 500 farm units are usually considered, according to \nSAGARDOY et al. (1986),\
    \ as large projects. \n \n \n121 \n5.2.1  New Halfa Irrigation Scheme \n \nThe\
    \ New Halfa Scheme is one of the largest and most important agricultural schemes\
    \ in \nSudan. The Scheme is located on the Atbara tributary in the eastern region133\
    \ of the Sudan, \nabout 400 km east of Khartoum and about 80 km from Kassala,\
    \ with estimated area about \n341 340 sq. Km (Fig 5.2). The 1987 population estimated\
    \ for the region is 3 497 000 \nincluding the Ethiopian (Eritrean) refugees who\
    \ were accounted for about 24% of this \npopulation134. In addition, many of the\
    \ agricultural labors are not native to the area, but \ninclude population from\
    \ West Sudan, West Africa, and some from Southern Sudan. About \n86% of the population\
    \ occupation in agriculture (irrigated and rainfed). The total arable \nland of\
    \ the region amount to about 21.2 million Feddan of which only 11 million feddan\
    \ are \nutilize. \n \nFig. 5.2 Sudan: Regions. \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ The Regionalization Act of 1981 divided North Sudan into five Regions (Northern,\
    \ Eastern, Central, \nKordofan and Darfur) in addition to Khartoum and the South\
    \ which enjoyed special status and \nadministrative structures. The south was\
    \ sub-divided in 1983 (WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON, 1985:21).  \n134 The population of\
    \ Atbara River Province according to the food subsidiary Cards is estimated in\
    \ 1991 at \n470 000. The  Province consists of three Councils: New Halfa rural\
    \ Council, Khashm El Girba rural \nCouncil, and Atbara River rural Council. \n\
    \ \n \n122 \nThe scheme has two main types of tenants; the Nubians, originated\
    \ in Wadi Halfa, will be \nreferred to in the study as Halfawyeen, and the local\
    \ tenants; the settled pastoral nomads \nfrom the Butana, which referred to in\
    \ the literature as Nomads or nomadic tenants whereas \nthe people in Sudan like\
    \ to call them Arab El Butana (Arabs of the Butana). The last name \nwill be used\
    \ frequently in this study. A new urban area, New Halfa, is being developed as\
    \ a \ncentral town with administration schools, a hospital, a large area of freehold\
    \ shops, cotton \nginning factory, cinema and transport connections to the rest\
    \ of the country \n(THORNTON/WYNN, 1987:214). \n \nThe scheme was initiated in\
    \ March 1964 and officially inaugurated on July 1967 under the \nname Khashm El\
    \ Girba Scheme, which has been changed through the Presidential \nEstablishment\
    \ Order of January 25th, 1980 to the New Halfa Agricultural Corporation \n(NHAC).\
    \ The scheme was initiated for the settlement of the local pastoral nomads \n\
    (distributed in approximately 51 villages) and re-settlement of the nubians135\
    \ (55 000 \nimmigrant distributed in 26 villages)136 in the Butana area137. At\
    \ the same time, the \nscheme was aimed at securing the subsistence and the individual\
    \ income for the tenants. \nLater on, since the beginning of 1980s, a national\
    \ aim was add, namely more contribution \nto the Sudan’s export earnings138. \n\
    \ \nNew Halfa Scheme, the only significant existing irrigation on the Atbara River,\
    \ covered an \narea of about half a million feddan, roughly 80 km north-south\
    \ and 30 km wide. It was \noriginally intended to serve 400 000 feddan under irrigation,\
    \ including 43 000 feddan set \naside for the cultivation of sugar by a parastatal\
    \ corporation and 24 000 feddan freehold \nland owned by Halfawyeen (SAEED, 1978).\
    \ Because of heavy siltation of Khashm El \nGirba Reservoir (storage capacity\
    \ 1.3 milliard cubic meters), on which it relies for its water \nsupply, the scheme\
    \ has never been developed to its full capacity (USBR 1986:11). \n \nThe scheme\
    \ was developed in five phases, the first two were for Halfawyeen settlement \n\
    and sugar cultivation and the other three were for settlement of nomads. All tenants\
    \ in the \nscheme (16 000 Arabs and 6 000 Halfawyeen) were provided with fifteen\
    \ feddan of \nleasehold land (6.3 ha.) on which they are to rotate five feddan\
    \ (one Hawasha) of \ngroundnuts, five feddan of cotton „Akala“ and five of wheat\
    \ or sorghum (Section 5.3.3.3). \nMany of the Halfawyeen tenants were given, in\
    \ addition, some freehold land plots as \ncompensation for their inundated lands\
    \ in Wadi Halfa district139. The rotation crop area is \n                    \
    \                                         \n135 Another interpretation for the\
    \ reason of initiation the Scheme was presented by the manager of the \nirrigation\
    \ Department in the Scheme (M.A. HASAN). He asserts that the idea of constructing\
    \ project in \nthis area is not, as many thinks (he argues), a consequence of\
    \ the inundation of the Nubians’ area by the \nfilling of lake Nasser, this was\
    \ only a cause to accelerate its realization. The project was planned since \n\
    1948 from the ministry of irrigation to initiated in the beginning of seventieth.\
    \  \n136 According to AGRAR (1978), the New Halfa Agricultural Production Scheme\
    \ had a population of about \n290 000 people, of which c. 68 000 were Halfawyeen,\
    \ c. 148 000 nomads, c. 50 000 migrant Laborers and \n35 000 inhabitants of New\
    \ Halfa Town (SORBO, 1985:13). \n137 Some 850 kilometer southeast of their original\
    \ home (Wadi Halfa). \n138 It must be taken in consideration, that since the construction\
    \ of the project, Sudan has known four different \npolitical systems i.e., different\
    \ orientations (1964-69, 1969-1985, 1985-89, 1989 till now). That means, the \n\
    policies of government which set for the bureaucracy the objectives of irrigation\

    \ sides of the New Halfa Project see the empirical studies \nundertaken by WYNN\
    \ (1968) THORNTON/WYNN (1987), BLANCKENBURG (1969), SORBO \n(1977,1982, and 1985),\
    \ FAHIM (1980), and PEARSON (1980). \n \n123 \ndivided into 19 Blocks140 grouped\
    \ into 6 administrative Divisions; Debaira, Sasaraib, \nSedaira, Demyat, Reira,\
    \ and Sheik Omer (Section 5.3.5). \n \n5.2.2  Gendettu Scheme \n \nGendettu Scheme\
    \ is located in the Nile Province, just to the south of Shendi town, on the \n\
    eastern bank of the Nile River downstream from Khartoum. The Nile Province form\
    \ \ntogether with the Northern Province the Northern Region of Sudan141. Total\
    \ population of \nthe Northern Region was estimated at 1 083 000 (1983 Census)\
    \ representing 5.3% of \nSudan’s total population of 20 564 000 (WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON,\
    \ 1985:10). Shendi \nDistrict is one of the biggest areas in the Nile Province\
    \ on an area extending of 124 310 km² \nand, administratively, is sub-divided\
    \ down to four local Councils with total population in \nthe year1993 of 192 000142.\
    \ The average annual increase in this District in the period \nbetween 1973/1983\
    \ censuses was above the UN estimate of annual population increase in \nthe whole\
    \ of Sudan of 2.9%. For instance, the average annual increase in Shendi Town \n\
    Council during this period was 4.28 5 and has exceeded 5% during the period 1983/1993.\
    \ \n \nThe population group of Shendi district is dominated by the Arabic original\
    \ groups as \nknown there in the area- Jaalean, Shigea and Ababda tribes- and\
    \ many other marginal \nSudanese sections from other parts of the country. Tow\
    \ factors have contributed to mixing \nthe ethnical colors on the portrait, first,\
    \ the location of military area Headquarters in Shendi \nTown and, second, the\
    \ drought and famine disasters of the 1980s which have forced their \nvictims\
    \ to reach the district seeking for opportunity to live and improve their status.\
    \ Among \nthe Arabic ethnic tribes (Ababda, Hassania, etc.) livestock raising\
    \ and nomadic spatial \nmobility become the most style of life emerging here and\
    \ other to secure the feeding of \ntheir herds143. the estimated number of these\
    \ herds according to the agricultural Survey \nCommission Report (1990) is about\
    \ 60 000 heads (ABD ALLAH, 1992:72). The social \norganization of these tribes\
    \ is flexible and reflect a remarkable adaptation to their natural \nenvironment.\
    \ \n \nGendettu Scheme is one of nine relatively large government irrigation pump\
    \ schemes \nin the Nile Province. These schemes, that are irrigated by Nile water\
    \ tapped by pump \nstations and supplemented by other sources, from north to south,\
    \ are: Bagwa (1917) 3 650 \nfeddan, Fadlab (1909) 3 668 feddan, Zeidab (1907)\
    \ 30 000 feddan (the first scheme in the \nSudan to grow cotton), Aliab (1943)\
    \ 5 375 feddan, Kitiab (1927) 5 775, Kelli (1952) 9 000 \nfeddan, Kabushiya (1986)\
    \ 4 500 feddan, Saiyal (1976) 6 000 feddan, and Gendettu (1917) \n3 500 feddan.\
    \ All of these schemes are managed by regional government agency; The \nNorthern\
    \ Agricultural Production Corporation (NAPC). The main target of these Schemes\
    \ \nare achieving food self-sufficiency and improving the farmers’ income. NAPC\
    \ which \n                                                             \n140 The\
    \ Block area is 1 750 feddan compared with 2 000 feddan in the Gezira-Managel\
    \ Scheme. \n141 The total area of the Northern Region is about 477 074 km²; within\
    \ the region the Nile Province covers an \narea of 120 807 km². \n142 This figure\
    \ according to the records of Shendi Town Council. It includes the population\
    \ of Shendi Rural \nand Town Councils, Kabushia Town Council and Wad Hamid Rural\
    \ Council. Whereas El Matama Town \nand Rural Councils being an independent District.\
    \   \n143 Just like in New Halfa, the rural people in the Nile Province are seen\
    \ as two main groups; the ‘river’ \nSudanese who engage largely in irrigated agriculture\
    \ on or close to the Rivers Nile and Atbara, and the \nnomadic pastoralists of\
    \ the desert and semi-desert areas to the east and west of the Nile \n(WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON,\
    \ 1985:17). \n \n124 \nmanage also five schemes in the Northern Province144, is\
    \ one of ten Corporations, \nresponsible to the Central Ministry of Agriculture,\
    \ that operate the irrigated schemes in the \nSudan145. Besides these schemes,\
    \ there are other kinds like private small pump schemes \nwhich play important\
    \ role in the Northern Region, co-operative schemes, and private \nagricultural\
    \ firms. In this region, private pump schemes serve about 208,000 feddan of \n\
    which over 92,000 feddan are government-owned. About 40 000 feddan of public and\
    \ 400 \n000 feddan of private irrigation and livestock operations are served by\
    \ gravity-fed basin \nflooding rather than by pumps (USBR, 1986:10). The private\
    \ agricultural Schemes in \nShendi district estimated by 33 000 feddan (the agricultural\
    \ Survey Commission Report, \n1990) mostly irrigated by pumps from the Nile. \n\
    \ \nThe first vital problem of Gendettu is the lack of precise mapping for the\
    \ Scheme which \nclearly defines the boundary of the official cultivated area.\
    \ Since the construction of the \nscheme in 1917, substantial unauthorized gradual\
    \ alternations and modifications have \ntaken place around the boundaries of the\
    \ original scheme, which have, in many instances, \nresulted in an alteration\
    \ of the Net Cultivable Area (NCA)146. Although this phenomenon is \nalso observed\
    \ in other schemes owned by NAPC, specially those constructed in the period \n\
    1907 to 1943, at Gendettu the measured area is considerably higher than in the\
    \ official \nrecords. The initiated area according to the NAPC records is 3500\
    \ feddan whereas the most \nrecently measured area from the series arial photographs\
    \ (1979) was 4 964 feddan147 (ODA \n1988: 4-2). \n \nThe difference between actual\
    \ and official area (42%) is more than those founded in the \nother projects;\
    \ Kitiab (-19%), Aliab (-5%), fadlab (-7%), Bawga (12%) and Zeidab (-16%). \n\
    This increase is due entirely to, according to the study of NRIRP (1988:4-1)148:\
    \ „unofficial \nextensions by individual farmers which have been carried out gradually\
    \ and have not been \naccompanied by a corresponding increase in pumping capacity“.\
    \ The underlying result is \nthat these areas outside the official scheme receives\
    \ gravity supplies from the Schemes’ \ncanal system whilst some areas within the\
    \ boundary rely entirely on private groundwater \npumps. However, because of the\
    \ water shortage problems, substantial areas of the scheme \nare supplemented\
    \ by pumping from groundwater, specially citrus areas. \n \n                 \
    \                                            \n144 Nory (1917), El Gurair (1917),\
    \ El Ghaba (1917), El Kolot (1927) and El Gurgeig (1943). \n145 As described in\
    \ ODA (1988:2-4): „NAPC differs from the other major public sector irrigation\
    \ \ncorporations in Sudan in two important respects. First, its individual schemes\
    \ are relatively small, except \nfor Zeidab, and they arescattered over a very\
    \ large area, with considerable distances between them. Most \nother corporations\
    \ have large areas of irrigated land in contiguous blocks or at least within reasonable\
    \ \nreach of each other. Second, the other corporations concentrate essentially\
    \ on only a very few crops \n(cotton, sugar cane, groundnuts and wheat) whereas\
    \ the NAPC schemes grow a very wide range of crops. \nMoreover, the land outside\
    \ the large schemes is usually either uncultivated or under rainfed cropping,\
    \ \nwhereas the NAPC schemes from part of the irrigated belt which stretches along\
    \ much of the main Nile \nand on which the farming is similar to that followed\
    \ on the schemes themselves“ .  \n146 this phenomenon is specially strong in three\
    \ areas: dowemat, H. Bannaga and Figaga (see Fig. 5.8)   \n147 The general manager\
    \ of the NAPC had reported 4 318 feddan, of which 2 200 feddan government owned.\
    \  \n148 This study within the framework of agreement between the Government of\
    \ Sudan and the British Overseas \nDevelopment Administration (ODA) 1983, to set\
    \ up the Northern Region Irrigation Rehabilitation Project \n(NRIRP), a program\
    \ of assistance to the irrigated farming sector in the Northern Region, focussed\
    \ initially \non the Northern Agricultural Production (NAPC) in the Nile Province.\
    \ The main aims of NRIRP are to \nassist NAPC to provide a more secure supply\
    \ of inputs to its farmers in order to improve agricultural \nproduction; to ensure\
    \ a more cost effective use of resources and to enable NAPC to function \nindependently\
    \ of government subsidy. \n \n125 \nHolding sizes for tenants vary according to\
    \ the time in which tenancies were distributed. At \nthe beginning, the standard\
    \ holding size was 5 fed, in other was 6 and 12 fed, and more \nrecently it has\
    \ been dimensioned to 2 feddan. That means, the variation can be between 12 \n\
    feddan to 2 feddan. Sometimes, because of traditional inheritance systems, smaller\
    \ plots \nare to be found, which may reach to only a fraction of a feddan. \n\
    \ \n5.2.3  Why New Halfa and Gendettu? \n \nAlthough the significance of New Halfa\
    \ Scheme might seen reduced in comparison with \nthe Managil extension to the\
    \ Gezira Scheme and further expansion of irrigated agriculture \nfrom the Roseires\
    \ dam on the Blue Nile (Rahad Scheme), in many ways, the scheme which \nconsider\
    \ the second large scheme in Sudan is unique (THORNTON/WYNN, 1987:201): \n \n\
    1. in the first place the Scheme is the only significant existing irrigation on\
    \ the Atbara \nRiver; \n2. part of the Scheme has been devoted to the first major\
    \ re-settlement carried out in the \nSudan; \n3. 24-hour watering was to have\
    \ been used throughout the Scheme which consider an \ninnovation in the Sudan’s\
    \ gravity irrigation works on this scale; \n4. the Scheme contains the Sudan’s\
    \ second area of sugar production; \n5. the scheme use pumpturbines to simultaneously\
    \ produce electricity and supply \nirrigation water when levels in the reservoir\
    \ are high, and then make the water in the \nbottom part of the reservoir available\
    \ for the use by pumping when the water levels \nhave fallen149; and  \n6. in\
    \ addition, the Scheme is the first large irrigation project established after\
    \ the \nindependence.  \n \nThe New Halfa Scheme is a typical example of the communities\
    \ where tenants are not only \ndependent on the farm as a sole or even, in many\
    \ circumstances, a main source of income150 \nas it is in Gendettu. In addition,\
    \ sources such as livestock holdings among the nomads; \ntrading capital (enterprises);\
    \ occupations like teachers, governments’ officials; and \nremittances from abroad,\
    \ constitute important sources151. That is why the ‘presence’ and \nfollow up\
    \ of the tenant in the farm ‘Hawasha’ was one important factor in choosing the\
    \ \nsample and evaluating the performance152. \n \nHence, the important of choosing\
    \ this scheme as a sample will be very noticeable, specially \nin representing\
    \ the vital rule of the social factor on irrigation systems. \n \n           \
    \                                                  \n149 FRAMJI, GARG and LUTHRA\
    \ (1983:1276). \n150 In a recent Survey, carried out by the Federal Agricultural\
    \ Extension Administration (FAEA) and the \nNHAPC (1991:5), it has been found\
    \ that 54 % of the sample (170 tenants) had other occupations.  \n151 The prior\
    \ economic condition of the settlers is an critical factor determining successes\
    \ in Settlement \nSchemes. This is a well-known situation with most development\
    \ projects. WIDANAPATHIRANA in his \nstudy about Poverty in Irrigation Settlements\
    \ in Sri Lanka has also identified this fact (ODI, Network \nPaper 27, 1993).\
    \  \n152 LEES (1986:613) describes similar situation in Israel. Because of the\
    \ deterioration of income from the \nsmall farms in the Israel’s cooperatives\
    \ and increasing the dependency on the employment off the farm, a \nfairly high\
    \ proportion of settlers have adjusted their farming practices to accommodate\
    \ their off-farm \nemployment. „Some neglect their farms entirely, some work them\
    \ part time only, and some arrange to \nhave others neighbors make use of the\
    \ holding and its resources by means of informal transfers such as \npartnerships“.\
    \  \n \n126 \nThe important of the second case study, Gendettu, derives from its:\
    \ position, history, farm \nsize, kind of farmers, and method of water acquisition\
    \ (Table 5.1):  \n \nTable 5.1 Basic Schemes Attributes \n \nScheme Attributes\

    \ the agricultural sector in the Northern Region is characterized by a \ndiversity\
    \ of production methods covering private, co-operative and company \nirrigation\
    \ pump schemes as well as traditional irrigation schemes, some rainfed \nagriculture\
    \ and the widespread keeping of livestock in sedentary, semi-nomadic and \nnomadic\
    \ systems. Shendi, in particular, where Gendettu scheme located, is a good \n\
    example for two kinds of irrigation systems in Sudan. Mainly, basin irrigation\
    \ \nwhich applied in the Sudan for most of the irrigated horticulture, irrigated\
    \ rice, \nwheat and vegetables. Secondly, pump irrigation which ranking second\
    \ to gravity \nirrigation; the largest system of irrigation in the Sudan. In addition,\
    \ Shendi is \nprimarily a horticultural station; \n− history: Gendettu is one\
    \ of the oldest irrigation schemes in the Sudan and has been \nestablished in\
    \ the colonial era;  \n− size of the farm, either leasehold or freehold, is small;\
    \ \n− the farmers of the scheme have good experience; and \n− the Scheme is well-known\
    \ in the region as the worst regarding irrigation \nmanagement.  \n \nFurthermore,\
    \ the difference in size was intentional to prove the view which see: “the larger\
    \ \nand more complex the system, the less well-defined the membership boundaries,\
    \ which \n                                                             \n153 Angaya\
    \ system is a flood system using basins and ridges within the basins for the two\
    \ row crops (see \nChapter 6.3.1). \n \n127 \nmakes effective management as a\
    \ common property resource increasingly difficult“ (ODI, \n1995:1). \n \n5.2.4\
    \  Profile of The Common Characteristics \n \nNotwithstanding the above, there\
    \ are many common characteristics between the two \nschemes that could be summed\
    \ up as follows: \n \n− Corresponding to Weber’s model of bureaucracy, as described\
    \ in MANIG \n(1989:10-1), both projects belong to Mechanical-Bureaucratic model\
    \ of \norganizations which have the following characteristics: simple technology;\
    \ high \ndemand for standardized goals and services; the organization is large\
    \ and \ncentralized; fixed process and supervision from top to bottom; routine;\
    \ no \ninnovation due to their staff’s low level of skills and the hierarchical\
    \ structure of \ndecision-making; and finally the inflexibility towards changes.\
    \ The two schemes \ncould be used as example to illustrate the general type of\
    \ structure that is found in \nthe public sector’s agricultural schemes in the\
    \ Sudan. \n− the collective choice entity in these cases, therefore, involves\
    \ not just the water \nusers but also interest groups who shares an interest in\
    \ irrigation and other related \nactivities; \n− in each of the two cases there\
    \ are two forms of land tenure; the main one is state-\ncontrolled tenancy and\
    \ farmers are therefore, in legal sense, tenants holding \ncontractual leases.\
    \ They have therefore no right of succession. On the death of a \ntenant the Corporation\
    \ selects a successor who has to compensate the legatees of the \ndeceased for\
    \ any permanent improvement that may have been made. Normally, the \nnew tenant\
    \ is selected from the family of the deceased where this is feasible154. In \n\
    addition, have many of those tenants freehold (amlak) land. \n− because of the\
    \ ambiguity over the real nature of the ‘tenancy’- defacto, tenancies \nare inherited\
    \ - the tenants in New Halfa Scheme seen to feel that they have a moral \nright\
    \ to their tenancies as compensation for the land they have lost155. Similar \n\
    feeling having also the tenants in Gendettu who always remind that the scheme\
    \ has \nbeen established to secure a livelihood for their families. Such feelings\
    \ will explain \nlatter some of the tenants behaviors, specially towards the water\
    \ pricing. \n− in both cases, fast the entire system are governed by the agency\
    \ „upper management \nbody.“ That means, the irrigators’ associations (Farmers’\
    \ unions) have no \nremarkable role in governing activities at the distributary\
    \ and water course levels.  \n− the farmers in both projects, as the most in developing\
    \ countries, use the oldest and \ngenerally the least expensive method to irrigate\
    \ their fields; that is gravity-flow \nsystem. This system distribute water from\
    \ surface canal or groundwater well \nthrough unlined field ditches or siphons.\
    \ In addition depends many of the nomads in \nNew Halfa, heavily, on rain-fields\
    \ outside the project. \n                                                    \
    \         \n154 Because the household and the nuclear family tend to coincide,\
    \ the terms „household“ and „family“ are \noften used interchangeably. This usage,\
    \ argues POLLAK (1985:589), is misleading even for advanced \nindustrial societies\
    \ and it is seriously misleading for developing countries. We refer in this case,\
    \ however, \nto the family.  \n155 This is not only the case of nubians’ tenants,\
    \ it is also applicable to the nomadic tenants, specially the \nShukrija, the\
    \ majority of whom received tenancies in compensation for loss of traditional\
    \ grazing rights on \nthe Butana plains for a period of 400-500 years.  \n \n\
    128 \n \n− the farmers in both Schemes plant different crops according to a three-year\
    \ crop-\nrotation systems. \n− finally, both projects considers the best examples\
    \ in Sudan which obviously reflect \nthe fact    that: ‘bad management’ of the\
    \ available resources had been, and still, and \nwill continue to be one of the\
    \ basic factors which causes bottlenecks in the \ndevelopment process. \n \n5.3\
    \ Methodology \n \n5.3.1 Factors that have governed Investigation Methods \n \n\
    Achieving the aims of the study, discussed in Chapte 5.1, requires necessarily,\
    \ a high \ndegree of judgement and intimate knowledge of the physical resources\
    \ and agricultural \ncharacteristics of the projects’ regions. In addition, socio-economic\
    \ survey is required to \nfurnish the information necessary for the successful\
    \ diagnosis and then applicable \nrecommendations. Since the study is not only\
    \ intended to identify and catch on the \nproblems and their causes, but also,\
    \ with more interest, to guide us to the possible solutions. \nThis approach is\
    \ called Diagnostic Appraisal which described by CHAMBERS (1983) as \n‘opportunity\
    \ rather than problem oriented’ (LENTON 1986:52) .156 \n \nThe quality of most\
    \ available data, not just their quantity, is a major constraint on \nimproving\
    \ irrigation management. Thereby, it is quite known today, for researchers \n\
    working in the third world’s irrigation schemes, that one vital source of difficulty\
    \ in \nmanaging many systems is the lack of valid information on either water\
    \ distribution or \nwater requirements157. That is why, the question which has\
    \ been strongly raised in this \ncritical phase of the study was, which social\
    \ research method or combination of methods \nguarantees gaining such information?\
    \ The answer has required examining the different \napproaches that have been\
    \ used in similar areas and their imperial facts to avoid, within the \nbounds\
    \ of possibility, the critique and strengthen, therefore, the effective sides\
    \ for our two \ncircumstances. The following considerations had, consequently,\
    \ governed the methodology \nof the study: \n \n− criticism directed to the Brief\
    \ Rural Visit by ‘the urban-based professionals’ \n(spatial: visits near cities,\
    \ the centers of villages, and neglect of peripheries; project: \nwhere projects\
    \ were being undertaken, often with special official attention and \nsupport;\
    \ person: meeting men more than women, elites more than the poor, the users \n\
    more than the non-users of services, and so on; seasonal: going in seasons which\
    \ are \noften worse for rural people; and diplomatic) all these could combine\
    \ to hide the \nworst situation (CHAMBERS 1992b:7); \n                       \
    \                                      \n156 In the field of irrigation management,\
    \ the concept which the term „methodology“ embodies is according to \nLENTON (1986:48):\
    \ „An irrigation management methodology comprises the generalizable practices,\
    \ \nprocesses, techniques or approaches-not specific to any given irrigation system-\
    \ employed by irrigation \nand other agencies and/or farmers to undertake a given\
    \ irrigation management activity.“ \n157 In this view, then, it would make sense\
    \ to separate definitions of information and data. SINGH       \n(1988:358), distinguish\
    \ the two terminologys in terms of their usability as follows: Data is facts and\
    \ \nfigures, lying in files, records and reports, which are not organized or processed\
    \ in a manner that is \nmeaningful to the manager. By contrast, Information consists\
    \ of data that is properly classified and \nanalysed such that they can be used\
    \ by the manager for decision making.  \n \n129 \n− the disillusion with the normal\
    \ processes of questionnaire surveys and their results. \nAs CHAMBERS (1992b:7,33)\
    \ argued, the experience had been that questionnaire \nsurveys tended to be: „long-drawn-out,\
    \ tedious, a headache to administer, a \nnightmare to process and write up, inaccurate\
    \ and unreliable in data obtained, \nleading to reports, if any, which were long,\
    \ late, boring, misleading, difficult to use, \nand anyway ignored“, „the quality\
    \ of its data is often so poor, that an improvement \nis not difficult to achieve“;\
    \ \n− the advantages emergent from ‘Indigenous Technical Knowledge’ (ITK) (rural\
    \ \npeople are themselves knowledgeable on many subjects which touched their lives);\
    \ \n− the new methods that have been emphasized in Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA)\
    \ such \nas direct observance and semi structured interviewing158. This approach\
    \ began to \nemerge in the late 1970s and gained increasing acceptance in the\
    \ 1980s. It has \nargued that RRA is cost-effective, specially for gaining timely\
    \ information and \nconsider in many contexts and for many purposes, the best.\
    \ In five empirical cases \ndiscussed by CHAMBERS (1992), the outcomes of the\
    \ RRA approach, compared \nwith the more formal questionnaire, were variously\
    \ more valid, less costly, more \ntimely, and more useful159; and \n− participation\
    \ of the those concerned must not be only the base of managing \nirrigation systems,\
    \ but also a vital factor of their related researches. \n− finally, rural data\
    \ presently obtainable in developing countries is, as \nMORIS/COPESTAKE (1993:6)\
    \ argued, more likely to merit qualitative (informal) \nthan quantitative (formal)\
    \ treatment. \n \nAccording to the above, the combination of social investigation\
    \ methods adopted in this \nfieldwork, which had commenced on 17th November 1992\
    \ and continued until end-April \n1993, had included: \n \n• two structural questionnaires;\
    \ one was directed at water-users, (contained 48 question) \nand the other (25\
    \ question) for the officials and the so-called ‘experts’ or key people \n(projects’\
    \ staff, specialists, researchers in Universities - Khartoum and Gezira; and \n\
    Ministries - Agriculture and Irrigation; staff of other government departments160;\
    \ and \nnumerous non-governmental organizations working in the area161). \n  \
    \                                                           \n158 FAO stresses\
    \ the necessity to collect actual data through Rapid Appraisal field surveys and\
    \ interviews \nwith farmers (WALKER/CLEVERINAGA, 1989:Vol 2, M.XI.7:5) \n159 He\
    \ refers to BERNADAS’ (1991) who reports that in Eastern Visayas in the Philippines,\
    \ highly structured \nquestionnaire interviews identified declining soil fertility\
    \ as the most pressing problem of farmers. \nBernadas explains that the staff\
    \ themselves had formulated the questions and determined the areas on the \nbasis\
    \ of what they felt to be priorities. As a result, „two years of research based\
    \ on the questionnaire \nsurvey findings did not match farmers need and circumstances,\
    \ and the developed technologies were not \nadopted by them.“ Using an RRA approach\
    \ led to the discovery that the most pressing problem facing \nfarmers was not\
    \ soil fertility but the long fallow due to the growth of a weed cotton). Another\
    \ study on \nagroforstry in Kenya (ROCHELEAU et al. 1989) had also different results\
    \ from applying the two \nmethods; a chain of informal in-depth interviews and\
    \ group interviews, compared with a survey of a \nformal randomized sample of\
    \ 63 households (p.34-5).     \n160 Agricultural planning department in ministry\

    \ course of this field study, visits were made to the headquarters of \nMinistry\
    \ of irrigation in Wad Medany and the head office of the Northern Agriculture\
    \ \nProduction Corporation NAPC in Ed Damer.  \n• Structure of the questionnaires,\
    \ the checklist’s topics, and even the expressions used in \nthe questions were\
    \ latter revised after informal in-depth interviews with representatives \nof\
    \ these different groups.  \n• In addition, other data/information gathering tools\
    \ were applied, such as observations, \nand analysis of published and unpublished\
    \ documents. \nThe interview schedule includes the following topics, that had\
    \ been, latter, translated in \ndetails into single questions: \n− social data\
    \ (sex, age, education, primary and secondary occupation, and members of \nthe\
    \ family); \n− general farm’s information ( location, ownership, and size);  \n\
    − farmer’s cropping patterns and production’s data (yield, area cultivated, number\
    \ of \none’s own animal, property of agrarian machines, size of labor; family\
    \ and paid \nlabor, and problems of agriculture); \n− farmer’s irrigation patterns\
    \ and behaviors (field distribution, land leveling, irrigation \ninterval, and\
    \ duration); \n− irrigation control162; \n− water distribution’s problems and\
    \ causes (reliability and predictability); \n− communication and linkages with\
    \ project’s Administrations; \n− the relationship between tenants as regards water\
    \ distribution; \n− conflicts: \n1) between the irrigation administration and\
    \ water users, and  \n \n2) between upstream and downstream water users; \n− water\
    \ user’s organizations; \n− the role of supporting institutions (credit market,\
    \ marketing); and \n− water pricing system \n \n5.3.2 Selection of the Samples\
    \  \n \nThe approach pursued here take in consideration the nature of the two\
    \ schemes. After \nstudying the sampling frame (the complete lists/maps of the\
    \ projects), and to get a \nrepresentative sample to the vast schemes that represent\
    \ the target population, as accurately \nas possible, a non-random approach had\
    \ been used to choose the districts and villages. \nThereby, a cross-section of\
    \ districts and tenants were selected with the help of the projects’ \nofficials,\
    \ experts, and Tenant Farmers’ Unions. The following factors had been taken in\
    \ \nconsideration: \n \n− the different positions of districts in the projects;\
    \  \n− the irrigation situation; the location of the farm along the field water\
    \ course and the \nposition of the later relative to the distributry (head, middle\
    \ and tail);  \n− the presence and follow up of the tenant in his farm (the degree\
    \ of absenteeism); and \n− the ethnical differentiation (in New Halfa Scheme).\
    \  \n                                                             \n162 FREEMAN\
    \ (1989) defined irrigation control in terms of the appropriate application of\
    \ water on the field. \nLAYTON et al. (1994:294) also assuming this and defines\
    \ it by the farmers’ ability to irrigate when they \ndesired and in the amount\
    \ they believed necessary. \n \n131 \n \nBy using simple random sampling, 60 tenant\
    \ in New Halfa Scheme and 40 tenant in \nGendettu Scheme, were interviewed. In\
    \ addition, the sample of the key informants \n(officials) had comprised 44 persons.\
    \ \n \nIn New Halfa, two Sections (five Blocks and thirteen villages) were selected\
    \ as illustrated \nin figure 5.3. Concerning the ethnical distribution in the\
    \ project, the sample was chosen \nproportionally according to stratified random\
    \ approach i.e., two thirds of the sample \nnomads (in 7 villages) and the other\
    \ third Halfawyeen (in 6 villages). \n \na) SHEIK OMER is the second biggest section\
    \ in the scheme regarding area (19 595 \nfeddan) and number of tenants (3920).\
    \ It includes the two population groups; nomads (the \nmajority) and halfawyeen\
    \ (Fig. 5.3), and lie on the beginning of the scheme. \n \n1- Abu Nagma: altogether,\
    \ this Block has more irrigation problems than El Butana Block. \nThroughout 1980s,\
    \ because of water shortage, the three villages have \ncultivated only two rotation.\
    \ Tenancies here are consider the very extreme \nexample for the unleveled land\
    \ in the Scheme. \n \nArab 5: all tenancies lie at the head,163therefore, they\
    \ have less irrigation \nproblems. The presence of tenants is good. \nArab 6:\
    \ the biggest village in the scheme; comprise 601 tenants. \nTenancies in the\
    \ middle i.e., has more irrigation problems than \nArab 5. \nArab 7: tenancies\
    \ at the end. It means chronic irrigation problems. \n \n2- El Butana: \ncanals\
    \ in this Block are more than the average by the others (9 compared \nwith average\
    \ 3-5) and well distributed. The sole problem here is the long of \nthese canals,\
    \ that extended from km.26 till km.33, and this require, \ntherefore, more control.\
    \ Two villages were chosen heir; Arab 2, and Arab3. \n     \n3- Argin: \ngenerally,\
    \ this Block has no irrigation problem i.e., availability of water. \nThe more\
    \ serious problem here, specially in villages 5 and 11, is the weak \npresence\
    \ or follow up of the tenants. Exception here is village 13, which lie \nat the\
    \ end. The tenants there use ‘pistols’ to guard their water during the \nnight.\
    \ In addition, because of the acute shortage of water, many tenancies \nare not\
    \ cultivated and tenants from neighbor villages drain there. A big part \nof the\
    \ command Area in this village is known as „the dead line.“ \n    \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n                                                             \n163 Head, middle\
    \ and end refer heir to the location on the minor canal. \n \n132 \nFig. 5.3 Sample\
    \ of New Halfa Scheme According to Section, Block and Villages \n \n \nSource:\
    \ Own Survey \n \n \n133 \nb) The other selected Section, SASARAIB, contains also\
    \ Arabs and Halfawyeen and lie on \nthe middle and east of the scheme. It comprise\
    \ 17 520 feddan and 3511 tenants. This \nSection is marked by long canals that\
    \ have problems at the tail end, and have also easy \nirrigated places. \n \n\
    4- Alledaj: \ninclude the biggest village in the Nubian’s area - village 26 -\
    \ which \ncomprise 334 tenant and 4267 inhabitant. This village is good example\
    \ for \nHalfawyeen who are firm connected with the tenancy, and is, in the same\
    \ \ntime, famous for high women’s participation in farm operations. Gereges \n\
    is the Nomads’ equivalent village to village 26 concerning the link with the \n\
    ‘soil’. Performance in sidira, on the other  side, is middle and their \ntenancies\
    \ lies on the end. \n \n5- El Madina: village 24 represent irrigation problems\
    \ in this Block because all tenancies \nlies on the end of long minor. Nevertheless,\
    \ represent El Basawla the top \nperformance among the project concerning the\
    \ productivity, specially \nwheat.   \n \nConsidering irrigation, Gendettu Scheme\
    \ is distributed among 8 sections: Kilo 10, Mowes, \nMinor (Gadual) 8, Minor 6,7,\
    \ Minor 5, Minor 4, Minor El Bahar, and Gendettu. The \nstructure of the sample\
    \ here has more emphasized the areas where irrigation problems are \nstrong. That\
    \ is why, the northern irrigation plant in the scheme (Minors, 4,5,6,7,8, and\
    \ \nMinor El Bahar) represent 71 per cent of the sample (Figure 5.4). These areas\
    \ lie on the \nend of the scheme, and had been described in the project’s internal\
    \ monthly reports as the \nmain problem of the whole scheme. The field canals\
    \ there did not receive water among the \neight years before season 92/93. That\
    \ is way all of them have built up wells and relayed on \nheavily. The main cause\
    \ of this „tragedy“ is the long journey of water which has to run 13 \nkm from\
    \ the main pump station, through the main canal, to these areas. In addition,\
    \ as \nmentioned in the technical background, the tenants in the first five km.\
    \ have constructed \nown pipes or canals to draw water directly from the main\
    \ canal.  \n \nIt has been also taken in consideration a representation for the\
    \ ‘old’ tenants who have long \nexperience with the scheme. In addition, to obtain\
    \ comparative data, an additional survey \nwas carried out in a very small private\
    \ project (4 participants, 9 feddan) lies direct on the \nNile (Ibriqu project).\
    \ These kinds of projects are dominant in Shindi and north Sudan, \nwhere many\
    \ farmers sharing pump set (or belong it to one of them) and sharing also the\
    \ \ncosts. \n \n \n \n134 \nFigure (5.4) Distribution of the Sample in Gendettu\
    \ Scheme \n \n \n Source: Own Survey \n \n \n5.3.3  Some Findings of the Field\
    \ Investigation’s Methods and the Quality of Response \n  \nDuring the carry out\
    \ of the field study, it was of interest to find that: \n \n1. It has been noticed\
    \ in both projects (more obvious in New Halfa) that the tenants were \nfrustrated\
    \ and not convinced of the positive effects that could be gained from such \n\
    studies; „every day come somebody who say that his study is important for us...\
    \ he put \nthe same questions and meet, more or less, the same people... and the\
    \ result is ... nothing \nnew!“ \n \n2. Throughout the interviews with the officials\
    \ of the schemes, experts, and even the \nresearch center’s staff, the general\
    \ perception was that most of them do not prefer what \nis called „answer list“\
    \ or „closed“ questions. On the contrary, they prefer to say, out of \nturn, all\
    \ what they thinks about the discussed topic, one for all, after the first question.\
    \ \nThis may be a kind of security, or to be out of danger, because ‘yes’ or ‘no’\
    \ means \nsometimes for them responsibility! In such political atmosphere, the\
    \ open discussions \ngive the respondent a better mood to speak with freedom.\
    \ So, the desire was (with many) \nto let the respondent speaking rather than\
    \ intersperse with the researcher’s comments \nand/or offering him specific answers.\
    \ This means that, in addition to the questionnaire, \nthere was heavy dependence\
    \ on the individual in-depth interview with check-list \ntopics. On the other\
    \ side, disadvantages of such method are already known; it takes \nmore time,\
    \ resources, and effort to control the discussion and many questions, \nfurthermore,\
    \ can not be answered or even mentioned. These, however, coincide with \nsome\
    \ components of the researcher’s beliefs i.e.  1) details are sometimes very important\
    \ \nto explain some phenomenons; 2) ‘yes’ or ’no’ is not necessarily to be in\
    \ one-word \nform; and 3) in the field of human behavior, it is difficult to belief\
    \ in absolute ‘fact’ or to \ntake it for granted. \n \n3. Again, because of the\
    \ political constrains, group interviews, that consider key method in \nthe more\
    \ recent approach; Participatory Rural Appraisal PRA, were not possible164. \n\
    \                                                             \n164 Participatory\
    \ Rural Appraisal PRA has emerged in the mid 1980s as a result of the massive\
    \ recognition of \nthe importance of participation. In 1988, were listed by the\
    \ IIED team as one of four classes of RRA \nmethodologies - the other being exploratory\
    \ RRAs, topical RRAs, and monitoring RRAs. In the same \n10%\n22%\n12%\n12%\n\

    \ 7\nGadual 8\nMowes\nH.Banaga\nFigaga\nGandattu\n \n135 \nTherefore, it is not\
    \ valid in such cases what CHAMBERS (1992:41) has argued about \n„the sensitive\
    \ subjects are sometimes more freely discussed in groups, when individuals \n\
    would not wish to discuss them alone with a stranger“ or that „participants fill\
    \ in gaps \nleft by others and add or correct details“. On the contrary, such\
    \ group activities could be \ndangerous for the participants. For example, in\
    \ the time of the field study, the local \npolitical administration in New Halfa\
    \ thumped165 three tenants from village 11 because \nthey were participating in\
    \ an open meeting and criticized the policies of the project’s \nadministration166.\
    \ For this reason, the tenants in this village refused the interview \nbecause\
    \ they thought that the researcher work as a secret agent for the government or\
    \ the \nproject (the same) despite the key person who was accompanied by him.\
    \ \n \n4. Figuratively speaking, it has been found that, at the field, ‘the eye’\
    \ is more important \nthan ‘the ear’. In other words, because of the socio-political\
    \ conditions in the project’s \nareas which might be attributed to the shades\
    \ of doubt about the collected data and \ninformation, observation in the field\
    \ was, to a big extent, more valuable than those \ncollected through the project’s\
    \ Management and the questionnaire (listening). Table 5.2, \nas example, refers\
    \ to the uncertainty of data that can lead us to wrong ways. Such \nanswers are\
    \ evidence, for the researcher, that the respondents had no trust in the face\
    \ of \nthe interviewer - though the family is related to him - or may be, from\
    \ other side, they \nwere afraid, as many of the staff, that their opinions and\
    \ information reach, somehow, to \nthe political administration or some governmental\
    \ agencies like Chamber of Taxation or \nZakat Department. \n                \
    \                                                                            \
    \                                                                            \
    \                  \nyear, this approach was applied in Machakos District in Kenya\
    \ and in Gujarat in India. From the succinct \nreview of PRA by CHAMBERS (1992),\
    \ the following advantages could be drawn: \n- its lable gives a sense of pride\
    \ of ownership and originality, so strengthening commitment, enthusiasm \nand\
    \ good work among its practitioners; \n- information is more shared and owned\
    \ by local people and shows high validity and reliability; \n- outsiders here\
    \ are conveyors, catalysts, and facilitators to enable people to undertake and\
    \ share their own \ninvestigations and analysis; \n- compared with T and V (training\
    \ and visit) the former is more effective and had favorable indicators \nconcerning:\
    \ agricultural yields, diversity of crops, soil erosion and sedimentation, cost\
    \ ratios, and wage \nrates. similar findings have been reported from the work\
    \ of AKRSP in Gujarat. \n- PRA is explained as ‘reversal’ - from etic to emic;\
    \ from our knowledge, categories, and values to theirs. \nWithin the frame of\
    \ that reversal, three clusters of reversal or change intervene and are mutually\
    \ \nreinforcing: reversal of modes (from closed to open, from individual to group,\
    \ from verbal to visual); \nreversal of relationship/dominance (from extracting\
    \ to empowering); and reversal of action (from \nreserve to rapport, from tedium\
    \ to fun). \n \n165 The local authority practiced this kind of punishment also\
    \ in village No. 5 Halfaween, but because of other \nreason. \n166 Within this\
    \ sample and because of the water shortage, only 13 of the 36 hawashas, have grown\
    \ wheat. In \nthat time substantial quantity of water ran more than month into\
    \ the drainage and roads. \n \n136 \nTable 5.2  Some quantitative Answers from\

    \ of the environment of the Scheme is the silver \nlining that needed to the above\
    \ quantitative picture.  \n \n \n5.4  Background to Some Contexts of the Schemes\
    \ under Study \n \n5.4.1  Agro-ecological Contexts \n \n5.4.1.1  Rainfall and\
    \ Other Climatic Factors \n \nAccording to the climatic data presented in the\
    \ Nile Waters Study (USBR, 1986:4-5), \naverage annual air temperature is much\
    \ the same throughout Sudan, ranging between 27°C \nand 29°C. Variations during\
    \ the year, however, are much more noticeable in the north than \nin the south.\
    \ In the eastern region, average monthly temperatures are about 29° C with a \n\
    maximum in May of 41°C and a minimum winter temperature in January of 15°C. \n\
    (PEARSON, 1980:1). In the Nile Province, the middle temperature is also between\
    \ 28° C \nand 30° C. The summer season with high temperatures and low humidity\
    \ extends from \nApril to October. The hottest months, between May and July, with\
    \ average 34° C, and \nmaximum around 42° C and relative humidity of about 25%,\
    \ whereas in the cool season- \nNovember to February - about 19° C (HERWIG, 1991:30).\
    \ \n \n \n137 \nThe mean annual rainfall increases dramatically from north to\
    \ south. The area along the \nEgyptian border receives virtually no rain. By contrast,\
    \ the areas along the borders of the \nCentral African Republic and Zaire receive\
    \ an average of about 1 500 millimeters of rain. \nIn the desert and semi-desert\
    \ areas (where the two schemes lies) the rainfall is from 75 to \n300mm. In the\
    \ Nile Province, rainfall (which normal falls during the months June to \nSeptember)\
    \ has not, mostly, exceeded 100 mm. per year since 1973167. Although the semi-\n\
    desert becomes green during the short-rainy season, during the remaining part\
    \ of the year \nmost of the vegetation is confined to watercourses, drainage channels,\
    \ depressions, runnels \nand catchment areas (BEBAWI/NEUGEBOHRN, 1991:15). \n\
    \ \nThe length of the rainy season also varies significantly from north to south.\
    \ At Karima, and \nthe eastern region, over 80 percent of the average annual 41\
    \ millimeters of rain occurs in \nJuly and August, while nearly 80 percent of\
    \ the annual 988 millimeters of rain at Juba \noccurs between May and October.\
    \ The remaining months of the year are hot and dry. \nEvaporation rates vary significantly\
    \ across the country. The rates are affected by rainfall \nand accompanying conditions\
    \ of humidity, solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and \nelevation.\
    \ The highest evaporation occurs in the north part of the country and along the\
    \ Nile \nand White Nile River, and it decreases progressively toward the east\
    \ and south-east. \n \n5.4.1.2  Soils \n \nThe soil of New Halfa is described\
    \ by THORNTON and WYNN (1987:207) as follows: \n„the topsoil of the area is predominantly\
    \ clay although a little less so than in the similar \nGezira plain. Poorer soils\
    \ to the north and a stony surface to the north-west limit the \nfurther expansion\
    \ of the scheme in this direction. Salinity and alkalinity are not a problem \n\
    at present but, as in the Gezira, poor permeability precludes sub-surface drainage\
    \ and \nthere may be a slow build up of salinity and alkalinity“.  \n \nA detailed\
    \ account of the geology and soils of the Northern Region as provided in the \n\
    Roseires Soil Survey Report No 5 (MacDonalds and Partners, 1964) and summarized\
    \ by \nBERY (1987) is outlined by WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON (1985:6): „the underlying\
    \ \nbedrock consists of Pre-cambrian granites, gneiss and mica schists with quartzite.\
    \ the \ngranite, where outcrops appear small hills, weathers to give quantities\
    \ of waterborne sand. \nLater deposits of Cretaceous Nubian sandstone are widespread,\
    \ particularly occurring \nnear the Nile, and consists of flat-bedded sandstone,\
    \ mudstones and conglomerates, giving \nrise to low-lying rock outcrops and gravel\
    \ ridges. The surface soil deposits overlying these \nformations are the qoz sands\
    \ (deposited by wind under arid conditions), clay plains and \nlaterites. Along\
    \ the banks of the Rivers Nile and Atbara are the narrow beds of silty alluvia\
    \ \nvarying from 50 to 1000 m in width. In general, the area is dominated by shifting\
    \ sands in \nsheets and dunes, with occasional alluvial depressions with loams\
    \ and clays associated \nwith dry watercourses (wadis)“. \n                  \
    \                                           \n167 With the exception of the flood\
    \ in Agust 4, 1988. All the district experienced a high level of rainfall \nreaching\

    \ that the cropped area is sometimes limited by the water available from the dam,\
    \ \nwhich is affected by the silting of the reservoir and also by the policy followed\
    \ for \nhydropower generation. The actual capacity of the Reservoir now is approximately\
    \ 50-60%, \nthat is why the actual irrigated area is declined to 230-260 000 feddan\
    \ yearly depending on \nthe amount of the rain (The Technical Department of the\
    \ Scheme)168. \n \nAs mentioned before, a three-year crop-rotation system (cotton,\
    \ wheat/sorghum, and \ngroundnuts) has been prescripted to all tenants (Fig. 5.5).\
    \ The recognized rotation in Sudan \nis groundnuts followed by cotton followed\
    \ by wheat. The primary objective is to ensure \nthat cotton receives the advantage\
    \ of the nitrogen fixing ability of the groundnuts. These \nthree types of crops\
    \ had been dictated through the following parameters (NHAC 1986: \nAnnex2 p.5\
    \ ): \n \n \n                                                             \n168\
    \ The actually cultivated area in Season 92/93 was as follows: Cotton (44 130\

    \ no previous experience with it and \nthe settlers of phase II and III are not\

    \ \nthe \nother \nsettlers \nwould \nprefer \nto \ngrow \n‘dura’ \n(THORNTON/WYNN,\
    \ 1987:219).  \n \nIn the middle of 1980s, and according to the period of drought,\
    \ sorghum (dura) were \nintroduced in the irrigated projects as a corn crop as\
    \ well as a fodder crop. In addition, the \nrotations here, like the Rahad Scheme,\
    \ do not include a fallow (Fig. 5.6), opposite of the \nGezira and Managel Extension\

    \ \n \n \n \n \n \nThe general features of the agricultural production in the\
    \ northern Region can be \nsummarized as follows: \n \n− the number of crops that\
    \ can be produced economically is greater than those \nproduced in any of the\
    \ other Regions; \n− there are some crops whose production is to a great extent\
    \ monopoly of this region, \nsuch as faba beans, haricot beans, lentil and many\
    \ spices; \n− the northern Region is leading other Regions in citrus and mango-growing\
    \ and is one \nof the leading Regions in onions production; \n− one can say that\
    \ the region is considered the major producer of fruits.  \n \nGendettu Scheme\
    \ \n \nAt Gendettu, the farming year is traditionally divided into three seasons\
    \ influenced by the \nannual flood of the River Nile (Fig. 5.7):  \n \n1- The\
    \ summer Season (seifi): extends from 1st April to 31st July and is characterized\
    \ by \nrising temperatures in April, May and June. Because of the heat, the summer\
    \ cropped \narea is low. The main crop is fodder sorghum (sorghum vulgar) and\
    \ vegetables.  \n2- The damira Season: from August to October and known also as\
    \ the flood Season. This \nseason is  less hot and more humid. The season is devoted\
    \ primarily to grain sorghum. In \naddition, some farmers plant small areas of\
    \ maize, vegetable and lubia (Dolichos Lablab).  \n3- The winter Season (Shitwe):\
    \ extends from November to March and is the main cash \ncrop growing Season. There\
    \ are  a very wide range of crops in winter Season like, faba \nbeans (Vicia faba),\
    \ wheat (Triticum aestivum), haricot beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), \nvegetables,\
    \ spices and onions (Allium cepa). \n \nIn addition, Perennial crops comprising\
    \ orchards and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) occupy \nsignificant areas on the Gendettu.\
    \ Orchards include grape fruit, orange, lime, mango, \nbananas, guava and dates.\
    \ Alfalfa is grown as a crop in its own right and as an intercrop in \norchards.\
    \ \n \nThis pattern of cropping -judging by the significant areas of irrigated\
    \ land that are devoted to \nfodder production both in pure stand and as an orchard\
    \ intercrop170- shows also that \nlivestock consider an integral part of the farming\
    \ system. They are kept for the provision of \n                              \
    \                               \n170 Sorghum has remained the main green fodder\
    \ supplemented by lubia though this pattern is changing with \nincreasing areas\
    \ of Alfalfa. Crop residues are also important sources of livestock feed.  \n\

    Gendettu Scheme was originally established to grow cotton according to rotation\
    \ system; \neach rotation 1500 feddan. After the establishment of the Gezira Scheme\
    \ (1924), growing \ncotton had been canceled, and farmers have been allowed to\
    \ determines the cropping \npatterns within a three-course rotation. In 1972,\
    \ many farmers have got permission to grow \nfruit and the outcome was that, orchards’\
    \ areas were expanded from 532 to 1600 feddan. \nThe size of the rotation has\
    \ also, consequently, expanded from 1500 to 3200-3300 feddan in \nSeason 92/93172.\
    \ The expansion and changing in the rotation’s size and the original design \n\
    cropping patterns, and the constancy of the original installed pump capacity on\
    \ the other \nside, results in a high pumping requirement with pumping between\
    \ 14 and 18 hours per day \nfor 17 ten-day periods. Such pumping duration is more\
    \ than the average in the other NAPC \nprojects. \n \n5.4.2  Production Relations:\
    \ from Sharecropping Arrangement to a Fixed-rent \nContract \n \nNew Halfa Scheme\
    \ \n \nIt is arguable that many of the specific managerial problems and defective\
    \ organizational \nrelations in New Halfa have their roots in an overall conception\
    \ of the role of the \ncorporation, of the nature of the Scheme, and of the nature\
    \ of tenant-corporation \nrelationships (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 7, p.6). This relationship\
    \ has been defined, according \nto the NHAC Establishment order (1980), as a partnership\
    \ between tenant and \ncorporation (and therefore implicitly, government) in the\
    \ production, processing and \nmarketing of cotton - other crops and non-agricultural\
    \ activities normally falling outside the \n‘Partnership’ concept. \n \n \n \n\
    \                                                             \n171 Camels and\
    \ donkeys are basic to local transport and marketing whilst sheep, goats and cows\
    \ provide a \nvaluable source of meat and milk. \n172 According to the manager\
    \ of the Scheme. \n \n142 \nIn New Halfa, as well as in the other large irrigation\
    \ Schemes Gezira and Rahad, the \nproduction of cotton remains the conceptual\
    \ „raison d’ˆetre“ of the Corporation and \nScheme (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 7, p.7).\
    \ Therefore, the relations of production had been \ndivided in the Establishment\
    \ order of NHIRP (Chapter 5 and 10)173 to these of cotton \nproduction and those\
    \ of other crops: \n \n1. Cotton crop Relations of Production: \na- Relations\
    \ of production for cotton shall be based on a partnership between the \nCorporation\
    \ and the tenants.   \nb- Tenants shall be granted rising money incentives if\
    \ the general yield average in the \nCorporation exceeds the average established\
    \ by the Minister from time to time. \nc- Return of the cotton crop shall be distributed\
    \ after discounting the „joint accounts“ and \nany duties or other taxes; this\
    \ shall be calculated according to proportions recommended \nby the Board and\
    \ approved by the Minister. \n \n2. Relations of Production for Other Crops: \n\
    a- Tenants shall pay to the Corporation fees for water and management services\
    \ provided to \nthe areas cultivated under other crops, except any exempted crops.\
    \ The fees shall be paid \nin accordance with rates and procedures recommended\
    \ by the Board and approved by \nthe Minister. \nb- The net total returns from\
    \ the other crops shall belong to the tenant \n \nThe Corporation thereby is (for\
    \ cotton) responsible for a wide range of operations \nincluding: \n− distribution\
    \ of water to the hawasha; \n− land preparation; \n− ridging; \n− clearing of\
    \ the quartenary canal (for the cotton crop); \n− provision of seed and fertilizer;\
    \ \n− crop protection; \n− the securing of a supplementary labor force when necessary;\
    \ \n− the securing of the credit (in cash and kind) associated with all those\
    \ functions; and \n− the collection and marketing of the crop \n \nIt is thus\
    \ responsible for the major functions affecting the quality of the cotton crop,\
    \ and the \nefficiency of its management is the major determinate of cotton yields.\
    \ \n \nTenants’ initiative and responsibility, in turns, are exercised only in\
    \ planting, supervision of \nwatering in the hawasha, cultivating (weeding), picking\
    \ and delivery to the cotton \ncollection center. Their work that has to be carried\
    \ out according to timetable, is closed \ncontrolled. It is noticeable here, as\
    \ RUTHENBERG (1963:706-7) pointed out, to find side \nby side primitive and high\
    \ mechanized processes. Cotton planting by hand and \n„Grabstock“, field plowing\
    \ by tractors and pest control by plane. However, this kind of \npartnership between\
    \ the scheme, government, and tenants „production under close \nsupervision“,\
    \ he argues, is successful since it enables the tenants to share the responsibility\
    \ \n                                                             \n173  NHAC 1981:ANNEX\
    \ 7, APPENDEX 1, p. 4,5 and 24. \n \n143 \nand- beside the high level of the agricultural\
    \ technique- achieves a good  monetary result \nfor the scheme as well.174 \n\
    In the light of the triple-partnership between the Corporation/government and\
    \ the tenant, \nthe Corporation had established three accounts; joint accounts,\
    \ the general, and individual \naccounts175. The first one, Joint Account (JA),\
    \ had played a long time ago an essential role \nin all public irrigation schemes:\
    \ \n \nJoint Accounts (JA): the components of such accounts are demonstrated in\
    \ Table 5.3. \n \nDistribution of Returns: \n \ni - The following items should\
    \ be allocated after deducting from the joint accounts any \nduties or taxes,\
    \ at the following rates: \n \na) 2% for the local people’s government. \n \n\
    b) 5% for social services. \n \nii- The Corporation and the tenants share those\
    \ rates as follows: \n \n- The Corporation shall pay 50% \n \n- Tenants shall\
    \ pay 50%. \n \nThe payments of tenants’ share should be played from the sales\
    \ of cotton, subject to rates \nand at appointed periods recommended by the Board\
    \ of Directors. \n \nThe General Account of Tenants: this account register the\
    \ full share of tenants from the \nnet returns on cotton, as well as the total\
    \ share of profits allotted to them from any other \nprofit sharing crop. The\
    \ net general account of tenants should be apportioned among \ntenants in accordance\
    \ with the weight and the grades of the cotton delivered to the \nCorporation.\
    \ \n \nIndividual Accounts of Tenants: according to this account, the Corporation\
    \ issue an \naccount book, against payment to every tenant, in which all loans\
    \ he might take will be \ndebited against his individual account, and this book\
    \ will also register details and grades of \ncotton delivered by the tenant to\
    \ the Corporation. Furthermore, the following items should \nbe deducted from\
    \ the individual tenant accounts: \n  \n                                     \
    \                        \n174 RUTHENBERG (1963:709-13) argues that agricultural\
    \ „production under close/strict supervision“ is not \ngeneral applicable principle.\
    \ A successful agriculture ‘production under close/strict supervision’ yet : (1)\
    \ \nrequires good trained staff; (2) it must be fiscal profitable; (3) diversity\
    \ can be endangered for its success. \nMonoculture or concentrating the control\
    \ on one special crop is advisable; (4) to cover the costs of control, \nthe productivity\
    \ should be high; (5) it is necessary to recken also with the fact that instructions\
    \ alone are \nnot enough. It is advisable to put the participators in an „strained\
    \ relationship“ between ‘pressure’ and \n‘incentive’. The most important incentive\
    \ in this connection is the high income. On the other side, as \nexample for the\
    \ pressure element he designate a- the lease must be proved before it renewal,\
    \ b- the \nobligatory sale through the scheme Management. It looks like those\
    \ two elements or techniques of \nPRICE’s empirical analysis (SCOTT/MITCHELL 1972:222)-\
    \ discussed in chapter 2.4 - i.e., integrate and \ncontrol, by which an Organisation\
    \ exercises influence over participation behavior. But in Price’s \nhypothesis\
    \ play sanctions the central role; (6) we mustn’t forget that such system of supervision\
    \ could be \nfaced with resistance from those concerned. The Organisation required\
    \ then intuitive understanding and  \ntaking this in account; and (7) the scheme\
    \ manager needs to have political backing support and to feel \neconomically independent.\

    \ \nOn the other hand, the share of the tenant from the net general tenants’ account\
    \ has \nregistered to his credit in his individual account. \n \n \n145 \nCritique\
    \ of The Production Relationship  \n \nThe survival and growth of societies depends\
    \ on generating a set of production relations \nwhich allow individuals or households\
    \ to carry out their current and intertemporal decisions \neffectively (BINSWANGER/ROSENZWEIG\
    \ 1989:505).176 Production relations therefore \nshould be expected to adapt,\
    \ however imperfectly, to the current and intertemporal \nproblems faced by people.\
    \ Thereby, the authors understand the production relations as \njointly determined\
    \ (1) by aspirations for higher incomes, for lowering risks, and for dealing \n\
    with misfortunes, (2) by the material and technological constraints faced in the\
    \ specific \nenvironment, and (3) by behavioral and technological constraints\
    \ information acquisition \nand transmission.  \n \nDiscussion with farmers, in\
    \ the scope of NHIRP (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 8, p.7), has found \nthat the practiced\
    \ Joint Account system is a disincentive to them to grow cotton. They do \nnot\
    \ expect revenues from cotton sales because „very often the cotton accounts are\
    \ burdened \nwith debts accumulated from previous years. Together with the debits\
    \ of the concerning \nyear the balances of the cotton accounts are often negative,\
    \ thus the debts are not paid \nback“.177 The remarkable result from this situation\
    \ was deterioration in the cultivated and \nharvested cotton areas and therefore\
    \ negative influence on the whole schemes concerning \nthe ‘relations’ and ‘production’.\
    \ \n \nBecause of the importance of cotton in the Sudan’s economy, the Rehabilitation\
    \ study has \nargued that „the reorganization of the relationship between the\
    \ corporation and the tenants \nconcerning the costs and revenues of cotton is\
    \ the most important and most critical point of \nall measures in the Scheme”\
    \ NHIRP (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 8, p.12). The study has \nrecommended, therefore, the\
    \ need of short-term measures, working together with the \nsolution worked out\
    \ by the IBRD178, to establish a modified Joint Account system avoiding \nsome\
    \ disadvantages of the traditional system, and find an eventual solution for the\
    \ whole \nSudan179. In the long run, assumed the study, that the Joint Account\
    \ system will be replaced \nby a system fulfilling the following criteria NHIRP\
    \ (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 8, p.13-4): \n \n− cotton bares only those costs that it itself\
    \ occasions; \n \n \n                                                        \
    \     \n176 This study undertake a step towards a more general theory of production\
    \ relations in agriculture. The \napproach it pursue „attempt to provide an analytical\
    \ framework capable of assisting the joint analysis of \nthe major features of\
    \ production relations in rural areas, that is, one which will look at the institution\
    \ \ngoverning production and the exchange (or lack thereof) of outputs and of\
    \ all primary factors of \nproduction.“ To do this, it incorporate into the analysis\
    \ risk, risk version, and information problems \njointly and simultaneously with\
    \ the material features of agriculture and the material attributes of the \nfactors\
    \ of production. \n177 Though the JA has been, later, changed, one still hears\
    \ such complaints as we will see in the next chapter. \n178 The Agricultural Rehabilitation\
    \ Program Credit has included funds for a Study of cost recovery and tenant \n\
    charge systems in the public irrigation schemes of Sudan. This has resulted in\
    \ IBRD’s Report (1980). \n179 The abolition of „partnership and the joint account\
    \ systems“ has been announced in the light of the \nPresidential Declaration to\
    \ Parliament (June 1980).  \n \n146 \n− the cotton price paid to the farmers is\
    \ directly derived from the world market price, \nand does not depend on the quality\
    \ of cotton produced in the Scheme and the costs \nof the corporation other than\
    \ marketing costs180; \n− the farmers receive most of the payment upon delivery\
    \ of the cotton to the \ncollection center by deducting all costs of the Corporation\
    \ directly related to cotton. \nthe remainder would be received 12 months afterwards\
    \ at the latest. \n \nFurthermore, the solutions that have proposed by the IBRD\
    \ (1980:15) and adopted by the \nRehabilitation study say: \n \n• a credit and\
    \ service contract would be signed every year by the Corporation and each \ntenant;\
    \ \n• the cost for machinery services and materials would be charged to that crop\
    \ which had \ncaused them; \n• the overhead costs would be recovered by a farm\
    \ service charge amount to LS 150 per  \ntenant per annum. \n \nIn view of the\
    \ above mentioned background, the 1981/82 agricultural season witnessed a \nmajor\
    \ change in production relations in all irrigated schemes in the Sudan, where\
    \ the Joint \nAccount system was replaced by an individual account system known\
    \ as the land and \nwater charge (LWC). One of the main justifications put forward\
    \ by the IMF-World Bank \nfor that charge was said to be based on efficiency grounds\
    \ (SALEEM, 1989:1); the so-\ncalled „Marshallian inefficiency.“ The assumption\
    \ here, which is based on the Marshallian \ntheory of sharecropping181, is that\
    \ the JA as a sharecropping arrangement would result in \ninefficient allocation\
    \ of resources relative to the LWC system as a fixed-rent contract.182 \n \nGendettu\
    \ Scheme \n \nProduction relations in Gendettu has been influenced, like the other\
    \ governments’ Schemes, \nby the above-mentioned development. Farmers are connected\
    \ with the Scheme through \ntwo kinds of fixed-rent contracts. The first is leasehold\
    \ and water contract for the \ntenancies, whereas the second; water contract,\
    \ is devoted to freehold lands. The Scheme \nitself is no longer, since 1.7.1992,\
    \ financial dependent on NAPC. All NAPC Schemes \nhave now individual account\
    \ and have therefore raised the water prices to cover the \noperation costs. \n\
    \ \n \n                                                             \n180 Within\
    \ this area of interest, a recent positive change in the cotton pricing system\
    \ in the neighbor country \nEgypt, has motivated the producers to keep their performance\
    \ high, after long conflict with problems like \nthose in Sudan.  \n181 See Chapter\
    \ Three, Section 3.1.3.4. \n182 By using a model based on the Cobb-Douglas production\
    \ function, and assuming that there are two \nvariable inputs and one fixed input,\
    \ SALEEM (1989:22)  has investigated the relative efficiency of the JA \nand the\
    \ LWC systems by comparing the economic performance of cotton farms in the other\
    \ two large \ncotton schemes in Sudan. The empirical results indicate that cotton\
    \ farms under a JA system (Gezira) \nand those under a LWC system (Rahad) are\
    \ equally relative technical efficient, equally relative price \nefficient, and\
    \ hence equally relative economic efficient. Similar investigation was also carried\
    \ out by \nMOROOKA and HAYAMI (1989) in an upland area in West Java where the\
    \ share tenancy contract was \ncommonly practiced side-by-side with the fixed-rent\
    \ contract. Consistent with other experiences tested by \nOTSUKA and HAYAMI (1988:40),\
    \ no significant inefficiency in resource allocation was found to be \nassociated\
    \ with share tenancy as compared with owner cultivation and fixed-rent tenancy.\
    \ \n \n147 \n5.4.3  Some Features of Organization Structures \n \nThis part of\
    \ the study will focus initially on the horizontal and vertical dimension of the\
    \ two \nconcerned structures. Whereas the other dimensions of the organizational\
    \ structure i.e., \nformalization and the water users’ side of configuration183,\
    \ will be further discussed in the \ncoming chapter. \n \nNew Halfa Scheme \n\
    \ \nNew Halfa Scheme is managed by the New Halfa Agricultural Corporation (NHAC)\
    \ whose \nadministration is based on forms and procedures, to a big extent, like\
    \ the Gezira Scheme \nwhich inherit this from the British. As prescribed in the\
    \ Establishment Order for the \nCorporation (Chapter 3), the Board of Management\
    \ was composed of a Chairman and 12 \nmembers. The composition of the Board was\
    \ as follows (NHAC 1980: ANNEX 7,p56): \n \n− representative of Kassala Province\
    \ \n− representative of the Ministry of Agriculture \n− representative of the\
    \ Ministry of Irrigation \n− representative of the Agricultural Research Authority\
    \ \n− representative of the Ministry of Finance \n− Assistant Commissioner Agriculture,\
    \ Kassala Province \n− four members of Tenant Farmers’ Union (TFU) \n− two representatives\
    \ of NHAC personnel (staff and workers) \n \nAs it is shown in Fig.5.8, the structure\
    \ of NHAC (1980) contains three main Departments; \nFinancial and Administration,\
    \ Engineering, and Agricultural Department. For the purpose \nof this study, it\
    \ will be concentrated on the last one, which consider, in the same time, the\
    \ \nmost important Department. However, the other Departments and their functions\
    \ will be \nreferred to through the discussion of the modifications and changes\
    \ recommended by \nNHIRP. \n \nThe main responsibilities of the Department of\
    \ Agriculture are in the field of supervising \n(THORNTON/WYNN, 1987:210): \n\
    \ \n1. clearance and preparation of land; \n2. distribution of seed, fertilizer\
    \ and tools and provision of financing loans and machinery \nservices for crops;\
    \ \n3. supervision of watering and farming practices; \n4. plant protection measures;\
    \ and \n5. the transport, ginning and marketing of the cotton crop.  \n \nThe\
    \ structure embrace then different set of activities: agricultural services (agricultural\
    \ \nextension with research support) and -as in new settlement schemes- commercial\
    \ services \n(input supplies, credit, marketing). Cotton marketing is an integral,\
    \ indeed central, part of \nthe organization. \n \n \n                       \
    \                                      \n183 According to COWARD (1980), there\
    \ is two important Organisational configurations in irrigation system, \ni.e.,\
    \ the role of water users and the various water-authority roles. \n \n148 \nFig.\

    \ structure at \nsection and block level. Figure 5.10 breaks this down further\
    \ and shows the Organization \nat section level under the assumption that the\
    \ section is divided into three Blocks. This is \nthe theoretical or recommended\
    \ division but, in fact, many of these posts, as it would be \nshown in the next\
    \ chapter, are not necessarily filled. For instance, A extensionist, \nhorticultural,\
    \ plant protection, and maintenance inspectors are usually not filled and they\
    \ \nfulfil their duties, if at all, through their departments in the headquarters.\
    \ \n \nThe structure of the staff (Extension Officers) at block and section levels\
    \ as demonstrated \nin Table 5.4 provide an extension ratio of 1 EO : 214 tenants.\
    \ Under conditions of reduced \nwater supply and assuming 70 per cent of tenants\
    \ present in the Scheme, as assumed by \nNHIRP 184, the 103 Extension Service\
    \ Staff at block and section levels provide an \noperational ratio of 1 EO : 150.\
    \ Taking the 23 not occupied posts into consideration, the \nactual ratio in season\
    \ 92/93 was 1 EO : 275 tenants or 1 EO: 193 tenants respectively. \nOperationally,\
    \ it is the block level EOs who are principally in regular contact with the \n\
    tenant farmer. That is why the NHIRP has maintained: „the major concentration\
    \ of retained \nExtension Service manpower should be at the Block level“ (NHAC\
    \ 1986:Annex 7, p.68). \nThereby, It has been proposed the following establishment\
    \ of extension staff: \n                                                     \
    \        \n184 Estimates are made in this study (NHAC 1980:ANNEX 8, Chapter 2.6)\
    \ of variation in the number of \ntenants in the Scheme under reducing water supply,\
    \ using alternate assumptions of minimum acceptable \nincome with declining tenant\
    \ numbers, and tenant populations with declining income. \n \n150 \n \n \nFig.\

    \ various records of the Scheme \n \nThe number and qualifications of personnel\
    \ working at different levels is an essential \nfeature of organization structure.\
    \ Table 5.3 shows that the structure of field level can be \ndescribed as ‘top-heavy’.\
    \ This means that a disproportionate number of the staff assigned to \nhigher\
    \ levels (posts from Third to Fifth). In addition, the fact that most staff with\
    \ higher \neducation and professional qualifications assigned to the upper levels,\
    \ with only less \nformally qualified staff running the system at lower levels,\
    \ reveals the qualitative \ndimension of the structure. \n \nThe functions and\
    \ responsibilities of each inspector can be said to fall roughly into the \nfollowing\
    \ categories: \n \n \n \n \n153 \n- administration \n \n- staff relationships\
    \ \n \n- equipment \n- irrigation \n- crop husbandry \n \n- extension \n \n \n\
    - control of Joint Account. \n \nFor many reasons, the functions have become confined\
    \ to Joint Account control had taking \nup the vast majority of the personnel’s\
    \ time. This orientation of the staff reflects then the \nfact that an objective\
    \ like collecting the earnings of cotton is more important than this of \nmaintaining\
    \ optimal day-to-day water deliveries for instance. In this connection NHIRP has\
    \ \nreported: „Due to the Joint Account commitments and the lack of communications,\
    \ \nagricultural staff have inexorably been maneuvered into the present situation\
    \ of Joint \nAccount controllers rather than Extension officers“ (NHAC 1986:ANNEX\
    \ 2, p.45). \nConsidering this fact, one can say that, here, the degree of administrative\
    \ intensity as \ndefined by PRICE/MUELLER185 is high. Though, in irrigation systems,\
    \ it is difficult to \ndistinguish the administrative and production staff. \n\
    \ \nThereby, it has been suggested that the services of the inspectors should\
    \ be directed to true \nextension work with the primary aim of improving the yields\
    \ and incomes of the tenants in \ntheir respective areas, not working their limited\
    \ manpower resources in the financials field. \nNote that, as SAGARDOY (1986:12)\
    \ has revealed, this activity of water management; \nassistance and extension\
    \ to farmers on water management at the local level, often failed in \nthe large\
    \ project organizations (specially settlement schemes) against the other mentioned\
    \ \nactivities. Furthermore, securing/or guarantee the mechanical inputs means\
    \ that inspector \ncan spend time with tenants discussing the „nuts and bots“\
    \ of crop production, irrigation, \ntenant inputs, labor requirements, cost/benefit\
    \ comparisons and all other aspects of \nextension. Time would be required to\
    \ train tenants to use irrigation water efficiently. \nEmphasis should be placed\
    \ on the income potential of tenants (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 2, \np.46).186 \n \nTo enable\
    \ field inspectors taking over these broad tasks, recommendations put forward\
    \ for \nconsideration by NHIRP concerning the internal organization of NHAC (NHAC\
    \ \n1986:ANNEX 7, p.61-7): \n \n1. The Tenant Credit Unit (TCU): responsible for\
    \ the control of all ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ \ncredit provided by NHAC to the\
    \ tenant, and for the assessment and provision of \nmedium-term credit to the\
    \ co-operative sector. It is directly responsible to the financial \ncontroller\
    \ provided under the project. It’s own field staff (Field credit officers) located\
    \ at \nsection and Block levels, could be constituted by the suitably retrained\
    \ accountants, \nbookkeepers and cashiers previously responsible to the dissolved\
    \ Field Divisions. \n \n2. Agricultural Extension Service Reorganization: as set\
    \ out above, the essence of the \nmodification of their role is the removal from\
    \ the agricultural field inspectors of \n                                    \
    \                         \n185 PRICE and MUELLER (1986:27) define this variable,\
    \ which is significant for management but is not \nclearly structural, as: „the\
    \ extent to which an organization allocates resources to the management of its\
    \ \noutput...An organization with a high degree of administrative intensity is\
    \ sometimes said to have a \nrelatively large ‘administrative apparatus’ or ‘supportive\
    \ component’.“ This variable can be \nperationalized as the ratio within a bureaucracy\
    \ of administrative staff (A) to production staff (P), i.e., \nA/P (UPHOFF 1991:49).\
    \  \n186 In spite of the abolition of JA system, many respondents from scheme\
    \ Management and tenants have \npointed out that the role of inspectors is still\
    \ limited in the area of cotton administration as will be coming \nin the next\
    \ Chapter. \n \n154 \nresponsibility for credit operations. In addition to expanding\
    \ the structure of the \nExtension Service at field level, the coming related\
    \ modifications are of interest: \na. Extension Service Tasks: Crop/Livestock\
    \ Integration: it is also proposed that the \nreorganized Extension Service be\
    \ retrained so that it may operate an integrated program \nof crop-and animal\
    \ -husbandry counseling. They would thus at one and the  same time, \nbe crop\
    \ and livestock counselors. \nb. Livestock Extension Officers: Dual Control and\
    \ Incentives: it is proposed that the \nextension officer, when working in the\
    \ context of the Livestock Development Program, \nwould be subject to the control\
    \ of the Livestock Advisers attached to the Livestock \nProduction and Marketing\
    \ Unit (LPMU), a separate body within the overall scheme. As \nsuch, the EO will\
    \ be subject to dual control: while consoling tenants on Livestock, he \nwill\
    \ be responsible to the Livestock Adviser of the LPMU; in his role as crop-husbandry\
    \ \nadviser, he will be responsible to, and continue to be paid from, NHAC. \n\
    \ \n3. The Development Planning Unit (Technical Planning Office): as part of an\
    \ existing \nTechnical Planning Office (TPO), a Development Planning Unit (DPU)\
    \ should be \nestablished to assist management in designing appropriate monitoring\
    \ and evaluation \nsystems and to furnish economic, financial and technical information\
    \ to management as \nthe basis for sound operations and planning. \n \nGiving\
    \ more attention to the social context of the scheme management, NHIRP has \n\
    proposed modifications or innovations in NHAC’s relations with a number of external\
    \ \nagencies (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 7,p.2). The argument for these organizational changes\
    \ is to \nensure efficient Scheme management and effective co-ordination of scheme\
    \ operations and \nplanning. It has therefore suggested that the involvement of\
    \ institutions in scheme \nOrganization should be expanded by immediate additional\
    \ appointments to the Board. At \nministerial level, it was proposed that a Central\
    \ Monitoring Unit should be established \nwithin the Ministry of agriculture to\
    \ monitor NHAC’s performance and anticipate \noperational constraints. In addition,\
    \ a liaison Committee should be established at inter-\nMinisterial level, to facilitate\
    \ planning for the agricultural corporations, including NHAC. \nAt scheme level,\
    \ in the same time, it was proposed that: \n \n− the Ministry of Irrigation, through\
    \ its irrigation service and the Earth Moving \nCorporation, should assume greater\
    \ responsibility for field water management and \nquaternary canal maintenance\
    \ respectively; \n− the constitution and financing of the Tenant Farmers’ Union\
    \ should be reviewed, \nwith a view to its financial participation in a project\
    \ scheme-wide impact such as the \nLivestock Production and Marketing Unit (LPMU);\
    \ \n− All seasonal and medium-term cash credit operations (crop and Livestock)\
    \ in the \nscheme area should be handled directly by the Agricultural Bank of\
    \ Sudan (ABS). \nABS would appoint Block-level Agricultural Credit Officer; and\
    \ it would act as \nconsultant in the establishment of the Tenant Credit Unit.\
    \      \n \nAccording to the above, the additional appointments to the Board have\
    \ been recommended \n(NHAC 1986:ANNEX 7, p56-9) \n \n \n \n \n155 \n− the Manager,\
    \ ABS (Agricultural Bank of Sudan) New Halfa Branch \n− the chairman or Managing\
    \ Director of the LPMU \n− a representative of the Ministry of Co-operation, Trade\
    \ and Commerce \n− financial controller \n− the head of the Technical Planning\
    \ Office \n− two Seats on the Board have to be accorded to the co-operative sector\
    \ \n− the new Halfa Agricultural Secondary School would be brought into a closer\
    \ \nrelationship with the Co-operation. \n \nAs a result of these proposed changes,\
    \ and to ensure rapidity in decision-making by those \nmost closely concerned\
    \ in the current operations of the scheme, NHIRP (NHAC \n1986:ANNEX 7, p.2, 59,60)\
    \ has also suggested that „a two-tier Board system“ should be \ninstituted in\
    \ NHAC. Namely: „an enlarged Policy Board to accommodate the increased \nmember\
    \ of agencies having an interest in Scheme policy and co-ordination with NHAC,\
    \ \nand a Working Board to ensure efficient operational management“ (Fig.5.11).\
    \ The \nWorking Board which would exercise all the powers of, and be responsible\
    \ to, the full \nBoard (or policy Board) composed of 7 members: 1) Director General\
    \ (NHAC) \n(Chairman); 2) Manager, ABS New Halfa Branch; 3) Chairman or Managing\
    \ Director, \nLPMU; 4) a representative of the Ministry of Irrigation; 5) two\
    \ representatives of the \nTenant Farmers’ Union; and 6) the Financial Controller\
    \ appointed under the Project. \nMinutes of all its meetings have to be distributed\
    \ monthly to members of the Policy Board \nand transmitted to the proposed Central\
    \ Monitoring Unit. Yet, it would report quarterly in a \nfull meeting of the policy\
    \ Board. \n \nIn the same vein, the purpose of the Policy Board would be „to give\
    \ influence in Scheme \naffairs to as wide a range as possible of institutions\
    \ directly affected by corporation \nactivity“. It has to meet quarterly to review\
    \ the management of the Working Board and \nbroad NHAC policy. It's particularly\
    \ concerned with the work the Technical Planning \nOffice (TPO) and its Development\
    \ Planning Unit (DPU). Minutes of Policy Board \nmeetings are transmitted quarterly\
    \ to the Monitoring Unit of the Ministry. In addition to the \ncomposition of\
    \ the old Board (12 members) includes the full policy Board the Following \nmembers\
    \ (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 7, p.61): \n \n− the manager, ABS New Halfa Branch \n− Chairman\
    \ or Managing Director, LPMU \n− a representative of the Ministry of Co-operation,\
    \ Commerce and Supply \n− the Director, New Halfa Agricultural Secondary School\
    \ \n− two representatives of the co-operative movement \n− the Financial Controller\
    \ appointed under the Project \n− the Head of the Technical Planning Office. \n\

    \ \nSource: NHAC 1986: ANNEX 7:62 \n \n \n157 \nGendettu Scheme \n \nThe regional\
    \ organization; The Northern Agricultural Production Corporation (NAPC), \nwhich\
    \ supervise the management of Gendettu Scheme (Chapter 5.3.2), has been \nestablished\
    \ according to the presidential order No. 512 of September 16th, 1979. Like the\
    \ \nother nine agricultural Corporations that manage the irrigation systems in\
    \ the Sudan, the \nBoard of Directors has been expanded and composed of 22 members\
    \ including all \nconcerned ministers and institutions as well as 6 representatives\
    \ of Tenants. To simplify the \nadministration of it’s Schemes, NAPC has subdivided\
    \ Nile Province into three Zones each \nof which has a Zone Manager, and the overall\
    \ headquarters is located at Ed Damer: \n \n− Southern Zone, administrated from\
    \ Shendi; includes Gendettu, Kelli, Kaboushia \nand Seyal; \n− Central Zone, administrated\
    \ from Atbara; it includes Aliab, Kitiab, Fadlab and \nBawga; \n− Zeidab, being\
    \ such a large Scheme with unique cropping pattern, is a Zone in its \nown right.\
    \ \n \nDirectors of the three main Departments; Agricultural, Civil and Mechanical\
    \ Engineering \nhad therefore taken their tasks through four Regions Managers\
    \ (Fig. 5.12). The Regions’ \nsystem has been canceled since the financial year\
    \ 92/93. Thereafter, the managers of the \ndifferent departments in the schemes\
    \ have become directly responsible to the main \ndepartments in Ed Damer and Atbara\
    \ 187. \n \nIn Gendettu, for instance, there are three main figures who have different\
    \ orientations and \ncome through different courses: \n \n1- the manager of the\
    \ Scheme (agriculturist), responsible in the face of the managing \ndirector of\
    \ NAPC;  \n2- the mechanical engineer, responsible to the main department in Atbara.\
    \ He supervise, \ntechnically, the mechanical staff in Gendettu and the other\
    \ three Schemes in the \nsouthern region; and  \n3- irrigation engineer (Operations\
    \ & Maintenance), responsible to the related department \nin Ed Damer and works\
    \ also with his staff in the other three Schemes in the same time \n(Fig. 5.13).\
    \ \n \nThe staff of both the mechanical and irrigation/civile engineers in Gendettu\
    \ scheme are \nresponsible, administratively, to the Manager of the Scheme, and\
    \ technically to the \nformers. This duplicity was and still a cause of several\
    \ management problems (e.g., create \ncontradiction between the administrative\
    \ and technical decisions) and through which the \nhierarchical control seems\
    \ to be semi-opaque (see Chapter 6.1.2). \n \n                               \
    \                              \n187 Atbara is the headquarters of the Mechanical\
    \ Engineering Department of the NAPC. \n \n158 \nFig. 5.12 Organization Chart\
    \ of NAPC  \nSource: Author's own view \n \n \n159 \nFig. 5.13 Organization Chart\
    \ in Gendettu Scheme (1992/93) \n \n \nSource: Author's own view \n \n \nThe agricultural\
    \ staff in Gendettu consists of Senior Agriculturists (Scheme Manager -\ndegree\
    \ in agriculture B.Sc., Fifth degree), Inspector (Agri. Second. School, Seventh\
    \ \ndegree), 2 Inspector (diploma - high Institute, Eighth degree) and Agriculturist\
    \ (Agri. \nSecond. School, Eleventh degree). Their responsibilities are mainly\
    \ concerned with scheme \nand farmer administration, water distribution and management,\
    \ rather than the technical \naspects of agriculture. In the concrete, their main\
    \ task is to distribute water and to identify \nthe area under each crop on which\
    \ water rates must be paid. Thereby, once again, the role \nof agricultural staff\
    \ as extension agents, by which they can pass their knowledge to the \nfarmers\
    \ is, specially after the new production relations, subservient to that of persuasion\

    \ at all stages of small-farmer \ndevelopment to ensure the timely supply of other\
    \ inputs besides water (SAGARDOY, \n1986:13). The agricultural services available\
    \ to Gendettu’s tenants are provided by several \ndifferent organizations in the\
    \ public sector as well as local merchants and entrepreneurs in \nthe private\
    \ sector. The main services involved are farm machinery, plant protection, \n\
    extension, agricultural credit and inputs. However, once these agencies are in\
    \ a position to \ntack direct responsibility for such services, the best results\
    \ may be achieved through good \ncoordination between them and the scheme organization\
    \ (see Chapter 6.5.3). \n \n5.4.4  Technical Context \n \nWhere the water for\
    \ an irrigation system comes from (source factor) and how it is acquired, \nis\
    \ the first technical aspect. This affects how irrigation water is managed. In\
    \ New Halfa, \nirrigation water is fed by gravity from Khashm El Girba Dam on\
    \ the Atbara River. The first \ndetailed study of the possibility of using the\
    \ waters of the Atbara for gravity irrigation was \nmade in 1954 (THORNTON/WYNN,\
    \ 1987:202). Due to the great fluctuation of discharge \nin the Blue Nile and\
    \ the fact that no water flows in the Atbara River after December, pumps \nhave\
    \ not been used near those rivers (FUKUDA, 1976:265). \n \nNew Halfa Scheme \n\
    \ \n5.4.4.1  Khashm El Girba Dam  \n \nIt was the 1954 investigation which drew\
    \ attention to the advantages of the Khashm El \nGirba site for a dam. Plans and\
    \ canalization were started in 1958, and June 1961 saw the \nfirst excavation\
    \ of the dame site. The construction was completed in 1964. This rapid \nexploitation\
    \ of opportunities, owes its impetus largely to the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement\
    \ \nas mentioned in Chapter 4. Theoretically, in most cases, managers of reservoir\
    \ systems can \nconcentrate their efforts on allocation and distribution, not\
    \ supply (UPHOFF, 1991:79). But \nthis is not the case in New Halfa. It appears\
    \ that the cropped area is sometimes limited by \nthe water available from the\
    \ dam, which is affected by extensive silting of the reservoir and \nalso by the\
    \ policy followed for hydropower generation (MINSTRY of IRRIGATION 1992, \nVol.\
    \ 3 of 4:F5). The initial reservoir capacity of 1.3 milliard has been seriously\
    \ reduced by \nheavy siltation and estimated recently between 0.65 milliard (SALEH,\
    \ 1989) and less than \n0.80 milliard (1993), according to the Technical Office\
    \ of the Scheme. \n \nThe extremely variable regime of the Atbara dictate the\
    \ manner of dam management. \nNinety per cent of the river’s median annual flow\
    \ is passed in the three months July to \nSeptember. During this period, the reservoir\
    \ is filled. From October to June, the river’s flow \ncan only be regarded as\
    \ sufficient to compensate for evaporation and seepage losses and for \nthe flow\
    \ of water which will in the future be left in the river downstream from the Dam.\
    \ \nDuring this period, therefore, irrigation relies on the stored water of the\
    \ reservoir. \n \n5.4 4.2   The Layout of The New Halfa Irrigation Canal System188\
    \  \n \nThe main difference found in the layout of systems is in the number of\
    \ levels of operation \nand organization they have (UPHOFF, 1991:32). This is\
    \ defined by the hierarchy of points \n                                      \
    \                       \n188 This part draws on the New Halfa Irrigation Rehabilitation\
    \ Project (NHAC 1986 ANNEX 1). \n \n161 \nat which water can be divided and controlled.\
    \ However, the number of levels in an \nirrigation system reflects the size of\
    \ its command area. Irrigation water is fed by gravity \nfrom Khashm El Girba\
    \ Dam through one main canal, lengthen 26 kilometers to the first \nregulator,\
    \ and three branches; East, West and Sabir Branch which run parallel \n(northwards)\
    \ through the 80 kilometers of the scheme. The regulating devices in the branch\
    \ \ncanals are vertical lift gates, and the discharge is a function of the gate\
    \ opening and the \ndifference in elevation between front water and back water.\
    \ These branches are connected \nwith a series of minor canals through five major\
    \ canals and carriers. \n \nThe minor canals (128) form the irrigation distribution\
    \ system of the Scheme. Because of \nthe slope of the land (roughly 45 cms. per\
    \ km.), the cost of excavating and regulating minor \ncanals having night storage\
    \ capacity on the Gezira pattern (where land slope is roughly 15 \ncms. per km.)\
    \ is more expensive189. To reduce costs at New Halfa, however, it was decided\
    \ \nto run a continuous flow of water to the fields, making night watering necessary.\
    \ In \npractice, this proved far from satisfactory. The resettled Halfaween were\
    \ unused to night \nwatering and have been reluctant to water at night for fear\
    \ of scorpions and snakes \n(PEARSON, 1980:2 and HORNTON/WYNN, 1987:206). In light\
    \ of this, night storage \ncapacity has been provided in the minors of phase II\
    \ and III of the scheme. This means, \nthere are two types of distributaries:\
    \ \n \n1. Minors designed for continuous irrigation: These minors are found in\
    \ the first \nconstructed phase of the Scheme; the south part of the Scheme where\
    \ the nubians have \nbeen resettled, as well as in the area of pumped extension.\
    \ They are situated at spacing \nof 2,840 meters and take the water directly from\
    \ a branch canal or are connected to a \nbranch via a carrier. The cheek structures\
    \ are pipe regulators or well head regulators, \nthe latter to facilitate calibration,\
    \ although no flow is measured within a minor.  \n \n2. Minors designed with night\
    \ storage facilities are found in the areas which were \ndeveloped after 1965\
    \ (in the nomads’ areas). The spacing between these minors is \n1,420 meters,\
    \ and the design is basically the same as for the minors for continuous \nirrigation,\
    \ except that the pipe and well head regulators are replaced by circular night\
    \ \nstorage weirs. \n \nAlong each minor canal, at intervals of 296 meters, field\
    \ outlet pipes (FOPs) pass the water \ninto 300 quarternary canals, known as Abu\
    \ Ishreens (Abu XXs). These canals, which \nconstitute the boundary of our focus/interest,\
    \ convey the water to the individual fields (Fig. \n5.16). The field offtakes\
    \ are 35 cm diameter concrete pipes through which flow can be \nregulated by a\
    \ valve having three opening positions. The Abu Ishreens that draw their \nsupply\
    \ from continuous watering canals have a length of 2.8 km (known as the long Abu\
    \ \nIshreens) and rotate the water over 36 fields of 5 feddan. This is called\
    \ a number.  \n                                                             \n\
    189 In this context, NIRP (1992) has reported: „there is evidence to indicate\
    \ that farmers and Agricultural \nAuthorities would prefer to use night storage\
    \ and daytime irrigation, for some but not all crop growth \nstages, if the water\
    \ supply in the Minors were suitably reliable: the change of operation mode away\
    \ from \nnight storage in recent decades may be partly due to the sediment and\
    \ weeds rather than the other way \nround“ (Vol. 3 of 4:F13).  \n \n162 \nFig.\
    \ 5.14 Layout of Irrigation Field Distribution System \n \n \n \nSource: NHAC\
    \ 1986: ANNEX 1:18 \n \nThe design capacity of these quarternary canals is 10,000\
    \ m³/day. Due to weed growth, \nsiltation and delayed maintenance, the present\
    \ capacities are much smaller (NHAC 1986: \nANNEX 1:17). This capacity is official\
    \ estimated in 1992/93 as 5,000 m³/day190. According \nto many informants, the\
    \ irrational estimation of the flows appear to be the main problem in \n     \
    \                                                        \n190 A survey carried\
    \ out in November 1979 with a currentmeter showed that a discharge of 3 000 m³/day\
    \ was \ntypical (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 1:17). The senior irrigation Engineer of the\
    \ Scheme argues that the actual \ndischarge become - in the season 92/93 - 2 500\
    \ m³/day. \n \n \n163 \nthe distribution system in New Halfa and Gendettu as well191.\
    \ It results in, the period of \nirrigation takes to long, and the irrigation\
    \ interval becomes much too large. \n \nThe Abu Ishreens that draw their supply\
    \ from minor canals with storage capacity are 1.4 \nkm long and irrigate a short\
    \ ‘number’ (18 fields of 5 feddan). The capacity of these Abu \nIshreens is the\
    \ same as the ‘long’ Abu Ishreens but they operate for only 12 hours/day in \n\
    the irrigation season, whereas the latter (the 2,8 km long canals) should operate\
    \ 24 \nhours/day. \n \nAn attempt has been made to solve the problem of the long\
    \ Abu Ishreens; being too long to \nrotate the water efficiently over the fields,\
    \ by introducing two quartenary canals (twin Abu \nIshreens, known as El double)\
    \ running parallel to each other. The first of which rotates the \nwater over\
    \ the first 18 fields (90 feddan), and the second of which rotates the water in\
    \ the \nsecond 90 feddan. Due to the fact that these twin Abu Ishreens have only\
    \ one offtake at the \nminor, and the farmer sometimes perforates the bank between\
    \ the two Abu Ishreens, the \nimprovement in water distribution is only minor\
    \ (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 1 p.19). \n \nAs is shown in Figure 5.12, a small field canal\
    \ (lateral water course), named Abu Sita (Abu \nVI), runs along the side of the\
    \ field. The design capacity of an Abu Sita is 4 000 m³/24 \nhours. From these\
    \ field canals, the water is led into the field by perforating the bank of the\
    \ \ncanal. A field is divided into basins, and the method of water application\
    \ in the field \ndepends on the crop grown in the field. Groundnuts and cotton\
    \ are normally irrigated in \nsmall furrows in the basins, running parallel to\
    \ the Abu Sita, and they are fed via field \nditches, called Tagnats. This application\
    \ method is also practiced for wheat, but wheat is \nalso irrigated directly from\
    \ the Abu Sita, as well, and the water runs parallel to the abu \nIshreen into\
    \ small basins.   \n  \nGendettu Scheme \n \n5.4.4.3  Gendettu’s Pump Stations192\
    \ \n \nAt Gendettu, the main source of irrigation water is Nile River. The region\
    \ has been \nallocated sufficient water to adequately irrigate 570 392 feddan\
    \ at 100% cropping intensity. \nAs many other irrigation systems, the Scheme use\
    \ more than a single source of water. \nUnderground water is recently being exploited.\
    \ There are, in almost all villages, Wells used \nfor lift irrigation (pump sets).\
    \ If the main system fails, the pump system can compensate. \nThe Scheme is supposed\
    \ to be entirely irrigated by riverine waters tapped by two pump \nstations and\
    \ conveyed by main canal (Fig. 5.15).The pump capacity here play a similar role\
    \ \nlike that of the dam capacity in New Halfa; both of them decide the water\
    \ supply. The \ndescription of pumping plant is as follows: \n \n \n \n      \
    \                                                       \n191 This result come\
    \ to justify the fact that the lack of valid information on either water distribution\
    \ or water \nrequirements is a major constraint on managing irrigation system.\
    \ Two other similar findings have been \npointed out in UPHOFF (1991:64). The\
    \ first has been found by Ford Foundation in four systems in India. \nThe second\
    \ has been documented by IIMI in a Mahaweli system in Sri Lanka. It was found\
    \ that the water \nactually being delivered to farmers be only about half as much\
    \ as the system managers thought was being \nmade available.  \n192 These and\
    \ the irrigation layout’s information are based on the studies of ODA 1986 and\
    \ 1988.  \n \n164 \nFig. 5.15 Gendettu Irrigation Layout \n \n \nSource: ODA 1988:\
    \ A2-6 \n \n \n165 \nI. Floating Pumpstation (Gendettu South): This is the main\
    \ station and contains: \na) 1 large pontoon containing 3 Nr Skoda 6s-160PN engines,\
    \ and \nb) 3 small pontoons each containing 1 Nr Ruston 4 VCBZ engine \nII. Temporary\
    \ Pumpstation (Gendettu North): The station consists of a total of 5 \npumpsets;\
    \ 2 Nr Perkins automative engines, 2 Nr Bedford automotive engines, and 1 Nr \n\
    Perkins engine. \n \nOperation and maintenance tasks for diesel pump stations\
    \ are comparatively more complex \nthan those for electric operated. The reliable\
    \ operation of such systems is, of course, \ndependent on the existence of an\
    \ infrastructure capable of repairing pumps as well as \nmaintaining a steady\
    \ supply of power or fuel. They must also be given a program of \nirrigation quantities\
    \ to be pumped. These considerations are more urgent when the canal \nnetwork\
    \ is mainly supplied from a single large pump station. This will make the need\
    \ for \ngood water management practices, and for the supporting facilities such\
    \ as flow and level \nmeasurement and communication, all the  more urgently needed.\
    \ SAGARDOY (1986:84) \noutlined, in this context, the need for easy communication,\
    \ specially in case of emergency, \nbetween the pump house operator and the officer\
    \ in charge - either telephone or signal or \nrunner. \n \nPumping requirements\
    \ have been determined for the three cropping patterns. The volume \nof water\
    \ required in each ten day period has been converted to an equivalent pumping\
    \ \ncapacity on the assumption that the maximum requirement would be met with\
    \ 18 hour \npumping station operation. This means that the pumping capacities\
    \ have been determined \nto meet the maximum demand in any ten day period and\
    \ don’t represent a continuos \npumping requirement (ODA 1986:A3/2-2). Generally,\
    \ the canal sections are undersized \ndue to siltation and the main contribution\
    \ to conveyance losses is poor water control and \ndistribution. An addition for\
    \ losses of 40% has been used for the determination of pumping \nrequirements\
    \ (ODA 1988:4-4). \n \nThe Scheme is currently fed from a floating pumpstation\
    \ because the offtake is situated on \nan unstable reach in the east bank of the\
    \ river. The original pumpstation is now nearly more \nthan 100 m from the River193.\
    \ Just over 20 years ago a new pumpstation was constructed at \nBerira, some 20\
    \ km upstream of the present site, and a large canal excavated to feed both \n\
    the Gendettu and additional extension areas. However, losses in the canal were\
    \ so large that \nno water was able to reach the Gendettu area and the pumpstation\
    \ and canal were finally \nabandoned \n \nRehabilitation Options and Recommendations:\
    \ \n \nThe pumping and directly related plant of Gendettu, Kitiab, Aliab, Zeidab,\
    \ Fadlab and \nBawga irrigation schemes has been inspected, surveyed and its condition\
    \ and state of repair \nassessed. The inspections at Gendettu were carried out\
    \ in April 1986. During these site \ninvestigations, the opportunity was taken\
    \ to assess the cause of plant deterioration, \nparticularly of the relatively\
    \ new equipment and it was found that, in addition to certain \n             \
    \                                                \n193 Recent movement of the\
    \ course of the river is shown from a study of the aerial photographs and it is\
    \ \ntherefore considered inadvisable to construct a permanent land based pumpstation\
    \ for this scheme in the \nforeseeable future (ODA 1988:4-7). \n \n166 \ndesign\
    \ faults, a major cause of early plant failure and deterioration was poorly organized\
    \ \noperation and maintenance (ODA 1986:A2/1-1).  \n \nThe recommendations (rehabilitation\
    \ priorities) for Gendettu pumpstations were divided \ninto 3 phases: \n− Immediate:\
    \ For works which were essential to keep the plant operating and prevent \nfurther\
    \ deterioration and failure of plant in the immediate further (supply some tools\
    \ \nand spares); \n− Short Term: Works which should be carried out as funds are\
    \ available (first or \nsecond year of phase 3 of the project); and \n− Long Term:\
    \ Works which should be carried out in year 6 of the project. \n \nConcerning\
    \ the main pumpstation, it was found that the pontoons of the four floating \n\
    pumpstations are rehabilitable and with modifications the pontoons’ life can be\
    \ extended \nwell into the next decade. Likewise, the discharges that have been\
    \ measured there, have \nindicated that even after rehabilitation the installed\
    \ pump capacity will be inadequate for \nthe whole scheme area. Thereby, two alternatives\
    \ have been considered to ensure a full \ncapacity. Both alternatives include\
    \ the future expansion of pumping capacity through the \nconstruction of a new\
    \ floating pumpstation and the rehabilitation of the existing floating \npumpstation.\
    \ The alternatives were (ODA 1988:4-8): \n \n1. The location of all pumping plant\
    \ at a single location, the most obvious site being \nthe one presently occupied\
    \ by the existing floating pumpstation at the southern end \nof the scheme. \n\
    \ \n2. The splitting of pumping plant between two installations, one at the existing\
    \ site and \nthe other at the site presently occupied by the temporary pumps194.\
    \  \n \nThe second alternative was recommended on the basis of cost and technical\
    \ considerations. \nIt has been also recommended, the need of completely rebuilding\
    \ for the ‘onshore’ \nfacilities: „This should consist of the construction of\
    \ office/workshop/storage \naccommodation at both pumping stations which could\
    \ be in the standard form of a \nconverted container body. This would be easier\
    \ to move if the pumpstation has to be \nrelocated“ (ODA 1986:A2/4-7). \n \n5.4.4.4\
    \  Gendettu Irrigation’s Layout \n \nFor many years, complains have been registered\
    \ at Gendettu that there is insufficient water \nfor satisfactory irrigation of\
    \ the current cropping pattern. The reason according to the \nrehabilitation study\
    \ was found to be a combination of inadequate pumping capacity and \ninefficient\
    \ water distribution. \n \nThe present irrigation layout is shown in Figure 5.17.\
    \ The canal system comprises the main \ncanal which branches into several minor\
    \ canals. The first reach of the canal irrigates a thin \nstrip of land parallel\
    \ to the river which is mostly cultivated as orchards. This reach is \nnotable\
    \ for the large number of uncontrolled outlet pipes serving individual land holdings.\
    \ \n                                                             \n194 It has\
    \ been proposed that in year 2 of the program, a new floating pumping station\
    \ of standard design with \n2 duty pumps plus 1 standby pump be provided at Gendettu\
    \ North to replace the Gendettu Temporary \nPumping Station. \n \n167 \nThe NRIRP\
    \ has estimated that there are over 300 of these uncontrolled offtakes (ODA \n\
    1986:A3/1-5). As a result, water distribution is extremely uneven with field at\
    \ the head of \nthe system receiving almost constant supplies and little or no\
    \ water reaching the area at the \ntail of the canal. The situation is made worse\
    \ by the poor state of the pumping plant which \nis unable to deliver the quantity\
    \ of water required. \n \nFarmers at the tail of the canal have restored to pumping\
    \ from the canal to maintain their \nirrigation supplies, in particular for the\
    \ areas of orchards which require a constant supply of \nwater throughout the\
    \ year. In addition, the majority of farmers at this end of the scheme \nhave\
    \ dug wells to supplement their supplies by pumping from groundwater, the \ngroundwater\
    \ aquifer being recharged by losses from the canal system or directly from the\
    \ \nNile195. \n \nAn additional problem with the lower reaches of the system,\
    \ as reported by NRIRP, is the \nlack of command, with water levels in the canal\
    \ being below the level of the cultivated \nland. Although it should theoretically\
    \ be possible to maintain canal supply levels \nsufficiently high to be able to\
    \ provide a gravity supply to all areas, the general shortage of \nwater due to\
    \ inequitable distribution and inadequate pumping precludes this in practice.\
    \ \n \nA small pumpstation has been established to provide supplementary supplies\
    \ to 650 feddan \nnear the tail of the area via the El Bahar minor canal, but\
    \ it was reported in the middle of \n1980s that only 300 feddan were irrigated\
    \ from this station due to inadequate pump \ncapacity. The reasons that handicap\
    \ supplying adequate quantities of water are not only \ntechnical. The NRIRP has\
    \ stressed also to the role of farmers in this connection: \n  \n„Apart from the\
    \ inability of the pumping plant to provide sufficient water the most serious\
    \ \nproblem on this scheme is the uncontrolled extraction of water from the main\
    \ canal by the \nupstream users. Control of these extraction is particularly difficult\
    \ as most of the land is \nfreehold and NAPC has little control over the farmers’\
    \ activities. Withholding water is \nimpractical as each holding has its own uncontrolled\
    \ supply. Strict policing of the canal is \nalso difficult to implement when the\
    \ farmers are able to take water at night if their normal \nsupplies are interrupted.“\
    \ \n \nThe traditional system of irrigation in the Nile Province (as well as in\
    \ New Halfa), open \ncannels, has been criticized by the experts (MacDonalds &\
    \ Partners). In efficiently terms, \nthey argue, the system, which is deeply engrained\
    \ into the psyche of the River Sudanese, is \nsomewhat wasteful of water, largely\
    \ on account of conveyance losses. The experts \nestimated that about half of\
    \ the water pumped is lost in seepage and evaporation \n(WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON\
    \ 1985:18-9). Two socio-economic factors, however, \nsustain this system, that’s\
    \ to say; the excessive use of water: \n \nfirstly: water is after all ‘freely\
    \ available’ even after several years of poor rains in the Nile \ncatchment areas;\
    \ \n                                                             \n195 UPHOFF\
    \ (1991:81) argues that farmers who get water from pumps may be unwilling to pay\
    \ for the \nupkeep of the canal system even though it raises the water table and\
    \ makes their pumping easy. On the \ncontrary, in Gendettu, as we will see in\
    \ the coming chapter, the tenants are willing to pay higher rates for \nwater\
    \ and they are aware of the economic benefits that can be drawn from it. \n \n\
    168 \nsecondly: there are even beneficial socio-economic aspects which should\
    \ not be lightly \ndisregarded. This system encourages considerable vegetative\
    \ growth along the canal banks, \nmuch of which is cut for fodder or grazed directly\
    \ by a range of stock. It is likely that this is \nan extremely valuable ‘free’\
    \ source of fodder for a number of poorer people within the \ncommunity. \n \n\
    Considering the cost of water pumping, water is not freely available. Using a\
    \ diesel engine \npump requires fuel which is costly and not always readily available\
    \ at the official retail \nprice. The supply of fuel is dependent on factors outside\
    \ the control of NAPC or the private \nagricultural sector, namely the availability\
    \ of foreign currency within Sudan as a whole \n(Chapter 4.3.1). ODA (1986:20)\
    \ has recommended therefore reducing the dependence on \ndiesel fuel. In addition,\
    \ it has been found that by introducing an modern method like spot \nirrigation,\
    \ demand for water is only 14% of that required by the open channel method, \n\
    assuming no losses from source to point of use. Spot irrigation, on the one side,\
    \ involves \nmore physical effort and greater supervision (3-5 mandays per inundation\
    \ per feddan \ncompare with 1 mandays by open canal), but on the other, it does\
    \ mean that the amount of \nwater given is accurately known. A further advantage\
    \ of spot irrigation, according to ODA, \nis that land preparation and leveling\
    \ need not be so critical, if necessary at all. \n \n \n169 \n6.  Implications\
    \ of the Results: Organizational and Managerial Obstacles to \nWater-Use Efficiency.\
    \ \n \n6.1  The Division of Responsibility \n \n6.1.1  New Halfa Scheme  \n \n\
    Water management in New Halfa scheme is operated, as in the case in similar Sudanese\
    \ \nirrigation schemes, on a tripartite basis: \n  \n− \nMinistry of Irrigation\
    \ (MOI) in charge of dams, scheme headwork and operation \nand maintenance of\
    \ canals; \n− \nNHAC in charge of canal operation and management at tertiary level\
    \ and below (in \naddition to agricultural services and marketing);  \n− \nTenant\
    \ farmers responsible for water management in the farm (hawasha). \n \n6.1.1.1\
    \  Scheme Administration (NHAC) and Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) \n \nIt is necessary\
    \ to distinguish here between operation (mainly water management) and \nmaintenance\
    \ (mainly weed and sediment control, plus repair and maintenance of structure).\
    \ \nThe Engineering Authority (EA), as outlined by NIRP (1992), is responsible\
    \ both for \noperating and for maintaining the headwork (and pump stations), and\
    \ primary canals \n(main, branch, major and carrier canals), which are designed\
    \ for continuous flow. The \nAgricultural Authority (AA) is responsible, along\
    \ with the farmers, both for operating and \nfor maintaining the territories (Abu-XXs)\
    \ and smaller canals, which are sometimes \noperated discontinuously. But, the\
    \ responsibility for Minors was divided. \n \nThe scene of the main questions\
    \ is the Minor canals (secondaries), which are usually \nmaintained by the MOI\
    \ (Engineering Authority (EA)), but operated by the Agricultural \nAuthority (AA).\
    \ The Minors have the special characteristic of being relatively wide and \nflat,\
    \ so that they provide a necessary storage buffer between the continuous flow\
    \ above and \nthe discontinuous flow below. Their head regulators are the smallest\
    \ flow measuring \nstructures, and their outlets (FOPs) are the smallest formal\
    \ water control structures (in \nsmaller channels control is by breaking and rebuilding\
    \ earth banks or checks). Because of \nthis unique position in the canal hierarchy,\
    \ it is natural and rational, as reported by \nNIRP, that the interface between\
    \ the responsibility zones of the EA and the AA should be \nsomewhere on the Minors,\
    \ but it was by no means obvious whether the interface should be \nat the Minor\
    \ head or at the offtakes (MINISTRY of IRRIGATION 1992:Vol.3, F13).  \n \nIn practice,\
    \ most of the major irrigation schemes; Gezira-Managil, New Halfa, Rahad and \n\
    Suki, were operated from the head of the Minor canals onwards by the respective\
    \ \nAgricultural Corporation, the Sudan Gezira Board being the original upon which\
    \ the later \nones were modelled. The staff of the AA were responsible for operating\
    \ the minor canals \n(but not for maintaining them), for assessing the total crop\
    \ water requirements for the \nforthcoming period based on the areas planted with\
    \ various crops and their state of \ndevelopment and for indenting for that water\
    \ from the EA (MOI). The indents contain \ndetails of the amount of water required\
    \ to be distributed into each minor canal, and it is the \nresponsibility of EA\
    \ staff to distribute the total water so as to comply with these individual \n\
    \ \n170 \nindents 196. The maintenance of the canal was also the responsibility\
    \ of EA. Additional \nweed clearance is performed mainly by laborers under the\
    \ supervision of EA staff \n(MINSTRY of IRRIGATION 1992:Vol.1, A24). \n \nThis\
    \ division of responsibility for the Minor canals between EA (maintenance) and\
    \ AA \n(operation) brought disadvantages: „in that priorities may not be seen\
    \ the same way by the \ntwo parties, and either party can (with or without true\
    \ justification) blame the other for \nproblems“ (MINSTRY of IRRIGATION 1992:Vol.3,:F14).\
    \ Such disadvantages are not \nfatal, argued the NIRP study, and they can be alleviated\
    \ by good communication, \nappropriate training of staff in both organizations,\
    \ and appropriate motivation. The \nstudy has therefore discussed four alternatives\
    \ for the future division of responsibility for \nMinor: \n \n(a) as before, i.e.,\
    \ maintenance by EA and operation by AA; \n(b) both by the EA; \n(c) both by the\
    \ AA; \n(d) maintenance by the AA and operation by the EA. \n \nThe fourth, though\
    \ it is rumored to have been suggested for some pump schemes, seems to \noffer\
    \ no advantages and is not considered further. Either options (b) and (c) would\
    \ avoid \nthe disadvantages of (a) but in turn they would involve duplication\
    \ of skills and resources. \nA key to this matter is the need for accountability,\
    \ which also requires that performance \n(primarily the delivery of water) can\
    \ be measured. Since the EA needs in any case to have \nskills and equipment for\
    \ both operation and maintenance of canals, option (c) would mean \nthat two organizations\
    \ would have to have these skills and equipment. This might be, the \nstudy concludes\
    \ wasteful and inefficient in use of people and machines. Option (b) on the \n\
    other hand would require the EA to deal directly with farmers in matters of water\
    \ \nallocation, which could only be done well if the EA acquired large numbers\
    \ of staff with a \ngood understanding of agricultural practices and problems;\
    \ this would also represent a \nduplication of knowledge between two organizations.\
    \  \n \nNevertheless, it is believed that, like the disadvantages of option (a),\
    \ these problems with \n(b) and (c) are not fatal and insuperable. A change to\
    \ either option would, given the scale \nof Sudanese irrigation, the immense training\
    \ efforts required, and the rigidity and inertia of \nbureaucracies everywhere,\
    \ take many years to accomplish, but it would be possible. As a \nconclusion,\
    \ the study has argued: „it may be worthwhile to try out both (b) and (c) on a\
    \ \npilot scale, but for the bulk of the areas it will be best to take steps to\
    \ avoid the \ndisadvantages of (a), particularly by improving communication and\
    \ by organizing joint \ntraining for agricultural and engineering staff at all\
    \ levels“ (MINSTRY of IRRIGATION \n1992: Vol.3,F14). Thereby, in quick succession,\
    \ the Sudanese authorities have decided on \nthe option (b). In November 1992,\
    \ the EA’s responsibility of water management \n(operation and maintenance) has\
    \ been extended up to the mouth (offtake) of Abu XX. This \nmeans elimination\
    \ of the water management responsibilities of the AA. \n \n                  \
    \                              \n196 This stands in sharp contrast to, for instance,\
    \ the allocation system in Gondalpur Watercourse in Pakistan \nwhere the supply\
    \ of water to various watercourses is decided by the Executive Engineer whose\
    \ decisions \nare based primarily on instructions from headquarters and the available\
    \ water supply in the main river, and \nnot the conditions and demand in the Command\
    \ area (TANG, 1993:15). \n \n171 \nThis decision changing the boarders of water\
    \ management, comes to make an end - \npartially - to a long history of conflict\
    \ between the two organizations concerning sharing of \nthe water management in\
    \ most large irrigated schemes. This conflict was at the tenant’s \nexpense of\
    \ course. It is worth noting that similar findings have been registered in other\
    \ \nschemes in different parts of the world197. The decision is also one of the\
    \ TFU’s desires \nand considers, at the same time, a wide step in the way of achieving\
    \ the recommendations \nof the World Bank which has seen that: „MOI has to take\
    \ control over water issues down \nto and including the field-outlet pipes“ (AHMED/TIFFEN,\
    \ 1989). Such decision then \nremains partial because many of respondents within\
    \ the tenants and most of the \nAgriculturists believe also that the responsibilities\
    \ of MOI must be extended until the field \ncanal (Abu VI)198. \n \nThe decision,\
    \ what became known as ‘Abu Ishreen’s decision’, is also not enough to fulfil\
    \ \nthe recommendations of the rehabilitation study. A series of proposals have\
    \ been made in \nthe different phases of the study to resolve constraints identified\
    \ in water management and \nscheme organization which bear on relations between\
    \ NHAC and agencies responsible to \nMOI. These proposals, in a highly summary\
    \ form, are (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 7:26-7): \n \n- the creation of a single water authority\
    \ for all aspects of water supply management \naffecting the Scheme, under a Chief\
    \ water Engineer, to improve supplier-user co-\nordination; \n- re-alignment of\
    \ Irrigation Service Field Units (13 Sections and Sub-divisions) with the 19 \n\
    Blocks and 6 Sections of the NHAC, to facilitate water indenting and information\
    \ \nexchange; \n- creation of the post of Head Khaffir responsible for the Khaffirs\
    \ along an entire minor \ncanal, to improve water control; and \n- assignment\
    \ of responsibility for maintenance of the quaternary system to the Earth \nMoving\
    \ Corporation, working on a contract basis to NHAC. \n \n6.1.1.2  Tenant Farmers\
    \ \n \nAs the NIRP has reported, about this vital participant, the provision of\
    \ the correct \nquantities of water to the crops at the time they require them\
    \ is the only major purpose for \nthe existence of the Agricultural Corporations\
    \ and those MOI departments operating on the \nscheme. Whatever the importance\
    \ of the role of the other two participants, the experience \nhas clearly showed\
    \ that the tenant is the most important factor in deciding when the \ncrops require\
    \ watering and operating the system to provide the water. The operation of the\
    \ \n                                                \n197 Based on works in several\
    \ countries, FUKUDA (1976:106) has reported: „... as we have seen, two or more\
    \ \nministries (such as agriculture or irrigation and public works) in charge\
    \ of various aspects of water \nmanagement at the farmers’ level often cause a\
    \ lot of trouble and bottlenecks in the smooth \nimplementation of an irrigation\
    \ project“. In addition, based on their experience in Philippine, and other \n\
    countries WALKER/CLEVERINAGA (1989:M.VIII.2/2) pointed out: „Field experience\
    \ quickly revealed \nthat having one agency responsible for organizing the farmers\
    \ and a different agency responsible for \ncontrasting the physical system led\
    \ to confusion and friction and made involving the local people in the \npreconstruction\
    \ and construction activities extremely difficult“. Similarly, Indian’s experience\
    \ has shown \nthat one of the hardest things to accomplish is cooperation across\
    \ departmental boundaries. And lack of \ncoordination, unfortunately, cannot be\
    \ eliminated by bureaucratic fiat (UPFOFF 1991:174).  \n198 The Chief Engineer\
    \ has comment on this opinion by saying: „what else could the agriculturist do\
    \ ?“. \n \n172 \nFOPs is carried out by the farmers through the water guard (khaffir);\
    \ in theory the water \nguard acts under the supervision and instructions of the\
    \ Agricultural Corporation’s Field \nInspectors, but in practice farmers act as\
    \ informal water users’ groups and make their own \ndecisions (MINSTRY of IRRIGATION\
    \ 1992  vol.1.A26)199. In addition, it is not obvious \nnow, after the Abu XX’s\
    \ decision, to whom are the Khaffirs along AbuXXs responsible? \n \nAll those\
    \ tenants who benefit from the Abu XX have an obligation to clear it. It is in\
    \ the \ninterest of the Tail-enders but not the top-enders that the canal should\
    \ be cleaned and \nmaintained. The maintenance responsibility lay jointly with\
    \ NHAC which was unable to \ncarry it out. The outcome of such a situation is\
    \ liable to be that neither NHAC nor the \ntenants maintains the works. The main\
    \ reason of this result is, there is no sanction for the \ntenants who ignore\
    \ this task. In addition, the tenants are individually responsible for their \n\
    field canals (Abu VIs). \n \nWhereas the Agriculture Corporation has a consistent\
    \ and formalized interaction with the \ntenant farmers and is subject to immediate\
    \ pressure if crop water requirements are not \nfulfilled, the MOI was insulated\
    \ from such pressure, as it does not have such an interaction. \nApart from informal\
    \ interactions, the MOI was in contact with farmers only when its staff \nattend\
    \ the meetings of Production Committees with farmers and Agricultural Corporation\
    \ \nstaff; the frequency with which these Committees meet varies from area to\
    \ area within the \nsame scheme (see Chapter 6.5.2.3). \n \n6.1.2  Gendettu Scheme\
    \ \n \nIn the northern Region, on the other hand, MOI was technically responsible\
    \ for NAPC’ \nschemes. On 24/12/1982, because of problems similar to those stated\
    \ above, hassle and \nnon-co-operation between MOI and NAPC, it has been decided\
    \ to transfer the \nresponsibility of the former to the later. After this date,\
    \ the NAPC has taken over through \nmechanical and irrigation Departments the\
    \ task of water management. The relationship \nbetween the two organizations has\
    \ become advisory. \n \nAt Gendettu, a clear distinction must be drawn between\
    \ the responsibilities of the Scheme \nManagement and the mechanical Section,\
    \ both being involved in the supply of water. It \nhas been observed that, even\
    \ the same organization, there appears to be a conflict between \nthe interests\
    \ of the two parties. On the one hand the Scheme Management has an obligation\
    \ \nto provide irrigation to the farmers in the quantity required and at the optimum\
    \ irrigation \ninterval, whilst on the other hand, the mechanical staff must ensure\
    \ that plant is correctly \noperated and maintained. The third party, represented\
    \ by the irrigation Engineer, is \nresponsible for determining pumping rates and,\
    \ in addition, he must give adequate notice \nof these to the Mechanical Engineers,\
    \ to enable them to program maintenance and to \ndetermine which pumps to operate\
    \ and for how long. The preparation of pumping \nschedules which meet the requirements\
    \ of both the crops and the pumps require a great \ndeal of co-operation and understanding\
    \ between the different disciplines of NAPC and \nno one discipline can have over-riding\
    \ control200. \n                                                \n199 In other\
    \ large schemes, like Gezira, this task has been undertaken by one of the Tenant’\
    \ farmers called \nsamad. He works also, theoretically, under the supervision\
    \ and instructions of the Field Inspector.  \n200 This stands in sharp contrast\
    \ to the first character of irrigation system discussed in Chapter 1.1.1 and 1.3\
    \ i. \ne. the coordination nature of water management. It is, in addition, an\
    \ indicator of the absence of vital \ncomponent of irrigation management; namely\
    \ conflict management. It is an indicator also of the quality of \n \n173 \nIn\
    \ what follows the different performances for all groups in both Schemes are highlighted.\
    \ \n \n6.2 The Role of Scheme’s Administration in the Problems of Water \nManagement\
    \ \n \n6.2.1  New Halfa Scheme \n \nWater management facilities at the field level\
    \ are considered, according to the experience \nof the Asian Development Bank,\
    \ an organic part of any large-scale irrigation project and \nshould be constructed\
    \ with Cooperation between the governmental organization and \nfarmers (FUKUDA\
    \ 1976:105). Some countries tend to have a paternalistic approach and \nprovide\
    \ all the facilities as part of the irrigation development while others provide\
    \ none of \nthem (SAGARDOY 1986:112). Some of the basic handicaps for the proper\
    \ water \nmanagement, which come from the New Halfa Scheme authorities’ side,\
    \ are in the field of \nland preparation, land leveling (joint responsibility\
    \ with the farmers) and maintenance of \nminors and field canals (AbuXXs). The\
    \ first two tasks, land preparation and land leveling \nare very important issues\
    \ of field water management in New Halfa Scheme. \n \n6.2.1.1  Land preparation\
    \ \n \nThis vital stage of the agricultural operations is closely connected with\
    \ planting date and \nboth of them, according to the interview with the officials,\
    \ constitute 26% of the problems \nthat faced the performance in New Halfa (Table\
    \ 6.1). This coincide also with the opinion \nof the tenants who see the delayed\
    \ land preparation as the first problem (32 %) which \nprevent them from increasing\
    \ the productivity (Table 6.2). \n \nTable 6.1 Officials report on problems of\

    \ that the tenant have correctly classified the problems that hinder their \n\

    \ that \nexist in the Scheme. One can say that there is no remarkable anomalies\
    \ in the results as \nshown in Table 6.3.201 They attribute the shortcomings of\
    \ the Scheme performance to the \nlate land preparation, water shortage, and financing\
    \ which is closely connected to the high \ncosts. \n \nLand preparation for cotton,\
    \ in the form of dry-ridging and channel clearance before the \nrains followed\
    \ by a split-ridging before sowing, is done by the agricultural management \n\
    with \nthe \nassistance \nof \nsome \ncontracting \nto \nprivate \nmachinery \n\
    operators \n(THORNTON/WYNN 1987:219). But, as we will see, the surface has merely\
    \ been \nscratched. All other operations are done by hand. For the other crops,\
    \ the Corporation has \nplayed no role. In practice, Corporation farm machinery\
    \ was in the past also available for \nwheat-land preparation (begin in October)\
    \ and combining, and the Corporation also to \nprovide seed. Increasingly, however,\
    \ with Scheme decline, this has eased to be the case \n(NHAC 1986: ANNEX 7:6).\
    \ \n \nNot only the timing of land preparation is very important but also its\
    \ quality which is \nnecessary to reduce seepage behind the root zone. The tenant\
    \ think  that the nature of the \nsoil in the Scheme needs better land preparation\
    \ than in other schemes. In spite of the \nrehabilitation (136 US million Dollar),\
    \ the tenant complains that the NHAC is faced with \nan acute shortage of tractors\
    \ and spare parts and often have chronic shortages of fuel. \nAlthough adequate\
    \ and appropriate machinery is available to reduce this constrains, the \nproduction\
    \ environment is often unfavorable, with inefficient services. Most of tractors\
    \ \n                                                \n201 Within the scope of\
    \ the rehabilitation study, the results of the investigation indicated that the\
    \ first three \nreasons constituted 65% of the issues on which tenants had to\
    \ contact the TFU’s Committees. These were \nrespectively land preparation and\
    \ lack of machinery (34%), irrigation-water-shortage (17%), delay of \nloans (14%).\
    \ \n \n175 \nwhich the Scheme have, are overworked and many are permanently or\
    \ temporarily \nunoperational waiting for spare parts. That is why the productivity\
    \ of tractor in the Scheme \nis 10 feddan comparing with 100 in the private sector202.\
    \ These aspects are closely bound \nup with the migration of the best technical\
    \ personnel to the rich Arab countries. This \ninfluence has been discussed in\

    \ the land preparation’s machinery for cotton or the other three crops at the\
    \ \nrecommended time205. The survey reveals that 12 % of the sample owned tractors\

    \ performance of Corporation tractor \ndrivers. In this context, the NHIRP has\
    \ reported: „where the major operations on farm-\nholdings are performed by an\
    \ outside organization, and the tenant has limited or no \ncontrol over the quality\
    \ of those operations, then his initiative and his own farm \nmanagement will\
    \ accordingly deteriorate. If this is true, then within the limits imposed by\
    \ \nthe disciplines of an irrigated scheme with strict-scheduling of water and\
    \ crop operations, \nevery effort must be made to transfer progressively responsibility\
    \ for farm operations to \nthe tenant or to tenant-controlled organizations, or\
    \ to e.g. private machinery operators \nwho can be directly controlled through\
    \ payment“ (NHAC 1986: ANNEX 7:11). If the case \nis so, one is tempted to ask\
    \ whether the Scheme has been really rehabilitated? \n \nScheme’s irrigation engineers\
    \ argued also that the delay of land preparation makes stress \non the water stored\
    \ in Khashm El Gerba Dam and affects therefore, negatively, the water \nlevel\
    \ in the irrigation network. According to the regime of the Atbara River and the\
    \ design \nof the dam, all gates are completely open during the flood season from\
    \ July to September \nto flush out sediment, and the water in that time has to\
    \ be pumped by three pump sets207. \nDuring this period the tenants have to make\
    \ use of this water together with the rain-water \nfor watering groundnuts, sorghum\
    \ and cotton. From October onwards storage is used only \nfor: 1) the watering\
    \ of the rest these three crops; 2) the entire watering of wheat; 3) the \npermanent\
    \ watering for the freehold lands; 4) sugarcane plantation and 5) water supply.\
    \ \nLate land preparation muddle this plan and leads consequently to water shortage\
    \ and \nconflicts between farmers. As the experience in other irrigation schemes\
    \ with a large water \n                                                \n206 In\
    \ the area of agricultural production, the Halfawyeen tenants think that the TFU\
    \ should address itself to \nthe following issues as judged from the proportion\
    \ of responses received from the tenants in relation to \neach : pricing of crops:\
    \ 17 per cent; irrigation water: 16 per cent; loans: 12 per cent; livestock control:\
    \ 12; \nand land preparation: 9 per cent. In the nomad area the main proposals\
    \ accorded priority in the field of \nagricultural production are: land preparation:\
    \ 20 per cent, loans: 18 per cent; irrigation water: 15 per cent; \ncotton revenues:\
    \ 9 per cent; and pricing of crops: 8 per cent (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 5:31).   \n207\
    \ They all working since 1964 and need therefore maintenance and spare parts.\
    \ \n \n177 \ndeficit shows, delayed land preparation means also that production\
    \ per hectare is low and \nlarge areas are sometimes abandoned due to salinity\
    \ problems208. \n \nCorrect time of planting is one of the most important inputs\
    \ to higher yields. The sowing \nof cotton and groundnuts is a tenant's function,\
    \ and has to be carried out by hand209. The \ntiming is left therefore to them.\
    \ According to the NHIRP, it has been assumed that by \nadhering to the suggested\
    \ June planting of groundnuts and July planting of cotton, the \nscheme could\
    \ raise its average yields significantly by this input alone. The watering and\
    \ \nharvesting would then follow along predetermined paths easing the management\
    \ \nrequirement (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 2:26-27). Sorghum planting is scheduled to take\
    \ place \ninto clay soil in May prior to groundnuts210 and cotton. The reasons\
    \ for this suggestion are: \n \n− planters will not be available June/July. \n\
    − sorghum - to keep stemborer invasions low - must be planted early. \n− by sowing\
    \ into dry soil in May, the crop will germinate after the first meaningful \n\
    rain whenever it occurs211. \n− most of the physical work can be carried out prior\
    \ to the start of cotton and \ngroundnuts. \n \nIn addition, the recommended dates\
    \ for land preparation and plantation of crops should be \nrespected and enforced\
    \ in order to minimize the period of overlap and consequently avoid \nthe water\
    \ shortage of wheat at the end of the season. \n \nThere are more indicators that\
    \ the Relative Water Supply (RWS) in New Halfa Scheme is \nlow. This means, the\
    \ amount of pressure that users can put on the staff controlling \nirrigation\
    \ water is high. Again this means that raising the level of ‘efficiency’ here\
    \ \ndemands more management effort. In view of matching supply and demand of water,\
    \ \nseveral restrictive measures can be utilized by the project management to\
    \ reduce the gap \nbetween them. These measures are related to:  \na) the cropping\
    \ pattern;  \nb) the water distribution practices; and \nc) the water fees. \n\
    \ \nUnfortunately, no measures have been practiced in the last two spectrums.\
    \ Even \nconcerning the first one, the management of the Scheme has not tried\
    \ to change the \n                                                \n208 One of\
    \ the reasons for such a state of affairs as pointed by SAGARDOY (1986:61) was:\
    \ „although the \nefficient use of water was essential, the farmers were not assisted\
    \ in preparing their lands (land leveling, \ngrading) for efficient use when water\
    \ supplies were limited“.  \n209 The Rehabilitation study has therefore proposed\
    \ to convert this vital operation to a mechanized system \nwith no input from\
    \ the tenant other than a cost one. The main reasons for this proposal are (NHAC\
    \ \n1986:ANNEX 2:26): \n- correct time of sowing \n- sown in straight lines \n\
    - correct plant populations \n- correct depth of seeding \n- the sowing can take\
    \ place on a planned „number“ basis in conjunction with irrigation \n- Scheme\
    \ labor requirements can be phased to spread the work load. \n210 Recommended\
    \ date is 15-5 until 15-6. \n211 It has been also suggested in Chapter 1.3 of\
    \ the same study that dryland sorghum should follow \ngroundnuts in the rotation\
    \ to make use of the high soil moisture reservoir after groundnuts which will\
    \ \nsustain the newly germinated sorghum for several weeks should the first rain\
    \ be followed by a dry spell.  \n \n178 \nexisting cropping pattern or to reduce\
    \ the irrigated area, but it has instead stressed the \nimportance of respect\
    \ (adhering to) the planting time to make use of flood and rain water. \nIndeed,\
    \ by suitable regulation of the planting time and other cultivation activities,\
    \ large \nreductions can be attained during the peak demand of an irrigation scheme.\
    \ Careful \nplanning of this also allows controlled staggering of cultivation\
    \ activities between different \nsections of the same irrigation system leading\
    \ to a more rational use of variable machinery \nand manpower. The Tenants know\
    \ surely that they must keep to the pre-planned timetable, \nbut because of the\
    \ delay of land preparation and canals maintenance, as they argued, they \nare\
    \ not in a position to adherente it212. \n \nTable 6.5 shows clearly that the\
    \ actually dates for planting executed by the tenants are \ntotally different\
    \ from the official ones. This is valid for all crops and the two groups of \n\
    tenants. It is more extreme forthe nomads because they have to plant three crops\
    \ - \napproximately - in the same time (July). In addition, because many of the\
    \ nomads are \ndependent on the rain, Season (begin in July), to secure their\
    \ main food (sorghum) outside \nthe Scheme, they have to postpone the planting\
    \ of cotton to the end of August and \nSeptember213. Interestingly, 11% of them\
    \ believe that the end of August is normal for \ncotton planting214. The delayed\
    \ planting for cotton is more extreme by the Nubian where \n33% of cases planted\
    \ cotton in September215. Many of them (50%) believe also that the \ndelay of\
    \ wheat planting is better for the productivity. On the contrary, the other half\
    \ \nbelieve that the winter is very short therefore it is necessary to begin early.\

    ∗ Refers to the weeks \nSource: Own Survey \n                                \
    \                \n212 The survey of FAEA/NHAC (199121-9) revealed that all surveyed\
    \ CF (Contacted Farmers) attributed \nnon-adoption of the recommended sowing date\
    \ of cotton to shortage of irrigation water. This reason \nrepresented about 70%\
    \ of the Non-contacted Farmers (NCF). Other reason claimed by NCF for non-\nadoption\
    \ were delayed land preparation and unavailability of pesticides, each constituted\
    \ 15 %. For \ngroundnuts, the reason for non-adoption for all farmers were: lack\
    \ of water at the proper time (66 %), the \ninappropriate time of the land preparation\
    \ (22 %), seeds were not available (5 %), and resowing (7 %).  \n213 Many have\
    \ reported that the women in the nomads’ area don’t enable their husbands to plant\
    \ other crops \nbefore securing the planting of the rainfed Sorghum outside the\
    \ Scheme. \n214 It is worth noting that as the result of different sowing times\
    \ in the Scheme (from first July until end \nSeptember), the operation of cotton\
    \ picking take rather a long time. \n215 According to NHIRP results in the oldest\
    \ Scheme in the Nile Province and Sudan; Zeidab Scheme (1907), \ncotton should\
    \ be planted in May, although, in practice, planting is usually delayed until\
    \ June/July and \nmaybe as late as August, due to delays in land preparation and\
    \ delivery of inputs and other constraints \n(NHAC 1986:A1/2-26,7). \n \n179 \n\
    6.2.1.2  Land Leveling \n \nIn most cases, on-farm development can be reduced\
    \ to two essential elements: 1) \nrelocation of irrigation and drainage ditches;\
    \ and 2) land grading or leveling (SAGARDOY \n1986:113). These elements are interdependent\
    \ and can hardly be separated in practice. \nLand grading is the movement of the\
    \ earth necessary to obtain a perfectly uniform inclined \nplane and land leveling\
    \ is for a horizontal plane, although both terms are used \ninterchangeably. This\
    \ operation is indispensable in surface irrigation to obtain a uniform \napplication\
    \ of the water (RAWITZ 1973:334). Therefore, it is considered, as HÜBENER \nand\
    \ WOLF (1991) argued, one of the most important problem in the traditional gravity-\n\
    flow system. The empirical results of this study leads us to agree with this argument.\
    \ \n \nEven very flat areas may need some land grading in order to provide uniform\
    \ slope. Of \ncourse, continue SAGARDOY (1986:114), the more irregular the topography\
    \ (as in New \nHalfa), the more expensive the operation. That is why land grading\
    \ or leveling is not an \noperation that is intuitively attractive to farmers.\
    \ Furthermore, if it is not done with great \ncare, productive top soil can be\
    \ removed leading to a decrease in productivity in affected \nareas for a few\
    \ years. Therefore, in order to make the operation attractive to farmers, it is\
    \ \nimperative that some sizeable incentive be offered. A common way is that 50\
    \ percent of \nthe costs are aborted by the public administration. Unfortunately,\
    \ the bearing of this fact \nwas unnoticed in our cases. \n \nThe operation of\
    \ leveling must be done during the fallow period which is usually very \nshort\
    \ on irrigated schemes. This is one of the reasons for the tendency to use machinery\
    \ \nrather than labor for land grading and leveling. It is therefore more difficult\
    \ in New Halfa \nwhere there is no fallow in addition to the fact that the soil\
    \ is relatively hard. This means, \nin New Halfa it is also a question of the\
    \ quality of the machines. In this context it is \npreferable to use the modern\
    \ ones like Leaser control machines which are now available \nfor other schemes\
    \ in Sudan and in Africa216, where the fields are well leveled according to \n\
    pre-determined specifications and water volumes. \n \nIn New Halfa, the shortage\
    \ of „light“ machinery is also combined with acute shortage of \nheavy machinery\
    \ which are necessary to break up the compacted soils since the scheme \nfirst\
    \ started. Notwithstanding the points discussed above, it is interesting that\
    \ the officials \nof the project did not mention land leveling as one of the problems\
    \ that need urgent \nsolution (Table 6.1). Nevertheless, through the discussion,\
    \ 94% of them assert that land \nleveling in the Scheme is out of interest. Causes\
    \ that have been mentioned here are:  \n- shortage of machinery (52%)217; \n-\
    \ bad management (20%); \n- tenants are unaware of its importance (16%); and \n\
    - the high cost (12%). \n \n                                                \n\
    216 For example, Gezira project in Sudan and Kapunga irrigation project in Tanzania\
    \ (FAO, 1994:70). \n217 All the experts outside the Scheme and many of the staff\
    \ have reported the converse and argued that it is \nup to the bad management.\
    \ For instance, the purchasing manager has reported that the existing levelers\
    \ in \nthe Scheme (76) are not used because they are „unsuitable“ ! He and the\
    \ others have also stressed the lack \nof the technical experience. \n \n180 \n\
    In addition, they maintain that the bad quality of the machines (levelers, ploughs,\
    \ tractors) \ncauses soil accumulations in front of and besides the quaternary\
    \ and field canals. The \noutcome is that the water drain and seep into the field\
    \ and do not irrigate the whole 5 \nfeddan218. Or, to put it another way,, the\
    \ result is: flooding at the end of Hawasha (the ends \nadjacent to the road),\
    \ over-irrigation at the middle, and no water at the beginning (adjacent \nto\
    \ the Abu Ishreen). The solution of this problem, as the officials pointed out,\
    \ is the \nadherence to the rules concerning the field distribution system (Angaya\
    \ System). The field \nmust be distributed by seven Gaduals (Irrigation Ditches)\
    \ and seven Tagnats (Field \nBunds) i.e., sixteen Basin (see fig. 5.14). \n \n\
    On the contrary, it appears instead that the tenants are more aware of this problem.\
    \ Only \n15% within the sample have reported that their fields are leveled. Two\
    \ main reasons hinder \nthe majority from solving this problem namely; the shortage\
    \ of machinery (53%) and the \nimpossibility of financing (47%). In addition,\
    \ reasons for the neglect of the \nrecommendations concerning field distribution\
    \ mentioned by the staff, experts, and tenants \nwere: 1) it means more cost burden,\
    \ 2) it needs time and effort, 3) more canals (particularly \nIrrigation Ditches)\
    \ means more loss in the Hawasha and they aggravate the harvest \nproblems especially\
    \ for Wheat. This is to be observed in almost every case particularly in \nAbu\
    \ Nagma Block in the nomads area (the most extreme case in the Scheme) and in\
    \ \nvillage 5, 24 and 26 in the Nubians area. \n \n6.2.1.3  Reasons of Water Shortage\
    \ \n \nImplicit in the foregoing discussion is the fact that the officials in\
    \ this study, especially the \nstaff of the Scheme and the experts, do not see\
    \ the water shortage as one of the most \nimportant problems of the Scheme. Going\
    \ back to Table 6.1, one finds that they refer to the \nproblem of the dam capacity\
    \ as if it is the only water problem in the Scheme. To prove this \nperception,\
    \ we have mentioned five possible reasons that can be the main hindrance of the\
    \ \nirrigation system and they were asked to rank them according to their relative\
    \ importance. \nThese reasons and their interesting ranking were as follows219:\
    \ \n \nReason \n% of responses \n2. Water storage capacity is not enough \n26\
    \  \n3. Behavior of tenants in relation to water \n24  \n4. Administrative problems\
    \ \n19 \n5. Canal problems (maintenance, control, etc.) \n18 \n6. Inefficient\
    \ water distribution \n13 \n \nIn significance here is the fact that the staff\
    \ of the Scheme see that their responsibility is \nonly limited in the reason\
    \ 3. The manager of the agricultural department in the Scheme, \nwho was the most\
    \ influential person in the Scheme in that time, reported only reason 1 and \n\
    2, and said the other three are does not exist. \n \n                        \
    \                        \n218 It is highly believed that the loss due to this\
    \ accumulation is minimal ½ feddan, this means it can be more \nthan 10 %.  \n\
    219 In addition, other reasons have been mentioned e.g. unreality of the available\
    \ data concerning water flow \nin field water course, unreliability of water delivery,\
    \ the long Abu XXs, land leveling, the night irrigation, \nand the water pricing\
    \ system.  \n \n181 \nOn the other side, tenants canvassed in this survey gave\
    \ responses which could be \ninterpreted according to the fact: a dependable and\
    \ well regulated supply of water to the \ntertiary level is a prerequisite for\
    \ good water management at farm level, while the reverse \nis not true. There\
    \ is no causal link between good farm-level practice and better \nmanagement of\
    \ schemes as a whole (WALKER/CLEVERINGA 1989:M.XI.3/1). The \nreasons that are\
    \ responsible for the water shortage, which considered, according to their \n\
    opinion as the second vital problem in the Scheme are represented in Table 6.6\
    \ \n \nTable 6.6 Causes of Water Shortage Ranked by the Tenants of New Halfa Scheme\

    \ between AA and EA \n4 \n7. The position of the field \n4 \nSource: Own Survey\
    \  \n \nA considerable part of the problem (63 %) can be traced to poor administration\
    \ (reasons 1, \n2, 5 and 6). As we will see the exchange of accusation between\
    \ the two configurations, is \nthe most feature of New Halfa Scheme. Generally\
    \ speaking, one of the main causes of \nwater shortage in both schemes is the\
    \ blockage of the minor and field water course by \nweeds and silt. The tenants\
    \ reported that they are not satisfied with the canal \noperations and quality\
    \ of water-course cleaning carried out by the scheme authority. \n    \n6.2.2\
    \  Gendettu Scheme \n \nMost NAPC schemes suffer at one time or another and to\
    \ a varying extent from pump \nfailure, fuel shortage, water intake problems,\
    \ or inefficient water distribution. Gendettu, as \nwas stated before, is the\
    \ extreme case. The level of water management on the scheme is \nseen to be at\
    \ a very basic level. When we try to draw conclusions from the analyses of the\
    \ \nNRIRP (ODA 1986 Vol.2:A1/2-17) as outlined in the technical description of\
    \ the scheme; \nChapter 5.4.4.3 and 5.4.4.4, we find that: \n \n− a major cause\
    \ of the early plant failure and deterioration was poorly organized \noperation\
    \ and maintenance; \n− the reasons for the chronic complains that have been registered\
    \ at Gendettu - \ninsufficient water for satisfactory irrigation of the current\
    \ cropping pattern - was \nfound to be a combination of inadequate pumping capacity\
    \ and inefficient water \ndistribution; \n− the need of completely rebuilding\
    \ for the ‘onshore’ facilities: the construction of \noffice, workshop, storage\
    \ accommodation; and \n \n182 \n− there were large number of uncontrolled outlet\
    \ pipes serving individual land \nholding (300). \n \nIn addition, farmers were\
    \ asked to identify those problems which are the main constraints \nlimiting their\
    \ farming activities. In all interviews but one the main problem was said to be\
    \ \ninadequate water supplies. A shortage of pesticides was the next most frequently\
    \ noted \nproblem. Other problems mentioned were shortages of tractors, labor,\
    \ fertilizer and seeds . \n \nWhen we compare the above results with the findings\
    \ of this study  shown in Table 6.7 \nand Table 6.8 five years later, we are forced\
    \ again to question whether this scheme has \nalso been rehabilitated? Again,\
    \ in spite of the rehabilitation, the officials assert that the \npumping and\
    \ related plant, and the canal network are the main causes (67%) for the under-\n\
    performance of the Scheme. \n \nTable 6.7 Officials Report on Reasons for the\

    \ in relation to his performance, two questions were put before him to respond\
    \ to \n(Table 6.8). The first is a specific one on the factors that hampered increasing\
    \ the \nagricultural production; while the second (at the end of interview) is\
    \ a general one the \nproblems of the Scheme. It is logical then that water shortage\
    \ come to the front. One can \nalso clearly notice the urgent need for active\
    \ support service institutions organizing credit, \nsupplies and marketing. The\
    \ lack of fertilizers, pesticides, and means to finance the \nexpensive operations\
    \ constitute 43% of the factors that hinder the production220. By way of \ncomparison,\

    \  \n \n1) State of repair: \na- instability of the main station. Its position\
    \ has been changed 7 times. \nb- there is no any means of measuring the amount\
    \ of water being delivered i.e., water \ndischarge records for each pumpsets222.\

    \ 45 percent in Table 6.7 is subdivided as following: the position of the main\
    \ Station (19%), pump sets \n(11%), Fuel (10%), and qualified technicians (5%).\
    \   \n222 One of the recommendations of the ODA’s Study  (1988) in this context\
    \ was: „Measurement of water flow \nfrom the pumping station would be means of\
    \ a ‘Crump’ weir in the discharge channel. This can be directly \ncalibrated in\
    \ liters per second and is cheaper to install and requires far less maintenance\
    \ than ‘Dall’ type \nflow meters or orifice plate. The ‘Crump’ weir will enable\
    \ the staff to monitor and record the output from \nthe pumping station and also\
    \ to evaluate individual pump performance“ (ODA 1988:Vol.1:3-5). It has \nalso\
    \ been recommended that flow measuring structures should be constructed at the\
    \ head of each canal to \nmonitor the pump discharge. Previous attempts to install\
    \ automatic water level records, as at Kitiab and \nAliab, have failed due to\
    \ mechanical breakdown and lack of maintenance and it has been therefore \nproposed\
    \ that, although provision may be made for future installation of automatic recorders,\
    \ initially, \nflows should be recorded manually (ODA 1986vol.2:A3/4-1).  \n223\
    \ This fact had been alleged by the scheme Manager, the mechanical Engineer, and\
    \ even Chief of the pump-\nset operators. \n224 One of the new pumps in the main\
    \ station was not working for more than two months in the season 92/93 \nbecause\
    \ of this problem. \n \n184 \n2) Significant quantities of fuel are also being\
    \ lost through leaks in the fuel pipes and \nengine connections. In addition,\
    \ storing fuel and oil outside, on the air, is uneconomical \nand can damage the\
    \ quality. That is why, the volume of fuel consumption is often not \nconverted\
    \ to the expected amount of water. The unavailability of fuel at the critical\
    \ time \nfor irrigation is therefore a Gendettu’s phenomenon within the NAPC schemes.\
    \ Usually, \nthe other schemes begin the season after securing the whole required\
    \ amount of fuel. In \nGendettu, on the other side, it seems that the policy is\
    \ „from hand to mouth“. That is \nwhy, it was observed during the field work that\
    \ pumping was many times reduced or \nsuspended because of shortage of fuel. Reduced\
    \ dependence on diesel fuel would be \ntherefore a great asset WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON\
    \ (1985:19). \n \n3) The need of qualified chief and experienced pump-set operators\
    \ to carry out proper \noperation and maintenance. This category is very important\
    \ in pump schemes. They are \nparticularly liable to abuse their positions because\
    \ they have monopoly control over \ndistribution within the areas commanded by\
    \ their pumps. To keep this situation in hand, \nargues SAGARDOY (1986:27), effective\
    \ management control systems are specially \nimportant, linked to incentives,\
    \ e.g., through promotion, to induce correct operation. So, \nit is desirable\
    \ that pump operators be mechanics, or relatively have mechanical \ntraining225.\
    \ \n \n4) The chief of the pump-set operators has defended the accusations and\
    \ pointed out: \na- still, in spite of the recommendation of ODA226, there is\
    \ a lack of the „onshore“ \nfacilities; there is no house, office (or even a roof\
    \ over one’s head), store, workshop, \ntransport, or medical care. Very briefly,\
    \ human being here is neglected and that is why \nthey are depressed. For these\
    \ reasons, many workers leave the work during the season \nand we are forced to\
    \ accept anybody disregard to the experience or qualification.  \nb- instead of\
    \ seven persons, work only four per shift. This situation is only in Gendettu.\
    \ \nAlthough 40 persons are registered in the mechanical department, most of them\
    \ work \nin other NAPC’s schemes. It is interesting here to find that in a scheme\
    \ like Saial (6 \n000 feddan) work 15 in the pump station. \nc- there is neither\
    \ ‘occupational structure’ (job description)227 nor training in this \ndepartment\
    \ and the scheme at all. \nd- the mechanical Engineer is responsible for other\
    \ three schemes and he is often busy. \n \n                                  \
    \              \n225 The chief of the pump-set operators in Gendettu is unqualified,\
    \ but has long experience in the work. He \nwas normal pump operator and has reached\
    \ this position without any training courses. Just as the \nresponsible chief\
    \ of the engineering department in New Halfa at the end of 1980S, who hadn’t any\
    \ \ntechnical qualification. \n226 „... This situation must be remedied as a mater\
    \ of urgency as rehabilitation of plant should not be \nundertaken without the\
    \ establishment of a clearly recognizable operation and maintenance structure,\
    \ ‘on-\nthe-job training’, strict operation and maintenance procedures and adequate\
    \ storage and stock control“. \nThe points which require particular attention\
    \ are (NRIRP, 1988:3-7): \n \n- Operating schedules for pumping plant; \n \n-\
    \ The rehabilitation of pumpstation structure and facilities; \n \n- Pumpstation\
    \ records; \n \n- Workshop and storage facilities and the supply of spare parts;\
    \ \n \n- The introduction of an exchange unit systems; \n \n- Fuel delivery, storage\
    \ and dispensing.   \n227 If individual members of staff are to perform their\
    \ duties properly, they must have a reasonably accurate \nand comprehensive knowledge\
    \ of what those duties are. \n \n185 \n5) All these constraints are responsible\
    \ for the breakdown of the pumps which causes the \ndelay of planting and confusing\
    \ the rotation system. According to the monthly reports \nof the scheme, it was\
    \ found that the average of this breakdown per month during the \npumping time\
    \ in the main station was 10 days in 1989, and 8 days in 1990 and 1991228. \n\
    In addition to average of 8, 6 and 7 days respectively in which the pump station\
    \ had \nworked with 30-50% of its capacity.  \n \nThe answers given from the tenants\
    \ to the question: „why water is not coming in the right \ntime?“ tie well with\
    \ the above analysis. The overwhelming reasons for delays is due to lack \nof\
    \ fuel and pump breakdowns (together 63 %). More other causes are identified.\
    \ Given in \npercentage of respondents supplying each, these causes are presented\
    \ in Table 6.9. \n \nTable 6.9 Tenants in Gendettu report on  \ncauses of water\

    6.2.2.2  Canal Network \n \nThe following points delineate in broad terms some\
    \ factors influencing the performance of \nGendettu’s canal network: \n \n− Expanding\
    \ of illegal cultivation and horticulture areas (the southern part of the \nscheme),\
    \ has changed the cropping pattern229, whereas the pumping capacity and \ncanal\
    \ network is not only stable but also deteriorated; \n− The structure of the canal\
    \ network makes water management difficult (there is no \nquaternary canals or\
    \ even, for the most, minor canals). The outcome is that; the \nfarmers take their\
    \ water directly from the main canal (the northern part of the \nscheme). In addition,\
    \ because the canal is narrow, it is difficult to use machines; \n− In addition\
    \ to the age of the canals, lack of routine maintenance i.e., desilting \ncanals230\
    \ and structures, repairs to gates231 and minor, repairs to structures, have \n\
    resulted in a steady decline in the condition of both canals and structures232.\
    \ The \n                                                \n228 It is not possible\
    \ then to improve the performance in Gendettu unless action is taken to improve\
    \ the \nenvironment of the pump station. The benefit of a ‘clean’ pump station\
    \ environment is reflected in the \nfact that in Aliab, Kitiab and Bagwa, old\
    \ pumpsets are still functioning satisfactorily.   \n229 This is also a Gendettu’s\
    \ specific problem in the northern Region. As a result, some need's water in a\
    \ time \nin which the other does not need. \n230 Clearing the canals must be begin\
    \ in November (the beginning of the season). Nonetheless, in the season \n92/93\
    \ it had begun in February. \n231 Gates in the main canal, in the area from Gendettu\
    \ until Mowes, are broken. \n232 Within this area of interest, the situation has\
    \ been described, before the rehabilitation, as follows: „..As a \nresult of inadequate\
    \ routine maintenance, minor problems lead eventually to major failure. For example,\
    \ \ngates which have been difficult to close have been hammered shut until eventually\
    \ they have fallen apart. \nSimilarly, gates which are difficult to open become\
    \ bypassed as farmers dig new offtake channels around \n \n186 \ncanal sections\
    \ are undersized due to siltation and the main contribution to \nconveyance losses\
    \ is poor water control and distribution. \n− It has been noticed that the irrigation\
    \ engineer who is responsible for canal network \nin Gendettu has no, at times,\
    \ transport facilities for the field. \n \n6.2.2.3  Supporting Institutions \n\
    \ \nAs discussed in the last Chapter (5.3.5), the agricultural services available\
    \ to the tenants in \nGendettu are provided by several different organizations\
    \ in the public sector as well as \nlocal merchants and entrepreneurs in the private\
    \ sector. The main services involved are \nfarm machinery, plant protection, extension,\
    \ agricultural credit and inputs. NAPC is then \nthe only regional government\
    \ irrigation agency in Sudan which has no its own \nagricultural service units.\
    \ That is why the agricultural service in Gendettu is very weak, \nargued the\
    \ general Manager of NAPC233. \n \nThe provision of tractor services is very important\
    \ supplement to the service provided by \nthe Scheme. Lateness of Land preparation\
    \ in this scheme, for instance, is partly due to \nthe dependence on the private\
    \ sector and the inadequate number of TFU’s tractors - only \nfive (Table 6.4).\
    \ Nobody within the sample has owned any agricultural machinery234, and \nthey\
    \ reported that the cost of hiring tractor per unit area/time is high (has the\
    \ same price in \nboth sources). In addition, on the contrary to New Halfa, there\
    \ is no co-operative society to \nhelp in this field235.  \n \nMost farmers appear\
    \ to prefer tractors than oxen as power source for land preparation, but \npoor\
    \ tractor availability and the high cost results in many farmers using oxen. Both\
    \ \nmoldboard and disc ploughs are used, whilst leveling is done with locally-constructed\
    \ \nmulti-purpose blade terraces236. Although the performance here is not enough\
    \ and needs \nmore effort and modernization, it has been described by the manager\
    \ of the research center \nin Shendy as „not bad“. It is anyway better than those\
    \ in New Halfa. The problem here, \nsaid the manager of the scheme, is not concerning\
    \ the field crops but horticulture and not \n                                \
    \                                                                            \
    \                                     \nthem in an attempt to obtain water“ (NHAC\
    \ 1988:3-5). This description is also valid for the situation in \nNew Halfa in\
    \ the season 92/93. \n233 It is important to reckon with the fact that to overcome\
    \ factors hampering production increases on irrigated \nsmall farms in developing\
    \ countries, support services have to be extended into the agricultural production\
    \ \nsphere itself. These services should include farm planning and higher-level\
    \ technology work operations \n(WÖRTZ 1993:112). \n234 The NRIRP has registered\
    \ an increase in the number of private tractors available to farmers in Gendettu\
    \  \nfrom 2 in 1984 to 7 in 1988). \n235 NAPC had undertaken this task at the\
    \ beginning of 1980s. Even though, it is commonly believed that as in \nNew halfa,\
    \ the services provided by the corporation was inadequate; out of its tractor\
    \ fleet of 68 tractors, \nonly 17 were in full working order.  \n236 The NRIRP\
    \ report (about KSK schemes; Kelli, Saial and Kabushia)) suggested that many farmers\
    \ either \nowned oxen or were able to borrow them from friends and relatives and\
    \ that there were some oxen for hire \nalso. More recent information from NAPC,\
    \ however, has suggested that most farmers using oxen hire \nthem from others.\
    \ During the group interviews conducted later by the same study, farmers said\
    \ that \nlivestock populations have decreased recently and that draught animals\
    \ are not as freely available as in the \npast. The costs per feddan of hiring\
    \ oxen for land preparation appear to be broadly similar to those \nfor tractor\
    \ cultivation (ODA 1988:A1/2-12). \n \n187 \nregarding land leveling but relating\
    \ to distributing the land; basins for the trees to control \nthe water. More\
    \ than 50% of the tenants, as he pointed out, are not aware of the advantages\
    \ \nthat can be skimmed from this operation, they are thinking only about the\
    \ additional costs. \n \nThe actual operations involved in land preparation can\
    \ be variable. Tractor operations are \nploughing and leveling: ox-powered operations\
    \ are ploughing, leveling, ploughing/sowing \nwhere the seed is dropped in the\
    \ furrow, and hod canal bank construction, which is done \nusing the sandtrack\
    \ leveler. The bunds surrounding hods and forming canals are sometimes \nmade\
    \ by hand using a ‘wasuq’; this is a two man operation with one pulling and the\
    \ other \nguiding/lifting (ODA 1988: A1/2-12).In addition, the optimum planting\
    \ dates are known \nand used by most farmers. A notable exception is cotton, which\
    \ should be planted before \n15 June but which is seldom planted before July and\
    \ may be planted (as in New Halfa) as \nlate as August, due to various constraints.\
    \ \n \nUnavailability of enough fertilizer, pesticides and means of financing\
    \ have in Gendettu \nmore negative effects on the productivity and the performance237.\
    \ The last one; financing, \nwill be discussed latter (Chapter 6.5.3). \n \n 6.\
    \ 3  Farmers Management: Water-Users’ Behavior \n \nHaving pointed out the role\
    \ of NHAC and NAPAC in water management, it is important to \nhighlight the role\
    \ of the third actor, which considered to be the focus of this study, namely \n\
    water users. Depending on the fact that all the structural work to be done within\
    \ the \nboundaries of a farm is the farmer’s responsibility, the schemes' administrations\
    \ in the two \ncases here, as in many other similar cases in the developing countries,\
    \ blame farmers for \nspoiling the water distribution system and the bad management\
    \ in the farm. A majority (88 \n%) of the officials in New Halfa reported that\
    \ they are not satisfied with the behavior of \ntenants with water. The other\
    \ 12 % reported „to some extent“. At Gendettu, the reply was \ndivided between\
    \ the two; 50% „no“ and 50% „to some extent“. It is interesting that, \nnobody\
    \ in both projects reported „yes“. As an explanation, they stated the following\
    \ \narguments (Table 6.10): \n \nTable 6.10 Reasons for the dissatisfaction concerning\
    \ Tenants’ behavior  \n \nNew Halfa \n% \nGendettu \n% \nabsenteeism \n28 \nthe\
    \ excessive use of water \n33 \ndo not adhere to recommendation \n25 \nthe psychological\
    \ factor \n33 \nunawareness \n18 \nspoil the canal system \n19 \nlack of co-operation\
    \ between \ntenants \n12 \ndo not adhere to \nrecommendation \n15 \nselfishness\
    \ \n9 \n \n \nfarm size is big \n8 \n \n \nSource: Own Survey \n \n          \
    \                                      \n237 These are exactly, to a big extent,\
    \ some of the constraints in the freehold areas (AMLAK) in New Halfa. \n \n188\
    \ \nThe argument, which has been often expressed in conversation is the absenteeism\
    \ of the \ntenants in the field. This phenomenon is valid in both projects, but\
    \ more extremely in New \nHalfa. In many cases, particularly at the beginning\
    \ of the season, water is available in the \nfield canal but the tenant is not\
    \ present. This problem is more observed in the Halfawyeen \nand considered, according\
    \ to the manager of the Madina Block, the main cause of the bad \nperformance\
    \ in their areas. He estimated that the concerned tenants within the Halfawyeen\
    \ \nas about 50%238. As well as, the Halfawyeen are often described as not convincible.\
    \ Within \nthe Arab, absenteeism increases in the rainy season. This problem is\
    \ also observed at \nGendettu and considered as one of the causes of the excessive\
    \ use of water. Generally, \nconcerning irrigation, tenant is surely present at\
    \ the field for onion and bersem, and may \normay not be present for faba and\
    \ wheat but absolutely not present for garden irrigation \n(see also Chapter 6.4.2).\
    \ In the last case, he opens the canal and goes to home. \n \nOne can say that\
    \ the psychological factor and the excessive use of water at Gendettu are \nthe\
    \ two sides of the same coin. Low reliability of the needed amount of water makes\
    \ the \ntenants unsure. The psychological reaction of this feeling of insecurity\
    \ is the excessive use \nof water239. Furthermore, because of the bad land leveling,\
    \ the tenant can not define the \naccurate amount of water and therefore give\
    \ the land more water. This results farther in \nexpanding the water intervals\
    \ and so on. It must be emphasized that water charging \nsystem, in Sudan (flat\
    \ rate per season irrespective of the number or the quantities of \nwatering),\
    \ as will be seen in Chapter 6.6, has no role in solving this problem. \n \nIt\
    \ is actually true that the gap between the current management practice on the\
    \ field canal \nand the officially recognized from NHAPC and NAPC is very deep.\
    \ But this is, first of all, \n                                              \
    \  \n238 It is worth noting that most of the Halfaween respondents reported that\
    \ they are responsible for more than \none Hawasha. This is due to the fact that\
    \ many families few years after the resettlement had left the \nScheme, entrusting\
    \ their tenancies to those staying behind, to carry production on their behalf.\
    \   \n239 For perspective, REPLOGLE (1986:118-9) related meaningful incident in\
    \ the United States in the early \n1970s, shortly after the steep rise in world\
    \ oil prices: „A national television talk show comedian host was \nlamenting the\
    \ resulting economic disruptions, saying that the whole world seemed to be on\
    \ „back-order“ \nwith shortages of everything, „even toilet tissue.“ (This was\
    \ meant to be humorous, since the supply-\ndemand for this item is, in reality,\
    \ extremely uniform). However, the general public had recently been \nconditioned\
    \ to some inconveniences in item shortages, and the national response was an irrational\
    \ run to \nthe nation’s store shelves and the hoarding of toilet tissue to the\
    \ point that, for a time, it could no longer \nbe found for purchase.“ „The sudden\
    \ empty supply chain certainly did not mean that the national demand \npattern\
    \ had changed at all, only that the distribution pattern had changed, and storage\
    \ of the item was \nnow located in millions of home cupboards rather than on store\
    \ shelves. This didn’t help other families \nthat had depended on an available\
    \ supply, however.“ „The national tissue manufactures knew that it \nwould be\
    \ foolhardy to build new facilities and increase production because of the temporary\
    \ shift in \nstorage (not true demand for their product), and eventually, as reliability\
    \ of supply became apparent, the \n‘shortage’ disappeared“. Irrigation projects,\
    \ argues REPLOGLE, are also subject to some of the \nhoarding psychology which\
    \ can be aggravated or ameliorated by the history of the system reliability. If\
    \ \nsystem reliability has been low, then the psychological incentives are to\
    \ use all opportunities and all \nmechanical adjustments, authorized and unauthorized,\
    \ to „hoord“ the water as if it were the last irrigation. \nFurther complicating\
    \ the social picture is that these shortages are not distributed but are usually\
    \ \ncompletely borne by those farmers farther from the supply source. This means,\
    \ he continuos, that the \nreliability usually becomes lower and the hoarding\
    \ pressures become higher as a function of distance from \nthe supply source.\
    \ A vicious circle is created wherein hoarding causes low reliability which then\
    \ increases \nhoarding. REPLOGLE argues that legal remedies and administrative\
    \ threats are generally ineffective, so \nthat remedies through physical system\
    \ changes and system management techniques are more feasible \nalternatives. \
    \ \n \n189 \nan indicator for the failure of all concerned organizations. It seems\
    \ to us that the tenants are \ntrying in one way or another, through their interventions\
    \ in managing the minor and \nquaternary canals, to compensate the weakness and\
    \ absenteeism of these organizations. \nUnfortunately they do not organize their\
    \ action or work collectively but they are trying to \nresolve the problems individually.\
    \ Because of this intervention as well as the remarkable \nabsence of NHAC and\
    \ NAPC field inspectors and khaffirs, it is normal to see in the same \ncommand\
    \ area, side by side, under- and over- supply of water. Anyway, the deviation\
    \ from \nthe instructions of management is not only restricted in the field of\
    \ water application240. \n \nIn New Halfa, it was found that the way in which\
    \ irrigation and farm management are \nactually undertaken, within the Unit Command\
    \ Area and at the level of the individual \ntenancy, differ from the procedures\
    \ which are recommended by the scheme management. \nThis is particularly of great\
    \ interest concerning: \n \n6.3.1  Irrigation Time \n \nAs was stated in the previous\
    \ sections, the irrigation system in the first phase of the project \nwas designed\
    \ according to the continuous irrigation system. This means, minor canals must\
    \ \nbe used as conveyors not as reservoirs in the night. However, because of different\
    \ reasons, \nmainly social, the tenants do not perform watering during the night\
    \ and, therefore, close \nthe intermediate regulator gates by sunset. The consequences\
    \ of such deviation from the \ndesigned system are as follows: \n \n− destroy\
    \ the canals and regulator gates; \n− leads to a remarkable waste of water which\
    \ affects directly the water management \nof the quaternary canal (Abu XX); \n\
    − due to the rise in the water surface level in the canals during the night, the\
    \ roadbeds \nbesides    the Hawasha becomes very muddily; and \n− make with other\
    \ unofficial intervention the situation downstream worse241.    \n \n6.3.2  Water\
    \ Intervals \n \nBefore discussing the behavior of tenant concerning the water\
    \ interval, it is important for \nthe analysis to explain first the water requirement\
    \ for the crops and the instructions of the \nmanagement concerning the irrigation\
    \ practices. These parts are described in detail in \nNHIRP, ANNEX 1 and 2. \n\
    \ \nIn the New Halfa irrigation scheme the irrigation interval recommended by\
    \ the NHAPC is \n14 days and does not vary for the different crops. About 420\
    \ m³/feddan is applied per \nirrigation. According to this standard, the total\
    \ applications for the three crops are: \n                                   \
    \             \n240 According to THORNTON/WYNN (1987:222), the resettled Halfaween\
    \ are inclined to trust their own \njudgement in their crop husbandry. Their experience\
    \ as Nile rivrine cultivators has not always proved \napplicable, however, in\
    \ contrast, the nomadic peoples have proved more receptive to the instruction\
    \ of \nmanagement. \n241 To avoid watering at the night, some who have the turn\
    \ let the water flow and flood the downstream fields  \n \n190 \ngroundnuts 7,\
    \ Cotton 9, wheat 7 (not including the first watering for all crops). 242 At a\
    \ 60 \nper cent application efficiency,243 the average gross requirements from\
    \ the reservoir are \n415 m³/fd/14 days for groundnuts, 510 m³/fd/14 days for\
    \ cotton and 445m³/fd/14 days for \nwheat244.  \n \nThe existing system requires\
    \ a tenant to dig a channel in the Abu XX bank to lead water \ninto the appropriate\
    \ Abu VI. The amount of water led off is dependent on the rate of flow \nin the\
    \ Abu XX and the dimension of the channel. The rate of flow in the Abu XX is \n\
    dependent on the head of water in the minor canal, the degree of weed invasion,\
    \ the \nsiltation factor and the 'Khaffir' operating the field outlet pipe. On\
    \ this basis it is impossible \nto regulate the quantity of water applied in any\
    \ one irrigation. \n \nAssuming that the canal system, up to and including the\
    \ Abu XX is operating at correct \nflow rates, the quantity of water led off into\
    \ the Abu VI, according to the NHIRP, is a \nfunction of time. The normal practice\
    \ is to flood the basins individually and this takes 24 \nhours. In the Halfawyeen\
    \ areas where there is no storage arrangement, irrigation \napplication must go\
    \ on for 24 continuous hours. This is not, as noted above, acceptable to \ntenants\
    \ who were unwilling to work at night. The total number required should therefore\
    \ \nbe supplied over a period of 2 x 12 hours and the flow rate in the Abu XX\
    \ should be able \nto cope with this requirement. \n \nThe design of the Abu XX\
    \ is aimed at watering four Hawashas (four Abu VIs) \nsimultaneously. This is\
    \ known as a roebat. Thus an 18 Hawasha numbers should take a \ntotal of 9 or\
    \ 10 days to complete one watering cycle. It can be seen from this that a four\
    \ \nday period of grace exists between the last Hawasha and the start of the next\
    \ cycle on the \nfirst Hawasha of an 18 Hawasha numbers. \n \nIn the case of the\
    \ 36 Hawasha numbers the position is extremely difficult. Because the \n‘twin\
    \ Abu XXs’ (El double) are serviced by one field outlet pipe from the minors (see\
    \ \nchapter 5.3.6.2). These numbers cannot be irrigated in a 14 day cycle and\
    \ in practice it \ntakes some 20-22 days to complete 36 Hawashas when the twin\
    \ Abu XX are completely \nfree of weeds and the flow rate is at design level245.\
    \ As a result, the yields on the 36 \nHawasha numbers are below average as the\
    \ crops are basically under-irrigated for the \nmajority of the time and not simply\
    \ at the one cycle of peak demand. This is due to the 20-\n22 days watering cycle\
    \ of 2 x 12 hours in place of the designed 14 day cycle (NAPC 1986: \nANNEX 2:21).\
    \ \n \n                                                \n242 According to the\
    \ manager of the Agricultural Research Center (New Halfa), Cotton needs 10 watering\
    \ and \nsometimes more, Groundnuts needs also 10 waterings, Wheat 7 watering and\
    \ usually between 5-6, and \nSorghum between 5-6 waterings. \n243 By assuming\
    \ that the three crops mentioned are equally distributed over the area, as is\
    \ the aim of the \nNHAPC, and assuming that an application efficiency on the land\
    \ cropped with sugar cane and freehold \nland and forest is in the same order\
    \ of magnitude as on the NHAPC land, an overall field application \nefficiency\
    \ of 79 per cent is found. \n244 The NHIRP (NAPC 1986:ANNEX 2:20) which has stated\
    \ the figures see that these figures are theoretical \nas they assume the ability\
    \ to adjust the amount of water actually applied to the crops. This is not possible\
    \ \nwithout incurring massive expenditure on metering devices to the actual Hawashas.\
    \ \n245 According to the designed discharge in the Abu VI (30 1/s.), it can be\
    \ calculated that the time taken to \nirrigate one feddan is about 4 hours, and\
    \ one field of 5 feddans (Hawasha) will take about 20 hours, while \na roebat\
    \ will be irrigated at the same time. A total area of 180 feddan (36 Hawasha)\
    \ will take then, \ntheoretically, 180/20 * 20 = 180 hours or 7.5 days. \n \n\
    191 \nAs conclusion for the situation, the NHIRP (NAPC 1986:ANNEX 1:25) reveals:\
    \ „During \nthe survey in the New Halfa Irrigation Scheme, it appeared that subsequent\
    \ watering were \nnot carried out properly. Recommendations as to intervals between\

    \ Table 6.11: \n− the application to cotton is under the recommended for all tenants.\
    \ However, there \nare some anomalies in the data of the Halfawyeen concerning\
    \ cotton. Those who \nmentioned 8 watering have probably better conditions or\
    \ may be did not understand \nthe question and mentioned instead an ideal number.\
    \ The latter may be valid by \nmany others.  \n− concerning Sorghum, most of the\
    \ Arab (specially in Sedira and greges) said: three \nand the rest of the water\
    \ requirement is supplied from rainfall. Similar finding was \nobserved in the\
    \ Halfawyeen. \n− the results of wheat show its importance for the Halfawyeen,\
    \ just like sorghum is \nfor the Arab. \n− the cash crop groundnuts are more insured\
    \ than cotton and may be at its expense246. \n \nIn some bureaucratic irrigation\
    \ systems, like our cases, even though local farmers are \nunable to develop their\
    \ own collective-choice arrangements, they have developed „extra-\nlegal“ rules\
    \ to suit their own circumstances (TANG/OSTROM 1993:16).247 The data of the \n\
    actual duration of irrigation are represented in Table 6.10 and show that: \n\
    \                                                \n246 An interesting comment\
    \ from the Arab’s area: groundnuts do not refuse the water!  \n247 Examples of\
    \ the difference between informal, farmer-established rotations and formal rotations\
    \ \nestablished by the Irrigation Department that have been mentioned here (Merrey\
    \ and Wolf 1986:46) are \nseen in the Gondalpur Watercourse: \n \n„Unlike the\
    \ formal rotation, the informal rotation takes into consideration local conditions\
    \ such as the \nsandiness of soils and the height of the field relative to the\
    \ ditch. Thus, a sandy or high field is awarded \nextra time to ensure it can\
    \ be irrigated. More time is also allowed for filling long sections of the \n\
    watercourse“.   \n \n192 \n \n− Tenants who reported one day (in particular the\
    \ Halfawyeen), definitely do not \nirrigate the field basins individually but\
    \ flood the whole field in one go (at the same \ntime). \n− 45 per cent of the\
    \ Arab need more than three days to irrigate their fields. This \nmeans, the period\
    \ of grace exists between the last Hawasha and the start of the next \ncycle on\
    \ the first Hawasha can not be only four days.  \n− The reply which has been often\
    \ repeated is: „one day when there is enough water  \nand 3-4 days in the case\
    \ of water shortage.    \n \nTable 6.12 Percentage of Duration of Irrigation in\

    \ same can also be said about water intervals. According to the officials: \n\
    − The regular irrigation intervals were never practiced with exception of the\
    \ first two \nwatering for wheat. On the other hand, many tenants believe, it\
    \ is better when the \ninterval between the first and the second irrigation of\
    \ wheat more than 14 days248. \nThey believe also that water interval for wheat\
    \ must be three weeks (or more) not \ntwo weeks. \n− Three factors determine the\
    \ water interval of Cotton; 1) the availability of water; 2) \nwhether the tenant\
    \ is busy with other crop,  and 3) the existence in the field at all. \n− The\
    \ rainfall confuses sometimes the water intervals (in particular for Sorghum).\
    \ \n \nOn the other hand, the data given in Table 6.13 show that sorghum (dura)\
    \ is the crop \nwhich experiences longer interval than the other, followed by\
    \ groundnuts and cotton. The \ndata of wheat stand in relative contrast to the\
    \ opinion of the officials (or the generalization \nin this opinion). Commenting\
    \ on this contrast, the water-users pointed out that there are \ntwo practiced\
    \ methods to irrigate wheat. The first is to irrigate the field before the sowing\
    \ \n(wet planting). It needs normally more than 21 days water interval. On the\
    \ contrary, the \nsecond method (planting into dry soil in basins) needs two waterings\
    \ for month. \nFurthermore, the last method needs few seeds, which is considered\
    \ as an advantage for the \ntenants. One may infer that the behavior of water-users\
    \ is entirely conditional upon the \navailability of water249. \n            \

    \ in the Agricultural Research Center (New Halfa). \n249 Justification of such\
    \ observation can be drawn from village 6 in the Arab area (water shortage) and\
    \ village \n5 Halfaween (no water problem), for instance. The average water intervals\
    \ in the former are: cotton (28), \ngroundnuts (24), and sorghum (30). Whereas\
    \ in the later the average is as follows: cotton (15), groundnuts \n(15), and\

    \ also the case at Gendettu. It is commonly believed that in case of water \n\
    availability, the adherence to management recommendations concerning water interval\
    \ is \nhigh. The exemption here is the case of faba beans. The water-users believe\
    \ here also that \nthe interval after the second watering must be longer. It is\

    \ and 7 are forced, however, to adhere to these recommendations \nthrough the\

    quoted by NAPC and the Agricultural Research Center in Shendi are: \n \n1- Seifi\
    \ Season: Sorghum fodder (6), Cotton (8). \n2- Damira Season: Sorghum grain (7).\
    \ \n3- Winter Season: Faba Beans (8), Wheat (8), Pulses(8), Onions (14), Bersem\
    \ (two per \nmonth), Horticulture (2 or1 per month).250 \n \n6.3.3  Crops Preferability:\
    \ Wheat and Sorghum vis-à-vis Cotton \n \nThe observations in the large agricultural\
    \ schemes in Sudan highlight the fact that cotton \nranks first in the „upper\
    \ management body’s“ priority scale, whilst subsistence and food \ncrops are looked\
    \ upon more as a necessary addition to cotton production (WÖRTZ \n1993:109). On\
    \ the contrary, it appears instead that the farmers have other scale of priority.\
    \ \nAs BARNETT (1977) observed in Gezira, the way in which the water is rationed\
    \ by the \ntenants between the different crops reflect the primacy of food crops\
    \ sorghum and wheat in \nthe tenants scale of values. The emphasis is always on\
    \ „our daily bread“ as opposed to \n„the Government’s cotton“. Groundnuts come,\
    \ however, in the middle between the two \nextremes. It seems to us that the base\
    \ of this ranking (classification) is not only food crops \n                 \
    \                               \n250 Bayoumi (1976) has stated that the irrigation\
    \ water requirements of 1 feddan of plantation is 400 m³ per \nmonth (WEDDERBURN/ERRINGTON\
    \ 1985:19). \n \n194 \nvis-à-vis non-food crops, as BARNETT argued, but first\
    \ of all profitable crops vis-à-vis \nnon-profitable crops251. In this respect,\
    \ it has been observed that many tenants intercrop \n(between rows) some Pulses\
    \ and Karkade with wheat and groundnuts to compensate the \neffect of the high\
    \ production costs. \n \nBroadly speaking, the tenant priorities in irrigation\
    \ in New Halfa are as follows: \n− crops that are marketed directly by tenants252;\
    \ and  \n− crops that are already planted as against those that are at the beginning\
    \ of planting \n(dura or groundnuts as against cotton or wheat by the Arabs).\
    \ \n \nIn addition, reasons that are always mentioned for such preference are:\
    \ \n•  The concentrated rotation which make it necessary to distribute the limited\
    \ resources; \nspecially labor force, between three crops in three months (June,\
    \ July, and August); \n•  lateness of land preparation, and \n•  the tenant is\
    \ not convinced of the Research Center’s recommendations. \n \nThe same phenomenon\
    \ has been registered at Gendettu, and the reasons are, for the most \npart, the\
    \ same. The priority here is for 1) the valuable crop (profitability); this means\
    \ onion \nfirst and then the others; and/or 2) crop which cannot stand water shortage\
    \ e.g., onion or \nfaba as against alfalfa. \n \n6.3.4  Irrigation Method \n \n\
    The introduction of suitable irrigation methods is an important point that is\
    \ intimately \nrelated to the need for appropriate land development work (usually\
    \ grading). This point \nbring to light, then, the relationship between the method\
    \ of land use and the method of \nwater use, in particular in a case of water\
    \ shortage. \n \nIrrigation system in the New Halfa Scheme is supplied by the\
    \ Angaya system. This \nsystem, as described in the study of NHIRP, is designed\
    \ as basins in which the water is \nbrought in by perforating the bank of the\
    \ Abu VI. As already mentioned, the field must be \ndistributed by seven irrigation\
    \ ditches and seven field bunds.  In general one Hawasha of 5 \nfeddan is divided\
    \ then into 16 basins of 0.3 feddan each (fig. 5.14), and the selection of the\
    \ \nnumber of basins depends on the slope of the field (NAPC 1986: ANNEX 1:40).\
    \ When the \namount of basins is not adapted to the slope, the water distribution\
    \ in the basins will be \nuneven, and the basins at the lower end will receive\
    \ too much water, while the basins at the \nupper end will be under irrigated.\
    \ \n \nTherefore, the rule is, the more the number of angayas the better the control\
    \ of water in the \nfield. This recommendation and its implications are, therefore,\
    \ less simple than they may \nfirst appear. The tenants, as the officials - 92%\
    \ in New Halfa, and 67% in Gendettu - \nblamed do not follow this recommendation.\
    \ In this context, they stated the following \nargument: \n \n \n            \
    \                                    \n251 See Chapters 6.4.5 and 6.6. \n252 It\
    \ is very important here to emphasize the interests of the emigrant labors who,\
    \ in the most, undertake the \ntask of irrigation. They prefer to irrigate the\
    \ crop they are sharing (groundnuts) as against dura for \ninstance. That is why\
    \ many of the Arabs have to enunciate the groundnuts to secure dura. \n \n195\
    \ \n• their costs are high; \n• the tenants are absent; \n• the relevant machines\
    \ are not available and then it has to be done manually;  \n• they take a considerable\
    \ area from the field; and  \n• they hinder the harvest machines for wheat. \n\
    \ \nAlthough the data given in Table 6.14 confirm this blame, it should be taken\
    \ with caution. \nWe believe that the actual numbers are less than those mentioned\
    \ here. The tenants know \nthe importance of this task as indicator for their\
    \ performance in the field. That is why they \nwere particularly the Halfawyeen\
    \ who are always accused of absenteeism, \noverexaggerating their real work to\
    \ wave away this accusation. This view is reached based \non the information of\
    \ the key informants, the trustable tenants and above all the \nobservation in\
    \ the field. According to these sources: \n \n− the maximum number is 12 Angaya,\
    \ and even this is valid only for wheat. \n− the number of cotton Angayas are\
    \ often fewer. The average is eight and in many \ncases between five and eight.\
    \ The reason mentioned here is not only the high cost \nof this practice, but\
    \ also the high cost of ginning. The base of paying for the labors \nin cotton\
    \ fields is the number of angayas. \n− the average number in Abu Nagma Block,\
    \ in particular in Arab 5 and Arab 6, is \nrelatively high whereas in Sedira,\
    \ for instance, it is between nine and ten. \n− the relative high numbers in groundnuts\
    \ fields for the Halfawyeen show the \ninterests of the emigrant labors.     \n\

    \ furnished by the survey reveals that the majority of tenants (53 %) do not \n\
    irrigate angaya by angaya as is recommended. Factors that determine the number\
    \ of \nangayas irrigated together are:  \n1) kind and age of the crop; cotton\
    \ and groundnuts: (3-3), wheat: the first watering (1-1) \nand then (3-3) \n \n\
    196 \n2) volumes and flow of water in the water course; weak flow (1-1), middle\
    \ flow (2-2), \nstrong flow (3-3).   \n3) whether the tenant himself irrigate\
    \ or a hired labor. Wage labors tend to irrigate the \nwhole Hawasha at one time.\
    \ \n \nThe angaya system has several disadvantages: \n− Mechanization possibilities\
    \ are limited. \n− Poor water management and water control result in waterlogging\
    \ of the basins. \n− This system tends to over-irrigation due to lack of water\
    \ measuring and regulating \ndevices at field level. \n \nTherefore, one of the\
    \ short-term measures for increasing the level of water utilization \nefficiency,\
    \ as recommended in the rehabilitation study, was changing the irrigation method\
    \ \n(NAPC 1986:ANNEX 1:48). As alternative, irrigation by the double ridging method\
    \ was \nproposed. This method is already practiced on some of the freehold land\
    \ for vegetable \nproduction253. The system as used in vegetable gardens was inspected\
    \ during various \nstages, and the results found were very encouraging. The observed\
    \ advantages of the \ndouble ridge system over the Angaya are (NAPC 1986:ANNEX\
    \ 2:22): \n \n− the plant line was not inundated; \n− germination of fine, small\
    \ seeds was good; \n− ease of watering; \n− because the surface was dry and friable,\
    \ weed control was simpler and more \neffective; \n− the working direction is\
    \ along the long axis of the „number“ i.e., across the \nHawasha to the improvement\
    \ of machine utilization; \n− low and high spots tended to be neutralized254;\
    \ and \n− the whole Hawasha could be used255. \n \nNotwithstanding the above,\
    \ almost all the interviewed the officials believe that it would be \nunwise to\
    \ change this system. Basin's system, they view, is the best for gravity and the\
    \ \nmost suitable for the soil in New Halfa. As well, it was very interesting\
    \ to find that almost \nnobody had heard about the alternatives recommended by\
    \ the NHIRP. \n \nThe arrangements for irrigation at Gendettu are very similar\
    \ to those described in New \nHalfa. Some crops like faba beans, sorghum and lubia\
    \ (Dolichos Lablab) are irrigated by \nangaya. For the other crops which consider\
    \ sensitive to water, like onion, vegetable and \nalfalfa, irrigation is done\
    \ by sub-dividing the angayas into small parcels or hods and letting \nthe water\
    \ flow into each parcel in turn. The smaller the parcel the less the effect of\
    \ surface \nvariation and the more efficient the irrigation. For instance, onions\
    \ are grown in small hods \nwith an area equivalent to 300 per feddan256. Surface\
    \ irrigation is also used for fruit trees; \nthe larger trees have individual\
    \ basins but closer spaced fruits such as bananas have several \n            \
    \                                    \n253 This method is also practiced in Zeidab\
    \ Scheme in the Nile Province for cotton irrigation. \n254 Here also, in order\
    \ to obtain a proper water distribution over the furrows, perfect land leveling\
    \ is required. \n255 In this system furrows will run parallel to the Abu XXs from\
    \ one Abu VI to another, and thus have a \nlength of 75 m. The total furrows per\
    \ feddan are 31 furrows i.e., 156 per Hawasha. \n256 As the case for cotton in\
    \ New Halfa, many tend to increase the size of the parcel to reduce the cost of\
    \ \nleveling, weeding and transplanting (the parcel is the unit of account for\
    \ these two operations, or in other \nwords, payments for the hired labors are\
    \ based on a piece rate system). \n \n197 \nstools in each basin (NAPC 1986:A1/2-17).\
    \ Anyway, the opinion of the officials about the \nadherence of the tenants is\
    \ generally positive. Water management at fields, in comparison \nwith New Halfa,\
    \ is better. Farmers seemed to have full control on water distribution in the\
    \ \nfield because of their long experience, with the exception of the case for\
    \ horticulture. Most \nof the officials, as well as the Horticultural Department\
    \ in the Regional Ministry of \nAgriculture, agree that the management in the\
    \ gardens is very bad - canals and basins are \nnot well distributed, not clean,\
    \ and always over irrigated; spaces between trees are not as \nrecommended; and\
    \ there is no drainage system. \n \n6.4 Water Distribution \n \nSchedule systems\
    \ or allocation rules are the most important activity for management in an \n\
    irrigation system, especially when the supply of water is inadequate to meet the\
    \ crop \nrequirements of all cultivators simultaneously. There appears, from the\
    \ last section, to be a \ndirect relation between the efficiency of water distribution\
    \ and application efficiency. The \nobjective of water distribution is (WALKER/CLEVERINGA\
    \ 1989:M.XI.2) a supply of \nwater at each farm or field inlet, responding to\
    \ the following criteria: \n \n- predictable: foreknowledge of supply; \n- reliable:\
    \ \npredictably adequate and predictably timed; \n- adequate: \nalways sufficient\
    \ for a particular crop in a particular season; \n- timely: \nat a time desired\
    \ by farmers and productive for their crops; and \n- equitable: \nsupply proportional\
    \ to land-holding in the area. \n \n \nEnforcing these rules effectively can reduce\
    \ uncertainty and conflict among irrigators. The \nhead-enders/ tail-enders’ \
    \ problem is often seen in most public schemes. Those near the top \nof channels\
    \ have an immense physical advantage of access which can be very difficult for\
    \ \nthose farther down to control. In the absence of countervailing custom, social\
    \ sanction, or \nphysical force, the privileged top-enders satisfy their own needs\
    \ first before allowing water \nto flow down a cannel to their less fortunate\
    \ neighbours below (CHAMBERS 1980:36). \n  \n6.4.1  Allocation system in both\
    \ Schemes \n \nWe are dealing here with bureaucratic allocation systems (water\
    \ authority oriented \nsystems). Such systems usually practice rigid257 water\
    \ delivery scheduling systems. These \nsystems include what has been called the\
    \ rotation distribution system (RD), wherein a \nfixed flow rate of water is delivered\
    \ at a fixed duration for a predetermined frequency \n(REPLOGLE 1989:121-5). This\
    \ system is commonly used. A higher percentage of cases \nusing such systems as\
    \ the sole distribution procedure is characterized by problems in rule \nconformance\
    \ or maintenance than those using other types or combinations of distribution\
    \ \nprocedures (TANG/OSTROM 1993:9).258 \n \nEach irrigation project has a unique\
    \ schedule. OAD’s experience in Southeast Asia, where \nwater shortage is relative,\
    \ assuming point toward having gate or orifice control at the field \nchannel\
    \ level to be able to adjust flows, including to be able to reduce offtakes as\
    \ soon \nenough water has been received. Considering the social as well as the\
    \ technical factors, \n                                                \n257 A\
    \ rigid system does not respond to information and maintains the same operating\
    \ schedule under all \nconditions. \n258 However, it is believed that such a system\
    \ has many advantages: less losses specially in the case of \nscarcity, gives\
    \ more reliable and equitable supplies, and can make better use of rainfall. \n\
    \ \n198 \nUPHOFF’s experience in south Asia, on the other hand, where water shortage\
    \ is absolute, \npreferred management system like Warabandi259, delivering on\
    \ a pre-set schedule fixed \namount of water, well below what farmers would like\
    \ to have and could make good use of \nit. In such case, he argued, fixed structures\
    \ represent an optimal social adaptation because \nthere is less opportunity for\
    \ tampering with deliveries (UPHOFF 1991:203). At the same \ntime he confesses\
    \ what Pakistan case studies have shown, where the installed solid \nconcrete\
    \ turnouts were modified by farmers. Under these circumstances, farmers at the\
    \ tail \nend of the water courses were found to be clearly disadvantaged (SHAH\
    \ 1991:147). \n \nThe rotation system with its allotted time is practiced in our\
    \ two cases. In New Halfa, the \ndown-the-ditch distribution method is used within\
    \ a tertiary (up-stream users first). \nEvery four Hawashas along water course\
    \ (Abu XX) are entitled to receive water \nsimultaneously only one day, including\
    \ the night and then the next four. Just like in \nWarabandi, there is no provision\
    \ in the system to compensate any single individual farmer \nwho may fail to receive\
    \ his share of the water. This means, the whole ‘number’ (36 \nHawashas) must\
    \ be irrigated in 9 days. According to the survey, it was found that the \nperiod\
    \ taken to irrigate the ‘number’ can be one month when the quaternary canal has\
    \ \nbeen poorly maintained. At Gendettu, each field receives water independently\
    \ from the \nfield channel. \n \nIn view of the non-profit nature of New Halfa\
    \ Scheme, where the main objective is \nsettlement and resettlement, system management\
    \ activities should be oriented to „equality“ \nin the spread of water more than\
    \ the maximization of production. This later orientation is \nmore likely where\
    \ irrigation schemes have been developed to support the expansion of \ncash cropping\
    \ or export (Gezira or Rahad). However, all  the respondents (100%) within \n\
    the officials, in both schemes, reported that there is no equity in the amount\
    \ and the time \nof water distribution260. They stated the following arguments\
    \ (Table 6.15): \n \n• It is known that each canal group (minor or field water\
    \ course) and each tenant have \nindividual concerns which are very site specific.\
    \ The extreme form of social \ndisorganization which affected negatively the irrigation\
    \ management at the field level is \nthe non-co-operation in water distribution\
    \ between these groups and individuals. The \ntenants act selfishly. \n• Because\
    \ of the uncertainty, the tail-enders open the gates on the minor canals, and\
    \ those \nat the tail end of the water course break the dam built by the first\
    \ irrigators to obtain the \nwater in the night. They could not therefore control\
    \ the water in the Hawahsa and this \n                                       \
    \         \n259 Warabandi system „water by turn“ originating from Northern India\
    \ and adapted by the British \nAdministration \nto \n‘protective \nirrigation’\
    \ \nas \npart \nof \ntheir \npolicy \nfor \nthe \nlarge \nsystem \n(WALKER/CLEVERINGA\
    \ 1989:M.XI.2/6). It is therefore a permanent method of water distribution \n\
    management (Pacca Warabandi) shifting from one generation to other in Pakistan\
    \ (SHAH 1991:147). \nWarabandi as WALKER/CLEVERINGA described is a system of equitable\
    \ water distribution by turns \naccording to a predetermined schedule, specifying\
    \ the day, time and duration of supply to each farmer on \nthe tertiary unit in\
    \ production to the land holding in the command area of the outlet. The turn is\
    \ fixed, the \nflow is fixed, and the farmer may do with the little water as he\
    \ pleases to satisfy his (crops’) needs. \n260 Of note is the fact that to secure\
    \ a „fair“ distribution of water within irrigation communities may often \nbe\
    \ difficult. CHAMBERS (1980:40), in the light of this, pointed out: „in any case\
    \ there are problems with \nthe connotations and interpretations of fair“. \n\
    \ \n199 \nmay result in flooding the neighbors' fields. After watering they let\
    \ the water flow to \ndrainage261. \n• Mostly, the first ten tenancies get reliable\
    \ amount of water262. It can be that they \nwatering twice or three times before\
    \ the last ones practice the first watering263. \n• Sharecropping with the migrant-labors\
    \ is responsible for the conflicts and bad \ndistribution between the water users.\
    \ The sharecropper, who is strange, is not interested \nto make good relation\
    \ with the neighbors264. \n• There is no punishment, furthermore it is said that,\
    \ sometimes, preferential politic is \npracticed regard by some members of the\
    \ Scheme authority.  \n• Normally, the tenant do not irrigate but let this vital\
    \ task, in particular after the second \nwatering, to others who are often hired\
    \ labors. Those labours are always responsible \nsimultaneously for watering many\
    \ fields. \n• Those responsible for the execution of water control are not qualified.\
    \ In principle \n'Khaffirs' (water bailiffs), the government official designated\
    \ to closing and opening the \nsluice, are not in a position - because of socio-economic\
    \ reasons- to fulfil their tasks \nperfectly or at all. \n \nTable 6.15 Reasons\

    \ Own Survey \n  \nThe most crucial consideration on Gendettu Scheme (NAPC 1986:A3)\
    \ is the distribution \nof irrigation supplies in a more equitable manner to obviate\
    \ the need for farmers to \nsupplement their supplies from groundwater or by pumping\
    \ from the canals which no \nlonger command their fields. The solution as the\
    \ rehabilitation study had argued involves \ntwo factors, firstly, the supply\
    \ of an adequate quantity of water at field level and, \nsecondly, the maintenance\
    \ of sufficient command to enable gravity distribution of water \n           \
    \                                     \n261 The responsible engineers reported\
    \ that sometimes it is difficult to distinguish drainage and irrigation \ncanals\
    \ because the former are always full of water. In addition, as a result of lack\
    \ maintenance, waters \nseep away and destroy the roads. These make a suitable\
    \ environment for mosquitoes.    \n262 It does not mean that there is fair distribution\
    \ here from the technical point of view. The flow of water \nthrough the quaternary\
    \ canal is divided into four field channels, each of which has a different head.\
    \ Thus \nthe flow into the four Abu VIs is often not evenly distributed, and one\
    \ field receives more water than \nanother. \n263 In El Basawla area, the first\
    \ Hawasha on the Abu XX (which is the first on the minor) has practiced four \n\
    watering whereas the last Hawashas on other Abu XXs did not practiced the first\
    \ one. \n264 Sharecropping is more to be observed in the Halfawyeen area; in particular\
    \ for groundnuts. The migrant \nlabors from west Sudan are the specialists of\
    \ such crop because it needs more work at the field (most \noperations by hands).\
    \ The migrant labors prefer to share the Halfawyeen than the Arabs. The later\
    \ reported \nthat sharecropping with the migrant labors influence the production\
    \ of sorghum; their main food, because \nthe migrant labors take the water to\
    \ the groundnuts fields.  \n \n200 \nfrom the canals to all fields within the\
    \ scheme boundary. From tables 6.15, 6.8 and 6.9, the \nabove recommendations\
    \ were not been realized, and the failure to manage the irrigation \nsystem remain\
    \ the main reason of water distribution problems (67%). In addition, \ndistribution\
    \ of water is controlled very crudely, usually upstream users obtain water on\
    \ \ndemand at the expense of farmers downstream and the high fields are always\
    \ \ndisadvantaged. \nThe ignorance of farmers’ optimum and failure to this including\
    \ in the design and \noperation of the system can result in a combination of events:\
    \ aggregate production from \nthe area served will be less than the potential;\
    \ those farmers with sufficient resources will \ndevelop private systems (frequently\
    \ tube wells where physically possible); those farmers \nwithout resources will\
    \ put increased pressure on the public system. The results of the \nsurvey showed\
    \ that all these events, that have been experienced in Southeast Asian \ncountries\
    \ e.g., Philippine, Taiwan, and Malaysia (LEVINE 1986:57-8), are realized at \n\
    Gendettu.In resemblance to New Halfa, an individual sense prevailed among tenants.\
    \ \nEvery one is trying to solve his problem apart from the effects on the others265.\
    \ As stated in \nChapter 5.3.6.4, one of the characteristics of the irrigation\
    \ system there is that head-enders \nalong the main canal take more than their\
    \ ‘share’. The NRIRP 1986 estimated over 300 \nuncontrolled outlet pipes serving\
    \ individual land holdings (most of these are freehold), \ndespite the 9 'Khaffirs'\
    \ and agricultural policeman who are responsible for controlling these \npipes.\
    \ As a result, farmers at the tail of the land have resorted to pumping directly\
    \ from the \nmain canal, in particular in orchard’s areas.After the decision of\
    \ removing all these private \npumps on the main canal, the competition had increased,\
    \ specially in minors 4, 5, 6-7, and \n8. In our survey, 532 unofficial outlet\
    \ and breakage now been foundin almost six km \nlong area at the beginning of\
    \ the main canal. Each of the 67 Hawashas in minor 6-7 for \ninstance, has its\
    \ own offtake. As well as 63 % of the respondents reported that they have \nown\
    \ offtake; 17 % participate with other farmer, and 20 % with more than one. This\
    \ is why \nthe Ssheme has bad reputation. One of the NAPC, who had worked more\
    \ than thirty years \nin this area, went so far as to use a metaphorical word\
    \ for his description of the canal \nnetwork of Gendettu Schemes: „it looks like...sieve“.\
    \ The majority of farmers at the end of \nthe scheme  were enforced therefore\
    \ to dig Wells to supplement their supplies by pumping \nfrom groundwater. Many\
    \ of them were entirely depended on this water; especially in minor \n5. Increasing\
    \ the water availability then by increasing the pumping capacity will not, by\
    \ \nitself, solve this problem as additional water will be taken by the upstream\
    \ users who will \ncontinue to extend their holdings and intensity of cropping\
    \ at the expense of downstream \nusers266.   When the farmers are unable to get\
    \ water when they need, this circumstance is  \n                             \
    \                   \n265 This ‘morale value’(individualism), is strongly to be\
    \ observed in Sudan and the Arab countries after what \nis known as ‘oil revolution’\
    \ in the 1970s. Elsewhere we have argued that the most negative effect of the\
    \ \nlabor migration to these countries is that migration has offered individual\
    \ solutions for problems that \nshould ‘only’ be solved collectively specially\
    \ in the long run (KHALIL 1985). \n266 Four possible options of dealing with the\
    \ numerous uncontrolled offtakes on the main canal have been \nconsidered within\
    \ the scope of Schemes’ rehabilitation (NAPC 1986): \nThe main canal would be\
    \ divided into reaches and irrigation supplies would be rotated between reaches.\
    \ \nReinstatement of a secondary/Tertiary Canal system. This would entail the\
    \ closure of all existing offtakes \non the main canal with the exception of those\
    \ serving secondary or minor canals. \n \n(iii) Grouping of offtake. Groups of\
    \ three or four uncontrolled offtakes would be replaced with a single \nregulated\
    \ offtake and individual holdings would be served by small farm channels. This\
    \ is a compromise \nwhich may be acceptable to the farmers and which would not\
    \ involve excessive expenditure. \n \n(iv) Standard „Mini“ offtake. All uncontrolled\
    \ offtakes would be replaced by a new standard mini offtake \nserving an individual\
    \ farm unit.  \n \nIt remains to say that non of these options has been adopted\
    \ or realized.   \n \n201 \ndefined as the lack of water control. It is of great\
    \ importance in this respect to question \nwho is really  responsible for water\
    \ control over the penultimate stage (the Abu XX) in the \nfield water distribution\
    \ system? Control is the capability of the irrigation system to direct \nthe appropriate\
    \ amount of water to specific farmers’ fields when needed (LAYTON ET \nAL. 1994:291).\
    \ Actually, the scheme management and the farmers co-manage the control \nof water\
    \ as it moves through the irrigation system. At the most local points in the system,\
    \ \nthe management of water becomes a collective enterprise among farmers who\
    \ are working \nwithin a situation restricted by government regulations implemented\
    \ by officials and by the \nactions of neighboring farmers. \n \n6.4.2  Who controls\
    \ the water? \n \nIn other words, who is responsible for basic-level water indenting\
    \ in the schemes? Is the \ndecision taken in November 1992 (transfer of authority)\
    \ enough to put an end to the \nproblem of „the missing responsibility“ between\
    \ the agriculturists and the irrigation \ntechnicians? This leads us to highlight\
    \ the important role played by the local water staff \n(water guards) in the operation\
    \ of the irrigation. The local water staff are the key actors in \nbridging the\
    \ gap between the theory and reality of scheme performance267.They help to \n\
    show how improved performance must come from a balance of technical and social\
    \ \ninterventions. Water operators268are the main communication channel between\
    \ the scheme \nmanagement and the farmer; translating information both ways, diffusing\
    \ local tensions \nand helping irrigators arrange informal flexible scheduling\
    \ where formal operational rules \nare inappropriate and difficult to change (TANG/OSTROM\
    \ 1993:15). So their success \ndepends on their capabilities and honesty. Furthermore,\
    \ the water guard must be a man \ntrusted and respected by the farmers as well\
    \ as it is preferable that he lives among the \nfarmers of the canal in order\
    \ to facilitate communication. SAGARDOY (1986:70) \ndescribed the main characteristics\
    \ of water guards as follows: \na. Job description: these may vary slightly according\
    \ to the type of scheme. Those \nrelevant to our cases are: \n− distribute and\
    \ control the flows that each intake must deliver \n− open and close intake gates\
    \ or valves \n− communication to the block inspector of the request for water\
    \ \n− control of the canals and watercourses to avoid unauthorized use of water\
    \ \n− delivery of water bills \n \nb. Qualifications: basic primary school education\
    \ is normally sufficient to undertake those               \nfunctions. Water guards\
    \ should have neither relatives nor properties in the area they \nserve. They\
    \ should also have farming and irrigation experience. \n \n \n               \
    \                                 \n267 These important actors have often been\
    \ forgotten in debates on the strengthening of water user \nassociations, and\
    \ in reforming operations. An interesting and vivid examination of the important\
    \ role \nplayed by the water guards in the operation of irrigation schemes (case\
    \ study in western Mexico) is that of  \nZAAG (1992). \n268 There are different\
    \ local names for these key actors: ditch riders, ditch tenders, water guards,\
    \ guards, water \nbailiffs, gatekeeper, agricultural policemen, ‘zanjeros’, ‘Khaffir’.\
    \ \n \n202 \nc. Manpower requirements at the scheme: the number of water guards\
    \ needed at the \nscheme level is greatly influenced by the type of water distribution\
    \ used and by the \nnumber of intakes to be controlled. In the case of rotational\
    \ system, assuming that each \nfarm has one intake, the average standards for\
    \ each 5 000 ha269, derived from projects \nin several parts of the world is:\
    \ very large farm (6); large farm, 5-10 ha (8); medium \nfarm, 2-5 ha (10) and\
    \  small farm, 2 ha (12). \n \nThe numbers of Khaffirs working in New Halfa in\
    \ the Season 92/93 was 362. Generally, \nthe average in the southern parts of\
    \ the Scheme (Debera, Sasaraib, and Shek Omar) is more \nthan those in the northern\
    \ part (Demiat, Sedira, and Rira), because Khaffirs are also \nresponsible for\
    \ water control in the freehold lands (Amlak). The average per Block is 17, \n\
    compared with 14 in the northern Blocks. The distribution of Khaffirs in the survey\
    \ area \nwas as follows: (1) Sheik Omar (8 232 ha or 19 600 feddan)- Argin (19),\
    \ El Butana (18), \nAbu Nagma (15) (2) Sasaraib (7358 ha or 17 519 feddan)- Doghem\
    \ (21), El Madina (17), \nAlledaj (14). In addition, 9 Khaffirs and one policeman\
    \ are responsible for water control in \nGendettu. Each is responsible for one\
    \ minor. All of them are old men and have no \nexperience in Agriculture. They\
    \ were either army soldiers or workers in the towns.In \nprinciple it was the\
    \ agriculturist at the Block level who assesses water requirements for the \n\
    ‘numbers’ along a minor canal and who instructs the Khaffirs controlling the intermediate\
    \ \nregulators on the minors and the FOP to the Abu XX. It is the responsibility\
    \ of the Khaffir \nonly to open and close the regulator gates along the minors\
    \ and control water distribution \nbetween Hawashas. There is some similarity\
    \ with the „semi-demand method“ where the \nwater guards have a crucial role270.\
    \ Usually, Khaffir is responsible for three ‘bridges’, i.e., \nthree km (approximately\
    \ 3 Abu XXs), and his place of residence must be in the middle. \n \nOn the other\
    \ hand, there is often a yawning gap between the principle and the reality. The\
    \ \ncanals are really suffering from a lack of management and operational discipline.\
    \ Water \ndistribution from the minor to the Field Water Courses was very bad\
    \ and was not carried \nout according to their actual needs. In addition, there\
    \ were many problems that hinder the \ndischarge of water among minors and eliminate\
    \ therefore the supply that should be drawn \nby the FOPs. Control gates operations\
    \ and maintenance at the scheme need a lot of effort. \nBecause of the poor  maintenance\
    \ and the tenants’ intervention, many of them are not \noperational; some were\
    \ valveless or did not have bolt or weir blade. In addition, every \ntenant has\
    \ a „key“ (spanner) to manipulate the gates according to his own interest271.\
    \ Poor \nturnout structures272 result in in-correct distribution of water in the\
    \ minor canals, and \nuneven water distribution in the fields that are under the\
    \ command area. Minor canals in \nthe survey area are long and need more control\
    \ and communication. 273 El Butana Block  \n                                 \
    \               \n269 Local circumstances, such as transport facilities, ease\
    \ of access, particular configuration of canal layouts, \netc., may reduce or\
    \ increase the above standards. \n270 Semi-demand is one of the FAO’s classification\
    \ of delivery scheduling methods, amongst others like on-\ndemand method, canal\
    \ rotation and free demand, rotational system and continuous flow. According to\
    \ this \nmethod, water is made available to the farmer within a few days (generally\
    \ 2-7) of his request. The \namount is often limited to a certain volume per hectare.\
    \ \n271 One of the respondents in village 13 Halfaween reported that he has to\
    \ open 27 gates or many of them to \nget water. \n272 Devices for controlled discharge\
    \ of water from a pipe or canal onto the land, and consider essential parts of\
    \ \nthe distribution system in the gravity irrigation systems. \n273 Respondents\
    \ in this village reported: „in this village water stealing occur among the minor,\
    \ which extend \n17 km, not among Abu XX. \n \n203 \nfor example has 9 minors274\
    \ extending from km 26 until km 33. But, on the other side, it \nhas one follow\
    \ up office which has to co-ordinate with the distribution center in the km 65.\
    \ \nIt is supposed that, in any time, only four FOPs must be opened to keep the\
    \ discharge in \nthe field water course as designed. Because all FOPs are always\
    \ opened, the flow is very \nlow and all of them have water shortage275.That is\
    \ why - beside weed growth, siltation and \ndelayed maintenance - the average\
    \ flow through the FOP in New Halfa is less than the \n5000 m³ /day that have\
    \ been estimated by the MOI. It is approximately 2500 m³/day. This \nresults in,\
    \ irrigating instead of 12.5 feddan only 6 feddan per day. This means doublet\
    \ \nirrigation period. At Gendettu, the ‘high’ fields are, for this reason, not\
    \ able to irrigate276. \nThe result of the lack of an entity to control the project\
    \ control is that tenants try to adjust \nthe system. This action is of course\
    \ at the expense of the time and effort which should have \nbeen  given to water\
    \ control at the field. In the eyes of the department irrigation engineers, \n\
    these problems are closely bound up with:- lack of formal irrigation training\
    \ of the \nagriculturists themselves.- In reality, it is the Khaffir who assesses\
    \ water requirements \nrather than the agriculturists. Although a standard calculation\
    \ is supplied to the Khaffirs by \nthe Irrigation Service (IS), they are poorly\
    \ trained in its application.- Poor disciplinary \nmeasures on the Khaffirs who\
    \ may open more FOPs than permitted was also a contributing \nfactor. Khaffirs\
    \ frequently are absent from housing provided adjacent to intermediate \nregulators.\
    \ This is mainly because of social and economical constraints. They do not have\
    \ \nthe resources, support services and incentives, to take over their vital role.\
    \ The average \nsalary for Khaffir (1480-2430 LS) is approximately half what normal\
    \ agricultural labor can \nearn. That is why some of them are ready to accept\
    \ bribes, and then become dependent on \nthe tenants277. Many, on the other hand,\
    \ have become sharecroppers or have other works \nin the village, and most of\
    \ them do not reside beside the canal any more. It is finally to be \nconcluded\
    \ that the social conditions of the water operators should be brought into the\
    \ \nfocus in dialogues and discussions concerning water distribution. The tenants\
    \ were asked \nwhether the Khaffirs are always present (Table 6.16). Although\
    \ the majority (71 %) of \ntenants in Gendettu reported the presence of Khaffirs,\
    \ they added: he can not do anything \nin the case of water shortage. In addition,\
    \ the dependency of khaffir on the tenants, to fill \nhis income gap, makes him\
    \ powerless. On the otherhand, no contacted respondent from the \nTFU reported\
    \ „Yes“. The replies in New Halfa reflect the distribution of water problems \n\
    within the sample. All of the respondents in Sidira, Basawla, and villages 11\
    \ and 24 \nHalfawyeen replied „no“. Most of the tenants who reported „to some\
    \ extent“ like Arab 6 \nand 7, and village 5 Halfawyeen believed also that he\
    \ is not in a position to do something \nand many replied „he is also like the\
    \ inspector and the agriculturist....responsible for one \nor more Hawashas and\
    \ concentrate of course on his area of  interest “. \n                       \
    \                         \n274 The average in the other Blocks is 3-5 minors.\
    \ \n275 In some villages in the Arab areas' valves of the FOPs were stolen by\
    \ the tenants or the migrant-labors and \nused as oven for their bread ‘kissra’.\
    \ \n276 We have observed such a case in minor 6. Although the water was available\
    \ for 16 days during the survey, \none of the respondents could not irrigate whereas\
    \ the neighbors have irrigated twice. They destroyed his \ndam and stored the\
    \  water at the night. In minor 8 we have found 10 dams at the same time among\
    \ 5 \nHawashas. The breaking of such dames aggravates the problem of siltation.\
    \ \n277 Until the end of 1970s, the income of Khaffir or the policeman in Gendettu\
    \ was sometimes more than the \nincome of the small Tenant. He was therefore respected\
    \ and he was in a position to carry out his job. \nKhaffirs in Gendettu are not\
    \ sharecroppers like those in New Halfa but they are dependent on livestock \n\
    that is why they need the tenant to get fodder at no cost. The only one in Gndettu\
    \ who does his work \nperfectly (minor 5) is supported financially from his sons.\
    \ Consequently, it is hard to blame the Khaffir for \nkeeping his attention to\
    \ secure daily bread rather than water distribution.  \n \n204 \nTable 6.16 Tenants\

    \ \n- \nSource: Own Survey \n \nIn addition to the critical water supply situation\
    \ in the Scheme, the total effect of these \nalleged practices is, in the opinion\
    \ of IS authorities, a considerable wastage of water278. \nThat is why they have\
    \ responded positively to the decisions of November 1992 which \nextended their\
    \ service until the Abu XX. The decision which is highly accepted from all \n\
    agriculturists, means also transfer of administrative authority from the Khaffirs\
    \ to the \nIrrigation Service. The IS is, according to the decision, responsible\
    \ for controlling and \ndistributing water requirements -assessed by the agriculturists,\
    \ among the different Abu \nXXs. The control of water between and inside the Hawashas\
    \ remains nevertheless, as \nmany informants argued, without resolution. These\
    \ additional tasks would have staffing \nimplications for the IS, which would\
    \ need to be determined. Training and communication \nmeans are highly requested.\
    \ In this connection, it was recommended that a training \nprogram for Khaffirs\
    \ should be conducted by IS in close co-ordination with NHAC. The \ntraining should\
    \ be in line with the job description of the water guard and his place in the\
    \ \norganization. In addition, a post of head Khaffir ‘Samad’ should be created,\
    \ with the \nresponsibility of controlling Khaffirs along a minor canal (see Chapter\
    \ 6.1.1).279    The \nquestion that always raised throughout the survey and remained\
    \ without logical reply is; \nwhy do not the tenants themselves organize the water\
    \ distribution among the Field \nWater Course? The argument, which has been often\
    \ heard expressed in conversation with \nmembers of TFU was: “we pay to the NHAC\
    \ for this purpose and they have to take over \nthis task. This is their duty“!\
    \ It would be easy to conclude from the above that the schemes \nare in need of\
    \ water-users’ organization. \n \n 6.4.3  Water Distribution between the Tenants.\
    \ \n \nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to move our understanding of\
    \ water distribution \none stage further. Information about water distribution\
    \ between tenants were reinforced \nthrough an additional question. Tenants were\
    \ asked whether they have problems with their \nneighbors concerning water distribution.\
    \ The majority in both schemes (53% in New Halfa \nand 59% in Gendettu) reported\
    \ „No“.  This must not be understood as a criterion for \nimproved management\
    \ or low ‘social costs’. On the contrary, it appears instead that the \nfamily\
    \ connections in New Halfa is the reason for this reply280. It comes in the most\
    \ from \nArab villages where the „esprit de corps“ is still very strong, and from\
    \ village 26 \nHalfawyeen where there is no water problems and the supervision\
    \ of water from the \ntenants is very high. As we will see, the high dependence\
    \ of the Halfawyeen on the \nmigrant-labor or others to irrigate the fields (Chapter\
    \ 6.4.4) has cancelled the role of  \n                                       \
    \         \n278 Estimated as in excess of 12 per cent. \n279 The system was reported\
    \ as working well in Gezira, where the samad alone indents to the Block Inspector.\
    \ \n280 „If we were not relatives, then we might have every day an attempt of\
    \ murder“ reported the tenants in \nGereges. \n \n205 \nrelationship and solidarity\
    \ which they were famous for. At Gendettu the majority were not \nunduly concerned\
    \ because they anyway either rely on their pump sets or draw the water \ndirectly\
    \ from the main canal or simply because there is no water at all. Nonetheless,\
    \ the \nproblems of social costs in this scheme is more remarkable. Those who\
    \ were unhappy with \nthe relation to neighbors stated the arguments showed in\
    \ Table 6.17. It is very interesting \nto compare these reasons with those reported\
    \ by the staff (Table 6.13). In addition we \nnoticed that: \n \nTable 6.17 Reasons\
    \ of the Water Distribution Problems (Tenants) \nThe Reason \n% of the Reason\
    \ \n \n \nNew Halfa \nGendettu \nShortage and unreliability of \nWater \n42 \n\
    12 \nBad administration \n21 \n22 \nConflicts between tenants \n19 \n44 \nLack\
    \ of co-operation and  \nco-ordination \n17 \n22 \nSource: Own Survey  \n \n1\
    \ The high percentage of conflicts among those who have not secured source of\
    \ water in \nGendettu is may be due, to a big extent, to the fact that the neighbors\
    \ at the field are not \nthe same neighbors in the village.  \n \n2 The example\
    \ of the conflict and lack of co-operation among the Halfawyeen is village \n\
    13 and El Basawla area. The downstream area in village 13 is known as „the dead\
    \ \nline“. The reason of this name is: 1) many Hawashas there are not grown because\
    \ of \nthe water shortage, and 2) it is very rarely to see one of the tenants\
    \ at field, and those \nwho are interested in growing their Hawashas have, sometimes,\
    \ to protect their water at \nthe night by guns. In the same time, others in this\
    \ command area intercrop faba beans, \nlentil and karkade with other crops. In\
    \ the other example; El Basawala, although water \nwas available during the last\
    \ two years, there were many problems between tenants.  \n \n3 All decisions about\
    \ water management are made by the top, with no latitude for \ntenants. The adjustments\
    \ they do make are, therefore, not officially authorized. \nIncasing water efficiency,\
    \ an objective often discussed, does not harmonize with \ncultural heritage and\
    \ hence people’s wishes. The tenants complain there is no regularity \nin the\
    \ water level of the canals: „sometimes we need the water but we do not find it.\
    \ In \nother times water flow continuously and the canal is over flooding“. In\
    \ addition, they \nargued, there is no link between the end of the water courses\
    \ and minors or \ndrainage canals to receive the excess amounts of water. That\
    \ is why the Khaffirs and \nthe tenants drain the water in the fallow fields or\
    \ the roads, which result in damaging \nthe soil, destroying the roads and railways,\
    \ and increasing the cases of malaria and \nbilharzia as well as water losses.\
    \ The Halfawyeen have earlier experience with such \nsystem which was practiced\
    \ in old Halfa281. Their suggestion in this connection was \n                \
    \                                \n281 This system is also practiced by the farmers\
    \ in the neighbor country Egypt. The study of OAD (1994:10) \nin Balaqtar area\
    \ (Damanhur District) has found that because of the practices of the upstream\
    \ farmers, the \ntail escape of the Balaqtar canal is fully open and farmers have\
    \ breached the canal end to the drain to \nprevent it from flooding their lands.\
    \   \n \n206 \nrefused by the Scheme Administration. The argument was „this work\
    \ must be done by \nthe TFU“. The Engineers who accepted the idea said: „there\
    \ is no money“. \nThe questions of equity are complex and interlinked with the\
    \ patterns of wealth and power \nin irrigation communities (CHAMBERS 1980:37).282\
    \ Water is politics, the allocation and \nappropriation of which are tools in\
    \ the structure of power WALKER/CLEVERINGA \n1989:M.XI.3/2). Complaints about\
    \ pressure for irregularities in water allocation or \ndistribution, or about\
    \ intervention in the operations of the agency have been registered in \nmany\
    \ irrigation systems. UPHOFF(1991:99) in this context noticed: “something seldom\
    \ \nwritten but keenly perceived by irrigation managers as a variable is the extent\
    \ of \ninterference by politicians in management activities“.283 Power and influence\
    \ has been \nindirectly reported as a reason of water distribution’s problems\
    \ e.g., the areas outside the \nofficial scheme that receive gravity supplies\
    \ (Chapter 5.3.2). In addition, the change of the \ncropping pattern through the\
    \ permission of 1972 which allowed many tenants to grow \nfruits is responsible\
    \ for the confusion of the rotation system and water management \n(Chapter 5.3.3.3).\
    \ \n \nThe officials at Gendettu blamed, as well as in New Halfa, the tenants\
    \ do not respect the \nregulations, Khaffirs, and the agriculturists, in fact.\
    \ They are backed up with the absence of \neither law or specialized court to\
    \ punish those who infringe the rules, or local social \npunishment system for\
    \ the infringements or non-participation in collective work. \nSometimes, reported\
    \ many of the officials, we decide that the breaches have to pay \nsanction payments\
    \ (fines), but they avoid it by the help of the members of the TFU or the \nlocal\
    \ politicians284. \n \nTenants, on the other hand, have other ideas as to how\
    \ problems including dispute over \nwater could be resolved, besides strengthening\
    \ the punishment system (Table 6.18). \nHowever, the concern they always raise\
    \ is that their interests and suggestions are not \nappropriately represented\
    \ even after the rehabilitation. This is a genuine concern and is \nconsidered\
    \ to be the major reason for poor performance of the Schemes. Regarding the \n\
    previous replies, it is logical that these ideas concentrate on improving the\
    \ administration \nside of water management. A part from this fact, it is  of\
    \ great importance in this respect \nthat many, in both schemes, reported that\
    \ there is a need for samad from the tenants \nthemselves to control the water.\
    \ The TFU in Gendettu has planned to appoint eight samads \nfrom the tenants in\
    \ the Season 93/94 with salaries and rewards system. \n \n                   \
    \                             \n282 In general, social power is the ability of\
    \ an individual or group to alter the conduct of others using the \nthreat of\
    \ sanctions to attain compliance and submission (LAYTON ET AL. 1994:292).  \n\
    283 Political interference may be used, he argues, to benefit certain privileged\
    \ groups or elected \nrepresentatives may be looking after the legitimate needs\
    \ of constituents who were ignored or victimized \nby the bureaucracy. It can\
    \ be, possibly, responding to unsanctioned payments extracted from water users\
    \ \nfor irrigation services (commonly referred to as corruption) UPHOFF 1991:100).\
    \  \n284 Investigations have revealed that, in certain settlements in ISRAEL,\
    \ in defiance of the control and \nadvanced technology, up to 70% of the water\
    \ used is unaccounted for (stolen) by tampering with outlets \nand meters. Sanctions\
    \ were difficult to enforce in this situation because of the political implications.\
    \ Those \ncommunities most likely to steal and mismanage water were the least\
    \ prosperous, who were also likely to \ncharge the authorities with discrimination,\
    \ particularly ethnic discrimination, if threatened with reprisals. \nThe authorities\
    \ understandably prefer to avoid such confrontations (LEES 1986:613-4).   \n \n\

    \ \nNo doubt that cultural differences and different developmental experiences\
    \ profoundly \ninfluence attitudes toward different forms of arbitration 285.\
    \ In our cases we did not find a \nspecific person; a government servant or a\
    \ local person, who perform this function. \nHowever, mention has been made of\
    \ the role played in this context by the traditional tribal \norganization in\
    \ the nomads area in New Halfa. We should  also note that, as it is known in \n\
    Africa, the old men in the families and the religious leaders have a considerable\
    \ role286. \nThe study reveals that 40 per cent of the sample in New Halfa discuss\
    \ the irrigation and \nagricultural problems with the other tenants in the village’s\
    \ mosque. Twenty-two per cent \nreported weddings or death occasions as places\
    \ where most tenants, particularly the \ninfluential, meet with each other. Village’s\
    \ club is also one of these places (10 %). \n                                \
    \                \n285 On the basis of comparison of fifteen irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines, ONGKINGEO (1973) has \nwritten, „It is striking to note\
    \ the satisfaction of farmers when somebody in authority, like a policeman or\
    \ \nmajor, attends to water distribution problems. Under these circumstances,\
    \ farmer even seen to be satisfied \nwith reduced water supplies“ (CHAMBERS 1980:39).\
    \ In Sri Lanka, the arbitrator is often a government \nservant. TANG/OSTROM (1993:19)\
    \ refer to the study of FERNEA (1970) In El Mujarilin in Irak, and \nreported,\
    \ „an official representing the Ministry of the Interior is responsible for hearing\
    \ complaints \nbetween irrigators. However, unless the dispute involves a clear\
    \ infraction of the civil code, the official \nroutinely refers the case back\
    \ to the leader of the local tribe or other tribesman whom the petitioners \n\
    might choose. This practice allows the traditional tribal organization to remain\
    \ a viable instrument for \nresolving conflicts among irrigators“. SHAH (1991),\
    \ on the other hand, revealed the active role of the \nelite in Pakistan in this\
    \ context. \n286  If the community accepts only the authority of religious or\
    \ tribal leaders, then, as WEITZ (1986:167) \npointed out, these leaders should\
    \ be consulted and asked to endorse the development of their villages. For \n\
    example, in the development projects in the Zambian copperbelt, the intervention\
    \ of a tribal leader was \nsolicited by the planners, and it later proved indispensable\
    \ to the success of their development program. \nThe author stressed also the\
    \ substantial role of the authority of local leadership in the development in\
    \ \nIsrael. \n \n208 \n6.4.4  Who takes over the task of irrigation? \n \nTo put\
    \ the question another way,, who irrigate the field; the tenant himself (or one\
    \ of the \nhousehold/family) or wage labor, hired on a daily or a seasonal basis?287\
    \ This is another \nquestion in regard to water distribution between tenants which\
    \ needs more attention, if one \nhas to have a comprehensive views of the subject\
    \ matter288. Traditional agriculture requires \nlabor to be applied flexibly.\
    \ There is uncertainty in labor requirements. It is also on \noccasion a problem\
    \ for an employer to verify the number of tasks a worker accomplishes. \nSupervision\
    \ of labor is crucial, and it involves time and resources (Transaction costs).\
    \ \n \nA daily paid labor, as BINSWANGER/ROSENZWEIG (1986:507,519) argued, has\
    \ no \nincentive to work hard, unless supervised closely via direct observation\
    \ of his effort or via \ninspection of his output. They add, „Whenever a worker\
    \ is not the sole residual claimant of \nfarm profits there is an incentive problem\
    \ relating to worker effort. Minimizing or \ncircumventing this problem requires\
    \ resources“. The resources that meant here are the \nsupervision costs. Since\
    \ household labor is easier to supervise than hired labor, tenancy \ninvolves\
    \ a contract to hire not merely the labor of the tenant, but also the supervised\
    \ labor \nof the tenant’s family. Therein, as DASGUPTA (1993:229) argues, lies\
    \ the subtlety of the \ntenancy; as an important agricultural institution. \n\
    \ \nIn fact, the dependence on hired labors in the Halfawyeen area is more than\
    \ this shown in \nTable 6.19. We believe that most Halfawyeen reacting to this\
    \ question were referring to \nthe pre-watering of wheat and not the three crops.\
    \ In addition, the reply „I do irrigate \nmyself“ refers mostly to the first two\
    \ watering. The quantitative data supplied by the \nNHIRP  \n \nTable 6.19 Distribution\
    \ of Irrigation Task among Tenants  \nand hired Labors: Percent of Tenants in\

    \ details on systems of labor organization, see KUHNEN 1982:9-12. \n288 Though\
    \ the family farm is the dominant form of agricultural organization, it has been\
    \ argued that the \ndiscussions of agricultural organization in economics have\
    \ focused almost exclusively on other issues. The \nprincipal focus has been on\
    \ sharecropping, and while incentive and monitoring issues are sometimes \nmentioned\
    \ (along with risk aversion and imperfections in capital and other markets) family\
    \ aspects of \nagricultural organization are ignored. The transaction cost approach\
    \ draws attention to the distinction \nbetween family and non-family labor and\
    \ it suggests that their behavior might differ systematically. The \ntransaction\
    \ cost approach generates interesting empirical research projects in this field\
    \ because it helps to \nanalyze the degree to which family and non-family labor\
    \ are imperfect substitutes in various types of \nagricultural production and\
    \ it helps to sort out the roles of incentives and asymmetric information. For\
    \ a \ndiscussion of the transaction cost approach to families and households see\
    \ POLLAK (1985). \n \n209 \nsubstantiates this view (Table 6.20). The crop for\
    \ which the tenant employs migrant labor \nmostly is cotton, followed by groundnuts.\
    \ Sharecropping is fairly common in the latter. \nTenants provide only land and\
    \ seeds; sharecropper provides labor and supervision from \nsowing until harvest.\
    \ Generally speaking, the Halfawyeen involvement in agricultural \noperations,\
    \ with regard to the three crops varies from one family to the other. In the \n\
    majority of cases studied, the contribution of the tenant is limited to supervision.\
    \ His actual \nlabor input in the tenancy as a worker undertaking operations by\
    \ his own hands is very \nnegligible. He might work in two minor operations: light\
    \ weeding and irrigation289. And \nthis is the meaning of absenteeism referred\
    \  to by the staff. \n \nThe same applies to the other members of the family290.\
    \ Of the latter, those contributing \nmost are sons at young age, being enrolled\
    \ in schools or not (Table 6.21). The tenant \nforwarded one condition with regard\
    \ to their participation, the farm work should not detain \nthem from schools.\
    \ Their effective contribution is then expected only when schools are \nclosed,\
    \ or after school hours. Although the support from the member of the whole family\
    \ is \nsmaller here, comparing with the Nomads area, it was very interesting to\
    \ find in village 26 \na very co-operative system called EL NAFEER where all the\
    \ neighbors help in different \noperations. This system, together with the fact\
    \ that only in this village - and village 33 - the \nparticipation of women is\
    \ relative high, can be ground for the high performance in this \nvillage. \n\

    \ Table 6.19, the role of the Nomads in farm operations is seen rather \nas a\
    \ participation in production and not full involvement. The involvement of family\
    \ \nmembers is limited to the head of the household; as a tenant supervising production,\
    \ \ncarrying some of the irrigation operation, and in some areas doing part of\
    \ the weeding. \nThis means, his reply here is weighted with Sorghum’s operations.\
    \ NHIRP (NHAC \n1986:ANNEX4:39) has found that the nomads participation is more\
    \ narrow than that of \nthe Halfawyeen, since at least for the last two years\
    \ of the study only two crops are \nproduced in their area. Even for those two\
    \ crops, labor availability from the family for \nfarm operations is very much\
    \ determined by three factors: \n \n1- the level of the economic prosperity of\
    \ the family. Poor families are observed to \ncontribute more, undertaking most\
    \ of the farm operations by their own hands; \n2- the size of the family, since\
    \ large families have more hands that can be involved in farm \noperations; and\
    \ finally \n3- the livestock wealth owned by the family, i.e. families with large\
    \ herds give more \npriority to their animals as compared to the tenancy, especially\
    \ if the number of male \nmembers in the family is limited.     \n \nThe nomads\
    \ employ migrant labor for wheat production, groundnuts and cotton which \nsurpass\
    \ the former two. Of all operations in which migrant labor is employed, weeding\
    \ is \nthe leading one, followed by harvesting and picking. Because of the rainfall,\
    \ weeding \npractices in New Halfa Scheme is more than those in Gezira. Recent\
    \ study in Gezira \n(FAKI, SALIH and KHODARY 1989:276), has registered that most\
    \ farmers weeded \ncotton and groundnuts twice while sorghum received two weedings\
    \ by a little more than \nhalf of the farmers. Moreover, groundnuts was weeded\
    \ for a third time in 45% of the cases. \nIn New Halfa, the number of weedings\
    \ by crops are represented in Table 6.22. \n \nTable 6.22 Number of Weeding by\

    \ member contributing in the family has to be met by six from outside the family\
    \ \n(NHAC 1986: ANNEX 4:32 and 44). As the ratio of hired to family labor increases,\
    \ the \nprice of a unit of effective labor thus increases as well. \n \nSixty-four\
    \ per cent of the total respondents reported that they receive help from the \n\
    member of the family. But this is not enough because of the above mentioned reasons\
    \ and \nthe relatively large tenancy as well. Table 6.23 gives the family labor\

    \ on the daily paid labor is high (Table \n6.19). But, the supervision at the\
    \ field is also high. The cases who depend totally on the \nhired labor were in\
    \ El Figaga (8 % of the sample) and Gendettu (8 % of the sample), where \nthere\
    \ is no water shortage. Generally, the tenants are trying to minimize the employing\
    \ of \nhired labor because of the high cost291. Therefore, the majority (85 %)\
    \ reported the \ninvolvement of family labor in farm operation with dominant participation\
    \ from the sons. \nAs we have already observed in New Halfa, the division of labor\
    \ within the family is \naffected by cultural factors, e.g. attitudes towards\
    \ women. The participation of the latter is \nhardly seen. They are expected to\
    \ be industrious, but surely not in the irrigation operation. \nOne can say that\
    \ the irrigation task in both schemes seems to be a male task. Table \n6.24 gives\
    \ the number of man-days of labor required in all operations for each crop. It\
    \ is \napparent from the table that orchard, alfalfa, and onion constitute most\
    \ of these \nrequirements. \n                                                \n\
    291 For example, hand weeding, which absorb high percentage of the labor requirement\
    \ (Table 6.21), is \nundertaken on all farms, though often not by the farmer or\
    \ his family. To reduce the labor input, farmers \nallow nomads to weed their\
    \ fields, for which they receive no wages but keep the weed growth, mainly \n\
    nutgrass, as fodder. While this arrangement has mutual advantages, it can result\
    \ in weeding being delayed \nto increase the volume of weed growth, thus adversely\
    \ affecting crop growth (NRIRP 1986:A1/2-15).  \n \n212 \nTable 6.24 Labor Requirement\

    \ unit of land than rainfed \nagriculture. To assess the labor situation in the\
    \ schemes, tenants were asked weather they \nhave difficulties getting labors.\
    \ The answers registered here are to a big extent similar to \nthose previously\
    \ registered by NHIRP,293 these are: \n \n \nYes \n \nNo \nTo some Extent \nHalfawyeen\

    \ to the question why they find it difficult to get labor, the following answers\
    \ were \ngiven: \n− Rise in labor costs (both schemes). The cost of cotton picking;294\
    \ the common \nexample, has increased four-fold, and those of watering have increased\
    \ three-fold \nin this season. The operations cost of onion in Gendettu is also\
    \ extremely increased. \n \n                                                \n\
    292 In New Halfa, only cotton is harvested by hand \n293 The distribution of the\
    \ reply was: 1- in the Halfawyeens’ area: 64 % (Yes) and 36 % (No); 2- in the\
    \ \nNomads’ area: 77 % (Yes) and  23 % (No).   \n294 It is often said that farmers\
    \ will neglect their cotton, even to the extent of delaying picking or, in the\
    \ \nextreme case, leaving their cotton unpicked, rather than neglect the food\
    \ crops. This situation is almost \ncertainly exacerbated by a shortage of labor\
    \ at the critical time and frequently rises in labor wages. \n \n213 \n− overlapping\
    \ of operations of groundnuts and cotton (by the Nomads) or groundnuts \nand wheat\
    \ (by the Halfawyeen). Generally, cotton is the crop which is more \ninfluenced\
    \ by this problem295followed by groundnuts.  \n− Competition for labor with mechanized\
    \ agricultural schemes in El Gadaref (New \nHalfa); \n− The return of the Eritrean\
    \ refugees to their land (New Halfa). \n− This problem is more critical in autumn\
    \ and winter because the migrant labor return \nto their region (West Sudan) to\
    \ plant and harvest rain sorghum.  \n \n6.4.5  Availability of Water and Productivity\
    \ \n \nThe question of equity are linked with questions of productivity. In addition,\
    \ it is difficult \nto establish accurately the effect of adequate or inadequate\
    \ water availability on the yield \nof a crop as a separate factor of its production.\
    \ However, some specific measures have \nbeen used for assessing equity of water\
    \ distribution, examining differentials in production \nor in productivity: (a)\
    \ between upstream and downstream areas, (b) between head-end and \ntail fields\
    \ served by a common canals, (c) among sub-systems within a command area. \nThough\
    \ the shadow of doubt concerning the reliability of the production’s data collected\
    \ in \nthis survey (Chapter 5.4.3), and the fact that the other inputs could be\
    \ in many cases the \nmost determinant factors, we will try to examine the effect\
    \ of the location of the command \narea and the farm on the productivity296. Anyhow,\
    \ despite the difficulties of this attempt, \nthe close relationship between the\
    \ location and the net income of the farm is more to be \nobserved at Gendettu.\
    \ The manager of the scheme mentioned, the locations of farms along \nthe canal\
    \ is the determinant factor for the economic return. \n \nThe starting point is\
    \ the fact - emphasized in different places in this chapter - that most of \n\
    the tenants in both Schemes are affected by water problems. They were additionally\
    \ asked \nif they do receive sufficient water in the right time? Their reply substantiates\
    \ again this \npicture: \nResponse \n% Response of Farmers \n \n \nNew Halfa \n\

    \ water availability in time perspective, the answers given by respondents reflect\
    \ \nthat water has become scarce during the 1980s, as could be depicted from the\
    \ following \nfigures in reply to the question: „Since when has water become problematic?“\

    \                                 \n295 As an example for the moral hazard that\
    \ face the tenant in agricultural production, one of the tenants in El \nBasawala,\
    \ who grow large areas of wheat reported that, because of the labor shortage,\
    \ he had to hire \nprisoners in the season 91/92.  \n296 Recent study (ISHAG/ELOBEID\
    \ 1989:241) has used Cobb-Douglas function to relate the output of each \ncrop\
    \ to the set of inputs land, labor and water in different farm locations in Gezira.\
    \ Concerning the effect \non the average net income per farm, the study has found\
    \ that farmers at the head end of the canal obtained \nthe largest net income\
    \ followed by the farm at the middle, tail end respectively. Similarly findings\
    \ have \nbeen reported from the study of FAKI (1981:356) in Gezira. He has found\
    \ that beside climate, the location \nof farms along tertiary canals influence\
    \ yields and farm-family incomes. \n297 Although they did not define accurate\
    \ time, the impression given through the discussions tempts us to say \nthat they\
    \ mean the beginning of eighty. \n \n214 \n− Since the beginning of drought (1984):\
    \ 23 % \n− Since 1989: 19 % \nGendettu: reply has distributed among 1983 (62 %),\
    \ about ten years back (24 %), and the \nbeginning of eighty (14 %). After these\
    \ dates, mostly all the tenants in the survey areas \nhave dug wells to keep their\
    \ plants. \n \nMost of the tenants in villages 6, and 7 Arabs  produce only two\
    \ crops since ten years \nbecause of the water shortage. The area at the end of\
    \ Gendettu Scheme; minors 4,5,6,7, and \n8, was totally isolated during the period\
    \ 1985-90. Only after cleaning the main canal and \nrenovating the pumps in the\
    \ season 91/92  that they have got, with the exception of minor \n5, approximately\
    \ 50 % of their needs. The average yield should be looked at as a good \nmeasure\
    \ for the success of an irrigation system (Table 25). The sample is distributed\
    \ \naccording to the location of the field water courses (Abu XXs) that serve\
    \ the villages on \nthe minors; head, middle, and tail (see the technical section\
    \ 5.4.2). There was in many \ncases substantial difference in the yield within\
    \ the same village according to the location of \nthe field on the water course.\

    \ NHAC \n \n \n \n215 \n \n− Generally, the average yield in the season 91/92\
    \ is higher than 90/91.  \n− It is clear that the Halfawyeen are not interested\
    \ in cultivating cotton. Only those at the \nhead end are willing to grow it,\
    \ with the exception of two cases from village 11. \nAnyway the performance of\
    \ the village 26 and Basawla is taken as model in the \nScheme. The productivity\
    \ of cotton is still lower than in Gezira and Rahad. It is \nproposed that, with\
    \ proper water control, medium- and long-stable cotton should \nachieve 6 kantar/feddan\
    \ to 7 kantar/feddan (the former can achieve 18 kantar/feddan \nunder optimum\
    \ conditions). The total cotton cultivated area in the Scheme has \ndecreased\
    \ from 108 025 fed. in 1971/72 to 57 735 fed. in 1981/82 and reached 41 055 \n\
    fed. in 1991/92.  \n− Wheat, the traditionally stable food for the Halfawyeen,\
    \ has witnessed similar trend. \nCauses of the low productivity of this crop are\
    \ the increasing of the costs of production \nand the financing bottlenecks. The\
    \ Agricultural Research Corporation (ARC) indicates \nthat tests have shown that\
    \ yield could reach 2 500 kg/feddan (about 6 t/ha) and field \ntrails have produced\
    \ yields of 1 700 kg/feddan (4 t/ha) with a full package of inputs, \nincluding\
    \ full irrigation. The current low yields are, they view, attributed almost entirely\
    \ \nto water deficiencies (Ministry of Irrigation 1992:G-11). Ministry of Irrigation\
    \ come \nconsequently to the assumption that yields of 1 000 kg/feddan (2.3 t/ha)\
    \ could be \nconsidered normal. Furthermore, the area has  decreased from 84 000\
    \ fed. in 90/91 to 63 \n553 fed in 91/92 and reached 57 000 fed. in 92/93 (in\
    \ addition to 3 000 fed. cultivated \nby the co-operative sector).298 \n− The\
    \ effect of water stress on the wheat growth and its yield depends critically\
    \ on crop \nspecies as well as the magnitude and time of water deficit. However,\
    \ it should be stated \nthat most farmers were reluctant to give their actual\
    \ production figures for wheat yield. \nSuch trend has been also registered in\
    \ Gezira (HAMAD 1989:118). They would like to \nkeep some of it for themselves\
    \ than to hand it over to the government officials under the \nsalam system (chapter\
    \ 5.6.3). That is why the difference in productivity can be hardly \nseen. For\
    \ example, the Basawla; the most famous farmers in the Sudan concerning \nwheat\
    \ production, where productivity of 1.5 t/fed. is normal, gave figures lower than\
    \ the \ntenants at the tail end299. \n− Although the tenants of nomadic origin\
    \ were also cautious about the figures of their \nstaple food crop i.e. sorghum\
    \ (most replies are under the average yield of the Scheme), \none can speak here\
    \ about direct relation between the location and yield. The case of \nsidira was\
    \ not an exception but, on the contrary, indicates the difference in productivity\
    \ \nbetween upstream and downstream. Sidira is the tail end of the Block Alledaj\
    \ where all \nvillages are at the beginning of the minors. Whereas, Arab 5 belongs\
    \ to a Block (Abu \nNagma) where water shortage is generally substantial and suffer\
    \ at the same time from \nthe problem of unleveled fields. The reason for the\
    \ low productivity of dura (sorghum) \nas the tenants argued was the bad quality\
    \ of the seeds recommended from the Scheme. \n                               \
    \                 \n298 The manager of the New Halfa Agricultural Research Center\
    \ reported that in the season 92/93 many \ntenants were not able to purchase three\
    \ sacks seeds to grow wheat because of the unavailability of finance. \nThat is\
    \ why the NHAPC give the rest of wheat area (3000 feddan), for the first time,\
    \ to the New Halfa \ncooperative Union’s Flour Mill. \n299 A more recent study\
    \ which examines the aggregate behavior of farmers in Sudan in response to \n\
    government wheat policies, is SALIH (1993). The study shows that the farmers,\
    \ as a consequence of the \ncompulsory procurement of a fraction of their produce,\
    \ underreport wheat production. The analysis \nindicates that wheat production\
    \ is also responsive to changes in the government policy. A 1 per cent \nincrease\
    \ in the delivery requirement depresses wheat production by more than a full percentage\
    \ point.  \n \n216 \nFor comparison, the average yield in Rahad Scheme, at the\
    \ beginning of the decade, \nwas 1 000 kg/feddan. \n− Despite the remarkable fluctuations\
    \ in yields, groundnuts stay the most profitable crop \nin the scheme. This result\
    \ tie well with the data and analysis stated before (Tables 6.11-\n14). The other\
    \ reason, beside profitability, might be the activity of the sharecroppers \n\
    (mainly the migrant labors), specially within the Halfawyeen areas. \n− Disparities\
    \ in productivity within fields sharing water course have been also registered\
    \ \nspecially in the areas of water shortage. Examples of the difference between\
    \ head \nend/tail end fields on the water course come from villages 13 and 24\
    \ Halfawyeen and \nvillages Arab 6 and Sidira in the Arabs area. These differences\

    Source: Own Survey    \n \nAt Gendettu, Table 6.27 shows the difference in yields\
    \ for the major crops between \ndownstream areas( minors 4, 5, 6), and upstream\
    \ area; Gender, as well as reveals the wide \ndisparity between the performance\
    \ of the Scheme and a small private Scheme on the Nile \nas an example of the\
    \ type of irrigation management in the area. Ibriqu is a farmer who uses \nhis\
    \ own pump set (4 inches)300 to irrigate his own land (6 feddan) and other three\
    \ feddan \nbelongs to three farmers; one for each. At the beginning of the season,\
    \ the four participants \nstore the whole requirements of fuel and oil. Water\
    \ is distributed through main channel and \n5-6 lateral water courses; each is\
    \ able to serve two participants. An operator is responsible \nfor the management\
    \ of the pump set as well as water distribution between the farmers. \nEverybody\
    \ knows the date of his turn and there is no problem in relation to water \ndistribution.\

    \ irrigate 19 feddan per rotation. Participation with other farmers \nwill therefore\
    \ reduce the operation costs; fuel; oil, and operators. \n \n217 \nProductivity\
    \ in gendettu section301, in particular onion, was higher than the downstream\
    \ \nsections. The reason for the low productivity of onion in the season 91/92,\
    \ as the tenants \nreported, was the breakdown of the pumps. The breakdown was\
    \ decided by the scheme \nmanagement as a punishment for the tenants because they\
    \ did not pay the water fees of the \nprevious season. However, the productivity\
    \ in the private scheme, which reach to 2 tonne \nper feddan shows the importance\
    \ of the stability and reliability of irrigation water.  \n \n6.5  Communication\
    \ Systems \n \nTo emphasize this point a quote by STIGLITZ (1989:27) is appropriate:\
    \ „..models focusing \non fully informed rational peasants working within ‘rational’\
    \ and efficient institutions are \nlikely to be not only inadequate, but seriously\
    \ misleading, just as models that simply \nhypothesize that peasants are rule\
    \ (tradition)-bound, irrational, and noneconomic are \nalmost certainly misleading“.\
    \ „Peasants are rational, but they are not fully informed. And \nimperfect information\
    \ (as well as a variety of transaction costs), besides limiting the \neffective\
    \ degree of competition, creates institutional rigidities, allowing the persistence\
    \ of \nseemingly inefficient institutions“. \n \n6.5.1  The Relationship between\
    \ Tenants and Project’s Management \n \nFor whom work the irrigation bureaucracies\
    \ in the developing countries? Are there \nreflections of the interests of the\
    \ central elites oriented towards the urban areas? (MANIG \n1989:23), or dependent\
    \ organizations work for the interests of the international market? \n(TETZLAFF\
    \ 1979:356). For many decades, it has been firmly believed that the underlying\
    \ \nconditions of poverty and unemployment can be remedied only through the balanced\
    \ \noperation of private initiative and government intervention (WEITZ 1986, SINGH\
    \ 1986). \nAn „optimal mix“ of these two driving forces is critical to successful\
    \ economic growth. \nEfforts have been made in most countries to establish a different\
    \ relationship between the \nbureaucracy and the public, e.g. designating the\
    \ civil services as the ‘public Service’. \nHowever, recriminations, especially\
    \ in ex-colonial countries, have been heared that the \nbureaucrats are not civil\
    \ servants but civil masters (UPHOFF 1991). To the extent that \nthere is a pervasive\
    \ tradition of civil service autonomy in a country, government irrigation \nagencies\
    \ will be more aloof and powerful vis-à-vis water users. \n \nMAKADHO (1994:38)\
    \ argues that, what is common in many African countries is that \nfarmers are\
    \ not given the chance to make management decisions in ‘their’ irrigation \nSchemes.\
    \ He further points out that the management style in use makes it difficult for\
    \ \nfarmer to have say in the day to day activities of their schemes. Another\
    \ study of  FAO \n(Ng’ Ong’ Ola 1993) refers to a similar findings from the work\
    \ of Kagubila (1992) in \nTanzania: „Irrigation schemes are employment ‘Offices’\
    \ for government irrigation \ntechnicians and agricultural field officers“. THORNTON/WYAN\
    \ (1987:230) found also \nthat Sudan is not exception to this rule. They pointed\
    \ out: „perhaps the greatest weakness \nin the development of this agriculture\
    \ (New Halfa) has been the failure to recognize the \ncrucial role of the individual\
    \ farmer. Their individual attitudes, aspirations, training, etc.“ \nThe information\
    \ furnished by the survey and analyzed below reveals the dichotomy of the \noperational\
    \ objectives of the Schemes’ authorities and the private beneficiaries. \n   \
    \                                             \n301 This is one section in the\
    \ scheme and has the same name (see the sample distribution of Gendettu Scheme\
    \ \nin Chapter 5.  \n \n218 \n6.5.1.1  Production Relationship and the ‘Government\
    \ Crop’. \n \nThe failure of NHAPC and/or the government to deliver physical inputs;\
    \ finance and \nservices, has meant that what was conceived of as a mutually-beneficial\
    \ partnership in \ncotton has deteriorated to a state of confrontation between\
    \ tenants and corporation over \nthe ‘government crop’. Partnership has been replaced,\
    \ as the rehabilitation study pointed \nout, by alienation and hostility on the\
    \ part of the tenant, and demoralization on the part \nof a significant number\
    \ of corporation personnel (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 7:7). As we have \nalready noted in\
    \ the last chapters, tenants are accused of absenteeism, laziness and \nmalfeasance;\
    \ schemes staff of dishonest, diversion of public resources to private ends, \n\
    and of a destructively authoritarian attitude towards the tenants. The rhetoric\
    \ of partners \nhas become, concluded the rehabilitation study, the reality of\
    \ adversaries, and the \nlanguage of sanctions replaced that of incentives. \n\
    \ \nWhat is new in this study is the prove that this reality, that has formed\
    \ the context in which \nmanagement institutions had been functioning during the\
    \ initiative of rehabilitation of the \nSchemes, is still dominant, despite the\
    \ rehabilitation and the changing of production \nrelationship. The first action\
    \ (rehabilitation) is not in a position to induce effective \ninstitutional change.\
    \ And the later, which is a consequence of the rehabilitation, was not \nenough\
    \ by itself to solve these problems. This result has been observed in many cases\
    \ \n(MOROOKA/HAYAMI 1989, PLACE/HAZELL 1993).302 The most important factor is\
    \ \nnot the type of contract but the attitude of tenant towards the crop; the\
    \ profitability that can \nbe gained from and, above all, the institutional context\
    \ in which it grow. Anyway, the \nessence of the problem is to identify those\
    \ factors that are: \n \n− the failure of the Scheme administration to undertake\
    \ their tasks; \n− the absence of participation whether inside the bureaucracy\
    \ or the Scheme; \n− the ambiguity of the purpose of the organization; whether\
    \ it is conceived of as \npurely a production enterprise or as the leading partner\
    \ in a resettlement Scheme; \n− the ambiguity of the nature of „Hawasha“. The\
    \ absence of enforceable contract \ndefining adequately and precisely the Corporation’s\
    \ and the tenant’s \nresponsibilities. Specific to New Halfa is the fact that\
    \ ‘tenancy rights’ in the \nScheme were granted as compensation for exporiated\
    \ land-use/ownership rights303. \n− No payment is received at the time of delivery\
    \ of the tenant’s cotton production, \nnor does he receive accrued interest on\
    \ its value for the (sometimes) several years \nduring which that value remains\
    \ unpaid.    \n \nEvidently, if our informants were correct, the relation between\
    \ tenant and the Corporation \nwas not in any time a partnership but, as accurately\
    \ described, a paternalist-dependent, or \npatron-client. \n \n              \
    \                                  \n302 In addition to the result registered\
    \ by  SALEEM (1989:40) in Gezira and Rahad (Chapter 5.3.4), the study \nof MOROOKA\
    \ and HAYAMI in Upland Java results in: „no significance inefficiency in resource\
    \ \nallocation was found to be associated with share tenancy as compared with\
    \ owner cultivation and fixed-\nrent tenancy“. Similarly, based on household survey\
    \ data from Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with few \nexceptions, land rights were\
    \ not found to be a significant factor in determining whether or not farmers \n\
    made land-improving investment or used yield-enhancing inputs (PLACE/HAZELL 1993:16-9).\
    \  \n303 The issue of compensation for the two groups is discussed in NHAC 1986:ANNEX\
    \ 7 and 8.  \n \n219 \n6.5.1.2  Farmers’ Views on the Formal Channels of Articulation\
    \  \n \nHere emerge again the word ‘absenteeism’. In an attempt to trace the question\
    \ of contact \nbetween tenants and field staff, only 4 % of the respondents in\
    \ New Halfa reported seeing \nthe agriculturist or the Block Inspector regularly.\
    \ The others reported: \n \n- I did not saw him \n \n \n \n \n29 % \n- I saw him\
    \  \n \n \n \n \n \n25 % \n- only one visit at the beginning of the season \n\
    19 %  \n- I don’t remember \n \n \n \n \n11 % \n- the last season \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n12 % \n \nTenants who ‘saw’ the inspector followed their replies by comment:\
    \ „only when we go to \nhim in his office“. And those who saw him at the field\
    \ confirmed: „only in the cotton’s \nfield“. One of the key tenants (Halfawyeen)\
    \ who manage 13 tenancies, and work at the \nsame time in NHAPC,304 reported:\
    \ „in the sixties and seventies the inspector was seen \nalways at the field whereas\
    \ the tenant was absent, it is exactly the reverse now“305. \nSimilarly at Gendettu,\
    \ 56 % of the respondents do not see the agriculturist at the field, 27 \n% reported\
    \ rarely, whereas 27 % see him regularly. As in New Halfa, the last category \n\
    maintained: „in his office“. \n \nTenant was asked: how many times did you talk\
    \ to the extensionists during this season \nabout farming problems?, and to what\
    \ extent do you feel that the extension officers have \nhelped to solve your problems\
    \ within non-cotton crops in the last years? The reply of many \nwas „smile“.\
    \ In New Halfa 69 % of the respondents reported that they are not visited at all.\
    \ \nThe only connection with the Corporation, reported many of them, is a daily\
    \ 10 minutes \nTV program. The others who are visited represent 31 %. This figure\
    \ is, in our opinion, \noverestimated. \n \nNew Halfa Scheme has 29 extensionist.\
    \ Theoretically, they are distributed among Blocks; \none for each (Fig. 5.7).\
    \ Every extensionist is responsible for 1200 tenants grouped in four \nequal groups306.\
    \ Four days of the week are allotted for regular and scheduled field visits to\
    \ \neach area and farmers group. The other two days are devoted to on farm trials.\
    \ The \ncontacted farmers are approximately 5 % of the tenants as estimated by\
    \ the manager of the \nagricultural extension department. In addition to the farm\
    \ visits, he has to organize a \ngeneral meeting in every village (in the evenings)\
    \ to transmit extension messages and \ndiscuss the problems, as well as participating\
    \ in the Block Agricultural Committee. The \ntype of farmers in the Scheme needs\
    \ an intensive extension work than in any other large \nscheme in Sudan. Thereby,\
    \ these tasks must be fully and accurately implemented. \n \nIn the reality, the\
    \ extensionests, just like the horticultural and plant protection inspectors,\
    \ \nare not in contact with the farmers in the farm, but works in the central\
    \ department in New \nHalfa. The reasons for this situation, according to the\
    \ manager of the department, are: \n \n                                      \
    \          \n304 The manager assistant of the Plant Protection Department. \n\
    305 For a succinct historical review of the work behavior of the field staff in\
    \ the Sudanese large irrigation \nschemes, see BARNETT (1977), Chapter 9. \n306\
    \ The 1200 tenants are approximately distributed among 5-6 villages. \n \n220\
    \ \n− \nThe Corporation is not in a position to ‘finance’ agricultural inspector\
    \ and field \ninspector (extensionist) in each Block. That is why the agricultural\
    \ inspector takes \nover both the managerial and the extension tasks and often\
    \ the agriculturists prefer the \nformer (inputs and loan distribution, harvesting,\
    \ etc.). \n \n− \nThe main problem facing extension programs is lack of mobility.\
    \ All vehicles \nprovided by the World Bank (6) for the T&V program have been\
    \ taken and used by \nthe Scheme’s Administration (for non-extension purposes)\
    \ and  often by the \npoliticians in the region. \n \n− \nThe importance of this\
    \ department is not recognized from the Management of the \nScheme. \n \n− \n\
    Field extensionists training is not adequate. Instead of every two weeks, according\
    \ to \nthe T&V program,307 training is every month. In addition, there is no agricultural\
    \ \nextension divisions in the Sudanese Agriculture Faculties, and the national\
    \ extension \ndivision in the central ministry is not qualified to take over training\
    \ tasks. \n \n− \nThere is no co-ordination with the other departments in the\
    \ Scheme in addition to \nweak linkage with the research center.  \n \nWithin\
    \ the framework of the planned Agricultural Research Extension and Training \n\
    Project (ARETP)308, IDA has recommended some modification to convert the extension\
    \ \nsystem to T&V approach. These modification deals with the following positions:\
    \ \n1. Assistant Block Inspector to be assigned full responsibility to deal with\
    \ all managerial \nmatter concerning inputs and loan distribution with the assistance\
    \ and help of \nproduction committees. \n2. Field Inspectors to reform their field\
    \ visits to be educational rather than inspectorial. \n3. Agricultural Manager,\
    \ Field Manager, Section Manager and Block Inspector to pay \nregular visits to\
    \ the field for supervising this educational approach. \n4. Extension Department\
    \ to lead a regular training for field inspectors on technical \nagricultural\
    \ matters and extension methods. \n5. A strong linkage with research to be created\
    \ through monthly workshops, on farm trials \nand a joint technical committee\
    \ field oriented visits. \n                                                \n\
    307 It is a management tool which helps to ensure the extension operations effectively\
    \ and also enable the \nmanagement to take corrective measure on the shortfalls\
    \ in the extension approach. The T & V system of \nextension has been introduced\
    \ in the New Halfa Scheme in 1986, with a view to transforming the \ntechnology\
    \ of improved cultivation to farmers and improving their productivity. This system\
    \ which has \nincluded changes in job discretion was not welcomed by NHAC. Resistance\
    \ for such approach continued \nfor 6 succession seasons until 91/92. It was not\
    \ confined for the system and its approach but extended to \nenforcement in using\
    \ the existing and the new project extension facilities in non extension and even\
    \ \npolitical assignments. This attitude of NHAPC management delayed the effective\
    \ establishment of the \nsystem at field level. This resulted in not being able\
    \ to add more blocks to T&V system. The T&V blocks \nnot exceeded 6 blocks out\
    \ of 19 blocks for 6 seasons. on the other hand this system is very successful\
    \ in \nRahad Scheme. \n308 One of the main objectives of ARETP was initiation\
    \ and introduction of T&V approach at NHAC on the \nfollowing basis: \n1. The\
    \ one line of command which features the field department fits one of the management\
    \ principles \nof T&V system. \n2. Assignment of specific certain area, to the\
    \ field inspector, although to a great extent for physical \ninspection is a second\
    \ factor to this approach. \n3. The field oriented visits although not regular\
    \ nor scheduled can suit T&V approach. \n \n221 \nIn the light of the NHAC resistance\
    \ for this approach, there was no alternative for IDA \nmissions in proposing\
    \ an amendment in extension organization. This alteration \nconcentrated on assuagement\
    \ of one or more full extension worker at each block with no \ninspectorial responsibilities.\
    \ These extension workers should be under direct control of \nExtension Department.\
    \ The extensionists should be at least provided with the project \nvehicles already\
    \ allotted to non extension work. This proposal when put under actual \nimplementation\
    \ for three seasons (89/90,90/91and 91/92) had increasing negative outputs. \n\
    This was mainly, as the inspectors reported, due to the deterioration of the project\
    \ vehicle \nwhich lacked spare parts. To overcome this problem in the season 92/93\
    \ the Corporation \nhas decided the following: \n \n1. The designated extensionist\
    \ should be responsible for one canal, an average of 400 \nfarmers, which compress\
    \ his total close supervision area. \n2. Two fields of 36 tenancies should be\
    \ selected as contact farmers for regular weekly \nvisits to adopt the main production\
    \ recommendations. \n3. Two tenancies should be selected to follow complete packages\
    \ of recommendation to \nserve as a result demonstration for conducting result\
    \ demonstration meetings. \n \nThe extensionist should be supervised by Senior\
    \ Block Inspector. The activity of extension \nat the three blocks should be monitored\
    \ by the section managers. A weekly report has to be \nsubmitted from each extensionist\
    \ to senior block inspector and section manager who in \nturn forward to extension\
    \ department for discussion at the weekly section managers \nmeetings with the\
    \ agricultural manager. Also this plane was not implemented in the season \n92/93\
    \ because of the same constraints. \n \nBecause the NAPC has no own support services,\
    \ the situation in Gendettu is worse309. All \nof the respondents, except two,\
    \ reported that there had been any type of communication \nwith the extensionist,\
    \ horticulturist, or the plant protection inspector in the region, nor that \n\
    this situation had changed. „Thy are no longer field workers, they became officials“\
    \ said \nthe tenants. In addition, there was sometimes contradiction in relation\
    \ to information \nreceived from extension310. \n \nRegarding the above discussion,\
    \ a point here that is of particular relevance is that from \nwhom or through\
    \ which media gets the farmer the messages, information, and the \nrecommendations\
    \ of the Scheme’s Administration? In New Halfa Scheme, the main \nsource of these\
    \ information, if at all as many stressed, are:  \n− the representatives of the\
    \ Agricultural Village Committees in the Block Committees \n(68%);  \n− there\
    \ are no messages (16%);  \n− block office (12%); \n− other farmers (2%); and\
    \  \n− television (2%).  \n                                                \n\
    309 The Gendettu farmers are served by the Shendi offices of the Department of\
    \ Agriculture; Plant Protection \nDepartment, and the Horticultural Department.\
    \  \n310 For example, the extension service recommended 6 sacks urea per feddan,\
    \ whereas the Corporation, which \nwas responsible for the supply in that time,\
    \ had given only two. In addition, the garden needs 10 sacks \nurea and 10 sacks\
    \ phosphate and most of the tenants, because of the high costs, use only the former.\
    \ \n \n222 \nAt Gendettu, only eleven respondents have answered this question.\
    \ All of them but one \nhave thought of water fees, that is why they reported\
    \ the khaffir311. This means that the \ncost of accurate information, that are\
    \ relevant to irrigation management, are relatively high. \n \nTenants have few\
    \ formal channels to articulate their interests and grievances to officials. \n\
    The answers given in New Halfa to the question: „who could help you when there\
    \ is a \nproblem between you and the Corporation?“ validate the above analysis.\
    \ Given in \npercentage of respondents supplying each, these are: \n \n− Nobody\
    \ \n29 % \n− Village representative \nin the Block Committee \n20 % \n− Block\
    \ Office \n16 % \n− The Village Committee \n13 % \n− TFU \n13 % \n− The agric.\
    \ Inspector \n7 % \n− The Khaffir \n2 % \n \nAlthough in theory, local-level production\
    \ committees (discussed below) of agricultural \ninspectors and tenants exist\
    \ to resolve disputes over corporation or tenant performance, \nthese committees\
    \ are heavily weighted in favor of the former. \n \n6.5.2  Tenant Farmers Union\
    \ (TFU) \n \nTFU is, theoretically, the middle-level organization which should\
    \ links between irrigators \nand central irrigation system. \n \n6.5.2.1  Initiation\
    \ \n \nInitially, TFU in New Halfa had its start as a purely Halfawyeen institution,\
    \ known as the \n„Village Committees“ to cater for the rights of the Halfawyeen\
    \ during the resettlement \nphases312. In 1968 the second stage in its development\
    \ commenced, with the TFU \nestablished, representing both the Halfawyeen and\
    \ Nomads. The membership of the TFU is \nmandatory, hence every tenant is a member\
    \ of the TFU and ‘subscription’ are annually  \n                             \
    \                   \n311 In recent study in the Guiurat (India), it was found\
    \ that about 70 percent of the farmers reported that they \ndid not usually receive\
    \ information about the closure of systems for maintenance and repairs, or even\
    \ \nopining dates. In a similar study in Pakistan, it was found that over 83 percent\
    \ of 389 farmers did not \nknow the published date for canal closures. \n312 The\
    \ main achievement of the Village Committee could be briefly summarized as follows\
    \ (NHAC \n1986:ANNEX 5): \n- the approval by the authorities to give the tenant\
    \ free water for wheat irrigation; \n- the establishment of ginning factories\
    \ within the New Halfa Scheme Area; \n- organizing and supervising the marketing\
    \ of wheat. The idea of the Co-operative Union Flour-mill had     \nits roots\
    \ during that period; \n- contribution to the advancement of the co-operative\
    \ movement substantially, through encouragement and \nenlightenment, and \n- as\
    \ a result of their negotiations with the Government, a general secondary school,\
    \ and a high secondary \nschool were opened at new Halfa Town \n \n223 \ndeducted\
    \ from them. The TFU does not include settled migrant laborers in the Scheme,\
    \ nor \nowners of amlak land unattached to tenancies. \n \nTFU in Gendettu, on\
    \ the other hand, is the oldest farmers Union in the Sudan; established \nin 1946.\
    \ The tenants struggled for the establishment of the TFU which replaced the system\
    \ \nof sheiks and samads who worked under the supervision, and represented the\
    \ interests, of \nthe colonial government in that time. After the independence,\
    \ the role of the TFU stayed a \nrepresentative body of the tenant looking after\
    \ their interests and defending their rights \nbefore the Scheme. \n \n6.5.2.2\
    \  Objectives  \n \nThe main objectives to be served by the TFU are: \n− Ensuring\
    \ the participation and contribution of the tenant at a wider level in the \n\
    management of the Scheme through effective representation in the Directing Board,\
    \ \nand the section and Block Committees. \n− Representation of the tenant in\
    \ all other spheres outside the field of agricultural \nproduction. \n− Expressing\
    \ the tenants’ view through forwarding recommendations when necessary to \nthe\
    \ management in all that advances the tenants’ benefits. \n− Fostering the relationship\
    \ between the tenant and the management through resolving \nthe conflicts arising\
    \ between the two; and also between the tenant and the other bodies \nwhich he\
    \ encounters. \n− Maximization of production through cutting down costs and raising\
    \ productivity by \nintroducing more mechanization, improved technologies, and\

    \ co-operative movement in all spheres of development. \n− Adoption of policies\
    \ that maximize the returns to the tenant from agricultural \nproduction. \n−\
    \ Improvement the livestock situation in the Scheme. \n− Expansion of the agro-industrial\
    \ base. \n \nHow far the TFU approximates the above objectives as judged by the\
    \ staff and tenants is \nconsidered below. \n \n6.5.2.3  The Organizational Set\
    \ Up of the TFUs \n \nStructurally, TFU in New Halfa has a well-developed hierarchy\
    \ of bodies and committees \nranging from the grassroots upwards: the Village\
    \ Committees, the Block Committees, the \nSection Committees, the General Assembly,\
    \ the Central Committee, and the Executive \nOffice. All of these bodies are theoretically\
    \ elected once every four years313. The TFU is \nrepresented by two members in\
    \ the directing Board. For the purpose of this study we will \nconcentrate on\
    \ the first three Committees. \n \n \n                                       \
    \         \n313 After the coup d’etat in 1988, the military rulers has canceled\
    \ all Unions in the Sudan and appointed new \nmembers instead those who are against\
    \ their polices. In New Halfa, only two elected village \nrepresentatives have\
    \ stayed in their position. \n \n224 \na. The Village Committee \nIt is the nucleus\
    \ of the whole TFU body. Every village is considered as a constituency if it \n\
    has 100 tenant farmers, who are represented by a committee of five representatives\
    \ \n‘elected’ by the tenants in the village. Since many villages have more than\
    \ 100 tenants, \nevery additional 100 to basic one is represented by three. Therefore,\
    \ the members range \nbetween 5 and 11. The Village Committee presently has the\
    \ main task of linking the \nvillage to the Block NHAPC staff, in all issues related\
    \ to agricultural production i.e. \nagricultural operations, loans, and livestock\
    \ control. The Committee is able to ultimately \n(though rarely) withhold water\
    \ or evict. Every 100 tenants are represented by one in the \ngeneral assembly\
    \ (Fig. 6.1). \n \nFigure 6.1 The Relationship between TFU and NHAC \n \n \n \n\

    \ is represented in the Block Committee by ‘elected’ member(s) from among \nthe\
    \ Village Committee. The number varies from one village to the other. The Block\
    \ \nCommittee performs at the level of the Block, representing the interest of\
    \ the tenants \nbefore the Block staff, co-operating with the latter and disseminating\
    \ information from the \nblock to the tenant through the village committees, in\
    \ all issues related to agricultural \nproduction. This is done through meetings\
    \ held weekly between the staff and the \nCommittees. Based on the organizational\
    \ rules which govern the performance of the \nCommittees, Block Committee members\
    \ should be present in all meetings, unless formally \npermitted to absent themselves.\
    \ A Committee can decide on the dismissal and replacement \nof a member who does\
    \ not abide by the above rule. \n \nc. The Section Committee \nEach Block is represented\
    \ in the Section Committee by one member elected by the Block \nCommittee from\
    \ among its members. The member should attend all meetings held at the \nSection\
    \ level and he should convey to his Block all the decisions passed. Meetings of\
    \ the \nSection Committee are held once every month and are chaired by the manager\
    \ of the \nSection. Decisions are passed by absolute majority. \n \nNHAPC Board\

    \ Committee \n \n225 \nThe dissemination of information on the proposed new Extension\
    \ Service, recommended \nby the rehabilitation study, should be carried out by\
    \ TFU Committees (NHAC \n1986:ANNEX:7). \n \nThe TFU in Gendettu consists also\
    \ of different bodies to maintain two way \ncommunication between the grassroots\
    \ bodies and the leadership of the Union at the apex \nof the hierarchy. The TFU\
    \ is geographically spread over 15 circle covering all the Scheme. \nThe distribution\
    \ of circles are based upon the position of fields, not the residence areas. \n\
    Each circle elect one representative in the Executive Committee (15 members).\
    \ The \nrepresentative appoints 5 members and constitute with them the branched\
    \ Committee in \nthis circle (called also as Six-Committee)314. Similar to the\
    \ Village Committee in New \nHalfa, the branched Committee is then the basic unit\
    \ from which the organizational \nstructure of the TFU builds up. It links between\
    \ the tenants and Executive Committee and \nhas to play role in collecting water\
    \ fees. The 90 members of the branched Committees \nconstitute the General Assembly\
    \ which formulates the general policy of the TFU and \nelects the Executive Office;\
    \ the Chairman and his deputy; the Secretary General and the \nTreasurer. The\
    \ TFU also, like the others, is represented in the directing Board. (According\
    \ \nto the new order of 92/93; the devolution of responsibility into tenants hands,\
    \ the TFU \nshould dominate the Board of Directors; represented by 9 members from\
    \ 15, and the \npresident of the TFU should be the chairman of the Board.) \n\
    \ \nThe representation in the directing Board is not the sole communication means\
    \ with the \nManagement. In addition, the TFU was represented in the Production\
    \ Committees; four \nmembers from the TFU and the same from the Scheme Management.\
    \ \n \n6.5.2.4  Performance and Role in Scheme Management \n \nThe formal representation\
    \ at Section and Block to cater for the tenants’ interest and co-\nordinate activities\
    \ with the management in specific tasks e.g. the running of agricultural \nproduction\
    \ Committees, is reported by tenants to be defective315. Of the main reasons is\
    \ the \napparent lack of involvement of the TFU Committees members at Section\
    \ and Block level. \nThis is partly attributed to the non-awareness of the Committee\
    \ members of their rights and \nroles in these joint Committees. Survey findings\
    \ indicate that about 29 per cent of the \nrepresentatives at Section and Block\
    \ levels are illiterate; with the figure even higher (44 \nper cent) in the Nomads\
    \ area (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 5:19). Furthermore the relationship  \n              \
    \                                  \n314 The idea of the branched Committee is\
    \ one result of the revolution of April 1985 (Entifada). \n315 Such  committees\
    \ are similar to those proposed by UPHOFF in Sri Lanka (1989). He recommended\
    \ a \nrevised M&E program applying the principle of specificity to improving management\
    \ in major irrigation \nsystems in that country. It proposed to operate in a participatory\
    \ manner, incorporating ‘management by \nobjectives’ principles, with water user\
    \ associations making inputs at three levels, helping to set goals, \nformulate\
    \ plans of action, and monitor and evaluate performance. On a seasonal basis,\
    \ distributary channel \norganizations made up of farmer-representatives from\
    \ each field channel within the command area, \nworking together with field-level\
    \ officials from the irrigation and other government departments, are to \nreview\
    \ past performance of that area in terms of efficiency, productivity, and profitability.\
    \ The task of \nthese committees is to formulate specific plans to deal with the\
    \ priority constraints. Distributary command \narea plans are forwarded to a joint\
    \ farmer-official project-level committee, which integrates them into an \noverall\
    \ plan for the project (UPHOFF 1991:211-12). \n \n226 \nbetween the tenants’ representatives\
    \ and the inspectors at Block and Section levels which \nlacks harmony is often\
    \ weak and strained. The major causes no doubt being mutual \nhostility and the\
    \ generalized air of pessimism which imbues the Scheme. The rehabilitation \n\
    study described such relationship as a „superiority/inferiority gap“ which hinders\
    \ co-\noperation between the two groups. Therefore, it comes to the conclusion\
    \ that the \nrepresentatives become reluctant to participate effectively in the\
    \ activities of these \nCommittees. \n \nExcept for the agricultural operations\
    \ that occasionally bring committee members at \nvillage, block and Section levels\
    \ together with the NHAC staff operating at the same \nlevels, the TFU has no\
    \ activities directly concerned with the tenants. As such, the tenants \nhave\
    \ expressed their dissatisfaction with the present performance of the TFU. This\
    \ \ndissatisfaction is more observed by the Halfawyeen. \n \nThe tenant considers\
    \ that the TFU would be more effective if it undertook other roles in the \narea\
    \ of agricultural production and social development, not only representing the\
    \ tenants \nbefore the NHAPC. The rehabilitation Study has therefore suggested\
    \ that the perception of \nthe role of the TFU has to be improved through training\
    \ programs for the TFU Committees \nat village, block, and section levels. As\
    \ well as, it has recommended that two branch-\noffices of the TFU be established:\
    \ one at El Sabaat and the other at Debaira to bring the \nTFU leadership close\
    \ to the tenant (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 5:2). \n \nOur field study indicates that all\
    \ recommendations in this context, like most of the others, \nare ‘dead letters’\
    \ more or less. Moreover, the situation after 1989 becomes worse. For the \nfirst\
    \ time in this survey, come both tenants and the staff to agreement on a question.\
    \ The \nTFU leadership (the Executive Office) has clearly failed to give satisfaction\
    \ either to the \ntenants it represents or the officials in the agricultural Sector\
    \ including NHAC Board of \nwhich it is a member. To reach a definite opinion\
    \ on this issue, both groups were asked to \nstate whether they believe that the\
    \ TFU play an important role in resolving the problems of \nthe tenants and improving\
    \ the performance of the Scheme. The answers received are \npresented in Table\
    \ 6.28. \n \nTable 6.28 The Attitude Toward TFU in both Schemes \n \n \n \nNew\

    \ reason behind the dissatisfaction mentioned by the tenants in New Halfa reflects\
    \ \nthe social and economic gap that separates them from the leadership of the\
    \ TFU (reply 1, \n3, and 6). The tenants in Gendettu mentioned age and poor education\
    \ level (under the \nterm weakness) as the main factor that contribute to the\
    \ ineffectiveness of the TFU317. \nWhereas this term in New Halfa refers to the\
    \ composition of the TFU. Many tenants \nclaim that some of the tenants’ leadership\
    \ and representatives have developed personal \nrelations with the staff that\
    \ create private interest to the exclusion of benefit to all. \nSpecially in New\
    \ Halfa, it is believed that the TFU tends to operate more at its leadership \n\
    level than at the tenants’ level318. To the questions investigating who have benefited\
    \ from \nthe services of the TFU?, the answers received were: the leadership itself:\
    \ 47 per cent; \nrelatives and friends of the leadership: 21 per cent; do not\
    \ know: 20 per cent, all the \ntenants: 12 per cent. \n \nNot only economically,\
    \ but also the TFUs are politically pressed to become ‘clients \nsubordinate’\
    \ to the Scheme Management. Most of the TFU Boards are appointed from, and \n\
    working for, the political system; just like the situation in the colonial era.\
    \ In addition, the \ncomposition of the TFU in New Halfa reflect the social and\
    \ cultural gap that separates the \ntwo communities of tenants (heterogeneous\
    \ communities).319 This lack of homogeneity \n                               \
    \                 \n316 From all respondents surveyed in Sidira, 50 per cent report\
    \ „Yes“ and the other 50 per cent „to some \nextent“, whereas the answer of the\
    \ Arabs in Gereges, in the same Block were; „No“ (83%), and „to some \nextent“\
    \ (17%).  \n317 The symbol of the TFU in Gendettu; the president, is illiterate\
    \ and was in that time 69 years old. The \nquestion is, as many raised, whether\
    \ the TFU with such leadership is able to tack over the task of \nmanagement of\
    \ the Scheme.    \n318 Related to total expenditure, this part going directly\
    \ to activities performed at leadership level \n(transportation, allowances for\
    \ central committee and executive office to meet travel expenses, and \nincentives),\
    \ makes 71 per cent. \n319 Since the composition of the TFU is based on proportional\
    \ representation of Scheme tenants, it is \nnumerically  a Nomad-dominated institution.\
    \ Field interviews indicate that for this reason, the Halfawyeen \ntenants do\
    \ not perceive either the TFU or its leadership (in a collective sense) as ‘their\
    \ own’. The major \ninstitution for the Halfawyeen , both at village level and\
    \ that of New Halfa town, has been and remains the \ncooperative Union and its\
    \ member societies, providing him with farm-machinery and repair services and\
    \ \n \n228 \nleads to opposing rights and interests. This is considered, therefore,\
    \ as one of the main \nfactors that contributed to the ineffectiveness of the\
    \ TFU, according to the officials. \n \nAlso within the officials, the dissatisfaction\
    \ with the performance of TFU was remarkable \nin the two cases of study, with\
    \ especial particular in New Halfa. Of the respondents who \nanswered this question,\
    \ only one (5%) maintained the positive role of the TFU in the \nScheme. Those\
    \ replying „No“ have presented several reasos as shown in the Table below \n(Table\
    \ 6.30). \n \nTable 6.30 Officials Report on Reasons of the Ineffective Role of\

    \ \n \nallocation and control  \n10 \n25 \nSource: Own Survey \n \nIt was difficult\
    \ to understand what does the term ‘their role’ means to the staff? Many \nstress\
    \ their activity in water fees collection and punishment in relation to water-misuse\
    \ as \nmain role. Whereas others argue that the TFU is busy with such administrative\
    \ matters and \ndescribe their work as ‘official’. Instead of being mediators\
    \ between the tenants and the \nadministration, the TFU itself become a part of\
    \ the administration. \n \nThe leaderships of the TFUs in the Sudan belong to\
    \ the few who dominates the social and \npolitical activities in the rural areas.\
    \ They are to be seen everywhere; TFUs; Local \nCouncils; and many are willing\
    \ to represent different political systems320. They are not \nnecessarily the\
    \ largest farmers in their communities, but they belong surely to those \nclass321.\
    \ They have therefore special influence in the society. That is why they are able\
    \ to \ncome to these positions even through ‘free’ election. That is why we have\
    \ to question \nwhether the free election in rural Sudan was actually ‘free’322.\
    \ \n \n \n \n                                                                \
    \                                                                            \
    \     \nflour milling facilities. This is to say in effect, that the TFU has not\
    \ developed into an integrative \ninstitution for the whole Scheme (NHAC 1986:ANNEX\
    \ 7:40). \n320 Many members of the Executive Office in Gendettu are in their position\
    \ since more than 15 years, and \nhave represented three contradictory political\
    \ systems; the military regime of Nemery (1969-85), \ncommunal \nparties \nin\
    \ \nthe \nthird \ndemocracy’s \nera \n(1985-89), \nand \nlastly \nthe \nexisting\
    \ \n‘militarily/fundamentalist’ regime! \n321 In comparison with the average field\
    \ size in Gendettu (3.2 Feddan), the cultivated sizes of three heads of \nthe\
    \ Executive Office is a s follows: the president: 21 Feddan, president deputy:\
    \ 38 Feddan; and the \nSecretary General: 14 Feddan. The president of the TFU\
    \ in New Halfa bring command areas under \ncontrol, although he is official in\
    \ the local authority. He is responsible for the ‘religious’ affairs in New \n\
    Halfa Town and called therefore by the nomads as Mawlana (a religious title)!\
    \   \n322 Legally, the elections in the Sudan in the democracy periods were absolutely\
    \ free. That means everyone \nelect voluntary. \n \n229 \nAccording to the above,\
    \ all the staff in both Schemes argued that the decision taken in the \nend of\
    \ 1992 to transfer the decision-making power in the large irrigated Schemes into\
    \ the \nhand of TFUs is unrealistic and ignore all these facts. It would be desirable\
    \ to promote a \ngradual transfer of responsibilities and increasing the area\
    \ of participation. According to \nthe decision that has been planned to be realized\
    \ in the season 93/94, the Board of \nDirectors will consists of 15 members of\
    \ which 6 are executives members and 9 are \nmembers of the TFU. However, we believe\
    \ that this decision which comes from the \npolitical authority without any preliminary\
    \ discussion with those concerned, was not \nserious but rather for propaganda,\
    \ and aimed in addition to political goals323. We argue \nthat this decision was\
    \ an attempt to avoid, directly, the responsibility of such projects in \nthe\
    \ light of the economic crisis and, at the same time, a chance to appear as a\
    \ democratic \nsystem in the face of the international organizations. \n \n6.5.3\
    \  The Relationship between the Organizations \n \nEarly theories of organizations\
    \ focused primarily on internal features of organizations and \nfailed to give\
    \ serious treatment to the claims that organizations were influenced by, and \n\
    exerted influence upon, their surrounding environments (see Chapter 2.3). We are\
    \ \ninterested here to bring to light the important role of the interorganizational\
    \ \nrelationships; the external linkages with other organizations such as supporting\
    \ \norganizations, capable of exercising effects on irrigation efficiency. The\
    \ previous findings \nyield insight into interfield relationships calling for\
    \ a greater degree of integration \nbetween the concerned organizations, and first\
    \ of all those sharing in irrigation \nmanagement. \n \nAs discussed in Chapter\
    \ 1.3, mobilizing the availability of a total package of necessary \nagricultural\
    \ inputs and facilitating their adoption by farmers being supplied with irrigation\
    \ \nwater is a pre condition for well-managed irrigation systems324. Appropriate\
    \ \narrangement must be made for the project participants to secure the supplies\
    \ of fertilizers, \npesticides, high yielding seeds, cattle feed and veterinary\
    \ medicines they need to adopt the \nnew crop and livestock production technologies.\
    \ \n \nImplicit in the foregoing discussion is the fact that the interaction of\
    \ MOI with the \nagricultural Corporation is an extremely involved day-to-day\
    \ practical one, with any failure \nby either party rapidly leading to insufficient\
    \ water reaching the crops and a consequential \ninfluence on production. Unfortunately,\
    \ the interaction is sufficiently complex to ensure \nthat when water supply deteriorates,\
    \ each party feels justified in the opinion that the fault \nlies with the other\
    \ party and neither seems able to remedy the deteriorating overall \nsituation.\
    \ \n \nDespite the above statment, the majority of respondents (79% in New Halfa,\
    \ and 84% in \nGendettu) reported that there are cooperation and good relations\
    \ with the colleagues in \nMOI and the other organizations. But, this relation\
    \ and co-operation are dependent on the \n                                   \
    \             \n323 The staff in Gendettu reported that there were four governmental\
    \ decisions, one after the other, in the \nseason 92/93 that have resulted in\
    \ confusion of the management. These decisions related to Region’s \nsystem; individual\
    \ account for NAPC’s Schemes; the extension of the MOI’s responsibility; and the\
    \ \ntransfer of the Schem’s responsibilities. \n324 The recent adoption of the\
    \ command water management project approach by major donor agencies is ased \n\
    on this comprehensive systems approach. \n \n230 \npersons (informal) and are\
    \ more routinized than productive. Personal connections and \nfavors play the\
    \ determinant role inside and between the organizations. \n \nPests and Disease\
    \ Control \n \nControl of insect pests in New Halfa (for cotton) is disappointing.\
    \ Recommendation in this \nconnections are in the areas of: improved scooting\
    \ techniques; even plant populations; \nimproved application techniques; and procurement\
    \ policy (NAPC 1986:ANNEX 2:35). \nCotton pesticides are applied by aircraft.\
    \ Even so, it is recommended that improving the \napplication techniques would\
    \ raise the efficiency. Aircraft, correctly supervised, will do a \nsatisfactory\
    \ job but equally it can be extremely inefficient. The application efficiency\
    \ does \nnot depend on the method chosen so much as the skill of the individual\
    \ operator. To \nassume that the use of aircrafts ipso facto efficient , because\
    \ it is technologically advanced, \nis a fallacy. Every system is as good as the\
    \ operator, and supervision of contractors is \nvital to ensure a high return\
    \ on costs. For the tenants, the main complaint here is the high \ncosts of this\
    \ services, that are undertaken by private firm under the supervision of the \n\
    scheme. \n \nProblems related to pest control are more extreme in Gendettu. The\
    \ NAPC, Plant \nProtection Department (PPD), the Department of Agriculture (DoA),\
    \ Agricultural \nResearch staff and the farmers all said that pests cause problem\
    \ every year and that, in \nmost years, there is a serious pest outbreak on one\
    \ crop or another. In theory, these \noutbreaks can be controlled by the farmers,\
    \ who should be able to purchase pesticides from \nthe PPD, but the availability\
    \ of chemicals is severely restricted by the methods of supply. \nThe main reason\
    \ for this unfortunate situation is that the PPD is administrated by the \nCentral\
    \ Government, Khartoum, not by the Regional MoA office in Ed Damer. \n \nThe PPD\
    \ office in Shendi, which is responsible for Gendettu Scheme, has one graduate,\
    \ \nand seven technicians (two: Agr. Scond. School and five:unquqlified), in addition\
    \ to five \nvehicles (only one for spraying) and enough numbers of sprayers. The\
    \ office provides \nthree kinds of service: first, selling sprayers and chemicals\
    \ to farmers; second, offering a \ncontract spraying service on request; and third,\
    \ assists any farmer requesting advice on pest \ncontrol matters. The PPD tries\
    \ to persuade farmers to group together so that the area to be \nsprayed is at\
    \ least 5 feddan. Likewise, the time and costs involved in spraying smaller \n\
    areas makes the operation uneconomic. \n \nThe manager of the department stressed\
    \ that it would be better when every scheme has its \nown PPD. This would enable\
    \ the Scheme to make regular inspections and bring this \nservice to all farmers\
    \ with lower cost. Otherwise, the Scheme management must co-operate \nwith the\
    \ Department in achieving this vital operation. Such co-operation, he argued,\
    \ is \nmissing. In addition, the unchained canals, gardens, and roads are responsible\
    \ for \nincreasing malaria cases325. Tenants, on the other hand, complain that\
    \ the services \n                                                \n325 Malaria\
    \ and bilharzia are diseases that increased through the misuse of water and lead\
    \ further to misuse \nof water because the patients are not able to manage and\
    \ control the water at the field. It is therefore \ndifficult to define the dependent\
    \ and the independent factor. Specially in New Halfa the cases of these two \n\
    were very high. The cases were doubled after the end of the World Bank’s program\
    \ (1983-1990).This can \nbe one reason for the high absenteeism there. In addition,\
    \ we have found in the documents of Gendettu \nSchemes many letters written from\
    \ the inspector of the health Office in Shendi  since the beginning of \n1980s\
    \ that seek the Scheme management to clean the main and the minor canals, and\
    \ the roads. The office \nviews that the Scheme is responsible for the spread\
    \ of Malaria and bilharzia cases in area. \n \n231 \navailable are inadequate,\
    \ insufficient and too expensive. The costs of this operation have \nfrequently\
    \ increased. Most of them said that they never received any assistance nor, \n\
    indeed, had they ever seen any PPD staff. Furthermore, many believe that in the\
    \ absence \nof group action, it makes no sense to spray alone because the pests\
    \ will come from the \nneighbors. \n \nCredit Services \n \nFacilities for credit\
    \ for the farmers to finance the different operations, purchase various \nproduction\
    \ supplies and for the suppliers of inputs should be made to ensure successful\
    \ \nimplementation of the project. The lack of financing  and its influence on\
    \ the performance \nof the different operations comes onthe top of  problems that\
    \ are facing the tenants (Tables \n6.1, 6.3, and 6.6). In the opinion of some\
    \ officials this problem is the first one at all326. \n \nThe Agricultural Bank\
    \ of the Sudan (ABS) is the main official source of agricultural credit \nin the\
    \ rural areas. The New Halfa branch of ABS has been involved with the settlement\
    \ of \nthe Scheme since its inception, initially in the granting of credit for\
    \ wheat operations \n(1965), and since 1966/67 in the provision of seasonal credit\
    \ for groundnut production. \nThe role played by the bank in the financing of\
    \ tenants’ groundnuts operations until the \nend of 1970s has been described as\
    \ instructive and significant (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 7:44-\n5). In addition, the ABS\
    \ has played only a minor role in recent years in non-groundnuts \ncrops - most\
    \ of it presumably in relation to production on freehold land (Amlak)327. The\
    \ \nstaff  of the Bank are of the opinion that if there were better co-ordination\
    \ between \nNHAC and ABS, the volume of credit could be considerably higher. Under\
    \ the new \nindividual account system, cotton is financed through credits from\
    \ the Corporation. \n \nThe bank offer mainly two kinds of loans in Shendi. Short-term\
    \ crop loans with period of \none season (from 15 Oct. to 30 Apr.) at a charge\
    \ equivalent to 36 per cent of the total loan \n(3 % per month) are mostly given\
    \ for the winter crops. Medium-term loans, ranging from 2 \nto 4 years are granted\
    \ for items such as tractors, equipment and pumps. The ‘charges’ of \nthese loans\
    \ are also 3 % per month under the Morabaha ‘islamic’ system328. \n \nThe more\
    \ recent form of seasons loan is the Salam system (post-harvest credit system)\
    \ \nwhich used mainly to finance wheat in New Halfa and faba beans in Shendi.\
    \ According to \nthis system, the farmer is obliged to dispose off  his crops\
    \ (particularly pulses) in a time \nand according to price determined, in advance,\
    \ by the bank in the harvest period329. In the \ncase of crops failure, the bank\
    \ has, theoretically, to accept the amount of the credit (cash) \nwithout charges,\
    \ but in the reality the bank accept only crops. This means, farmer is \nobliged\
    \ in this case to purchase the crop from the market to deliver it further to the\
    \ bank.  \n                                                \n326 For example,\
    \ the manager of the New Halfa Agricultural Research Center.  \n327 It is estimated\
    \ that not more than three percent of the farmers in the mid 1980s received institutional\
    \ credit \n(HANSOHM 1991:121). \n328 Charges have been increased from 15 % in\
    \ 1986/87 to 19 % and recently 36% after the ‘islamisation’ of \nthe economy.\
    \ Under the Morabaha system, the bank finance the item.  \n329 For example, the\
    \ determinate price of the wheat in the season 92/93 was 1200 £S (sack) and the\
    \ amount of \ncredit was 37 000 £S, this means the farmer had to deliver the bank\
    \ 37 000/1 200 = 31 sacks disregard the \nproduction. Under the objection of the\
    \ farmers the number was reduced to 14 sacks. In the season 91/92 \nthe Salam\
    \ price was 1 000 LS/sack whereas the market price after the harvest was 2 100\
    \ Ls/sack.  \n \n232 \nMany of the officials argued that this system exploit the\
    \ weakness of the farmer and the \nabsence of the roles played by the concerned\
    \ organizations. The opinion of the tenants \nin regard to this system was: unfair\
    \ (61 %); exploiter (16 %); do not know (9 %); to some \nextent (9 %); and good\
    \ system (5 %). \n \nIn the ‘with project’ situation it would be more possible\
    \ for farmers to make full and rapid \nuse of the water if seasonal crop credit\
    \ were to be used more extensively. The late of the \nseason-loans in the season\
    \ 92/93 caused problems for the farmers in Shendi area who are \ndependent on\
    \ this source of financing. Although middle of October is the recommended \ndate\
    \ for the beginning of the Winter Season, from the extension service department,\
    \ the \nfarmers had not received any credits until the beginning of December.\
    \ Therefore, they \nraised the question; to what extent co-ordinate the concerned\
    \ organizations their \npolicy, if at all? \n \nFor such reasons; delay of credits;\
    \ high charges; and the obligation to repay by crops, \nformal agricultural credit\
    \ plays a fairly insignificant part on the schemes. During the study \nattempts\
    \ were made to identify the sources of finance for the different tenants and crops:\
    \ \n \n− The role of the ABS in New Halfa is secondary and limited to groundnuts;\
    \ 16 % of \nits finance among the Halfawyeen and 21 % among the Arabs. The rest\
    \ is self-\nfinance. \n \n− Sorghum in the Arabs area is 100 % self-financed.\
    \ \n \n− Financing of wheat among the Halfawyeen is heavily (53 %) dependent on\
    \ \ngovernmental credits (under the Salam system) through the Corporation. \n\
    \ \n− The Halfawyeen are more dependent on the credits of the Corporation to finance\
    \ \ncotton (82 % of its finance) in compare with the Arabs (53 % credit and 47\
    \ self-\nfinance). \n \n− There is no formal credit institution to finance the\
    \ freehold areas in New Halfa.  \n \n− Only 7 % of the tenants in Gendettu have\
    \ received credit from the ABS in the \nseason 92/93 whereas the rest reported\
    \ self-finance. In addition to the high rates \ncharged by the bank, tenants reported\
    \ other reasons for this situation, the most \nfrequent one was: „in the case\
    \ of default the bank will send me to prison but the local \nmerchant will endure\
    \ and protect my reputation.“ Other most frequent reason was \n„we don’t understand\
    \ the way of dealing with such system, only the upstreamers \ncould that.“330\
    \ \n \n− The term ‘self-finance’ in New Halfa refers also to informal credits\
    \ from the family \nmembers, friends or relatives whereas in Gendettu refers,\
    \ in addition, to food/money \n                                              \
    \  \n330  The traditional bank system may be sophisticate for the peasant. A simplified\
    \ approach like this \npracticed by Grameen Bank in Bangladesh for example, where\
    \ the bank go to the peasant not reverse, \nmay be more suitable. Other example\
    \ from Bas Boen, Haiti project, where planners had to do away with \neven simple\
    \ bookkeeping since the illiterate population could not cope with such, for them,\
    \ sophisticated \nmethods. So the planners instituted a system of ‘internal money’\
    \ whereby peasants „paid“ for the \nsupplies and engaged in other financial transactions\
    \ by remitting or receiving chits (WEITZ 1986:169).  \n \n233 \nlending system;\
    \ the so called Shayl or Sheil system. It is one form of the interlinked \n(personalized)\
    \ transactions331 in such small face-to-face community which comprise \nsimultaneous\
    \ deals in the commodity and credit markets between a trader and a \nfarmer where\
    \ the later gets credit on the precommitment of future crop delivery to \nthe\
    \ former332. \n \n− The members of the TFU in Gendettu stressed that many tenants\
    \ are dependent on \nthe informal Shayl credit system - apparently it presents\
    \ better creditor-borrower \nrelation. Only 23 % of the respondents reported directly\
    \ that they do not practice \nsuch system and described it as ‘forbidden’ from\
    \ the religious point of view333.    \n \nMarketing \n \nIrrigated agricultural\
    \ production and marketing; crop yields and generated farm income, \nform the\
    \ basic indicators against which the ‘efficiency’ of the system is assessed. In\
    \ \naddition, an institution can be said to be optimal if it best attains some\
    \ welfare goal. \nTherefore, issues like where the project’s output will be sold,\
    \ whether the market is large \nenough to absorb the new production without affecting\
    \ the price and whether suitable \nfacilities are available to handle/process\
    \ and/or store the new production, are responsible \nfor the failure of many projects.\
    \ The Scheme Management of our two cases did not make \nany effort in this context.\
    \ And it seems to us that market in this sense is absent from ‘their’ \nmind334.\
    \ All the staff (100%) in both Schemes pointed out that the Corporations have\
    \ no  \n                                                \n331 Much of the recent\
    \ theoretical literature spelling out the underlying rationale of interlinked\
    \ contractual \narrangements has served as a welcome corrective to the murky institutionalize\
    \ of the past and has provided \nsome much needed micro foundations to the study\
    \ of agrarian institutions (BARDHAN 1989b:238). \n332 Shayl (carrying) system\
    \ is practiced in deferent rural areas in Sudan; mainly north, central and west,\
    \ to \nfinance low-investment subsistence grain cultivation. According to this\
    \ system, that is in operation since \nthe Fung Kingdom (around 1500), merchants\
    \ stored grain to lend in times of shortage and to receive \npayment in times\
    \ of abundance. The effect is to bring considerable profits to the merchants and\
    \ great \nmisery to the peasants (TRILSBACH 1991: 181). In the recent years, similar\
    \ to the salam system, the \nmerchant give credits (in cash or kind) to the tenant\
    \ to finance the agricultural operations and the normal \ndaily costs, and the\
    \ farmer is forced to repay at harvest (from the crop) according to price determined\
    \ at \nthe beginning of the season.  \n333 Based on field study in Ad-Damazin,\
    \ EL TAHIR (1982) represents many shayl students and stressed the \ndisadvantages\
    \ of such system specially the high rate: „The wide difference between the shail\
    \ price and the \nmarket price shows how exorbitant the rate of interest is that\
    \ the traditional farmer have to pay. The rate of \ninterest at the above mentioned\
    \ areas is estimated to be 296% on the average. This rate of interest is \npushed\
    \ even higher due to the fact that the farmer needs the borrowed money to buy\
    \ consumer goods from \nthe lender. The price at which he buys, are usually very\
    \ much higher than the market prices in the urban \nareas“. However, shayl prices\
    \ differ between individual peasants depending on their creditworthiness, the\
    \ \nhighly indebted peasants receiving lower prices (OSTERDIEKHOFF 1991:369).\
    \ On the other hand, \nAWAD (1967) belongs to the few who oppose the idea of considering\
    \ the shayl margins as usurious \ninterests. In contrary, he argues: “there are\
    \ no interest payments in shayl. The margins which the shayl \nmerchants receive\
    \ are strictly in nature of profits.. they are not fixed in advance, and they\
    \ are not always \npositive sums as interest rates are. Because of their habit\
    \ of confusing shayl with money-lending, the \nstudents of shayl usually refer\
    \ to shayl margins as interest rates. But moneylending is an entirely different\
    \ \nsystem: its transactions are usually carried out in cash only, and so it is\
    \ an essentially urban institution. \nRural borrowers use it only when they can\
    \ not obtain loans from shayl lenders because its loans have all \nthe risk problem\
    \ of state and cooperative loans beside being more expensive.“ (EL LAYTHY 1995:23-\n\
    27).  \n334 The village shopkeepers, as OESTERDIEKHOFF (1991:368) pointed out,\
    \ are the central commercial \ninstitution of villages.    \n \n234 \nrole in\
    \ marketing, and the tenants in this respect are oppressed and exploited again.\
    \ There \nmust be, they argued, any kind of co-ordination and cooperation between\
    \ the concerned \norganizations including TFU.  \n  \nCotton is sold to the ginneies\
    \ (most of which are publicly owned through the scheme \nmanagement organizations)\
    \ at a fixed farm gate price. The lint is sold to the Sudan Cotton \nCompany,\
    \ a publicly owned company, which sells to both the domestic and export \nmarkets.\
    \ Wheat is still predominantly handled by government authorities from the gate\
    \ to \nthe flour mills. In addition to the unfair system of cotton marketing and\
    \ the obligation to \ndeliver most of the wheat crops to the state under the salaam\
    \ system,335 the marketing of \ngroundnuts, the sole cash crop for the tenant,\
    \ is totally controlled by some monopolists. \nThe tenants reported that instead\
    \ of helping the farmers it seems that the state, through its \npolices and the\
    \ big merchants who belong to the party in power, make profits from them. \nOnly\
    \ 20 per cent of respondents in New Halfa and 17 per cent in Gendettu reported\
    \ that \nthey have no marketing problems. In New Halfa, most of the farmers  grow\
    \ only cotton \nand sorghum or only wheat. The obstacles of marketing reported\
    \ by the tenants are \ndistributed between336: \n \n \n% of the total answers\
    \ \n \n \nNew Halfa \nGendettu \nLow prices \n30 \n42 \nMonopoly of the market\
    \ \n17 \n16 \n High taxes \n16 \n21 \nAbsence of any \norganization to defense\
    \ the \nfarmers \n15 \n11 \nDelay of opening the \nmarket (groundnuts) \n7 \n\
    - \nmiddlemen \n5 \n- \n  \nGroundnuts are marketed in specific market called\
    \ ‘crops market’. As a condition for \nparticipation in this market, tenant has\
    \ to pay eight different local taxes and social services \nlevy per sack. The\
    \ lack of opening the market enforce the tenant to accept any price \nbecause\
    \ of his need for liquid money. The low prices and monopoly refer to the same\
    \ \nproblem. Many tenants therefore refused to accept the price available at end\
    \ of the season \n92/93 and stored the crop in the houses. \n \nIn the light of:\
    \ a) the low prices of the crops resulting from the monopoly of the state \n(cotton\
    \ and, to a big extent, wheat) and the merchants (groundnuts, faba, onion and\
    \ fruits); \nb) the low productivity due to the water shortage; and c) the absence\
    \ of financial \nsupporting, the problem of increasing the costs of production\
    \ means low revenues and, \ntherefore, no motive for the tenant to increase the\
    \ performance at the field. \n                                               \
    \ \n335 Only very small quantities of wheat and sorghum enter the free market.\
    \ \n336 The first set of problems affecting agricultural performance and hunger\
    \ in Africa, according to the \nWorld Bank perspective, are the cluster of often\
    \ inappropriate agricultural price, tax, subsidy and \nexchange rates policies.\
    \ In Africa, these policies have generally served in the last 20 years to depress\
    \ \nfarmers’ incomes and incentives to produce. This has discouraged agricultural\
    \ production for the market, \nencouraged rural-urban migration, reducing inevitable\
    \ resources remaining in agriculture hence reducing \nagricultural investment\
    \ (SERAGELDIN 1990:243).  \n \n235 \nAs mentioned before, cost of production is\
    \ one of the major problems of the two schemes \nwhich has direct influence on\
    \ the water management. The costs of the different \nagricultural operations and\
    \ inputs have dramatically increased in the season 92/93 as \nshown in the Table\

    \ have changed as follows: \n \n \n1991/92 \n1992/93 \nIncrease \nWheat \n800\

    Onion \n500 \n800 \n60% \nFaba Beans \n \n2000 \n \n \nThe increase in cost of\
    \ production in the season 91/92 for the crops in New Halfa were: \ncotton 113%;\
    \ wheat 143%; groundnuts 88%; and sorghum 96%. Revenues have, on the \nother hand,\
    \ increased as follows: 57%; -0.03; 73%; and 118% respectively. As compared \n\
    with the productivity (Table 6.25) we find, with exception of groundnuts, net\
    \ loss. This \novershadows the effects of higher yields. The net return to tenants\
    \ profits (loss) LS/fed. \nfor sorghum during the1980s was negative (-0.9, -29.6,\
    \ -64.8, -109.7, -23.4, -139.5, -166.6, \n-160.9, -589.6, and -80.0 respectively).\
    \ Similar results in relation to cotton was observed \nwith the exception of the\
    \ year 89/90. \n \nThe estimated increase in production costs of the crops in\
    \ New Halfa in the season 92/93 \nwas: cotton 335%; wheat 207% and  groundnuts\
    \ 304%. For sorghum the costs of one sack \nwas £S 1200 whereas the price £S 550.\
    \ The high estimation for cotton and groundnuts is  \n \n236 \ndue to the high\
    \ utilization of the labor input. All these facts indicate the negative returns\
    \ \nfrom the crops and have resulted in changing the arrangement of sharecropping\
    \ system337. \n \nThough the absence of official prices in Gendettu, it seems\
    \ that the problem related to \nproduction costs is very critical. In comparison\
    \ with the other crops, onion is the most \ninfluenced by the cost’s problem,\
    \ but still, because of the high productivity, more \nprofitable for the tenants338.\
    \ There is special reference to inputs like fuel and oil, fertilizers, \nlabor,\
    \ and insecticides. Fuel, for instance, is only available in the black market.\
    \ Farmers \nsurveyed said that in 1985/86 they had experienced no difficulty in\
    \ purchasing fertilizer. It \nwas, however, due largely to NAPC obtaining a special\
    \ allocation of 2000 tonnes financed \nby Japanese aid. The prices were: Urea\
    \ £S 38 and triple superphosphate (for orchards) £S \n24 per 50 kg sack (ODA 1986:A1/2-14).\
    \ In this context, FAO Fertilizer Program339 had \nbeen concentrating on persuading\
    \ the farmers to use TSP (Triple Superphosphate) in \naddition to Urea. The availabilty\
    \ of these inputs have been reflected in more productivity \nin the middle of\
    \ 1980s. \n \nClearly, we could conclude by emphasizing that 1) the support organizations\
    \ have \nsubstantial role to play in relation to farm management. This role is\
    \ absent in our two cases \nas well as the Schemes’ Administrations do not co-ordinate\
    \ with these organizations340; 2) \ntaking the negative effects of such policies\
    \ on the income distribution, we are able to \ncharacterize the two schemes, according\
    \ to transaction costs theory, as inefficient; and 3) \nwhere irrigated agriculture\
    \ is profitable for water users, they have more participation in the \nactivity\
    \ and are willing to cooperage in paying water fees. \n \n6.6  Water Prices \n\
    \ \nThe amount of water received by each farmer during the irrigation season is\
    \ not known, \nsince water is not measured at the individual farm take off point.\
    \ In New Halfa, the only \nmeasuring points in the irrigation water distribution\
    \ system are at the intakes of the minors. \nIn order to measure discharges into\
    \ each farm, an intensive network of measuring devices \nis required. Particularly\
    \ in the areas where night storage facilities are constructed. This \nrequires,\
    \ in addition to a high investment per Hawasha, well trained personnel to collect\
    \ \ndata on actual water use. That is why the rehabilitation study of New Halfa\
    \ Scheme has \nsuggested water charges based on a fixed rate and related to the\
    \ land rent. This, \nhowever, will only be possible, stressed the study, once\
    \ operation and maintenance of the \nirrigation scheme is such that each farmer\
    \ will be able to apply water at the right time and \nthe correct quantity (NHAC\
    \ 1986:ANNEX 1:29). \n \n                                                \n337\
    \ Before the season 92/92 the arrangement was that the tenant receive 20 per cent\
    \ of the ‘total’ outputs or \nthe return whereas the sharecropper who shoulders\
    \ all the costs is entitled to receive the rest. Because of \nthe high production\
    \ costs the new arrangement is that the tenant receives 20 per cent of the net\
    \ return i. e. \nafter deducting the production costs. \n338 The price of onion\
    \ dropped from £S 800 at the beginning of the season to £S 350 at the end. \n\
    339 The FAO Fertilizer Program is initiated in 1977 and intended to promote the\
    \ sound use of fertilizers, \nmainly nitrogen and phosphates, through their sale\
    \ to farmers at favorable price plus extension and \ntraining support. \n340 It\
    \ is worth noting that the need for cooperation and good will between research\
    \ institutions, irrigation \nengineers, agriculturists and the farmers was defined\
    \ in a study, since almost twenty years, as \nurgentrecomendation for improving\
    \ the application efficiency in irrigation systems in Sudan (see: SALIH \nand\
    \ KHADAM 1976:126).  \n \n237 \nIn the Sudan, farmers pay water charges based\
    \ on a fixed rate per area irrigated - but \nthese charges bear no relation to\
    \ the amount of water used and the numbers of \nirrigations. Once tenant irrigate\
    \ one time he has to pay for the whole season (eight \nwatering) even if, for\
    \ one reason or another, he do not complete the season. The evasion \nis, in addition,\
    \ not possible specially in New Halfa. Until season 90/91 charges for \nwater\
    \ and land had been levied under one rate; called land and water rate. Since season\
    \ \n91/92 water rates and land fees have been separated. Tables 6.32 and 6.33\
    \ show water \nrates structures and explain the variation in the feddan rate for\
    \ different crops. The flat \nrate of irrigation water has been tremendously increased\
    \ specially during the last \nfive years. \n \nTable 6.32 Water and Land Charges\

    \ was £S 2260 in \nseason 91/92 increased to £S 4635 (190%) in the next season.\
    \ Cotton charges have more \nincreased because it needs more watering; from 2680\
    \ £S/Hawasha in the season 91/92 to \n£S 5780 (180%) in the season 92/93. The\
    \ variation in the charges per Hawasha in the \nlast five years was more than\
    \ twelve times for groundnuts and sorghum, nine times for \nwheat, and almost\
    \ seven times for cotton. \n \nTable 6.34 shows dramatically increases in the\
    \ feddan/rate for some selected crops in \nGendettu. During seasons 85/86 and\
    \ 92/93 these variations have been as follows: \nberseem (alfafa) 5525%, horticulture\
    \ 4275%, onion 4048%, faba 2713%, vegetable \n2106%. Of course, one has to question\
    \ whether these increases are real or nominal. \n \n238 \nAlthough the deterioration\
    \ of the Sudanese currency and the inflation341 play a \nsubstantial role here,\
    \ the more critical question would be how much is the share of water \ncharges\
    \ within the production costs? According to the available data from New Halfa,\
    \ \nfor example, the relative share of water and land rates of these costs constitute\
    \ average \nof 14% of cotton, 23% of wheat, and 10% of groundnuts. However, the\
    \ meaning of such \nincreases would be more clear when we add the increases in\
    \ the costs of the other inputs \nand when we, on the other side, compare it with\
    \ the increases in crops prices.   \n   \n \nTable 6.34 Water Charges in Selected\

    \ Scheme \n \nNote that responsiveness to water price can be viewed as farm-level\
    \ land reallocations that \nwould occur with an increase in price and this is\
    \ known as allocative distortions342. \nAlthough it makes no sense, however, to\
    \ test the elasticity of water demand with respect to \nprice in New Halfa, decline\
    \ in the Wheat area has been registered in the season 92/93. In \nGendettu some\
    \ tenants have begun to substitute away from alfalfa production in the face of\
    \ \nhigher water prices. \n \nDespite the above, there is another factor which\
    \ is very important for the decision of \nsetting, and of course increasing, the\
    \ water rates. This factor is whether the tenants are \nfree in selecting the\
    \ cropping pattern which maximize their profits. The interview in \nNew Halfa\
    \ has shown that 53% of the tenants were not satisfied with the current \ncropping\
    \ pattern and 7% were not sure, whereas 40% have viewed that they find no \nreason\
    \ to change it. Since such questions are very critical for the tenants, because\
    \ of the \npolitical shadows that influence it, we have tried, as in many similar\
    \ situations \nthroughout the interviews, to repeat the question, later, with\
    \ other words. Tenants have \nbeen asked to suggest a new cropping pattern in\
    \ the scheme (Table 6.35). The results is \nshown in the table below as follows:\
    \ \n \n                                                \n341 As a solution for\
    \ the inflation’s implications on water fees, is to establish the level of fees\
    \ in terms of the \nquantity of the crop (specially important crops). It does\
    \ not mean that they are necessarily collected in \nkind. The amount of cash necessary\
    \ to satisfy the fee would depend on the price of the crop. The \nmechanism for\
    \ establishing the price to be used each year would have to be specified. This\
    \ approach has \nbeen used in the Philippines since 1975 (SMALL/CARRUTHERS 1991:179).\
    \ However, the rehabilitation \nstudy of New Halfa Scheme has excluded such alternative:\
    \ “If water charges are related to the harvest \nand a rate per unit of harvested\
    \ crop is determined, water wastage will increase. A farmer having good \nyields\
    \ will see the water charge as a fine since he has to pay more than his fellow\
    \ farmer whose yields are \npoor even though he has used the same quantity of\
    \ water” (NHAC 1986:ANNEX 1:29).  \n342 See MOORE, GOLLEHON, and CAREY 1994:867.\

    \ \n \n• Cotton backed and three new crops are suggested instead. Third of the\
    \ surveyed has \nclearly and directly refused cotton343. \n• Wheat is still the\
    \ most desired crop in the scheme344. Some of the nomads, on the \notherhand,\
    \ asked for the replacement of wheat with groundnuts or sunflower. \nSorghum constitute\
    \ with wheat a considerable share of the subsistence consumption \ncommodities\
    \ of the poor. \n• Most of the Halfaween are not interested to grow sorghum not\
    \ only because the are \nwheat consumers, but first of all because it needs a\
    \ lot of work in the Hawasha. They \nare tend therefore  to share it with the\
    \ nomads or the hired labor. Distribution of the \nyield is 50 % for both or 75\
    \ % for the sharecropper and 25% for the Halfawyeen, and \neven in some cases\
    \ the later is ready to renounce his share in order to keep the \nrotation. \n\
    \ \nFurthermore, the neat answers given to the questions: „what do you want to\
    \ grow if you \nwould obtain another five Feddan and why?“ tie well with the above\
    \ analysis and draw, \nclearly, the preferences of the tenants concerning cropping\
    \ patterns. Seen from the \neyes of the tenants, there seem to be several alternative\
    \ crops that reflect their needs (Table \n6.36). \n \n                       \
    \                         \n343 Tenants in village 24 halfaween have decided to\
    \ drop the cotton in the season 92/93. This decision is \npracticed in village\
    \ Gereges by the nomads throughout the last four seasons. The reasons that have\
    \ been \nusually mentioned concerning cotton’s exclusion are: a) water shortage;\
    \ b) ...”cotton is not yours, not in \nyour hand,controlled in all phases from\
    \ the ‘others’; and at the end we get the earnings after one years. \nThat is\
    \ way it  has been dicribed as ‘Kamel crop’ (12 months pregnancy). Some of the\
    \ halfaween argued: \n“cotton does not belong to us: the government takes the\
    \ flower; the remain of the produce used as a fodder \nfor the nomads’ animal;\
    \ and the earnings are to be taken after one year...why should we then grow it?\
    \      \n344 On the contrary, wheat is seen as ‘gold’, especially by the Nubian\
    \ (halfaween): “its value is stable and/or \nwith the  time its prices go up (store\
    \ of value);....you can by it any time (cash liquidity); and first of all it is\
    \ \nin your hand”. This result stands in sharp contrast to what is viewed in the\
    \ rehabilitation Study: “In view of \nthe acute water supply, it is recommended\
    \ that the cropping program is confined to cotton, groundnuts, \nand sorghum with\
    \ no wheat on NHAPC land” (NHAC 1986:NHIRP, Annex2:1).  \n \n240 \nTable 6.36\

    Source: Own Survey \n \nThese results reveal too an important fact in irrigation\
    \ system i.e., financing irrigation with \nuser fees requires consideration of\
    \ both the costs of providing irrigation and, at the same \ntime, the benefits\
    \ that the users receive from irrigation  \n \nBut crosscutting these, there are\
    \ other angles namely the officials. Almost 50% of the \nsurveyed agree on the\
    \ current cropping pattern addition to 20 % who view it as “to some \nextent”.\
    \ Interesting here is that 30% have described it as: “not suitable”345. \n \n\
    There is a general perception about water pricing that the farmers do not accept\
    \ it. This is \nnot entirely correct346. It was very interesting here to find\
    \ that the tenants were more able \nto accept the institutional change concerning\
    \ water prices than the officials. Here is \nanother ‘point’ where the latter\
    \ misconstrue the behavior of the tenants. The resistance \nwhich has been practiced\
    \ at the beginning should not be understood, as the projects’ staff \nwrongly\
    \ did, as refuse or non-conviction of the idea. Indeed, it is the reaction of\
    \ a series of \ndissatisfactions. It is, however, the non-conviction that such\
    \ step will be used to improve \nthe water utilization, as well as their refuse\
    \ of the way of the ‘whole’ management whitch \nresult in reducing their incomes.\
    \ This is, unfortunately, not clear for the Schemes’ \nManagement. \n \nIn spite\
    \ of all these dissatisfactions, we find the reaction of the surveyed tenants\
    \ with \nrespect to change in water rates very interesting. Table 6.37 shows that\
    \ they are willing \nto accept the increase in water charges but only in the case\
    \ if this step, in the same time, \nwould guarantee the improving of water management.\
    \ From the other angle, staff and \n                                         \
    \       \n345 Some of them (Nubians) argued that dura (sorghum) has to be excluded\
    \ from the irrigated area (it belongs \nanyway to the rainfed cultivation outside\
    \ the scheme).   \n346 Information on communal and private irrigation systems\
    \ in various countries in Asia, for example, shows \nthat even poor farmers often\
    \ pay quite large amount for good quality irrigation services because they are\
    \ \nstill better off than they would be if they had no access to irrigation (SMALL\
    \ and CARRUTHERS \n1991:161). \n \n241 \nofficials were asked if they think that\
    \ increasing water charges could be an effective \nmeans for improving water use\
    \ in the two schemes (Table 6.38)  \n \nTable 6.37 Do you Agree to Pay Higher\

    \ \n22 \nSource: Own Survey \n \nThe answers of these two questions reflects many\
    \ aspects, for example: \n1. Tenant’s attitudes towards the project. In New Halfa\
    \ where the dissatisfaction is high \nthey were not willing to accept the increases.\
    \ Furthermore, there is no confidence in, or \nhope of, improvement. They referred\
    \ to the season 92/93 as example.  \n2. The kind of water user (e.g., degree of\
    \ dependency on agriculture as a source of \nincome; the background of the tenant\
    \ whether he/she is a farmer or a newcomer to \nthis field). Thereby, many tenants\
    \ in Gendettu have argued: “irrigation is the sprite \nof agriculture that is\
    \ why we have to accept the increases in water prices” and \n“availability of\
    \ water will motivate us to think about other new crops”. It is also to \nbe noted\
    \ here that many of them are conscious that water costs in the scheme still \n\
    lower than it is in the private schemes.  \n3. The different views of both „configuration“\
    \ about one of the most important \nelements of irrigation schemes. The majority\
    \ of officials see no relation between \nincreasing water prices and improving\
    \ water-use. The presumption underlying this \nargument is that: (a) it is the\
    \ problem of the current rate setting system which has to \nbe changed, not the\
    \ amount of price (50% in New Halfa, 40% in Gendettu); (b) \nincreasing the price\
    \ will be reflected on the production costs (25% New Halfa, 20% \nGendettu); (c)\
    \ in addition to the importance of control, farmers have to be explained \nthat\
    \ the over watering is, the same way like under watering, harmful for crops (17%\
    \ \nNew Halfa, 20% Gendettu); (d) in addition to the above, the government has\
    \ to \nstrengthen the law and penalty. \n \nIn summary, we argue that the preconditions\
    \ that guarantee positive results from \ncharging farmers water fees are the same\
    \ that are needed to alleviate and overcome the \nproblems of water management.\
    \ As long as the tenant: not involved in the decisions-\nmaking; face water shortage\
    \ and unfair water distribution; stay alone in the field without \nextension services\
    \ and determinate inputs for the productivity; find no conditions of trust \n\
    \ \n242 \nbetween farmers and between farmers as a group of irrigation and officials;\
    \ has no \nsteady benefits from his farm and then lost the loyalty to the scheme;\
    \ as long as these \nobstacles dominate, then waiting that increasing water charges\
    \ would improve water-use \nstay as a theoretical hypothesis. \n \n \n \n243 \n\
    7. Conclusion \n \nThe focus of this study has been on improving the performance\
    \ of irrigation water-use in \nSudan. The assessment of this performance is seen\
    \ as having main points of reference, as \nconcluded below.  \n \nIt is difficult\
    \ to imagine a partial solution for a comprehensive problem. Improving the \n\
    performance of water-use is only possible as part of a comprehensive development\
    \ \napproach which takes all resources into consideration. However, in order to\
    \ get better \nutilization of the resources in the irrigated sector in developing\
    \ countries, there is an \nurgent need for, what could be referred to as Resources\
    \ Management Ethics. The \ngovernment of Sudan spent 136 million US dollars at\
    \ the beginning of the 1980s for the \nrehabilitation of the New Halfa Scheme\
    \ (less than two decades after its inauguration). \nOne has to question, after\
    \ the discussion of the results in Chapter 6, whether there was a \nrehabilitation\
    \ at all. The question is also valid for the Gendettu scheme. Technical \nrehabilitation\
    \ without changing the institutional deficiencies cannot be the favorable \nsolution,\
    \ from a cost point of view, to increase production capacity. \n \nThe environment\
    \ of irrigation projects is of particular importance. The case study of the \n\
    Sudan emphasizes that bureaucratic irrigation systems must take political conditions\
    \ \ninto account. With regard to the role of the state towards irrigation schemes,\
    \ one is \nforced to state that farmers have faced new forms of ‘exploitation’\
    \ with little difference \nfrom the precious situation during the colonial era.\
    \ The current condition is, however, \nbitter because it has been practiced under\
    \ a national ‘flag’. Sometimes it is hardly \npossible to find a substantial difference\
    \ between NHAC, NAPAC, and the national \nGovernment on one side, and The Sudan\
    \ Plantations Syndicate (of the Gezira) and the \ncolonial Government in the colonial\
    \ era. Now, the elite in power see farmers as a main \nsource of financing activities\
    \ that serve their own goals (the war in south Sudan as an \nexample).  \n \n\
    The recent kind of irrigation management system in the Sudan reminds one of the\
    \ \ndivision of society at the beginning of this century along class lines between\
    \ a group of \nrulers, known as hukam and a class of subject commoners, for which\
    \ the corresponding \nterm was masakin (literally, ‘poor people’). This focus\
    \ has tended to direct attention to \nthe ‘colonial inheritance’ that has been\
    \ practiced by the elite since ‘independence’: \nfarmers have to work for the\
    \ scheme and not the other way round. These observations \nhighlight the fact\
    \ that an irrigation system is a political system. \n \nThis raises the question:\
    \ to what extent are the participation approaches applicable in the \norganizations\
    \ of such countries? A central conclusion of this study is that an irrigation\
    \ \nsystem could not be seen as a developed ‘island’ in an underdeveloped ‘sea’.\
    \ If the \ndominant institutions in the country do not practice the democratic\
    \ values and prevent \nothers from using it, then talks about participatory approaches\
    \ in some organizations or \ninstitutions or expecting this in such a country\
    \ remains theoretical. \n \nThe absence of tenant participation and the dominance\
    \ of the scheme management’s \ngoals, as representatives of the state, have resulted\
    \ in a contradiction: efficiency in the \nopinion of the scheme management vis-à-vis\
    \ efficiency in the opinion of the tenants. The \nabsence of farmers’ participation\
    \ has resulted, however, in the domination of \n‘individualism’ among water users.\
    \  \n \n244 \n \nA point here that is of particular relevance for irrigation systems\
    \ is that the definition of \nthe term water efficiency has to be join with the\
    \ productivity per unit of water applied. \nIf this is not the case, the other\
    \ inputs will be underutilized or wasted. In addition, more \nproductivity motivates\
    \ tenants for efficient use of water and makes them able to pay \nwater charges.\
    \ An institution can be said to be optimal if it best attains some welfare \n\
    goal.  \n \nThe technology applied has a vital role in order to reach such a goal.\
    \ One should be \nclear about the meaning of the term ‘appropriate technology’\
    \ in literature. ‘Appropriate’ \nas seen in this study also means the advanced\
    \ technologies that are needed to save scarce \nresources. Therefore, modern technology\
    \ must not be seen as a ‘block’ that should be \ntaken or ignored completely (‘take\
    \ it or leave it’). Conversely, irrigation projects could \nuse modern technology,\
    \ in some phases or parts of the schemes, as long as it necessary \nfor water\
    \ saving. This question arises in a number of areas, the principal one in the\
    \ \nimmediate future being in relation to land leveling and land preparation,\
    \ gate control, \nclearing canals, siltation of canals and reservoirs, harvesting,\
    \ and communication \nsystems. Although this study suggests improving the technology\
    \ practiced in irrigation \nschemes, it is of great importance to stress that\
    \ this kind of change, as such, is not \nenough as long as there is no water-user\
    \ organization to undertake the task of water \ncontrol. \n \nIt is necessary\
    \ to reckon with the fact that the weak role of complementary or support \ninstitutions\
    \ in Sudan is one of the vital obstacles to water-use efficiency in its broadest\
    \ \nmeaning. Agricultural extension services, in particular, are the indispensable\
    \ tool for the \nrepresentation of new technologies. The importance of the role\
    \ that can be played by the \nagricultural extension service must be recognized\
    \ and really practiced by the scheme \nmanagement. The performance of this department\
    \ and the attitude of the scheme \nadministration towards it show what chances\
    \ Sudan has in this context. \n \nBroadly speaking, previous findings yield insight\
    \ into interfield relationships calling for \na greater degree of integration\
    \ between these institutions. Because of the integrated \nnature of the agricultural\
    \ operations, it should be an area of cooperation between all the \nconcerned\
    \ organizations and primarily all those organizations that directly share \nresponsibility\
    \ for irrigation management. For instance, the non-cooperation between \nNHAPC\
    \ and MOI has resulted in a lot of trouble and bottlenecks for water management.\
    \ \nSupport institutions have had no significant role in sustaining the agricultural\
    \ operations \nand modernizing the technologies and this resulted in low productivity\
    \ and wastage of \nwater. Thus, a central conclusion of this study is that the\
    \ efficiency of water utilization \nalso requires, at the same time, efficient\
    \ utilization of other resources and inputs \nsupplied by support institutions.\
    \ \n \nAnother issue emerging from these findings is the importance of communication\
    \ (the \n‘bridge’ or ‘gangplank’) in coordinating organizational activities. Information-\n\
    processing writers take a somewhat broader view of the organization as an information-\n\
    processing system trying to cope with uncertainty by getting information to the\
    \ decision \npoint where it is needed. Communication here means information exchange\
    \ and \nbehavior control. Nevertheless, it is not an easy task, in such bureaucratic\
    \ schemes, even \nto define the feature of this communication. After having examined\
    \ the communication \n \n245 \nand articulation system of the two schemes, a yawning\
    \ gap was found between the \ndifferent actors. \n \nThe study has attempted to\
    \ trace the question of contact between the leadership and the \nbase. Deviations\
    \ from the scheme management recommendation have been found for \ndifferent operations.\
    \ Some of the tenants argued that there are no recommendations at \nall, and therefore,\
    \ there is no feedback. Many others pointed out that they find nobody to \ndiscuss\
    \ with. On the other hand, it has been mentioned, several times, by officials\
    \ that \nthe entrepreneurship of tenants (with special reference to the Halfaween)\
    \ is weak. Such \nresults are familiar in developing countries.  \n \nThis study\
    \ draws attention, in particular, to the role of the TFU (Tenants Farmers’ \n\
    Union) as a channel of communication between corporations and tenants. TFU is\
    \ \nfarmers’ organization not an irrigation association. It has no remarkable\
    \ role in \ngoverning activities at distributary and water course levels. There\
    \ is no doubt that \n‘building’ water-users associations is more conducive to\
    \ equitable water distribution. It \ncould help to mitigate the problems connected\
    \ with insufficient water supplies, water \ndistribution and water charges. Clearly,\
    \ what is at issue here is not the utility of the \nconcept, but the conditions\
    \ under which it is employed. Water-users’ associations needs \nindependence.\
    \ \n \nIt is true that the existence of a farmers’ organization is an indicator\
    \ for the ‘dialog’ \nbetween water users and higher levels like scheme administration\
    \ or the actual definers \nof the scheme’s goals (i.e. politicians and businessmen).\
    \ But on the other hand, the \nsocio-economic and political analysis of these\
    \ organizations and the way through which \nmembers of such organizations come\
    \ to their positions (as in the Sudanese case) allow \none to argue that the existence\
    \ of such organizations can also be seen as merely – as it \nwere – a kind of\
    \ ‘monologue’. \n \nThe point to dwell on here, however, is by and large one of\
    \ the most important factors \nfor improving irrigation systems in the future.\
    \ As was stated in different places of the \ntreatise, improving water-use cannot\
    \ exclusively be achieved by arrangements in the \nfield and/or the design, or\
    \ even through managerial arrangement concerning water \ndistribution. This goal\
    \ needs, in addition, other aspects of institutional change \nconcerning price\
    \ policies and market conditions.  \n \nMany students of irrigation management\
    \ have stressed the potential counter-\neffectiveness of increasing the price\
    \ of irrigation water as a means for inducing optimum \nwater-use efficiency.\
    \ In order to achieve this goal, some institutional changes concerning \nthe following\
    \ issues should accompany  the administrative capacity of the scheme, the \npracticed\
    \ technology, cropping patterns, and production relationships. Therefore, one\
    \ \nmay infer that, in irrigation systems, the term ceteris paribus has no function.\
    \ In \naddition, intervention in pricing and payment systems should be aimed towards\
    \ creating \nimproved systems based on reduced distortion and well-stated, clear\
    \ objectives that take \naccount of the specific circumstances of the country\
    \ concerned and the potential impact \non all parties involved. \n \nIt has been\
    \ found that the generalization of the common idea that tenants/farmers are \n\
    against water pricing is of no effect. Moreover, they are willing to accept considerable\
    \ \nincreases in the price as long as an additional source of financing is used\
    \ to improve \n \n246 \nwater delivery and distribution within their schemes.\
    \ It is necessary to reckon also with \nthe fact that many of them are firmly\
    \ aware of the benefits they could gain from this \nchange. Therefore, it is not\
    \ possible to imagine benefits from levying water charges in \nsuch projects as\
    \ long as the tenants have no full hand on the decisions of water \ndistribution,\
    \ land use, cropping pattern, and as long as the markets are not free. \n \nThe\
    \ first concern tenants raise is that: “the revenue from increasing water charges\
    \ will be \nused for ‘their’ interests not for solving ‘our’ problems ..... the\
    \ price has been increased \nseveral times and water problems have remained unchanged”.\
    \ On the other hand, \nincreasing costs of production in the same time as decreasing\
    \ the productivity as a result \nof water and financing bottlenecks, as well as\
    \ the ambiguity of property rights, create no \natmosphere of trust or a feeling\
    \ of loyalty. These are genuine concerns and are \nconsidered to be major reasons\
    \ for the poor performance of the schemes.  \n  \nIn Chapter 6 an attempt was\
    \ made to prove one of the factors that are closely bound up \nwith water pricing\
    \ i.e. tenants’ attitudes towards cropping patterns. As illustrated in \nmany\
    \ studies in the last two decades, cotton areas and yield declined dramatically\
    \ \nbecause of the poor management and pricing policy despite the change in production\
    \ \nrelationships. Because of the unprofitability, this crop reflects the conflict\
    \ between the \ngoals of the national policy-makers and those of the tenants.\
    \ One is facing here an \nexample of clashing objectives similar to the one practiced\
    \ in the Dominican Republic, \nwhere the government stressed the total volume\
    \ of rice produced whereas farmers, \nunderstandably, were more concerned with\
    \ its profitability. Similar to the behavior of \nthe tenants in New Halfa and\
    \ other schemes in Sudan towards cotton, when the price \npaid for rice in the\
    \ Dominican Republic fell too low, farmers left crops unharvested in \nthe fields,\
    \ to the consternation of officials. The investigation in Sudan has shown, \n\
    however, that if the choice were possible, which it is not, the tenants would\
    \ prefer cash \ncrops and those that needs low water and fertilizers (because\
    \ of their costs). \n \nUltimately, it is concluded that the water pricing system\
    \ in Sudan has failed to achieve \nits stated objectives of: (a) introducing funds\
    \ for operation and maintenance, (b) \ninfluencing the manner of water-use, (c)\
    \ promoting innovations and investment, and (d) \nsustaining loyalty to the scheme.\

    \ two educators whose aspirations served as an \ninspiration for this work: my\
    \ father, Jesus M. Delos Reyes and my mentor, Prof. Wilfredo P. \nDavid. \n \n\
    \ \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nA doctoral study is a challenging journey. It is both\
    \ exciting and daunting at times. It is \nexciting because it gives one an opportunity\
    \ to contribute in an effort to find just and effective \nways for a greater good.\
    \ An offshoot of such opportunity is just as stimulating - a chance to \ncommunicate\
    \ and work with highly inspiring people in the academia, government agencies \n\
    and in the field. Like in a journey, the roads are not always smooth. There can\
    \ be bumps, \nmires, precarious turns and a seemingly interminable empty horizon.\
    \ \nThe completion of this academic journey was made possible by guidance and\
    \ goodwill \nof many individuals to whom I am deeply grateful. \nI highly appreciate\
    \ the guidance, support and encouragement of my promoter Em. Prof. \nE. Schultz.\
    \ It is an honour to be your student. I am inspired by the wisdom that comes \n\
    naturally from you.  \nI am indebted to my late supervisor Prof. Wilfredo P. David\
    \ whose vast knowledge and \ndeep understanding of the technical aspects and cross-cutting\
    \ issues of my PhD thesis and \nwhose wisdom and virtues in the practice of his\
    \ profession were truly an inspiration. I was \nprivileged to have learned from\
    \ and worked with you. \nI am grateful to my local supervisor, Prof. Guillermo\
    \ Q. Tabios III for his invaluable \nguidance and encouragement particularly on\
    \ the modelling aspects of this doctoral research. I \nhave learned much from\
    \ you. I am also thankful to Dr. Krishna Prasad for his valuable \nsupport and\
    \ insights which helped this study reached milestones. \nMy gratitude also extends\
    \ to dedicated officials and staff of the National Irrigation \nAdministration\
    \ (NIA) who willingly accommodated my request for data and shared their \ninsights\
    \ on various aspects of their mandates. I am thankful to officials and members\
    \ of the \nirrigators associations of Sta. Maria RIS and Balanac RIS for their\
    \ usual support and \ncooperation in the conduct of my various field experiments.\
    \ \nI am also indebted to the Philippine Government and the Netherlands Government\
    \ for \nthe financial support to my PhD study. I thank my host institution, UNESCO-IHE,\
    \ for the \nvibrant and stimulating academic atmosphere. Also to Maria Romero\
    \ Vink and family for \ngenerosity and kindness they have shown me during my stay\
    \ in the Netherlands.  \nTo my parents and siblings, for their presence in my\
    \ life no matter what. \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n1.1 General \n \nExpanding\
    \ the aggregate irrigation service area has been a key strategy of the Philippine\
    \ \nGovernment to achieve its goals of rice self-sufficiency and alleviation of\
    \ rural poverty. \nConstruction of new irrigation facilities was vigorously carried\
    \ out with the launch of a 10-\nyear accelerated irrigation development program\
    \ in 1974 (National Irrigation Administration \n(NIA), 1990). The irrigation service\
    \ area increased from about 0.74 million ha in 1972 to \nabout 1.44 million ha\
    \ in 1985, almost 94%. \nRehabilitation of irrigation systems has also been carried\
    \ out to maintain the irrigation \nservice areas and to close the gap between\
    \ the actual area irrigated and the design service \narea. It is defined by the\
    \ NIA as an undertaking that includes reconstruction or restoration of \nirrigation\
    \ facilities to their original design, expansion of the service areas beyond the\
    \ original \ndesign and provision of additional control structures, drainage systems,\
    \ on-farm facilities and \nservice roads. \nSince the late 1980s, however, irrigation\
    \ expansion in the Philippines has lost \nmomentum due to a host of interrelated\
    \ technical, hydrologic, socio-economic, institutional, \nenvironmental and political\
    \ issues and constraints (David, 2003). A number of studies \nrevealed that many\
    \ canal irrigation systems are performing below expectations (Ferguson \n1987;\
    \ Dy, 1990; World Bank, 1992; David, 2003; David, 2008; David 2009). The actual\
    \ area \nirrigated is much less than the design service area especially during\
    \ the dry season. Rice yield \nand cropping intensity are much below their projected\
    \ levels. Consequently, post-evaluation \neconomic rates of return of irrigation\
    \ projects are much lower than those estimated during \nproject planning. Further,\
    \ the systems rapidly deteriorate due to cumulative operation and \nmaintenance\
    \ neglect and apparent too optimistic design assumptions that have compromised\
    \ \nthe physical integrity of these irrigation systems (David, 2003; 2008). Newer\
    \ canal irrigation \nsystems only served around 56% of their design service areas\
    \ in contrast with up to 94% prior \nto 1965 as reported by Fergusson (1987).\
    \  \nThe performance of large-scale canal irrigation systems remained generally\
    \ less \nsatisfactory even after the adoption of participatory irrigation management\
    \ schemes \n \n2 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \n(Bagadion, 1994; Raby, 2000; David, 2003; International\
    \ Programme on Technology and \nResearch in Irrigation and Drainage (IPTRID),\
    \ 2003; Maleza and Nishimura, 2007).  \nThe policy of continuing public investment\
    \ in the development and rehabilitation of \ncanal irrigation systems has increasingly\
    \ been questioned in the light of continued dismal \nperformance of such irrigation\
    \ systems, attractiveness of shallow tubewell irrigation, heavy \nforeign debt\
    \ burden, pressing need to upgrade other rural infrastructure such as roads, \n\
    markets, and post-harvest facilities. While the validity of such arguments cannot\
    \ be denied, \nthere is still a strong case for construction of new and modernisation\
    \ of existing canal \nirrigation facilities from the standpoints of food security,\
    \ poverty alleviation, equity in access \nto irrigation water, and preservation\
    \ of the integrity of the water resources (David, 2003). \nThe dismal results\
    \ of rehabilitation efforts have been attributed to the approach of \nrestoring\
    \ the original design without rectifying apparent unrealistic design considerations\
    \ \n(David, 2003; David et al., 2012a; David et al., 2012b). IPTRID (2003) noted\
    \ that the \nPhilippine government borrowing for irrigation during the 1980s and\
    \ 1990s has mostly \nsupported rehabilitation and that maintenance was deferred.\
    \ However, no assessment on the \ncauses of rapid deterioration of flow control\
    \ structures and no changes on water delivery were \nmade.  \nModernisation of\
    \ irrigation is widely viewed as a process of technical, management and \ninstitutional\
    \ transformation to improve irrigation services to farmers (Food and Agriculture\
    \ \nOrganisation of the United Nations (FAO), 1997; Renault et al., 2007). It\
    \ is now recognized \nas a strategic option to improve the performance of large-scale\
    \ canal irrigation systems. As \neach irrigation system is unique, a modernisation\
    \ strategy must be system-specific. \nIn the Philippines, large-scale canal irrigation\
    \ systems, which are more commonly \ncalled in the country as national irrigation\
    \ systems (NIS), are designed based on rice crop \nwater requirement and a water\
    \ source supply with at least 80% probability of exceedance. On \nthe average,\
    \ however, many of these systems can irrigate only about 60–70% of their design\
    \ \nservice areas during the dry season despite the various rehabilitation efforts\
    \ carried out by the \ngovernment. This low percentage of area actually irrigated\
    \ has been attributed to inadequate \nwater supply or low irrigation efficiency\
    \ or both. \nThis study discusses the proposed approach to investigate modernisation\
    \ options for \nNIS. Central to the proposed modernisation strategy are: \nIntroduction\
    \ \n3 \n \n \n• \nfocus on establishing a coherent link among the physical structure,\
    \ system operation \nand water supply in the analysis and formulation of a modernisation\
    \ plan for NIS; \n• \nconsideration of adaptive modifications in the physical\
    \ structure, operation, \nmaintenance and management of irrigation systems in\
    \ the context of changing \nhydrological regimes. \n \nThe available water supply\
    \ would be the main limiting factor on how much of the \nservice area can be irrigated.\
    \ A prudent approach to planning for irrigation system \nmodernisation would consider\
    \ a realistic service area that can be irrigated with the available \nwater supply.\
    \ In many NIS, this would mean reducing their service areas. The advantages of\
    \ \nreducing the service area down to the realistic level would include a more\
    \ focused \nmodernisation plan, a more reliable water service delivery, higher\
    \ unit area productivity as a \nresult of more reliable water supply and a higher\
    \ chance of full operation and maintenance \n(O&M) cost recovery due to most likely\
    \ increases in irrigation service fee collection as \nirrigation service to farmers\
    \ is improved. Meanwhile, augmentation of the water supply would \nhelp maintain\
    \ the design service areas. Conjunctive use of water from other sources and from\
    \ \nthe original water source for the irrigation system would help address inequity\
    \ in access to \nirrigation water as well as improve reliability, flexibility\
    \ and adequacy of irrigation service \nand, probably, simplify system operation.\
    \ \nThe general methodology used in developing the approach included the following:\
    \ \nanalysis of the process, nature and impacts of rehabilitation projects; diagnostic\
    \ assessment of \nthe irrigation systems; revalidation of design assumptions on\
    \ water balance parameters; \ncharacterization of irrigation management and demands;\
    \ and identification of options for \nimprovement. \n \n1.2 Structure of the thesis\
    \ \n \nThis thesis consists of eleven chapters. Chapter 1 highlights the trend\
    \ and present state of \nirrigation development in the Philippines as well as\
    \ the nature and scope of the study. Chapter \n2 gives an overview of the state\
    \ of irrigation in a global perspective; brief history of irrigation \ndevelopment\
    \ in the Philippines, the present level of irrigation development and issues in\
    \ the \n4 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the\
    \ Philippines \n \n \nirrigation sector; and the rationale, research questions,\
    \ hypothesis, objectives, and research \nmethodology of the study. Chapter 3 provides\
    \ descriptions of general hydro-climatic, socio-\neconomic conditions, laws and\
    \ policies of the country that are relevant to water resources and \nirrigation\
    \ development. The description of the irrigation systems considered in this study\
    \ is \nalso described in this chapter. Chapter 4 presents a review of pertinent\
    \ literature on the issues \nand concepts on design and performance of irrigation\
    \ systems, while Chapter 5 summarizes \nthe general approaches to assessment of\
    \ irrigation systems.  \nChapter 6 discusses the results of the assessment study\
    \ on the impact of rehabilitation in \nincreasing the service area actually irrigated.\
    \ Chapter 7 presents the diagnostic assessment of \nthe performance of the irrigation\
    \ systems under study as well as the results of the analysis on \nconsistency\
    \ among design philosophy, operational objectives, physical structure and current\
    \ \nirrigation water demand. The validity of design assumptions on percolation\
    \ and water supply \nis investigated in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 deals with the water\
    \ flow paths, system management, \nirrigation service and demand. Chapter 10 presents\
    \ the options for improving the physical \nstructure and system operation of the\
    \ case study systems, visions of the modernised systems \nand the major steps\
    \ in the formulation of a modernisation plan for NIS. The key findings for \n\
    each objective and some of the challenges to NIS modernisation are discussed in\
    \ Chapter 11. \nThe thesis is concluded with an evaluation of the proposed approach\
    \ to formulation of a \nmodernisation plan for NIS and an indication of the way\
    \ forward. \n \n \n2. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES \n \n2.1 Irrigation in global\
    \ perspective \n \nThe primary purpose of irrigation is the production of food\
    \ and fibre. Agricultural production \nin areas far from water resources and during\
    \ dry seasons has been made possible by extensive \nirrigation development. Irrigation\
    \ development has been adopted as a key strategy of many \ncountries to attain\
    \ food security during the twentieth century (Turral et al., 2010). The \nincrease\
    \ in global food production during this period was closely associated with the\
    \ \nexpansion of irrigated land (Clemmens, 2006). Irrigation was a key element\
    \ that underpinned \nthe Green Revolution, the mid-20th century period was marked\
    \ by an increased agricultural \noutput in Asia (Hussain, 2007a; Turral et al.,\
    \ 2010). Irrigation offers a quick way of \nincreasing food production through\
    \ increased yields and cropping intensities (Abdullah, \n2006). Approximately\
    \ 40% of the world’s crop production comes from the irrigated land, \nwhich is\
    \ about 20% of the world’s cultivated lands (FAO, 2007).  \nIrrigation has also\
    \ been viewed as an instrument to increase rural household income and \nto alleviate\
    \ rural poverty (Abdullah, 2006; Hussain, 2007a; Hussain, 2007b; Lipton, 2007;\
    \ \nMolden et al., 2007; Turral et al., 2010). It generates employment opportunities\
    \ and creates \nconditions for subsequent agro-industrial and economic development\
    \ (IPTRID, 1999; \nAbdullah, 2006; Molden et al., 2007). Surplus in agricultural\
    \ production made possible by \nirrigation is also an important source of foreign\
    \ revenue for many countries (Dedrick et al., \n2000).  \nBy the period 2025–2030,\
    \ global food production will have to be doubled to keep up \nwith the food requirement\
    \ of the concurrent world population (Schultz et al., 2005; Abdullah, \n2006;\
    \ Schultz et al., 2009) of around 8 billion people. It is expected that around\
    \ 80–90% of \nthis increase will have to come from existing cultivated areas and\
    \ 10–20% from newly \ncultivated land (Schultz and Wrachien, 2002; Schultz et\
    \ al., 2009). Since significant increase \nin yield cannot be expected from areas\
    \ without irrigation facilities, around half of the required \nfood production\
    \ over the next couple of decades will to have to be realized on irrigated lands\
    \ \n(Schultz and Wrachien, 2002; Schultz et al., 2005; Abdullah, 2006; Schultz\
    \ et al., 2009).  \n \n \n6 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nHowever, not all is well with irrigation.\
    \ Despite impressive contributions in global food \nproduction, there have been\
    \ issues and concerns on the environmental impact, performance \nand sustainability\
    \ of irrigated agriculture. Irrigation accounts for about 70% of water \nwithdrawals\
    \ from global river systems, while the irrigation efficiency of canal irrigation\
    \ \nsystems is generally less than 40% (Plusquellec et al., 1994). Excess water\
    \ flowing out of \nirrigated areas has been associated to waterlogging, soil salinity,\
    \ freshwater pollution by agro-\nchemicals and habitat for vectors of water related\
    \ diseases (United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development (UNCED),\
    \ 1992).  \nIt has also become a common knowledge that many canal irrigation systems\
    \ have been \nperforming poorly (Horst, 1998; Skutsch and Rydzewski, 2001; Plusquellec,\
    \ 2002; \nClemmens, 2006; Malano and Hofwegen, 2006). The economic rates of return,\
    \ cropping \nintensities and actual area irrigated have been lower than expected\
    \ during the project planning \nstage (Rice, 1997; Pluesquellec, 2002; David,\
    \ 2003). Inability to achieve the performance \ntargets in quite some canal irrigation\
    \ systems has been attributed to the commonly observed \nproblems, which include\
    \ unreliable water supply, insufficient maintenance, poor system \noperation or\
    \ water management, inappropriate flow control structures, poor water distribution\
    \ \nto the detriment of downstream farmers, rapid deterioration of physical structures,\
    \ and \ntechnical design shortcomings, among others.  \nThe poor performance and\
    \ the recurrent rehabilitation and operation and maintenance \ncosts, which are\
    \ hardly recovered from users, have casted doubts on the sustainability of most\
    \ \ncanal irrigation systems. Such lack of sustainability has been one of the\
    \ key factors in the \ndecrease of investments by international funding agencies\
    \ in canal irrigation system \ndevelopment (Pluesquellec, 2002; Malano and Hofwegen,\
    \ 2006).  \nA widespread installation of private tubewells for irrigation purposes,\
    \ which started in \nthe early 1980s (Turral et al., 2010), has been associated\
    \ mainly to the unreliability of water \ndelivery of canal irrigation systems\
    \ (Plusquellec, 2002; IPTRID, 2003; Ertsen, 2009). \nGroundwater irrigation has\
    \ been the dominant mode of irrigation in India and has been used \nextensively\
    \ in China, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan. As cited by Ertsen (2009), the total\
    \ \ngroundwater use in these countries accounts for 300 billion m3yr-1 or nearly\
    \ half of the \nestimated worldwide groundwater withdrawals of 600–700 billion\
    \ m3yr-1. Groundwater \nirrigation is credited to have sustained the increase\
    \ in global food production earlier achieved \nBackground and objectives \n7 \n\
    \ \n \nwith a rapid development of canal irrigation systems. However, its success\
    \ comes at a price: \ngroundwater is being depleted at undesirable rates in many\
    \ irrigated areas (Plusquellec, 2002; \nIPTRID, 2003; Ertsen, 2009). Continued\
    \ reliance on groundwater irrigation in many countries \nwill expedite reaching\
    \ the limits on groundwater development. \nThere is a consensus that irrigation\
    \ will play a key role in securing global food supply in \nthe forthcoming decades.\
    \ This role implies that the contribution of irrigated areas in food \nproduction\
    \ will have to increase. Increasing such share can be achieved by expanding the\
    \ \nareas with irrigation and drainage facilities and improving and modernizing\
    \ existing irrigation \nand drainage systems (Schultz et al., 2005; Schultz et\
    \ al., 2009; Turral et al., 2010). The latter \nis the more subscribed option\
    \ (Malano and Hofwegen, 2006; Schultz et al., 2009; Turral et \nal., 2010) as\
    \ the former is deemed more costly and has limited potentials as competition for\
    \ \nland and water among various uses (industries, cities, and environment) is\
    \ expected to \nintensify. Consequently, performance improvement of existing canal\
    \ irrigation systems has \nbeen the theme of many papers, international fora and\
    \ development efforts on irrigation. \nVarious performance assessment methodologies\
    \ and performance indicators have been \ndeveloped. Similarly, a number of concepts,\
    \ processes and activities aimed at improving \nperformance have been proposed.\
    \ Shifting focus from mainly technical solutions pursued \nprior to 1980s to management\
    \ and institutional solutions during the 1980s (Horst, 1998; \nPlusquellec, 2002;\
    \ Malano and Hofwegen, 2006), many of them now gravitate towards a \nmodernisation\
    \ strategy that emphasizes consistency among design of physical components of\
    \ \nirrigation systems, operational procedures and agreed water delivery service\
    \ (rate, duration \nand frequency). Service-oriented approach to design and management\
    \ of irrigation systems \nhas recently been the dominating philosophy subscribed\
    \ to by most irrigation experts. It is \nalso the proposed guiding principle in\
    \ modernisation efforts aimed at improving the \nperformance of existing irrigation\
    \ systems. Ensuant development includes redefining \nmodernisation as a process\
    \ of technical and managerial upgrading of irrigation systems to \nimprove irrigation\
    \ service to farmers. Such becoming commonly understood definition of \nmodernisation\
    \ distinguishes it from rehabilitation, which simply re-establishes the physical\
    \ \ndesign of the original system (Plusquellec, 2002). \nThe service-oriented\
    \ approach to irrigation development and modernisation presents a \nkey challenge\
    \ since a service-oriented design has to account for farmers demand and \n8 \n\
    Modernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nresponses to water deliveries as a standard in irrigation. Thus, it\
    \ would require knowledge on \nhydrology, hydraulics and social aspects (Ertsen,\
    \ 2009). It implies a design process that \nspecifies the physical components\
    \ of an irrigation system within a well-defined operational \nprocedure that enables\
    \ delivery of an agreed level of water service (Plusquellec, 2002). It also \n\
    calls for sufficient flexibility to be incorporated in the design to better respond\
    \ to changes in \nwater service demands (Schultz and De Wrachien, 2002). Further,\
    \ it also necessitates a review \nor re-assessment of irrigation design procedures,\
    \ criteria and assumptions (Plusquellec, 2002; \nSchultz and De Wrachien, 2002).\
    \ Groundwater, which provides farmers water storage in the \nvicinity of their\
    \ farms, presents opportunities to augment the surface water supply of canal \n\
    irrigation systems. Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is deemed\
    \ to provide a \nbetter irrigation service. \n \n2.2 Irrigation in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n2.2.1 \nHistory of irrigation  \n \nAccounts on irrigation development\
    \ in the Philippines can be found in the National Irrigation \nAdministration\
    \ (NIA) (1990) and David (2003). This review draws heavily from these \nreferences.\
    \ The time when irrigation was first practised in the country predates recorded\
    \ \nhistory. Historical accounts and archaeological findings approximate the age\
    \ of the earliest \nirrigated rice terraces in the country at 2,000 years old.\
    \ Similarly, early canal irrigation \nsystems in lowland areas first existed prior\
    \ to colonial times. These irrigation systems were \nconstructed and operated\
    \ by local farmers. Water for these communal irrigation systems was \nusually\
    \ diverted from a river by placing bamboo and rock structures across the river.\
    \ Based on \nSpanish reports Zanjera, an indigenous irrigation society found mostly\
    \ in the Ilocos Region, \ncame into existence starting 1630 (NIA, 1990).  \nPrior\
    \ to the Spanish colonial era, it was estimated that an aggregate of about 25,000\
    \ ha \nin the country was served by mainly very small canal irrigation systems,\
    \ which were built, \noperated and maintained by farmers. David (2003) remarked\
    \ that an interesting feature of \nthese systems was their built-in stability\
    \ as a result of crop cultural practices, cropping \nBackground and objectives\
    \ \n9 \n \n \npatterns and soil and water conservation and management practices\
    \ being interwoven in their \ndesign, operation and maintenance. \nThe Spanish\
    \ colonial government constructed irrigation systems in lands granted by its \n\
    King to Spanish religious orders in the country. These religious orders grew rice\
    \ as a major \ncrop in these lands, which was familiarly known as “friar lands.”\
    \ The colonial government \nintroduced new techniques and designs in the construction\
    \ of the irrigation systems serving \nfriar lands in provinces around Manila.\
    \ Typical to these irrigation systems are massive \nheadworks up to 40 metres\
    \ high and large networks of canals to convey water (NIA, 1990).  \nDuring the\
    \ Spanish regime, many small run-of-the-rifer irrigation systems were built as\
    \ \nwell to serve mainly friar lands in coastal areas close to Manila, along the\
    \ Pampanga River \nand in the Ilocos Region. These irrigation schemes served an\
    \ aggregate area of 200,000 ha \n(David, 2003). \nDuring the American regime (1900–1936),\
    \ the Irrigation Division under the Bureau of \nPublic Works was established in\
    \ 1908 and the Irrigation Act was passed in 1912. The \nIrrigation Division was\
    \ responsible for constructing new irrigation facilities and repairing \nexisting\
    \ ones. The Irrigation Act regulated the appropriation of public waters, prescribed\
    \ rules \non water rights, and provided for the investigation, construction, operation\
    \ and maintenance \nof irrigation systems and payments thereof. David (2003) noted\
    \ that this Act was significant \nbecause it attempted to integrate the planning,\
    \ design, construction and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of irrigation systems\
    \ under one institution. It transferred the operational \ncontrol of irrigation\
    \ facilities from the regional offices of the Bureau of Lands to the Irrigation\
    \ \nDivision. However, he argued that it paved the way for the centralization\
    \ of irrigation \ndevelopment and set in motion a process of viewing irrigation\
    \ development projects mainly \nfrom technical and engineering perspective, with\
    \ focus on physical infrastructure. \nThe Irrigation Division constructed the\
    \ first national irrigation system (NIS) in the \ncountry, the San Miguel River\
    \ Irrigation System in Tarlac Province, with a service area of \n6,000 ha. This\
    \ NIS was inaugurated in 1913. From 1922 to 1930, 11 national irrigation \nsystems\
    \ with a total irrigated area of around 80,000 ha were completed (NIA, 1990).\
    \ While \nthe emphasis was on small canal irrigation systems for rice monocultures,\
    \ 12 medium-sized \nnational irrigation systems with a total service area of 91,000\
    \ ha of rice farms were \nconstructed during the American regime (David, 2003).\
    \ \n10 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nDuring the Commonwealth period, government funds for communal irrigation\
    \ projects \nwere coursed through the legislators. With its evident political\
    \ purpose, these funds were \nusually spread out thinly over many public works\
    \ projects within the legislator's district. This \nresulted in the construction\
    \ of dams across streams with insufficient water supply or on sites \nwhere foundations\
    \ were unstable and, in many instances, unfinished irrigation projects (NIA, \n\
    1990). \nDuring the Japanese regime, only two national irrigation systems with\
    \ total service area \nof about 1,270 ha were constructed (NIA, 1990). Irrigation\
    \ development activity during this \nperiod was minimal as safety and survival\
    \ during the war against the Japanese invasion was \nthe overriding concern of\
    \ the nation. At the end of this period, many irrigation systems were \nin a bad\
    \ state of deterioration and disrepair (David, 2003). \nThe initial efforts on\
    \ irrigation during the early independence (1947–1965) were aimed \nat rehabilitating\
    \ existing systems neglected or damaged during the World War II. Succeeding \n\
    activities increased the total number of NIS to 44 with an aggregate service area\
    \ of 196,650 \nha. Including areas irrigated by other public-funded systems, the\
    \ total irrigated area in the \ncountry at the end of 1957 was about 400,000 ha.\
    \ \nPump irrigation development as government program started during the early\
    \ \nindependence with the establishment of the Irrigation Pump Administration\
    \ (IRPA) under the \nthen Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 1949.\
    \ The task of IRPA included \nthe purchase of pump irrigation equipment and supervision\
    \ of their installation, operation and \nmaintenance (NIA, 1990). In 1952, IRPA\
    \ was reorganized as the Irrigation Service Unit \n(ISU). David (2003) stated\
    \ that the establishment of the ISU was significant in two respects. \nFirst it\
    \ placed under one institution the planning and implementation of certain development\
    \ \nactivities and the delivery of essential irrigation support services and functions.\
    \ Second, it \ngave individual farmers access to an easy-to-operate irrigation\
    \ system and, hence, greater \ncontrol over its O&M. \nPrompted by the need to\
    \ construct more irrigation systems, a bill was signed into law \n(also known\
    \ as Republic Act No. 3601) that created the National Irrigation Administration\
    \ \n(NIA) in 1963. The implementation of this Act was made effective in 1964.\
    \ All functions, \nassets and liabilities of the abolished Bureau of Public Works\
    \ Irrigation Division were \nabsorbed by NIA. The Irrigation Unit of the Bureau\
    \ of Lands and the Friars Lands Irrigation \nBackground and objectives \n11 \n\
    \ \n \nSystems were also transferred to NIA. The NIA has become a public corporation\
    \ primarily \nresponsible for the irrigation development. In 1964, the country\
    \ had 79 NIS, 771 communal \nirrigation systems and 2,540 pump irrigation systems\
    \ with a total service area of 541,000 ha. \nAt the latter part of the period\
    \ of early independence, the focus of irrigation \ndevelopment shifted towards\
    \ large-scale multipurpose development projects (David, 2003). \nAmong the first\
    \ of these was the Upper Pampanga River Irrigation System (UPRIS), whose \nplanning\
    \ and feasibility study was undertaken by the United States Bureau of Reclamation\
    \ \n(USBR) in pursuant to the National Economic Council and the United States\
    \ Agency for \nInternational Development (NEC-USAID) agreement in 1962 to establish\
    \ a planning program \nfor the water resources development in seven major river\
    \ basins in the country. \nA rapid expansion of rice area with irrigation facilities\
    \ occurred between 1966 and \n1988. After the UPRIS feasibility study in 1966,\
    \ the USBR also submitted a feasibility report \nfor proposed projects on other\
    \ six major river basins between November 1966 and January \n1967. Construction\
    \ of new irrigation facilities was vigorously carried out with the launch of a\
    \ \n10-year accelerated irrigation development program in 1974 (NIA, 1990). The\
    \ irrigation \nservice area increased from about 0.74 million ha in 1972 to about\
    \ 1.4 million ha in 1985, \nalmost 94%. In irrigation development more emphasis\
    \ was put on medium- and large-scale \ncanal irrigation systems. It was heavily\
    \ subsidized by the government. \nDuring this period of rapid expansion in irrigation,\
    \ other government agencies became \ninvolved in irrigation development: the Farm\
    \ Systems Development Corporation (FSDC) and \nthe Bureau of Soil and Water Management\
    \ (BSWM). The former was mandated to develop \nsmall (less than 1,000 ha) low-lift\
    \ pump irrigation schemes while the latter started developing \nsmall water impounding\
    \ irrigation systems. Before the end of the period, FSDC was abolished \nand NIA\
    \ stopped its pump dispersal program. \nIn the late 1980s, performances of irrigation\
    \ systems way below expectations during the \nplanning stage hinted that not all\
    \ was well in irrigation development in the country. David \n(2003) pointed that\
    \ the policy bias towards large canal irrigation infrastructure was not \nconducive\
    \ to private sector participation in irrigation development and judicious choice\
    \ of \nmore suitable and efficient irrigation technologies by farmers. The public\
    \ investment per unit \nirrigation service area for large canal irrigation systems\
    \ has steadily increased while some 30–\n50% of the service area was not being\
    \ irrigated and physical infrastructures were rapidly \n12 \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \ndeteriorating\
    \ despite of rehabilitation efforts. \nThe policy of continuing to invest in the\
    \ development of new and rehabilitation of \nmedium to large-scale canal irrigation\
    \ systems has increasingly been questioned in the light of \nsustainability issues\
    \ and attractiveness of other modes of irrigation. A rationalization of \nirrigation\
    \ development has started in the late 1980s and has resulted in: (1) the transfer\
    \ of NIA \nto the Department of Agriculture; (2) the search for more-cost effective,\
    \ efficient and \nsustainable irrigation technologies; and (3) policy reforms\
    \ and institutional changes to \npromote such technologies (David, 2003). The\
    \ transfer of NIA to the Department of \nAgriculture was deemed as an appropriate\
    \ step to have a better coordination of irrigation \ndevelopment activities with\
    \ the delivery of essential irrigated agriculture support services. \nSimilarly,\
    \ the launching in 1992 by the Department of Agriculture of a shallow tubewell\
    \ \n(STW) irrigation project was viewed as a big step towards increasing farmers’\
    \ participation in \nirrigation development and their control over irrigation\
    \ facilities and gradually removing \nirrigation subsidy. Shallow tubewells have\
    \ become popular with farmers as they can exercise \ngreater degree of control\
    \ over water and their cropping system. In the late 1990s, the shallow \ntubewells\
    \ have increased at a rate of over 10%. Over 90% of all existing shallow tubewells\
    \ \nwere installed purely through the initiatives of the private sector. \nIn\
    \ the late 1990s, the modernisation of the agriculture sector was accorded top\
    \ priority \nby the government in an effort to provide enduring solutions to the\
    \ twin problem of food \ninsecurity and rural poverty. The primary instrument\
    \ for doing this was to expand the \nirrigation base in an efficient and cost-effective\
    \ manner. The Philippine Congress passed the \nAgriculture and Fisheries Modernisation\
    \ Act (AFMA) in 1997. The AFMA stipulated an \nagenda for action to rationalize\
    \ irrigation development in the country. The agenda called for \ndevelopment of\
    \ additional irrigation command areas; effective and efficient rehabilitation,\
    \ \noperation and maintenance of existing irrigation systems; and enhanced institutional\
    \ capacity \nfor the effective and timely delivery of essential irrigated agricultural\
    \ services and functions \nguided by sound policies and programs. These policies\
    \ and programs emphasize expenditure \nswitching for cost-effectiveness and improved\
    \ performance of irrigation systems, expanding \nthe technology base for rectifying\
    \ design shortcomings, improving the operation and \nmaintenance of irrigation\
    \ systems and increasing the productivity of irrigation water, \ninstitutional\
    \ reforms and strengthening; genuine devolution of activities, services and \n\
    Background and objectives \n13 \n \n \nfunctions to local government units and\
    \ the private sector, and a system of accountability in \nthe expenditures of\
    \ public funds for irrigation. Section 28 of the Act stipulates the selection\
    \ of \nappropriate irrigation schemes for development or rehabilitation shall\
    \ be based on the \nfollowing criteria: (1) technical feasibility; (2) cost-effectiveness;\
    \ (3) affordability or low \ninvestment cost per unit area; (4) sustainability\
    \ and simplicity of operation; (5) O&M cost \nrecovery; (6) efficiency in water\
    \ use; (7) length of gestation period; and (8) potential for \nincreasing unit\
    \ area productivity. David (2006; 2009) emphasized that these criteria are not\
    \ \nmutually exclusive and that the first four are the minimum criteria, hence,\
    \ must all be met. \nIn recent years, rehabilitation has also been viewed as a\
    \ requisite to a successful transfer \nof the Government-managed national irrigation\
    \ systems (NIS) to irrigators associations (IA). \nWith the rehabilitated physical\
    \ structures, it is expected that the IAs would be willing and able \nto take\
    \ over the operation, maintenance and management of the NIS. Individual experts\
    \ within \nthe NIA have recognized the mediocre impact of past rehabilitation\
    \ efforts and advocated a \nmodernisation-based \nirrigation \nrehabilitation\
    \ \nreform. \nModernisation-based \nirrigation \nrehabilitation is aimed at improving\
    \ diversion and conveyance capacities, water control and \nallocation, and water\
    \ adequacy and productivity of irrigation systems. It is envisioned to \ntransfer\
    \ the function of water distribution from irrigation stewards to irrigation structures.\
    \ \n \n2.2.2 \nPresent level of irrigation development \n \nThe NIA (2014) estimated\
    \ the total irrigable area of the country to be about 3 million ha. \nAbout 1.78\
    \ million ha or 57% of this irrigable area are provided with irrigation facilities\
    \ \n(Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1). Of these areas equipped with irrigation structures,\
    \ 46, 43 and 11% \nare service areas of national irrigation systems (NIS), communal\
    \ irrigation systems (CIS) and \nprivate irrigation systems, respectively. By\
    \ end of 2014, the area under irrigation totalled 1.71 \nmillion ha (Table 2.2).\
    \ The reduction in the total service area accounted for the service areas \nconverted\
    \ to non-agricultural use and non-restorable areas that were previously developed\
    \ for \nirrigation. \nNIS are publicly funded and government-owned systems. They\
    \ can be co-managed with \nwater users associations that have signed a contract\
    \ for irrigation management transfer (IMT). \nCIS are owned and operated by group\
    \ of farmers while private irrigation systems are mostly \n14 \nModernisation\

    \ small pump irrigation. As of December 2014, there are 245 NIS and \n10,651 CIS\
    \ as well as 2,485 water users associations that have entered into IMT contracts.\

    Other irrigation related issues \n \nDavid (2003) presented a number of issues\
    \ and constraints to sustainable irrigation \ndevelopment in the country, which\
    \ included, among others, the absence of significant \nirrigation research and\
    \ development (R&D) efforts and the fragmentation of irrigation \ndevelopment\
    \ activities. There were little useful R&D outputs for the formulation of irrigation\
    \ \ndevelopment plans and programs, establishment of design criteria and development\
    \ of \nBackground and objectives \n17 \n \n \nappropriate irrigation technologies.\
    \ He pointed out the need for a comprehensive water \nresources policy framework\
    \ that will take into consideration the competing, multiple uses of \nwater and\
    \ lend coherence to existing laws, policy guidelines and regulations on water\
    \ rights, \nwater pricing and water control. He stated a number of requisites\
    \ for a national water \ncommission that should be established for the task of\
    \ developing such water resources policy \nframework. The National Economic Development\
    \ Authority (NEDA) (2012) reaffirmed the \nneed to address institutional fragmentation\
    \ and lack of leadership in the water sector, dearth of \nreliable data, absence\
    \ of scientific decision support systems and inadequate provisions of \nwater-related\
    \ infrastructures. The Government is working for the creation of an apex, central\
    \ \nagency that will govern the development and management of the country's water\
    \ resources. \nIrrigation is next to domestic and municipal uses in the priority\
    \ appropriation pursuant \nto the provisions of the Water Code of the Philippines.\
    \ With increasing water demands for \ndomestic, municipal, industrial, power generation\
    \ and other uses, the irrigation sector faces \nuncertainty in meeting its water\
    \ needs, especially during periods of prolonged dry seasons.  \nAraral (2005)\
    \ argued that the problem of poor performances of irrigation systems in the \n\
    Philippines is linked to inherent problems in incentive structure of a public\
    \ bureaucracy like \nthe NIA. The incentive problems include the valuation of\
    \ agency performance and outputs, \nlimited competition and employment rules and\
    \ inflexibility of civil service system. In the case \nof the NIA, these are manifested\
    \ in an oversized and less efficient bureaucracy, the promotion \nof farmers'\
    \ participation with patronage and a tendency to build-neglect-build irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. Araral (2005) opined that these incentive problems were firmly established\
    \ by the \npath-dependent irrigation development and reinforced by moral hazard\
    \ and fungible nature of \nirrigation aid. He further argued that the combination\
    \ of inherent bureaucratic incentives and \neasy access to foreign aids have not\
    \ encouraged the NIA to vigorously undergo essential \ngovernance reforms. \n\
    The landmark legislative effort to modernize the country's irrigated agriculture\
    \ has lost \nmomentum with the non-implementation of AFMA. AFMA was not implemented\
    \ mainly \nbecause of the lack of budget allocations to carry out its programs\
    \ (Dy et al., 2006). \nConsequently, its objectives are yet to be achieved and\
    \ hardly made a dent in addressing the \nissues in irrigation development and\
    \ arresting further deterioration of irrigation systems in the \ncountry (David,\
    \ 2008, 2009). \n18  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \nThe implementation of the NIA Rationalization Plan\
    \ reduced the number of regular staff \nby 40%, with more than 2,100 senior field\
    \ personnel, voluntary or otherwise, availing offers \nof early retirement (NIA,\
    \ 2012). A number of individual experts opined that such reduction in \ntechnical\
    \ field personnel would negatively impact on the technical capacity of the NIA\
    \ to \ncarry out its irrigation development mandate in the immediate years following\
    \ the \nretrenchment of personnel. When the PhP1 11 billion NIA budget was increased\
    \ by at least \n200% starting 2011, NIA faced the dilemma of increased expected\
    \ physical accomplishments \nin irrigation projects with reduced expertise and\
    \ less experienced technical personnel. \n \n2.3 Description of the research problem\
    \  \n \nThe viability and effectiveness of an irrigation system depend on the\
    \ soundness of the criteria \nused in its design. The design shortcomings of an\
    \ irrigation system manifest themselves in a \nlow ratio of actual areas irrigated\
    \ to the design service area, a faster rate of deterioration of the \nstructures\
    \ as compared to the design economic life and unwieldy problems in operation and\
    \ \nmaintenance of the system (David, 2003).  \nFaulty designs often stem from\
    \ inaccurate or inappropriate design criteria and \nassumptions. Cases of inappropriate\
    \ irrigation design criteria are prevalent in the country \nbecause of the practice\
    \ of generalizing the design criteria or parameters over regions or even \nlarger\
    \ areas.  \nDesign is usually carried out in isolation from systems operation\
    \ and maintenance. \nDesign engineers are not required to test run, in collaboration\
    \ with those who are supposed to \noperate and maintain them, the systems they\
    \ designed. As a result, design mistakes are \nrepeated from system to system\
    \ without being rectified. Hence, there is a compelling need to \nre-evaluate\
    \ the soundness or suitability of the design criteria used in the planning and\
    \ \ndevelopment of gravity irrigation systems and to develop appropriate location-specific\
    \ \nirrigation designs for improved performance of irrigation systems. \nMeanwhile,\
    \ modifications in the river basin (deforestation) and impacts of apparent \n\
    change in weather patterns are projected to further increase the risks to irrigated\
    \ crop \nproduction. Deforestation causes shifting and alteration of hydrographs.\
    \ Dry season flows of \n                                                 \n1 PhP\
    \ = Philippine Peso (1 PhP = 0.022 US$, price level 2015) \nBackground and objectives\
    \ \n19 \n \n \nmany rivers continue to decrease. More pronounced dry seasons,\
    \ stronger typhoons, and \nbigger-magnitude, short-duration floods are being observed\
    \ more frequently than usual. \nShifting the bulk of food and agricultural production\
    \ to the typhoon-free season (dry season) \nby insuring water supply and improving\
    \ on-farm water control and management through \nimproved system design is one\
    \ pragmatic approach of sustaining agricultural growth and \nadapting to apparent\
    \ change in weather patterns. Ensuring irrigation water supply during the \ndry\
    \ season in areas presently served by canal irrigation systems would require additional\
    \ \nsources of irrigation water. Groundwater provides storage of water which can\
    \ be tapped for \nsupplemental irrigation. However, it has not been considered\
    \ in the conventional designs of \nmost canal irrigation systems. Since most of\
    \ the irrigation service areas of existing irrigation \nsystems are underlain\
    \ by shallow aquifers, groundwater utilization for supplemental irrigation \n\
    would make a relevant design criterion in the development of modernisation measures\
    \ for \nexisting canal irrigation systems. \nPrivate groundwater irrigation has\
    \ become popular among farmers mainly because it \ngives higher reliability of\
    \ water supply as the source is just in the vicinity of the farms and \ngreater\
    \ farmer's control in planning their cropping and irrigation strategies. It emphasizes\
    \ the \npossibility of decoupling canal operation, especially for higher level\
    \ canals, and irrigation at \nthe farm level, especially the downstream farms.\
    \ Such possibility may open opportunities to \nsimplify operational procedures\
    \ and present options for changes in flow control structures \nalong higher level\
    \ canals (Ertsen, 2009). Therefore, ways to best integrate the concept of \nconjunctive\
    \ use of groundwater and surface water in the design of service-oriented irrigation\
    \ \nsystems have to be explored. \nIn recent years, modernisation has been viewed\
    \ as a process of technical and managerial \nupgrading to improve irrigation service\
    \ to farmers. This becoming widely accepted definition \nof modernisation distinguishes\
    \ it from the conventional rehabilitation, which simply restore \nthe physical\
    \ design of the original system (Plusquellec, 2002). The Food and Agriculture\
    \ \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) put emphasis on modernisation as\
    \ a process of \nimproving the ability of the irrigation system to serve the current\
    \ demands of farmers as well \nas to provide flexibility to respond to future\
    \ needs with the best use of the available resources \nand technologies (Renault\
    \ et al., 2007). This service-oriented approach to system \nimprovement and management\
    \ is also espoused by many experts (Plusquellec, 2002; \n20  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nClemmens, 2006;\
    \ Malano and Hofwegen, 2006; Molden et al., 2007; Renault et al., 2007; \nErsten,\
    \ 2009). \nIt is apparent that interventions that would substantially improve\
    \ irrigation system \nperformance go beyond the current rehabilitation approach.\
    \ They will have to address design \nshortcomings and changes in water supply\
    \ and irrigation demands as well as take stock of the \nresources and potentials\
    \ of an irrigation system. Given the multi-faceted nature of irrigation, \ncrafting\
    \ a service-oriented irrigation modernisation plan is arguably a difficult task.\
    \ However, \nthe need to pursue irrigation improvement in a more efficient and\
    \ cost-effective way has been \ncompelling. Consequently, a strategy for appropriate\
    \ modernisation plan has to be formulated. \nBased on current general knowledge\
    \ in irrigation and existing research tools, this study \nhas conceptualized a\
    \ strategy on formulating a modernisation plan for canal irrigation systems \n\
    in the Philippines. Elements of the modernisation strategy specifically investigated\
    \ are: (1) \ncoherence of design, operation and water supply; (2)validity of design\
    \ assumptions on \npercolation and water supply; (3) water management in the context\
    \ of changing hydrological \nregime; and (4) the use of groundwater in conjunction\
    \ with surface water in part of service \nareas experiencing water shortages.\
    \ The approach to developing a modernisation plan has \nbeen tested in two national\
    \ irrigation systems, namely: Balanac River Irrigation System and \nSta Maria\
    \ River Irrigation System. \n \n2.4 Research questions \n \nThe following specific\
    \ research questions will be answered by the research: \n• \nwhat is the nature\
    \ of rehabilitation methods or modernisation approaches being \nfollowed for large-scale\
    \ canal irrigation systems?  \n• \nwhat is the level of consistency among design\
    \ philosophy, operational objectives, \ndistribution network and flow control\
    \ structures and operational reality to meet the \npreset water delivery targets?\
    \  \n• \nhow do assumptions on water balance parameters differ from location-specific\
    \ data?  \n• \nto what extent are the estimates of water demand and irrigation\
    \ supply based on the \nassumed water balance parameters influence the ratio of\
    \ actual area irrigated to the \ndesign service area? \nBackground and objectives\
    \ \n21 \n \n \n• \nhow much area can be irrigated with the given water supply\
    \ and existing and preferred \ncropping patterns? \n• \nwhat potentials do exist\
    \ in various NIS for supplementing their surface water supply \nwith groundwater\
    \ from confined shallow aquifers? \n• \nwhat are options of using water from these\
    \ aquifers in conjunction with the NIS surface \nirrigation (that is, where, when,\
    \ how shallow tubewell irrigation be used conjunctively)? \n• \nwhat design guidelines\
    \ can be adopted in modernizing NIS amenable to conjunctive \nwater use strategy?\
    \ \n \n2.5 Research hypothesis  \n \nDespite the Philippine government’s massive\
    \ investment in rehabilitation and advocacy on \nparticipatory irrigation management,\
    \ the performance of publicly funded large-scale, agency-\nmanaged canal irrigation\
    \ systems continues to be mediocre. Rehabilitation approaches are \nfocused on\
    \ restoring and improving the original physical structure and are not adequately\
    \ \naddressing the root causes of the low performance of irrigation systems, which\
    \ are: design \nphilosophy and design criteria based on unrealistic assumptions\
    \ on water balance parameters; \nflawed conceptualization of canal hydraulics;\
    \ and ensuing choices of irrigation technologies \nthat are in conflict with operational\
    \ reality. The hypothesis of the study is hence formulated as \nfollows: \nEffective\
    \ modernisation of national irrigation systems (NIS) in the Philippines can be\
    \ \nachieved by rectifying past irrigation design shortcomings and adopting an\
    \ appropriate design \nphilosophy and design criteria, including those for conjunctive\
    \ use of surface water and \ngroundwater. \n \n2.6 Research objectives \n \nThe\
    \ general objective of this research is to identify technically feasible and hydrologically\
    \ \nsound modernisation options for existing government-owned national irrigation\
    \ systems (NIS) \nin the Philippines. The specific objectives of the research\
    \ include the following: \n22  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \n• \nto analyse the nature of previous rehabilitation\
    \ or modernisation efforts and their \nimpacts in terms of closing the gap between\
    \ the actual area irrigated and the design and \nfirmed-up service areas; \n•\
    \ \nto assess the efficacy of the physical structure and operations of irrigation\
    \ systems to \ndeliver the design rate, duration and frequency of irrigation water\
    \ or a modified \nirrigation water demand at the offtakes of secondary canals;\
    \ \n• \nto assess the validity of design values for dependable water supply, crop\
    \ water \nrequirement, seepage and percolation; \n• \nto identify modernisation\
    \ options for the irrigated NIS service areas; \n• \nto investigate the potentials\
    \ of shallow tubewell irrigation in the part of NIS service \nareas that cannot\
    \ be fully irrigated with surface water as designed; \n• \nto identify possible\
    \ options of integrating conjunctive use of groundwater and surface \nwater in\
    \ the formulation of modernisation plans for NIS. \n \n2.7 General research methodology\
    \ \n \nA number of guidelines for modernisation of NIS were proposed, namely:\
    \ reduction in the \nservice area of a NIS to be modernized down to realistic\
    \ levels and irrigating the parts of \nservice area that are usually short of\
    \ water by a more efficient alternative mode of irrigation; \nfull O&M cost recovery\
    \ of the modernized system; greater degree of farmers’ control over \nirrigation\
    \ water; validation and improvement of the design philosophy and criteria; and\
    \ \nrectification of design shortcomings prior to modernisation (David, 2003;\
    \ 2008). This \nresearch builds on these guidelines and is aimed at developing\
    \ a strategy for technically and \nhydrologically sound modernisation of NIS.\
    \ It has used the rapid appraisal survey (RAP), \nMapping System and Services\
    \ for Canal Operation Techniques (MASSCOTE) approach, \nsystem design and improvement\
    \ analyses and field measurements of design values as research \ntools: \nThe\

    \ SYSTEMS OF THE CASE STUDY \n \n3.1 Brief hydro-geographic description and general\
    \ climatic conditions \n \nThe Philippines is located between 116° 40̍ and 126°\
    \ 34̍ E and 4° 40̍ and 21° 10̍ N and is \nbordered by the Philippine Sea to the\
    \ East, the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) to the \nWest and by the Celebes\
    \ Sea to the South (Figure 3.1). It is an archipelago consisting of about \n7,107\
    \ islands with a total land area of approximately 300,000 km2. Its coastline stretches\
    \ up to \n36,289 km and is the fifth longest in the world. \n \n \nFigure 3.1.\
    \ Location map of the Philippines (snipped from Google map) \n \nThe country is\
    \ situated on the western fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Most of its \n\
    mountainous islands are of volcanic origin and covered by rainforests. The highest\
    \ mountain \n(Mt Apo) measures up to 2,954 m+MSL (mean sea level), while the deepest\
    \ point in the \ncountry (Galathea Depth in the Philippine Trench) is third deepest\
    \ in the world. \nThe Philippine has a tropical and maritime climate, which is\
    \ characterized by relatively \nhigh humidity, high temperature and abundant rainfall.\
    \ The country's weather and climate are \ngreatly influenced by temperature, humidity\
    \ and rainfall. \n26  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \nRainfall is the most important climatic element in\
    \ the country. The rainfall distribution \nvaries throughout the archipelago depending\
    \ on the direction of winds and presence of \nmountain ranges. The mean annual\
    \ rainfall ranges from 965 to 4,084 mm. Based on the \ndistribution of rainfall,\
    \ areas in the country are classified under four climate types (Figure 3.2) \n\
    which are described as follows: \n• \nType 1: There are two pronounced seasons,\
    \ dry from November to April and wet for the \nrest of the year. Maximum dry period\
    \ is from June to September. \n• \nType 2: There is no dry season with a very\
    \ pronounced maximum rain period from \nDecember to February. There is not a single\
    \ dry month. Minimum rainfall occurs during \nMarch to May. \n• \nType 3: There\
    \ is no very pronounced maximum rain period with dry season lasting only \nfrom\
    \ one to three months, either during December to February or during March to May.\
    \ \nThis type resembles type 1 since it has a short dry season. \n• \nType 4:\
    \ Rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. This type \n\
    resembles type 2 since it has no dry season. \n \nThe mean annual temperature\
    \ based on the average of all but one (Baguio) weather \nstations in the country\
    \ is 26.6 °C. The coolest month is January and the warmest month is \nMay with\
    \ mean temperatures of 25.5 °C and 28.3 °C, respectively. Altitude is the more\
    \ \nsignificant factor in the variation of temperature than latitude and longitude.\
    \ The mean annual \ntemperatures of the northernmost station and southernmost\
    \ station in the country do not vary \nsignificantly. Meanwhile the mean annual\
    \ temperature of Baguio at an elevation of 1,500 \nm+MSL is 18.3 °C. \nThe Philippines\
    \ has a high relative humidity owing its high temperature and \nsurrounding bodies\
    \ of water. The average monthly relative humidity ranges from 71% in \nMarch to\
    \ 85% in September. Temperature and humidity reach their maximum levels during\
    \ \nMarch to May, giving rise to high sensible temperature throughout the archipelago.\
    \ \nThe climate of the country is defined by rainfall and temperature and has\
    \ two major \nseasons: the rainy season from June to November and the dry season\
    \ from December to May. \nThe latter is subdivided into the cool dry season from\
    \ December to February and the hot dry \nseason from March to May. \nDescription\
    \ of Philippines and irrigation systems of the case study \n27 \n \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 3.2. Climate map of the Philippines based on Corona's classification (adopted\
    \ from \nPhilippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\
    \ (PAGASA) \nhttp://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/index.php/climate-of-the-philippines)\
    \ \n \nTyphoons and El Niño are the two major weather disturbances in the Philippines.\
    \ The \ncountry is at high risk of typhoons or intense tropical cyclones as it\
    \ is situated in the busiest \ntyphoon belt of the world - Western North Pacific,\
    \ where the highest percentage (30%) of \ntyphoons is formed. The combination\
    \ of factors that favours the formation of most of the \ntyphoons in the Philippines\
    \ Sea and West Pacific Ocean include the following: (1) warm sea \nsurface temperature\
    \ (at least 26.5 °C with a depth of 50 m (150 ft)) and high humidity; (2) \npresence\
    \ of intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ); (3) existence of low pressure areas\
    \ within \nthe ITCZ; and (4) light winds (less than 36 km/hr (23 mph)) in the\
    \ upper atmosphere (6,000-\n15,000 m+MSL (20-50,000 ft+MSL)). \nOn the average,\
    \ about 18 tropical cyclones per year enter the Philippine area of \nresponsibility\
    \ (Figure 3.3). Tropical cyclones are classified in the country according to their\
    \ \nmaximum sustained wind as follows: \n28  \nModernisation strategy for the\
    \ national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \n• \nTropical depression:\
    \ with maximum sustained winds of up to 61 kph; \n• \nTropical storm: with maximum\
    \ sustained wind speed of 62 to 88 kph; \n• \nSevere tropical storm: with maximum\
    \ sustained wind speed of 89 to 117 kph; \n• \nTyphoon: with maximum sustained\
    \ wind speed of 118 to 220 kph; \n• \nSuper typhoon: with wind maximum sustained\
    \ wind speed exceeding 220 kph. \n \n \nFigure 3.3.Frequency of tropical cyclones\
    \ occurrence in the Philippines (data source: \nPhilippine Statistics Authority\
    \ (PSA, 2014)) \n \nThe country is also prone to El Niño, the periodic, above-average\
    \ warming of sea \nsurface temperatures (SST) in the central and eastern tropical\
    \ Pacific Ocean. The effect of an \nEl Niño event in the country is usually a\
    \ prolonged period of subnormal rainfall, which is \naccompanied by variations\
    \ on distribution patterns of runoff, other hydrologic sub-processes \nand tropical\
    \ cyclones. The effect of El Niño on rainfall and tropical cyclones depends on\
    \ its \nintensity, area of coverage, duration and time of occurrence (De los Reyes\
    \ and David, 2006). \nStrong El Niño events reduced monthly rainfalls by more\
    \ than 50% during their peak period \nand suppressed tropical cyclone activity.\
    \ Weak-to-moderate El Niño events did not reduce the \noccurrence of tropical\
    \ cyclones, but shifted their tracks northeast. \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n\

    \ Philippine economy is the 39th largest in the world (International Monetary\
    \ Fund (IMF), \n2014) and is one of the emerging markets. Its annual growth rates\
    \ for the period 2010-2015 \naveraged 6.2% (Figure 3.4). It was driven by the\
    \ services and industry sectors (Figure 3.5). \nMeanwhile, the agricultural sector\
    \ had registered either contraction or minimal gain. The \ntransport, storage\
    \ and communication (TSC); trade; real estate, renting and business activities\
    \ \nsubsectors were major contributors to the growth of the services sector. Communication\
    \ \ncontributed robustly to the growth of TSC. The country has become the world’s\
    \ largest centre \nfor business process outsourcing since recent years. Manufacturing\
    \ and construction were the \nbiggest contributors to the growth of the industry\
    \ sector. The growth of agriculture for 2015 \nwas pulled down by poor performance\
    \ of rice, fisheries, corn, sugarcane and rubber. \n \n \nFigure 3.4. Growth rates\
    \ of gross domestic product (data source: PSA, various years) \n \nThough the\
    \ agricultural sector accounted for only about 10% of the gross domestic \nproduct\
    \ (GDP) (Figure 3.6), it remains large as it employed about 30% of the total labour\
    \ \nforce in the country (Figure 3.7). These figures would indicate low productivity\
    \ in agriculture, \nthat is, 30% of the labour force had to share in only 10%\
    \ of the GDP.  \n7.6\n3.6\n6.8\n7.1\n6.1\n5.8\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n2010\n2011\n\

    \ Bank (ADB), 2009; Ravago and \nBalisacan, 2015). Poverty in the country is both\
    \ a rural and agricultural phenomenon. About \n75% of the poor are in rural areas\
    \ and about two-thirds are in the agriculture sector (Table \n3.1). The highest\

    \ The country experienced an annual \naverage of 201 natural disasters during\
    \ the 2003-2013 period (PSA, 2014). The number of \noccurrence ranged from 66\
    \ events in 2005 to 374 events in 2011. Almost 94% (PhP 288 \nbillion) of the\
    \ economic losses were attributable to the direct and indirect effects of \nmeteorological\
    \ disasters, which were associated with tropical cyclones, tornados, continuous\
    \ \nheavy rains, big waves, Southwest monsoon and cold front, among others (Figure\
    \ 3.8). \nDestructive tropical cyclones caused the most economic damage costing\
    \ PhP 278 billion or \nabout 90% of the total economic losses during the 11-year\
    \ period. In contrast, only about 4% \nand 2% of the economic losses were due\
    \ to climatological and hydrological disasters. \nClimatological disasters were\
    \ mainly El Niño-induced drought, while hydrological include \nflash floods or\

    Water management \n \nSta. Maria RIS is a gated system. Water diverted into the\
    \ scheme is monitored by the water \nusers association of Sta. Maria RIS at the\
    \ flumes immediate downstream of the main intakes. \nThe flow into the scheme\
    \ is controlled by adjusting the main intake structures. The main \nintake structures\
    \ of are spindle-type vertical gates, which are fully closed when irrigation \n\
    water is not needed, especially during periods of continuous, heavy rainfall or\
    \ expected \nfloods. The sluice gate of Sta. Maria Dam remains fully closed and\
    \ not-operational while the \nslab-type sluice gate of Mata Dam is seldom adjusted\
    \ and is closed most of the time. \nThe service area is divided into 28 turn out\
    \ service areas or management units. The flow \ncontrol structures at main distribution\
    \ points are a combination of spindle-gated pipe culvert \nofftakes and adjustable\
    \ vertical gates as cross-regulators. Constant head orifice structures \n(CHO)\
    \ are also used as turn outs. There are direct offtakes, mostly ungated culverts,\
    \ along the \nmain canals and lateral canals. \n \n48  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nSta. Maria RIS\
    \ was under a dual system management by the NIA and the Sta. Maria \nRIS waters\
    \ users association (SANTAMASI) during the 1990s. Full system operation and \n\
    management was transferred to the water users association with the signing of\
    \ an irrigation \nmanagement transfer (IMT) contract between the NIA and SANTAMASI\
    \ in 2000. Like \nBalanac RIS, Sta. Maria RIS is under IMT stage 3.  \nThere are\
    \ two distinct cropping seasons being followed: the wet season during May-\nOctober\
    \ and the dry season from November to April. Segmental cropping and water delivery\
    \ \nschedules are practised in Sta. Maria RIS. The cropping schedules for each\
    \ irrigation zone \nfollows a system-wide water distribution plan agreed upon\
    \ by the system officials and water \nusers. Rotation of water delivery is by\
    \ lateral. \n \nSocio-economic of the service area \n \nSta. Maria and Mabitac\
    \ towns are classified as fourth and fifth-class municipalities, \nrespectively\

    \ AND CONCEPTS ON DESIGN AND \nPERFORMANCE OF IRRIGATION SYSTEMS \n \n4.1 Historical\
    \ perspective on the causes of and solutions to poor irrigation \nperformance\
    \  \n \nOver the years, the poor performance of many gravity irrigation systems\
    \ has been attributed to \nshortcomings in either the design and technology, management\
    \ and institutional setup, policy \nor a combination of these factors. Historical\
    \ perspective on irrigation development from \ncolonial times and turns of related\
    \ events that led to problems besetting irrigation \ndevelopment in most developing\
    \ countries today has been discussed by Horst (1998) and \nErtsen (2009). Colonial\
    \ irrigation design and management practices and ensuing irrigation \ntechnologies,\
    \ which were developed to be consistent with the physical and socioeconomic \n\
    settings and in balance with the management capability of their times, have been\
    \ continuously \nadopted in most of the former colonies after World War II. Rehabilitation\
    \ of most irrigation \nsystems has been merely restoring the original hydraulic\
    \ design. Meanwhile, foreign \ntechnologies have been re-introduced in newer large-scale\
    \ irrigation systems by project \nconsultants trained on colonial approaches (“schools”)\
    \ of irrigation development. However, \nmany of such technologies have been incompatible\
    \ with circumstances for irrigation \ndevelopment in post-colonial times. In most\
    \ cases, local irrigation agencies have to work with \nlimited funds, insufficient\
    \ staff in terms of number and skills and fewer options for strict \ncontrol of\
    \ the irrigation systems. Project planning, design and construction have been\
    \ isolated \nfrom system operation and maintenance. Further, management capacity\
    \ has not been \nsuccessfully made to balance with the fast expansion of irrigated\
    \ areas and is made more \ninsufficient with the growing complexity of system\
    \ operations.  \nA number of authors (Horst, 1998; Plusquellec, 2002; Ertsen,\
    \ 2009) summarized the \nsolutions that had been taken to address these problems.\
    \ Irrigation systems built in a number \nof countries during the 1960s consisted\
    \ only of facilities from the water source to secondary \ncanals. The wastage\
    \ of water below the farm outlets was viewed as the primary reason for the \n\
    poor performance of gravity irrigation systems. In the 1970s, the common responses\
    \ included \n \n52  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \ntertiary unit development (increasing the density\
    \ of canal systems including introduction of \nmodern water application methods\
    \ and precise land levelling), technical training of farmers, \noperators and\
    \ extension workers; creation of water users groups at the level of tertiary canals\
    \ \nand refining of flow measuring techniques. However, these conventional engineering\
    \ \nsolutions failed to push the performance of irrigation to expected levels.\
    \ In the 1980s, the \nfocus of efforts to improve the performances of irrigation\
    \ shifted to the management and \ninstitutional aspects. To date, the results\
    \ left much to be desired. \nSeveral authors (Rice, 1997; David, 1997; Horst,\
    \ 1998; Plusquellec, 2002; David, 2003) \nargued that over-optimistic assumptions\
    \ in the planning stage and faulty and unrealistic \ndesigns were the main causes\
    \ of the poor performance of gravity irrigation systems. The \nresults of the\
    \ 1996 and 1997 studies of the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) of the \n\
    World Bank on six gravity irrigation systems in Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam\
    \ agreed with \nthis opinion. Findings from this study contradicted the dominant\
    \ paradigm attributing low \neconomic returns of government-operated, gravity-fed\
    \ irrigation schemes to poor O&M and \ninadequate farmer organizations. The study\
    \ concluded that the primary reasons for \nperformance gaps included over-optimism\
    \ about the crop area to be served and project design \nfaults including the choice\
    \ of unsuitable technology. \nThe recognition of poor design as a main reason\
    \ of the poor performance of irrigation \nsystems has been slow. Plusquellec (2002)\
    \ summarized the studies, publications and events \nthat acknowledged directly\
    \ or indirectly the importance of design and technology in the \nperformance of\
    \ irrigation systems. He noted that although such studies, publications and \n\
    events were sponsored by international organizations (World Bank, International\
    \ Water \nManagement Institute (IWMI), International Commission on Irrigation\
    \ and Drainage (ICID) \nand FAO, they remained the initiatives of individual experts\
    \ rather than the result of policy \nadopted by such organizations. Consequently,\
    \ improvement of the performance of irrigation \nprojects through revisioning\
    \ of designs was not given a high priority on the agenda of \ninternational fora\
    \ on water. \nClemmens (2006) deduced that the main reason for the poor performance\
    \ of large-scale \ncanal irrigation systems is that system operation is not tied\
    \ up to the productivity of irrigation \nsystems. He argued that chaos, which\
    \ he defined as anything that causes the process within a \nsystem to be variable\
    \ and difficult to predict, naturally dominates large-scale canal irrigation \n\
    Issues and concepts on design and performance of irrigation systems \n53 \n \n\
    \ \ndistribution systems. The dispersive nature of these irrigation systems, even\
    \ those with \nreasonable infrastructure and management, causes significant variability\
    \ in water supplied and \nwater delivery service, especially at the downstream\
    \ of the delivery system. Shortcomings in \ndesign, maintenance and operation\
    \ make distribution and irrigation water losses worse. He put \nforward that the\
    \ management philosophy of canal irrigation systems should adopt a service \n\
    orientation. His proposed remedy is to improve both the physical and administrative\
    \ controls \nat key intermediate points within the distribution network in accordance\
    \ with such service \nphilosophy of management. The improvement of physical controls\
    \ relates to modernisation of \nirrigation infrastructures, that is, installing\
    \ modern flow control structures needed to isolate \nlower parts of the canal\
    \ network from upstream disturbances and chaos. Administrative \ncontrols include\
    \ among others the establishment of water delivery criteria that are agreed \n\
    upon by the water users and the service providers, a contract stipulating the\
    \ accountability of \nthe service provider and willingness to pay for the service,\
    \ and purposeful corrective actions \nto overcome chaos. \nThe modernisation process\
    \ of irrigation systems is now widely recognized as a strategic \napproach to\
    \ improve water productivity and increase total production and economic returns\
    \ of \nlarge canal irrigation schemes (Burt and Styles, 1999). In the past decade,\
    \ the concept of \nmodernisation has evolved from merely introduction of new physical\
    \ structures and flow \ncontrol devices to a process of technical, managerial\
    \ and institutional transformation of \nirrigation systems with the objective\
    \ of improving resource utilization and water delivery \nservice to farms (Plusquellec\
    \ et al., 1994; Plusquellec, 2002; Playan and Mateos, 2006). \nErtsen (2009) noted\
    \ the wide range of interventions or efforts associated with modernisation, \n\
    from increasing drainage intensity to precise amount and timing of water delivery.\
    \ \nRecently, FAO put emphasis on modernisation as a process of improving the\
    \ ability of \nthe irrigation system to serve the current demands of farmers as\
    \ well as to provide flexibility \nto responds to future needs with the best use\
    \ of the available resources and technologies \n(Renault et al., 2007). Its irrigation\
    \ modernisation programme in at least 30 irrigation systems \nin Asia highlighted\
    \ inadequate attention to canal operation as a major reason for dismal \nperformance\
    \ of canal irrigation systems. The many surveys carried out by FAO disproved the\
    \ \nthen widely taken belief that the issue of underperformance of irrigation\
    \ systems is related to \nsocio-economic factors and not to engineering aspects.\
    \ It showed that substandard canal \n54  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \noperation is very often the origin\
    \ of the vicious cycle of poor irrigation service, poor fee \nrecovery, poor maintenance\
    \ resulting in the deterioration of the physical structures and water \ndelivery\
    \ service (Renault et al., 2007). In connection with this, the FAO presented a\
    \ \nmethodology to assist water engineering professionals, irrigation managers\
    \ and practitioners \nin developing a consistent modernisation plan for medium-\
    \ to large-scale canal irrigation \nsystems. This methodology is called MASSCOTE\
    \ (Mapping System and Services for Canal \nOperation Techniques), a stepwise procedure\
    \ for diagnosing the performance, assessing the \ndifferent system characteristics\
    \ and mapping the way forward in order to improve the \nirrigation service and\
    \ the cost-effectiveness of canal operation. Its focus is on canal operation,\
    \ \nbut the scope is modernisation and the goal is to promote service-oriented\
    \ management of \nirrigation systems (Renault et al., 2007). \nThe merit of service\
    \ orientation of management, performance assessment and design \napproach for\
    \ modernisation of irrigation systems has been pointed by a number of authors.\
    \ \nGood irrigation service provides the environment for productive and sustainable\
    \ agriculture \n(Molden et al., 2007). Service orientation in the management as\
    \ a key element of the strategy \nthat is needed to improve the performance of\
    \ canal irrigation systems is shared by other \nauthors (e.g.: Clemmens, 2006;\
    \ Malano and Hofwegen, 2006; Renault et al., 2007). Ertsen \n(2009) argues that\
    \ farmer interventions, which often reflect a nature of water delivery service\
    \ \ndemanded by farmers, should be taken as standard in irrigation design. A service-oriented\
    \ \napproach implies that design engineers should select the physical elements\
    \ of the system \nwithin a clearly defined operational strategy that will ensure\
    \ delivery of the water service \ndemanded. Service concept has been the basis\
    \ of modern design (Plusquellec, 2002). \nMeanwhile widespread emergence of private\
    \ tubewell irrigation systems, either as a \nsupplemental irrigation or a sole\
    \ source of irrigation water in several Asian countries, has \noccurred since\
    \ the early 1980s (IPTRID, 2003; David, 2003; Turral et al., 2010). The rapid\
    \ \ngrowth of groundwater irrigation in these countries is viewed as a farmers’\
    \ response to low \nlevel of flexibility and reliability of canal irrigation systems\
    \ (Plusquellec, 2002). The \npopularity of private tubewells among farmers is\
    \ mainly attributed to a higher reliability of \ngroundwater supply, higher level\
    \ of farmer’s control over tubewells and greater flexibility in \nplanning their\
    \ cropping pattern (Plusquellec, 2002; David, 2003; IPTRID, 2003; Hussain, \n\
    2007b). However, consequences of overexploitation of groundwater resources, such\
    \ as  \nIssues and concepts on design and performance of irrigation systems \n\
    55 \n \n \nalarming overdraft in groundwater level and decline in water quality,\
    \ have been increasingly \nobserved in many areas. \n \n4.2 Design issues \n \n\
    The common design problems resulting in poor performance of irrigation systems\
    \ were \npointed out by a number of researchers. Meijer (1992) cited three common\
    \ pitfalls in \nirrigation design. These are: \n• \nthe use of too optimistic\
    \ friction factors when applying the Manning formula in small \nunlined canals;\
    \ \n• \nthe unbalanced design procedure that largely “follows the direction of\
    \ the water flow”; \n• \nthe adherence to high water use efficiency.  \n \nThe\
    \ Manning’s equation is expressed as: \n \nݒ=݇ெܴ\nଶ ଷ\nൗ ܵ\nଵ ଶ\nൗ  \n(4.1) \n\
    \ \nwhere v is the flow velocity in m s-1; kM is the flow factor related to the\
    \ canal roughness and is \nalso known as the friction factor 1/n; R is the hydraulic\
    \ radius, or the quotient of water cross-\nsectional area and wetted perimeter\
    \ in m; and S is the energy gradient or the bed slope for \ncanals with normal\
    \ flow. Meijer pointed out that for uniform flow in rough canals, the canal \n\
    roughness or friction factor is not a constant but increases with the depth of\
    \ flow. He opined \nthat the variations in the canal roughness are probably due\
    \ to the simplification of the formula \nby adopting 2/3 as an average exponent\
    \ of the hydraulic radius R when in the derivation of the \nformula the exponent\
    \ was found to vary from 0.65 to 0.84. The canal roughness is also \ndetermined\
    \ by the canal shape and bed slope. The influence of depth of flow, canal shape\
    \ and \nbed slope is more pronounced in rough shallow sections or at small depths\
    \ of flow. Meijer \nconcluded that this simplified Manning formula leads to too\
    \ small dimensions in small \nearthen canals to convey the design flow. He proposed\
    \ the use of a modified Manning \nformula of the form: \n \n56  \nModernisation\
    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nݒ=݇ெݕ\n\
    ଵ ଷ\nൗ ܴ\nଶ ଷ\nൗ ܵ\nଵ ଶ\nൗ  \n(4.2) \n \nwhere y is the flow depth. He suggested\
    \ a kM value that equals 36 (n = 0.028) for well \nmaintained irrigation canals\
    \ with weeds that are cut to 0.05 m and depth of flow not more \nthan 3 m. In\
    \ small open irrigation canals carrying less than about 0.2 m3s-1, a kM value\
    \ of 24 \n(n = 0.042) is recommended. \nThe second technical shortcoming referred\
    \ to by Meijer (1992) is a sequence of the \ndesign process where the irrigable\
    \ area and the alignment of the main canal are considered \nfirst, followed by\
    \ the secondary canals, roads, and drains, and then by the tertiary units. \n\
    Usually the tertiary units or farm blocks were designed last, often long after\
    \ the main and the \nsecondary canals and roads had been constructed. Such design\
    \ succession dates back from the \n1940s when irrigation design mainly concentrated\
    \ on ensuring water supply to groups of \nfarmers already drawing water from less\
    \ reliable sources. Meijer argued that problems with \nsuch a design sequence\
    \ arise after the implementation of the irrigation scheme if during the \ndesign\
    \ the details of the tertiary unit including the layout are not known, or not\
    \ considered. \nFor the third pitfall, Meijer argued that too much adherence to\
    \ high water use efficiency \nper se in the design of irrigation systems can result\
    \ in water distribution schedules that tend to \nbe much too complicated and far\
    \ too rigid for everyday practice. He contended that apart from \ncrop water requirements,\
    \ additional water is needed to facilitate a fair and simple water \ndistribution.\
    \ These so-called additional operation requirements (AOR), management losses or\
    \ \nintentional losses are necessary for simplifying the water distribution and\
    \ system operation. \nMeanwhile, Pluesquellec et al. (1994) pointed out that the\
    \ design and layout of an \nirrigation scheme often fail to consider some basic\
    \ laws of hydraulics, such as lag time, \nunsteady nature of water flow, and fluctuations\
    \ of the water level. All too often the designer \nassumes that the canal will\
    \ operate well with unsteady flow, but in reality the design prohibits \neffective\
    \ operation because it lacks a control strategy, sufficient communications, suitable\
    \ \ngate spacing, or other design errors. One of the most common design errors\
    \ is the use of \nmanually operated undershot gates in cross-regulators where\
    \ almost invariably the function of \nthe structure is to simply maintain a relatively\
    \ steady upstream water level while passing flow \nchanges on to the next reach.\
    \ \n \nIssues and concepts on design and performance of irrigation systems \n\
    57 \n \n \nPluesquellec et al. (1994) traced other design errors to a poor understanding\
    \ of the \ninteractions of a particular hydraulic structure with other structures\
    \ in its vicinity. Three \ncommon problems relate to location and interaction\
    \ of structures. First, many conventional \ncanal designs have too few check structures\
    \ to ensure adequate water-level control at outlets. \nThus, the flow rate through\
    \ the outlets varies with time even though it is supposed to remain \nconstant.\
    \ Second, the difference in head across structures is frequently insufficient.\
    \ Larger \nchanges in elevation will dramatically stabilize the flow rate at standard\
    \ underflow turnouts. \nHowever, drops across farm turnouts recommended in some\
    \ design manuals are insufficient. \nThird, the designs of lower-level (tertiary,\
    \ distributary and watercourse) distribution systems \nare frequently not based\
    \ upon sufficient topographical data, with the result that the supply \nsystem\
    \ may be at a lower elevation than the destination of the water. They opined that\
    \ some \nstructures, which are still found in new irrigation systems, have either\
    \ undesirable hydraulic \neffects or are premised on unrealistic hydraulic assumptions.\
    \ These include Romijn gates, \nvertical sliding gates as check structures, radial\
    \ gates as check structures without side weirs, \nand constant-head orifice offtakes.\
    \ The weir action of Romijn gates creates large fluctuations \nof the flow rate\
    \ in the offtake with minor changes in the water levels of the supply canal. \n\
    Sluice-gated control along the parent canal combined with Romijn-gated offtakes\
    \ and outlets \nis among the unfavourable combinations from hydraulic point of\
    \ view, since it is extremely \nunstable and requires high construction standards,\
    \ accurate calibration, and disciplined \noperation if correct discharges are\
    \ to be maintained. Small deviations have a proportionally \ngreat effect. On\
    \ the other hand, vertical sliding gates are underflow gates, therefore the \n\
    upstream water level tends to fluctuate widely with small adjustments. Radial\
    \ gates as check \nstructures without side weirs should be avoided in manually\
    \ operated systems because they \nare basically underflow weirs with the same\
    \ problematic features as sliding gates. The basic \nhydraulic assumption for\
    \ constant-head orifice offtakes is a stable water level in the supply \ncanal\
    \ or relatively insignificant fluctuation between adjustments. But since this\
    \ assumption is \noften not the case, adjustments on the offtakes must be made.\
    \ Such necessary adjustments \nmake operation relatively complicated. \nFurther,\
    \ Plusquellec et al. (1994) argued that many failures and problems are caused\
    \ by \na design approach that pays insufficient attention to operational procedures.\
    \ The designs of \nmany canal irrigation systems make management of these systems\
    \ difficult in actual field \n58  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nconditions. Instructions for system operations\
    \ are often conflicting and sometimes \nmeaningless. They cited Murray-Rust and\
    \ Snellen (1991) observation of an operation system \nof the Maneungteung Irrigation\
    \ Project in Indonesia that requires bi-weekly assessment of \ndemand for every\
    \ tertiary block and readjustment of every gate in the system to meet the \nchanged\
    \ water distribution plan, thus requiring a very intensive data collection program\
    \ and \nan efficient and effective information management system. Because such\
    \ operational \nprocedure is carried out in an environment of unpredictable water\
    \ availability, it becomes \nalmost impossible to achieve. \nCiting the work of\
    \ other researchers, Plusquellec et al. (1994) mentioned the following \nexamples\
    \ of design problems: \n• \nan actual operation procedure for the Right Main Canal\
    \ of the Kirindi Oya Irrigation \nProject in Sri Lanka would cause a water fluctuation\
    \ of about one metre in the lower \ncanals and take up to four days to reach a\
    \ steady state; \n• \ngate rating tables, which tell operators how much to open\
    \ a cross-regulator for specific \ndischarges, are over-emphasized. They are generally\
    \ inaccurate. For typical cross-\nregulators in a series in a canal, the use of\
    \ gate rating is meaningless. With upstream \ncontrol, the flow rate through the\
    \ structure cannot be controlled by the operator except \nfor a short duration\
    \ because the flow in the canal is determined at the canal inlet. \nInstructions\
    \ for cross-regulators with upstream control should deal with maintaining a \n\
    desired water level, not a desired flow rate; \n• \nmanually operated gates and\
    \ control structures rarely work despite all efforts to improve \nirrigation management\
    \ and the capacity of staff; \n• \nmany extremely simple irrigation systems are\
    \ so rigid that the operational procedures \ncannot be changed when required.\
    \ The design must include sufficient flexibility to \nadjust the operation procedure.\
    \ \n \nPlusquellec et al. (1994) reasoned that failures of some modernized projects\
    \ were due to \nimproper choice of control structures, incompatible components,\
    \ and a design that was not \nbased on realistic operation and maintenance plans.\
    \ These gave a wrong impression that \nmodern design concepts are not suitable\
    \ to emerging or least developed countries. \n \nIssues and concepts on design\
    \ and performance of irrigation systems \n59 \n \n \nIn addition, Plusquellec\
    \ (2002) cited the hierarchy of canals as one specific design issue \nthat is\
    \ neglected during the design of irrigation projects. In many existing schemes\
    \ in South \nAsia, as much as 40% of the irrigable area in some projects is served\
    \ through direct outlets \nfrom the branch distributary and even from the main\
    \ canal. He argued that such canal \narrangement is hardly amenable for the creation\
    \ of multi-tiered users associations which \nwould be useful in the effective\
    \ management of the system, lack of which has also detrimental \neffects on the\
    \ system performance. \nHorst (1998) believed that the problems in irrigation\
    \ are historically determined, finding \ntheir roots in the technology of the\
    \ colonial era and the lack of adaptation to the new socio-\neconomic environment\
    \ of the post-colonial period. During the colonial times, design and \noperation\
    \ resided in one ministry making feedback from operation to planning and design\
    \ \npossible. Consequently, technology developed in balance with the management\
    \ capability. In \nthe post-colonial era, however, design has been carried out\
    \ by foreign consultants while \ngovernment agencies have been responsible for\
    \ operation. Horst argued that this separation of \ndesign and operation has led\
    \ to discrepancies between design assumptions and operational \nrealities. Together\
    \ with shortage of technical personnel and expansion of areas under \nirrigation,\
    \ irrigation in emerging and least developed countries has been haunted for decades\
    \ \nby a multitude of problems such as low performance, low irrigation efficiencies,\
    \ conflicts \namong farmers and between farmers and management and deteriorating\
    \ physical structures. \nSimilarly, Horst concluded that often in the design phase,\
    \ little or no attention was paid \nto operational aspects. Design assumptions\
    \ were limited to agronomic, engineering and \neconomic parameters only, without\
    \ taking into consideration institutional and human aspects. \nThus, the outcome\
    \ of the design was more often incompatible with the socio-institutional \nenvironment.\
    \ Horst specifically identified the design of water division structures at the\
    \ core of \nmany irrigation problems. Owing to their functions, he argued that\
    \ the type and characteristics \nof these structures largely determine the operability\
    \ and manageability of the system and are \nthe points of interface where conflicts\
    \ of interest among farmers and between farmers and \nmanagement often take place.\
    \ He pointed out that not only the design of many water division \nstructures\
    \ was based on incorrect hydraulic supposition but was also devoid of social and\
    \ \ninstitutional criteria, such as staff requirement (in terms of number and\
    \ skills), operability and \nsocial acceptance, among others. Such design shortcomings\
    \ led to hydraulically unstable \n60  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \ncanals that were too cumbersome\
    \ to operate, thus, required extra field staff. Horst discussed \nthe common types\
    \ of water division structures in terms of general hydraulic characteristics \n\
    and operational implications. He concluded that the types of irrigation systems\
    \ with manually \nor mechanically operated water division structures experience\
    \ most serious problems. \nCases of canal irrigation systems with unsound design\
    \ philosophy and design criteria \nwere also observed in the Philippines (Comprehensive\
    \ Irrigation Research and Development \nUmbrella Program, 2007). The results of\
    \ a preliminary study of sample canal irrigation \nsystems in the Province of\
    \ Ilocos Norte showed numerous flawed design parameters (David, \n2009). These\
    \ include lack of head control structures, wrong placements and combinations of\
    \ \nflow control and offtake structures, improper alignment of main farm ditch\
    \ and farm ditches, \nungated offtake structures, direct offtaking of farm ditches\
    \ from main canals, inadequate \nprotection of sluice gates and main intakes from\
    \ siltation and remarkably high service area to \nfarm ditch and turnout ratios.\
    \ Potentials for improvements in hydraulic structures were \nevident. However,\
    \ the most serious design mistake was the gross underestimation of \npercolation\
    \ and seepage during the design stage. There was also an apparent underestimation\
    \ \nof flood flows for one large diversion dam and one impounding dam. These dams\
    \ were \ndesigned for 100-year and 25-year floods, respectively, but were both\
    \ badly damaged by a \ntyphoon whose rainfall totals had an associated chance\
    \ of occurrence of 25% per year. \nUnfortunately, such mistakes were most likely\
    \ repeated in other irrigation systems in the \ncountry for one or combinations\
    \ of the following reasons: \n• \nonly one national agency is involved in implementing\
    \ gravity irrigation projects; \n• \ndesign criteria are generalized over regions\
    \ or larger areas; \n• \nabsence of feedback mechanism between design and operation\
    \ engineers. \n \nAs cited by Plusquellec et al. (1994), similar design mistakes\
    \ were observed by Murray-\nRust and Vermillion (1989) in Indonesian irrigation\
    \ projects. These errors included the \nfollowing: \n• \nover- or under-estimation\
    \ of water availability for irrigation, both during the year and \nvarious seasons;\
    \ \n• \nwrong estimates of field level demand for irrigation due to incorrect\
    \ design assumptions \nof field efficiency, cropped acreage, and cropping pattern;\
    \ \nIssues and concepts on design and performance of irrigation systems \n61 \n\
    \ \n \n• \nincorrect conveyance losses used in sizing and locating unadjustable\
    \ structures \nrendering such structures useless in actual system operation. \n\
    \ \nAccording to Plusquellec (2002), the control of seepage losses is one design\
    \ issue that is \ngenerally neglected during the design of irrigation projects.\
    \ \n \n4.3 Concepts on irrigation design \n \nNoting the traditional design sequence\
    \ of irrigation projects wherein the tertiary units or farm \nblocks are designed\
    \ last, Meijer (1992) recommended a design sequence wherein the so-called \nbottom-up\
    \ and top-down design approaches are employed (Figure 4.1). The sequence of the\
    \ \nfirst two steps is arbitrary and the procedure is repeated several times until\
    \ a satisfactory final \ndesign is achieved. The conclusions arrived at in step\
    \ 3 are used in steps 1 and 2 of the next \nround. The top-down design is mainly\
    \ used when moving from step 2 to step 3 while the \nupward approach is apparent\
    \ between steps 1 and 3. Any inconsistencies between the two \napproaches should\
    \ be solved in step 3. \n \n \nFigure 4.1. Simplified conceptual framework of\

    \ of tertiary units\n62  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nAnkum (2001) pointed out that large-scale\
    \ canal irrigation systems under dual \nmanagement can only be well designed and\
    \ managed when their overall objectives have been \nspecified accurately, together\
    \ with the resulting operational objectives of the main system. He \nrefers to\
    \ the main system as the part of a dual-managed irrigation system that is under\
    \ the \ncontrol of an irrigation agency and usually comprises the headwork and\
    \ all canals and \nappurtenant structures up to the tertiary offtake. The tertiary\
    \ offtake is the structure that \ndiverts water from the main system into tertiary\
    \ units, the part of the irrigation system that is \npresumably under the control\
    \ of a farmers’ group. He emphasized that the design team (e.g.: \nengineers,\
    \ agronomist, economist) and users of the irrigation system (e.g.: irrigation\
    \ agency, \nfarmers) have to jointly agree on the stipulated objectives. Otherwise,\
    \ arguments on whether \nthe irrigation system is performing according to expectation\
    \ will remain. \nHe also made distinctions between the irrigation system’s overall\
    \ objective and the main \nsystem’s operational objectives. Examples of overall\
    \ system objectives include irrigation \nconcepts such as: (1) protective irrigation\
    \ (also called “supply-based” irrigation) wherein the \nlimited water supply is\
    \ distributed over the entire service area for drought or famine relief, \nand\
    \ productive irrigation (also known as “demand-based” irrigation) that focuses\
    \ on the \nsatisfying the irrigation water of the crop for optimum production;\
    \ (2) equitable supply \nwherein irrigation is commonly distributed in proportion\
    \ to the size of the farm, and flexible \nsupply wherein water delivery is based\
    \ on changing demand of crops; (3) the main irrigation \nseason (e.g.: wet or\
    \ dry) the system is designed for. \nAnkum (1997; 1999; 2001) argued that each\
    \ concept may fit well or maybe the only \nlogical match with the other. For example,\
    \ designing for productive irrigation during the dry \nseason is logical only\
    \ when the there is sufficient water available from the water source \nduring\
    \ the dry season to meet the irrigation requirements. Productive irrigation during\
    \ the dry \nseason would mean providing irrigation water optimum for plant growth\
    \ during a cropping \nseason when crop evapotranspiration rates are expected to\
    \ be higher. Such objective would \ntranslate to canals of larger capacities to\
    \ convey larger discharge rates of irrigation water \n(Figure 4.2). During the\
    \ wet season, an irrigation system designed for productive irrigation \nduring\
    \ dry season can be operated for supplemental irrigation. On the other hand, when\
    \ \nrainfall or irrigation supply from a water source is not enough even during\
    \ the wet season or \nmonsoon months, designing for productive irrigation would\
    \ imply a focus on providing \nIssues and concepts on design and performance of\
    \ irrigation systems \n63 \n \n \nsupplementary irrigation during the wet season.\
    \ In this case, medium capacity canals are \nconstructed. \nMeanwhile, the design\
    \ context of protective irrigation is that the supply available at the \nwater\
    \ source is inadequate to meet the irrigation requirements of the cropped area.\
    \ The focus \nof protective irrigation is on distributing the available water\
    \ to as many farmers as possible. \nWith this context, the irrigation system is\
    \ designed for wet season irrigation as designing for \ndry season is not a logical\
    \ option since the latter case would results to higher irrigation water \nrequirements\
    \ that would be impossible to meet due to the given water supply constraints in\
    \ \nthe area. Canals for protective irrigation are usually of small capacity.\
    \ \nEquitable supply is applied in protective irrigation systems where all farmers\
    \ receive \ntheir share of water (Figure 4.3). It may also be applied in productive\
    \ irrigation for a uniform \ncropping pattern. Flexible supply fits well in productive\
    \ irrigation systems with diverse \ncropping patterns. He also opined that reshaping\
    \ an existing protective irrigation system \nserving rice areas into productive\
    \ system would not be feasible without drastically increasing \ncanal capacities\
    \ and water supply availability. \n \n \nFigure 4.2. The determining season of\

    \ and decision-making procedure for an irrigation \nsystem (Ankum, 2001) \n \n\
    Ankum (1997; 2001) defined the operational objectives of the main system in terms\
    \ of \nthree parameters: (1) the decision-making procedure on the water allocation\
    \ to the tertiary \nofftake, i.e., who decides on water allocation to the tertiary;\
    \ (2) the method of water allocation \nto the tertiary unit, i.e., how is that\
    \ water allocated to the tertiary unit; (3) the method of water \ndistribution\
    \ to the (sub)main canals, i.e., how the water is distributed through the main\
    \ \nirrigation system (Figure 4.4). The selection of the operational objectives\
    \ starts with a general \nagreement between the designers and users whether the\
    \ decision-making procedure at the \ntertiary offtake will be based on imposed,\
    \ semi-demand, or on-demand allocation. In imposed \nallocation, also known as\
    \ dictated delivery, the irrigation agency decides while the water users \nhave\
    \ no say on the water allocation to the tertiary unit. In semi-demand allocation,\
    \ also known \nas on-request delivery, the water agency decides on water allocation\
    \ based on advance request \nfrom water users. In the case of on-demand allocation,\
    \ also called on-demand delivery, \nirrigation water is supplied to the tertiary\
    \ unit when water users request for it. \n \n \n \nProtective irrigation \n\"\

    \ that is, the timing of gate settings at the tertiary offtake determine already\
    \ the \ndecision-making procedure to the tertiary offtake. Protective irrigation\

    \ in the Philippines \n \n \nadjustments are possible at any time, it is under\
    \ on-demand allocation. When gate adjustments \nare only possible at fixed times\
    \ it is either under semi-demand or imposed allocation. Further, \nthe decision-making\
    \ procedure on water allocation to tertiary units (i.e.: imposed, semi-\ndemand,\
    \ on-demand) directly connotes the timing of water supply delivery (i.e.: pre-set,\
    \ after \ntime lag, immediate). The rates of supply delivery can be surmised to\
    \ be according to the \ndefinition of productive and protective irrigation. \n\
    According to Ankum (2001), the consensus on the decision-making procedure on water\
    \ \nallocation determines already the options for the methods of water allocation\
    \ to tertiary units \nand the water distribution through the main system. He identified\
    \ the following three basic \nlogic methods irrigation water can be allocated\
    \ to a tertiary unit: \n• \nsplitted flow or also called proportional flow, when\
    \ the discharge from the headwork is \ndiverted into a fixed ratio throughout\
    \ the main systems and towards the tertiary units; \n• \nintermittent flow or\
    \ also called on/off flow, when water is allocated to tertiary units \neither\
    \ at a maximum flow (peak discharge) or at zero-flow; \n• \nadjustable flow or\
    \ also called varied flow, when the discharge to tertiary units is both \ncontinuous\
    \ and can be intentionally adjusted to the target rates. \n \nHis list of options\
    \ for logical combination of the three fundamental parameters into an \noperational\
    \ objective of the main system (connected by arrows in Figure 4.4) includes: \n\
    • \nimposed allocation to the tertiary offtake by splitted flow allows splitted\
    \ flow through \nthe main system. An intermittent, rotational or an adjustable\
    \ flow through the main \nsystem are also possible options; \n• \nimposed allocation\
    \ to the tertiary offtake by an adjustable flow allows a rotational flow \nor\
    \ an adjustable flow through the main system; \n• \nimposed allocation to the\
    \ tertiary offtake by an adjustable flow prescribes an adjustable \nflow through\
    \ the main system; \n• \nsemi-demand allocation to the tertiary offtake by an\
    \ intermittent flow and by an \nadjustable flow prescribes an adjustable flow\
    \ through the main system; \n• \non-demand allocation to the tertiary offtake\
    \ by an intermittent flow and by an adjustable \nflow prescribes both an adjustable\
    \ flow through the main system. \n \nIssues and concepts on design and performance\
    \ of irrigation systems \n67 \n \n \nFurther, Ankum (1997; 2001) pointed out that\
    \ the parameters of the selected operational \nobjectives of the main system limit\
    \ the options for flow control method and the type of flow \ncontrol structures\
    \ (that is, water level and discharge regulators) and their operational \ninstructions.\
    \ Flow control methods aim at maintaining a target water level or target discharge.\
    \ \nThe logic choices for the flow control method (Figure 4.4) are as follows:\
    \ (1) either \nproportional control or upstream control for imposed allocation;\
    \ (2) normally upstream \ncontrol with central management, but predictive control\
    \ under self-management for semi-\ndemand allocation; (3) either downstream or\
    \ volume control for on-demand allocation. \nHe emphasized that the selection\
    \ process of flow control method requires a \nmultidisciplinary approach, but\
    \ ultimate selection should be closely related to the operational \nobjectives\
    \ of the main system. The six basic flow control methods based on the location\
    \ of the \ntarget value, also called setpoint, are described as follows: \n• \n\
    proportional control, without any setpoint in water level. The primary purpose\
    \ of a \nstructure is to maintain a certain ratio-in-discharges to downstream\
    \ destinations. \nIrrigation systems under proportional control divide and distribute\
    \ the water according \nto a fixed ratio. \n• \nupstream control, with the setpoint\
    \ in water level at the upstream side of the regulator. \nStructures under upstream\
    \ control maintain the upstream water level at the target level, \nwhich means\
    \ that the upstream water level is constant for each discharge. A main \nirrigation\
    \ system under upstream control is essentially a discharge-controlled system,\
    \ \nthat is, discharge regulation and measurement is required at all offtaking\
    \ canals. It \nrequires a central management where the irrigation agency decides\
    \ on the water releases \nto tertiary units and on the cumulated discharges through\
    \ the whole main system;. \n• \ndownstream control, with the setpoint in water\
    \ level downstream of the regulator. It is a \ncontrol of the water regulator\
    \ based upon changes in the water level immediately \ndownstream of it. The regulators\
    \ in the main system maintain a constant water level \ndownstream of the structure,\
    \ regardless of the discharges. Such regulation of structures \nmeans that water\
    \ supply is given to a canal reach when the water level drops. Thus, the \ndischarge\
    \ at each regulator is automatically adjusted to the accumulated downstream \n\
    demand for irrigation water. A downstream-controlled main system has self system\
    \ \nmanagement, that is, the system itself converges to the new (required) steady\
    \ state; \n68  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in\
    \ the Philippines \n \n \n• \nvolume control, with the setpoint in water level\
    \ at a pivot point located in the middle of \nthe downstream reach. Its concept\
    \ is to have a constant volume, regardless of the \ndischarge in the downward\
    \ canal. Volume control behaves basically as a downstream-\ncontrolled system.\
    \ It solves the large dynamic storage in traditional downstream control \nbut\
    \ requires telemetry and regulation by electro-mechanical gates; \n• \npredictive\
    \ control, with the setpoint in water level at the other end of the downstream\
    \ \ncanal reach. It uses two sensors per regulator: the main sensor is located\
    \ at the next \ndownward gate to measure water need there; the second sensor is\
    \ at the gate itself as to \nprevent overtopping when irrigation flow stops. Predictive\
    \ control solves the drawback \nof central management in upstream control and\
    \ avoids the need for high embankments \nfor the positive wedges in downstream\
    \ control and volume control, but suffers the same \nproblems with time-lags and\
    \ operational losses associated with upstream control and \nrequires telemetry\
    \ and regulation by electro-mechanical gates; \n• \nsimultaneous control, without\
    \ setpoint water level, but with discharge regulators in all \ncanal reaches.\
    \ A system under simultaneous control behaves basically as a piped system \nwithout\
    \ dynamic storage \n \nPlusquellec et al. (1994) argued that there is a pressing\
    \ need to adopt a modern or new \napproach to the design and engineering of irrigation\
    \ projects to improve the performance of \ncanal irrigation systems. Modern irrigation\
    \ design is defined as a result of a thought process \nthat selects the configuration\
    \ and the physical components in the light of a well-defined and \nrealistic operational\
    \ plan, which is based on the service concept. It is not defined by specific \n\
    hardware components or control logic, but by the use of advanced concepts of hydraulic\
    \ \nengineering, irrigation engineering, agronomy and social science to arrive\
    \ at the most simple \nand workable solution. \nFurther, they suggested that engineers\
    \ must follow a certain evolution in their thoughts \nand in their perception\
    \ of the design task in order to produce a good final product. The steps \nin\
    \ this evolution and the associated requirements are given in Table 4.1. The classical\
    \ \napproach tends to concentrate on physical components without considering their\
    \ interactions. \nThe focus is on the mechanical and structural integrity. The\
    \ first step is associated with most \nof the design mistakes. \nIssues and concepts\

    \ maintained that appropriate design criteria are prerequisites to good \ndesign,\
    \ and hence, engineering performance. Design criteria are the parameters on which\
    \ the \nspecifications for structures and their construction, operation and maintenance\
    \ systems are \nbased. They are determined usually from hydrologic, geologic,\
    \ agronomic, climatologic and \nsocio-economic characteristics of the project\
    \ area. They are influenced by design philosophy, \nwhich takes into consideration,\
    \ among others, national and regional policy environment, \n70  \nModernisation\
    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nsustainability,\
    \ cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, social equity, management and \ncultural\
    \ factors. Examples of design philosophy include manual construction as against\
    \ \nmechanized construction to generate local employment, use of locally available\
    \ construction \nmaterials, flexibility for crop diversification, empowerment\
    \ or greater degree of control of \nfarmers over management of irrigation water,\
    \ continuous or rotational irrigation, and \nsimultaneous or relay cropping. The\
    \ first crucial point in the design of an irrigation system is \na clear understanding\
    \ of, and formulation of a design philosophy and determination of design \ncriteria.\
    \ Table 4.2 lists the common design criteria and the relevant parameters for some\
    \ canal \nirrigation systems. \nFor Horst (1998), the water delivery schedule\
    \ or the way in which water is delivered at \nthe tertiary unit is the core of\
    \ the design of irrigation systems. It is derived from a number of \nchoices and\
    \ assumptions both at field and system levels. Design assumptions deal partly\
    \ with \npolicy planning (extensive or intensive irrigation, poverty alleviation\
    \ or production-driven, \ntype of water allocation, etc.) and partly with agronomic\
    \ requirements (cropping patterns, \nwater requirements, irrigation methods, etc.).\
    \ Figure 4.5 shows the conventional derivation of \nthe water delivery schedule.\
    \ The upper section of the chart represents the design decisions, \nwhich are\
    \ concerned mostly with the agronomic and agro-hydrological aspects of irrigation\
    \ at \nthe farm level, while the lower section deals with design choices at system\
    \ level. The latter \nare primarily related to technological and operational aspects.\
    \ Matching the two sections will \nresult in the water delivery schedule. Once\
    \ the water delivery schedule is determined the \nsystem technology follows as\
    \ a derivative from this schedule. In its turn, the type of system \ntechnology\

    \ He examined \nthe applicability of simplified technologies such as proportional\
    \ outlets, proportional division \nweir-type structures, on-off gates and stepwise\
    \ distributors in six commonly recurring \ncropping patterns. He concluded that\
    \ for many different cropping patterns a simplified \ntechnology (either proportional\
    \ division or on-off structures) is applicable provided additional \noperational\
    \ requirements are taken into account. While admitting that additional operational\
    \ \nrequirements can be considered as a loss of water, hence, contributes to low\
    \ irrigation \nefficiencies, Horst (1998) argued that with this intentional management\
    \ loss, the overall water \nuse efficiencies are expected to increase due to a\
    \ simpler technology and a simpler operation. \nAs Meijer (1992) has put it, one\
    \ needs water to save water. \nRenault (2001) advocated a concept of re-engineering\
    \ irrigation management and \nsystem operation, which combines the notion of industrial\
    \ production (transformation of \ninputs into outputs) and the notion of service.\
    \ He viewed re-engineering as a revolution in the \nthinking and design concerning\
    \ irrigation management and operation. Thus, it should be the \nfirst strategic\
    \ stage of any intervention and must be a prerequisite to any physical \n(modernisation\
    \ of infrastructure) or institutional (reforms) interventions. With the re-\n\
    engineering concept, he considered a re-assessment of some of the commonly held\
    \ \nassumptions underpinning irrigation design as a likely first step in identifying\
    \ new ways of \nmanaging irrigation systems. He proposed to discard the assumption\
    \ on homogeneity in \ncropping patterns and in the design of structures throughout\
    \ the system and, sometimes even, \nat the irrigation department or national level.\
    \ He reasoned that natural conditions such as soil \nand climate are heterogeneous,\
    \ especially in the case of large irrigation system, and may \ncause significant\
    \ differences in the required irrigation service.  \nWhile acknowledging that\
    \ simplicity might be the best option for some irrigation \nsystems with respect\
    \ to ease in operation and maintenance as suggested by Horst (1998), he \nexpressed\
    \ doubts that simple management solutions and techniques can also cope with the\
    \ \nincreasing complexity of water management when confronted with challenges\
    \ posed by \nincreasing complexity of cropping patterns, climate and multiple\
    \ uses of water. He also \nquestioned the concept of equity and uniformity in\
    \ the conventional design, saying that it may \n76  \nModernisation strategy for\
    \ the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nno longer be an efficient\
    \ management strategy. He suggested that the importance of equity \nshould be\
    \ re-addressed in terms of both quantity and quality of water. \nHe argued that\
    \ a strengthening of the notion of service should be a key aspect of re-\nengineering\
    \ for irrigation management. Such strengthening would have to include: (1) an\
    \ \nupward service-oriented approach, starting from the level of the agreed service\
    \ with the users \nand moving to the mobilisation of resources to achieve that\
    \ service; (2) promoting an agreed \ncost-effective service by defining the level\
    \ of service that meets both the demand and \nwillingness of users to pay and\
    \ by adopting water use indicators such as adequacy and \nefficiency to monitor\
    \ effectiveness of irrigation service providers; (3) enlarging the concept of\
    \ \nflexibility in water service to encompass the spatial variability of the service\
    \ within an \nirrigation system; (4) defining and achieving the reliability requirements\
    \ by users. For canal \noperations, the re-engineering approach should focus on\
    \ an improved physical assessment of \nthe infrastructure. In doing such an assessment,\
    \ he proposed the use of sensitivity analysis to \nbetter understand canal behaviour\
    \ under perturbations so that more relevant management \nstrategies can be developed.\
    \ He also called for a smart engineering approach to information \nsystems for\
    \ irrigation, advocating that a strategic and hierarchical approach to information\
    \ \npertinent to irrigation and the availability of water balance studies are\
    \ important requirements \nto the design of cost-effective information systems.\
    \ Further, he proposed that the service-\noperation interface be redesigned to\
    \ include more appropriate allocation of operational effort \ntargeting the most\
    \ demanding areas. \n \n \n5. ASSESSMENT OF IRRIGATION SYSTEMS \n \n5.1 Approaches\
    \ to analyze the hydraulic behaviour of irrigation systems \n \nThe conveyance\
    \ and distribution of water in canal irrigation systems are governed by \nhydraulic\
    \ laws, which either relate to steady state or unsteady state hydraulic conditions.\
    \ \nSteady-state open flow hydraulics covers flows for which discharge is constant\
    \ with time. It \nlinks the geometry, hydraulic properties and flow for different\
    \ types of flow control structures \nand canals. In contrast, unsteady flow hydraulics\
    \ considers discharge variation with time \n(Chow, 1959). \nSteady state hydraulics\
    \ is the more generally understood and developed topic. Steady-\nstate flow conditions\
    \ have been a widely used design assumption in most gated canal \nirrigation systems\
    \ and are canal operation targets (Plusquellec et al., 1994; Renault, 2001; \n\
    Kouchakzadeh and Montazar, 2005; Renault et al., 2007). However, they rarely happen\
    \ in \ncommon irrigation practice as a canal operation upstream (e.g.: a change,\
    \ or adjustment in \ngate setting) itself causes variations in discharge and water\
    \ levels (or unsteady state \nconditions) along the canal network. It has been\
    \ observed in many large canal irrigation \nsystems that the time lag between\
    \ a change upstream of the canal and its conversion at a \ndownstream point of\
    \ the canal can take a number of days. More often, new changes in flow \nconditions\
    \ as a result of the succeeding operation are already beginning to be reflected\
    \ \ndownstream just when the flow conditions are converging after the preceding\
    \ operational \nprocedure (Renault et al., 2007). Thus, the steady-state approach\
    \ has limited practical \nsignificance for efficient management of canal irrigation\
    \ systems, while it is not capable of \nanalyzing the propagation of flow variations\
    \ in discharge and water level along the canal \nnetworks (Renault, 2001; Kouchakzadeh\
    \ and Montazar, 2005). Nevertheless, knowledge on \nsteady-state flow properties\
    \ of a canal system is relevant for purposes of measuring, \nmonitoring and managing\
    \ discharges at different locations along the canal network. \nUnsteady flow condition\
    \ is a norm in canal irrigation systems (Plusquellec et al., 1994; \nRenault,\
    \ 2001; Plusquellec, 2002; Renault et al., 2007; Facon et al., 2008). Therefore,\
    \ the \nunsteady flow approach is suitable for analyzing the flow dynamics of\
    \ irrigation distribution \nsystems and canal operation (Renault, 2001; Renault\
    \ et al., 2007). Cognizant of the fact that \n78  \nModernisation strategy for\
    \ the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nperturbations or\
    \ variations in discharges and water levels are permanent features of canal \n\
    irrigation systems, consideration of unsteady state flow instead of assuming steady\
    \ state has \nalso been suggested for the design and layout of canal irrigation\
    \ systems and for canal \noperation (Plusquellec et al., 1994; Renault et al.,\
    \ 2007; Renault, 2008). Several methods, \nincluding hydrodynamic models, based\
    \ on Saint Venant differential equations have been \nproposed and used to describe\
    \ unsteady flow conditions (Renault et al., 2001). While an \nunsteady approach\
    \ allows comprehensive analysis of hydraulic behaviour of canals, it is not \n\
    simple (Renault, 2001; Renault, 2005; Kouchakzadeh and Montazar, 2005). Canal\
    \ hydraulic \nmodels are seldom used by irrigation agencies due to their apparent\
    \ complexity (Burt and \nStyles, 1998). \nCanal hydraulic models are basically\
    \ based on Saint-Venant equations developed by a \nBarré de Saint-Venant in 1871\
    \ (Litrico et al., 2005). Saint-Venant equations are based on \nmass conservation\
    \ law and momentum conservation law and are expressed as: \n \nడ஺\nడ௧ +\nడொ\n\
    డ௫ = 0 \n(5.1) \n \nడொ\nడ௧ +\nడொమ/஺\nడ௧\n+ ݃ܣ\nడ௬\nడ௫ = ݃ܣ(ܵ௕−ܵ௙) (5.2) \n \n\
    where A(x, t) is the wetted cross-sectional area (m2), Q(x, t) is the discharge\
    \ (m3s-1) across \nsection A, Y(x, t) is the water depth (m), Sb is the bed slope,\
    \ G is the gravitational acceleration \n(m s-2), Sf(x, t) is the friction slope.\
    \ \nTwo boundary conditions are considered: Q(0, t) and Q(X, t) where X is the\
    \ length of \nthe canal. The initial conditions are denoted by Q(x, 0) and Y(x,\
    \ 0). Sf is based on Manning-\nStrickler equation: \n \nܵ௙ =\nொమ௡మ\n஺మோర య\n⁄\
    \  \n(5.3) \n \nwhere n is the Manning coefficient (s m-1/3) and R is the hydraulic\
    \ radius (m), defined by \nR=A/P where P is the wetted perimeter. \n \nAssesment\
    \ of irrigation systems \n79 \n \n \nSome of the hydraulic models that have been\
    \ used for canal irrigation include MIKE 11 \n(Mishra et al., 2001), SETRIC (Depeweg\
    \ and Paudel, 2003), HEC-RAS (Shahrokhnia and \nJavan, 2005), CANALMAN (Kumar\
    \ et al., 2002; Khan and Ghumman, 2008; Ghumman et \nal., 2010), ICSM (Ojo and\
    \ Otieno, 2010) and SIC (Tariq and Latif, 2010). Other available \nhydraulic models\
    \ include CANAL, CARIMA, DUFLOW, MODIS, USM, RootCanal, \nCanalCAD and Sobek.\
    \ Evaluations for each of the first five models were made by Merkley \nand Rogers\
    \ (1993), Holly and Parish (1993), Clemmens et al. (1993), Schuurmans (1993) and\
    \ \nRogers and Merkley (1993), respectively. CanalCAD and Sobek were evaluated\
    \ by \nClemmens et al. (2005). Merkley (2006) provides a description and technical\
    \ reference of \nRootCanal. \nIn between the steady state and unsteady state approaches\
    \ is the sensitivity analysis that \nfocuses on the behaviour of canals under\
    \ input changes. Rather than resorting to complexity \nof unsteady state flow\
    \ hydraulics, this sensitivity approach considers two different steady \nstates\
    \ with corresponding slightly different value of inputs. The sensitivity of an\
    \ irrigation \nstructure is expressed as the ratio of the relative or absolute\
    \ variation of outputs to the relative \nor absolute variation of the inputs.\
    \ Depending on the function of the structure, the input and \noutput are either\
    \ water level or discharge. For a diversion structure or an offtake, the \nsensitivity\
    \ indicator refers to the relative variation in discharge through the offtake\
    \ (Δq/q) as a \nresult of the variation in water level (ΔH) in the parent canal\
    \ and is expressed as: \n \nܵ௢௙௙௧௔௞௘ =\n∆௤ ௤\nൗ\n∆ு  \n(5.4) \n \nField measurements\
    \ of the offtake sensitivity were done by generating a variation in the water\
    \ \nlevel or head (ΔH) in the parent canal and measuring the corresponding variation\
    \ of discharge \n(Δq) through the offtake. When records on water levels and discharges\
    \ are available, the \nvariations are obtained from the data and substituted to\
    \ equation 5.4. For a rough estimate of \nthe sensitivity indicator, the logarithm\
    \ derivative of a generic equation of flow through the \nofftake will be used.\
    \ \n \nGeneric flow equation: ݍ=ܿܪ∝ (5.5) \n80  \nModernisation strategy for the\

    \ on the structure (water level upstream minus the water level \ndownstream if\
    \ the structure is submerged, or minus a level of reference taken as the crest\
    \ level \nfor an overshot structure, or the orifice axis for an undershot structure\
    \ if the structure is not \nsubmerged). α is the exponent in the relevant hydraulic\
    \ equation for flow; it is equal to 1.5 for \novershot flow and 0.5 for undershot\
    \ flow. \nOfftake sensitivity can be used to asses discharge variations for different\
    \ water levels in \nthe main canal and to set water-level control requirements\
    \ for a set water delivery target. \nBased on equation 5.4, the permissible variation\
    \ in water level can be derived as: \n \n∆ܪ௣௘௥௠௜௦௦௜௕௟௘ =\nቀ∆௤ ௤\nൗ ቁ\nೞ೐೟\nௌ೚೑೑೟ೌೖ೐\
    \  \n(5.8) \n \nA variation in diverted discharge through an offtake will have\
    \ corresponding variation \nin discharge in the parent canal. Depending on the\
    \ ratio of the discharge through the offtake to \nthe discharge in the parent\
    \ canal, such perturbation might be significant in the parent canal \ndownstream\
    \ of this diversion point. Thus, low sensitivity and high discharge offtake can\
    \ have \na large impact on perturbation along the main canal. The sensitivity\
    \ indicator for conveyance \nexpresses the relative variation in the main canal\
    \ discharge as a function of the variation in \nwater level (equation 5.9). While\
    \ Sofftake can be used to determine the impact of perturbations \nto the offtaking\
    \ canal, Sconveyance can be used to determine the impact of the fluctuations in\
    \ the \nofftaking canal on the main system. If the offtake sensitivity is known,\
    \ it is given by equation \n5.7. \n \n \nAssesment of irrigation systems \n81\

    \ \n \nThe methods to determine the sensitivity of cross-regulator are basically\
    \ the same as \nthose for the offtakes; the difference is the input and the output\
    \ to be measured. Direct \nmeasurement is done by generating discharge variation\
    \ in the main canal and measuring the \nresulting variation in the head upstream\
    \ of the regulator. \nAs cited by Renault et al. (2007), studies on sensitivity\
    \ analysis with emphasis on \ndelivery structures were carried out as early as\
    \ mid-20th century by Mahbub and Gulhati \n(1951) while further studies were conducted\
    \ by Horst (1983), Albinson (1986), Ankum \n(1993) and Renault (1999). Recent\
    \ studies (Renault, 2000; Kouchakzadeh and Montazar, \n2005) involved development\
    \ of hydraulic sensitivity indicators at reach and subsystem levels \nbased on\
    \ progressive aggregation of sensitivities. Indicators of sensitivity for each\
    \ flow \ncontrol structures are determined and aggregated at the reach level,\
    \ then reach indicators are \ngrouped at subsystem level. \nAt the canal reach\
    \ and subsystem levels where a number of flow control structures \nmight be interacting\
    \ and influencing each other, it is the ratio of the rate of change in \ndischarge\
    \ from the outlet to the rate of change in discharge of the parent canal that\
    \ are being \n82  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \nassessed. It is termed as node sensitivity or hydraulic\
    \ flexibility for ungated systems, and \nreach sensitivity for gated systems.\
    \ \nThe node sensitivity (Hydraulic flexibility) indicator expresses the link\
    \ between the \nrelative variations in discharge (ΔQ) in the parent and dependent\
    \ canals (Δq) at diversion or \ndivision nodes, and is calculated using equation\
    \ 5.12. Hydraulic flexibility is especially well \nadapted to ungated systems\
    \ that were developed on the principle of proportionality. Dividing \nboth the\
    \ discharge variation in the parent (ΔQ/Q) and discharge variation in the dependent\
    \ \ncanal (Δq/q) by the water depth variation in the parent canal (ΔH) leads to\
    \ an expression of \nhydraulic flexibility as the product of offtake sensitivity\
    \ and water level regulator sensitivity \n(equation 5.13). \n \nܨ=\n∆௤௤\nൗ\n∆ொ\n\

    \ \n(5.13) \n \nBased on the generated discharge fluctuations in the offtaking\
    \ canal, Horst (1998) \ncategorized hydraulic flexibility indicators as follows:\
    \ \n• \nF < 1 (under proportional): a relative change in discharge in the parent\
    \ canal generates a \nsmaller relative change in the offtaking canal. Fluctuations\
    \ are diminished in the \nofftaking canal; \n• \nF = 1 (proportional): a relative\
    \ change in discharge in the parent canal generates an \nequal relative change\
    \ in the offtaking canal. Fluctuations are divided uniformly; \n• \nF > 1 (hyper\
    \ proportional): a relative change in discharge in the parent canal generates\
    \ a \nlarger relative change in the offtaking canal. Fluctuations are exacerbated\
    \ in the \nofftaking canal. \n \nIn ungated irrigation systems developed on the\
    \ principle of proportionality, the ideal \nvalue of the flexibility indicator\
    \ is unity (F =1). In such cases, the discharge is divided \nproportionally over\
    \ canals and a high level of equity can be achieved (Renault et al., 2007). In\
    \ \nAssesment of irrigation systems \n83 \n \n \ngated systems, the flexibility\
    \ indicator approaches unity when the sensitivity indicators of the \nofftakes\
    \ and the cross-regulators are inverse (equation 5.13). However in such systems,\
    \ a \nnumber of strategies for managing perturbations is possible through gate\
    \ adjustments, thus, \nproportional distribution of perturbations is not necessary\
    \ a target of canal operation. \nIn gated systems, sensitivity analysis at the\
    \ reach is important as flow control structures \nare interacting and influencing\
    \ one another and conveying their behaviour downstream or \nupstream. Understanding\
    \ the final behaviour of a reach requires aggregation of sensitivity \nindicators\
    \ of several offtakes under a cross-regulator influence. The equation by Renault\
    \ et al. \n(2000) will be used for computing for lumped sensitivity indicators\

    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \n5.2 Overview\
    \ of the performance assessment of irrigation systems  \n \nDeveloping irrigation\
    \ facilities has been a key strategy of many countries to increase crop \nproduction.\
    \ However, many studies reveal that the target irrigated area and crop production\
    \ \nwere not achieved in most areas served by canal irrigation systems. The evidently\
    \ poor \neconomic returns from irrigation investments and the increasing demand\
    \ for crop production \nfrom irrigated agriculture, while its share of water is\
    \ predicted to decline, has underscored the \nneed to improve the performance\
    \ of most canal irrigation systems. The emphasis on \nimproving the performance\
    \ has focused the attention of irrigation professionals on the \napproaches to\
    \ investigate the causes of such mediocre performance and on the process of \n\
    identifying improvement measures (Chambers and Carruthers, 1986; Bruscoli et al.,\
    \ 2001).  \nIrrigation performance relates to the extent or level an irrigation\
    \ system has met its set \nobjectives (Murray-Rust and Snellen, 1993; Bos et al.,\
    \ 2005; Malano and Hofwegen, 2006). \nBased on the nature of the irrigation system’s\
    \ objectives, two types of irrigation performance \nwere defined by Murray-Rust\
    \ and Snellen (1993): operational performance and strategic \nperformance. The\
    \ former measures the extent to which target levels of service are being met \n\
    at any period in time through routine implementation of operational procedures.\
    \ The latter is \nconcerned with a longer-time activity that assesses the extent\
    \ and the level of efficiency that \nthe broader set of objectives is being achieved.\
    \ \nStudies on performance assessment of irrigation schemes have gained momentum\
    \ since \nlate 1980s (Gorantiwar and Smout, 2005). Performance assessment in irrigation\
    \ is defined as \nthe systematic observation, documentation and interpretation\
    \ of activities related to irrigated \nagriculture with the objective of continuous\
    \ improvement (Bos et al., 2005; Molden et al., \n2007). It is the measurement\
    \ of the degree of achievement of the strategic and operational \nobjectives set\
    \ out in the strategic planning (Malano and Hofwegen, 2006). Bos et al. (2005)\
    \ \nand Molden et al. (2007) listed the following application of performance assessment:\
    \ \n• \noperational performance assessment to determine how the operational processes\
    \ are \nperforming; \n• \nstrategic performance assessment to understand how a\
    \ system or organization is \nperforming and using available resources; \n \n\
    Assesment of irrigation systems \n85 \n \n \n• \ndiagnostic performance assessment\
    \ to understand the causes of low or high \nperformance, and as a prelude to design\
    \ and implementation of interventions for system \nimprovement and rehabilitation;\
    \ \n• \ncomparative performance assessment and benchmarking to compare performance\
    \ to set \nappropriate benchmark standards and identify processes that lead to\
    \ higher \nperformance; \n• \nassessing impact of irrigation to understand whether\
    \ investments have paid off and \nunderstand the determinants of high or low productivity;\
    \ \n• \nsupporting adaptive management to respond to changing needs and environment.\
    \ \n \n5.3 General framework for assessing irrigation performance \n \nBuilding\
    \ on the previous works of several authors, Bos et al. (2005) formulated a framework\
    \ \nto define and guide the performance assessment task. The framework (Figure\
    \ 5.1) is based on \na series of questions on: (1) the purpose and strategy of\
    \ performance assessment – to whom it \nis for, from whose perspective it is undertaken,\
    \ who will carry it out, what is the type and \nextent of it; (2) the design and\
    \ planning of the performance which include selecting criteria, \nperformance\
    \ indicators and data to be collected; (3) the implementation with data being\
    \ \ncollected, processed and analyzed; (4) the course of action on the results\
    \ of data analysis.  \nThe purpose of the assessment is closely related to who\
    \ the assessment is for, which \nmight be the government, funding agencies, irrigation\
    \ service providers, irrigation system \nmanagers, farmers or research organizations.\
    \ The assessment may be undertaken on behalf of \na group of stakeholders but\
    \ may be looking at performance assessment from the standpoint of \nanother group\
    \ of stakeholders. An example is an assessment study on the impact of irrigation\
    \ \nsystem performance on farmer livelihoods to be carried out by a research institute\
    \ hired by the \ngovernment. \nDifferent types of performance assessment will\
    \ require different types of organizations \nor individuals to conduct the assessment\
    \ as organizations or individuals differ in their \ncapabilities in carrying out\
    \ the assessment. The purpose of the assessment also defines the \ntype of assessment,\
    \ which can be operational, accountability, intervention, sustainability \n(Small\
    \ and Svendsen, 1992) and diagnostic analysis (Bos et al., 2005).  \n86  \nModernisation\

    \ season-to-\nseason monitoring and evaluation of system performance. Accountability\
    \ performance \nassessment is undertaken to assess the performance of those responsible\
    \ for managing the \nsystem. Intervention assessment is employed to study and\
    \ enhance the performance of the \nsystem. Sustainability assessment looks at\
    \ the longer resource use and impacts. Diagnostic \nanalysis is carried out to\
    \ track down the causes of performance so that improvements can be \nmade or performance\
    \ levels be sustained. \nThe performance assessment can either relate to only\
    \ one system (internal analysis) or \ncomparison between systems (external analysis).\
    \ Benchmarking of irrigation systems is a \nform of external performance assessment.\
    \ The two primary boundaries of performance \nassessment relate to spatial and\
    \ temporal dimensions. Spatial refers to the area or number of \nschemes covered,\
    \ that is, whether the assessment is limited to a particular canal within a \n\
    system, to one system, or to several systems. Temporal refers to the duration\
    \ of the \nassessment. The system approach advocated by Small and Svendsen (1992)\
    \ is an example of a \nboundary and extent of performance assessment. \nBos et\
    \ al. (2005) noticed that the terms performance criteria, performance measures\
    \ and \nperformance indicators have been used by different authors to mean different\
    \ though closely \nrelated things. They proposed to equate the term criteria to\
    \ the stated and/or alternative \nobjectives of the irrigation system, against\
    \ which performance is to be assessed. Criteria can \nbe measured using performance\
    \ indicators, which identify data needed for the performance \nassessment. Examples\
    \ of performance criteria, which is also called as performance measures \n(Gorantiwar\
    \ and Smout, 2005) and system characteristics (Schultz and De Wrachien, 2002),\
    \ \ninclude efficiency, reliability, productivity, adequacy and sustainability,\
    \ among others. \nPerformance indicators are measurable variables that quantitatively\
    \ describe the condition or \nperformance in respect to the objectives established\
    \ for the system. A number of papers have \ndealt with formulation and/or in-depth\
    \ discussion on performance indicators (e.g.: Burt, 2001; \nBos et al., 2005;\
    \ Gorantiwar and Smout, 2005). A comprehensive list of performance criteria, \n\
    performance indicators and their data requirements are summarized by a number\
    \ of authors \n(e.g.: Gorantiwar and Smout, 2005; Bos et al., 2005). \n \n \n\

    \ \n \n \n5.3.1 \nDiagnostic assessment \n \nThe purpose of the assessment defines\
    \ the nature of the performance assessment procedure \nthat would be appropriate.\
    \ A sound diagnosis of the current performance is often the most \nimportant phase\
    \ in the modernisation process (Renault et al., 2007), hence, a performance \n\
    assessment procedure of diagnostic nature is given an emphasis in this review.\
    \ \nDiagnostic assessments are carried out to gain an understanding on reasons\
    \ for the \nobserved levels of performance, to find out the nature or causes of\
    \ the problems, to know the \nconstraints, to identify intervention measures for\
    \ system improvement, or to learn more about \nsuccesses and failures of irrigation\
    \ design and management (Bos et al., 2005; Molden et al., \n2007). It complements\
    \ routine operational performance monitoring and evaluation of \nirrigation systems\
    \ (Figure 5.2). It is undertaken when difficult operational problems are \nidentified,\
    \ when target performance is not met, or when stakeholders are not satisfied with\
    \ the \nexisting levels of performance achieved and desire a change. \n \nFigure\
    \ 5.2. Relationship between the normal operational and strategic management cycle\
    \ in \nirrigation (Bos et al., 2005) \n \nThere are two common approaches of diagnosing\
    \ irrigation performance. The first \napproach involves collecting as much information\
    \ as possible about the system and explaining \nthe system performance through\
    \ data analysis, while the second approach focuses on and \nUpdate \noperational\
    \ \nor strategic \nplans \nStart diagnosis\nReporting \nSolutions? \nAssessment\
    \ \nMonitor \nperformance\nProblem? \nAssesment of irrigation systems \n89 \n\
    \ \n \ntracing key cause-effect relationships (Bos et al., 2005). The more cost-effective\
    \ is the second \napproach, which takes a broad view of the system to identify\
    \ possible explanations for the \nproblem and offers explanations of reasons for\
    \ the current level of performance after \nsuccessive approximation. The basic\
    \ steps for this approach are shown in Figure 5.3. \nA system overview involves\
    \ profiling of the system from macro perspective using \nsecondary information\
    \ on key descriptors of the irrigation system (climate, water supply and \ndistribution,\
    \ command area, crops, institutional framework, etc) in order to develop an initial\
    \ \nexplanation or hypothesis of cause-effect relationships. In a detailed assessment,\
    \ more data \ncan be collected and analyzed or certain parts of the system can\
    \ be studied in more detail to \nreformulate and re-test the hypothesis (i.e.,\
    \ causes of problems) until it is validated, or \nsupported by results of analysis.\
    \ After finding the causes of the problem, recommendations \nare formulated and\
    \ reported to concerned parties. Recommended actions may include \nadjustments\
    \ in operations or in target values of indicators or formulation of new performance\
    \ \nindicators. \n \n \nFigure 5.3. Steps to diagnostic assessment (Bos et al.,\

    \ \n \n \nThe methodologies applicable to diagnostic assessment include diagnostic\
    \ analysis \nmethodology, rapid appraisal, participatory rural appraisal and diagnostic\
    \ tree. Examples of \nthe more specific diagnostic assessment techniques include\
    \ remote sensing, water balance and \naccounting and questionnaire surveys (Bos\
    \ et al., 2005). Diagnostic analysis and rapid \nappraisal as methodologies for\
    \ assessing and understanding the performance of irrigation \nsystems has been\
    \ discussed in a number of papers (Chambers and Carruthers, 1986; Oad et \nal.,\
    \ 1988; Derick et al., 2000; Bos et al., 2005). The authors traced back the roots\
    \ of \ndiagnostic analysis methodology from a joint on-farm water management research\
    \ project by \nPakistan government and Colorado State University in the early\
    \ 1970s. In this pioneering \nwork (Clyma et al., 1977), a diagnostic analysis\
    \ phase is one of the three phases of a so-called \nresearch development process\
    \ (Figure 5.4). It involves an interdisciplinary study aimed at \nunderstanding\
    \ the performance of the irrigation system and identifying the most important\
    \ \nproblems of the system. The general sequence of activities in a diagnostic\
    \ study includes: \ndefining preliminary objectives; reconnaissance (background\
    \ information and preliminary \nsurveys); revision of objectives and plans; detailed\
    \ studies; interdisciplinary analysis and \nsynthesis; and report writing (disciplinary\
    \ and interdisciplinary). Chambers and Carruthers \n(1986) noted that the manual\
    \ written up on diagnostic methodology used in irrigation water \nmanagement in\
    \ Pakistan and succeeding diagnostic activities was strong on the full checklist\
    \ \nof data to be collected and methods to be used in diagnosis, but did not provide\
    \ a diagnostic \nanalysis method for a whole irrigation system, only for a few\
    \ isolated systems. \nThe diagnostic analysis methodology is a flexibly structured\
    \ process and has evolved \nover the years. Pioneer authors have defined more\
    \ completely the sequence of steps for a \ndiagnostic analysis in their succeeding\
    \ works (Chamber and Carruthers, 1986; Dedrick et al., \n2000). Other contributors\
    \ in the diagnostic methodology presented analytical frameworks or \nmodified\
    \ diagnostic processes based on the original concept (Oad et al., 1988; Bos et\
    \ al., \n2005). Further, diagnostic analysis methodology has been used also in\
    \ combination with other \nmethods (e.g., Hales and Burton, 2000; Dedrick et al.,\
    \ 2000; Bruscoli et al., 2001). The key \nconcepts of the methodology include:\
    \ (1) use of system analysis, which characterizes how \nvarious irrigation system\
    \ components interact with each other; (2) use of an interdisciplinary \nteam\
    \ to carry out the assessment; (3) action research on developing data and knowledge\
    \ that \ncan be used to implement organization change; (4) users involvement throughout\
    \ the process. \nAssesment of irrigation systems \n91 \n \n \n \nFigure 5.4. Research-development\
    \ process (as cited by Oad et al., 1988) \n \nThe rapid appraisal method is a\
    \ quick but systematic way to gather data on system \nperformance. It falls on\
    \ a continuum between very informal methods, such as casual talks or \nhurried\
    \ site visits, and highly formal methods such as census, structured surveys, or\
    \ field \nmeasurements (USAID, 1996). It is typically used in the initial steps\
    \ of performing diagnostic \nanalysis as its results, an overview of the irrigation\
    \ system, can shed light in formulating an \ninitial hypothesis on likely problems\
    \ and in making decisions on promising courses of actions \n(Bos et al., 2005).\
    \ \nThe initial development of the rapid appraisal method can be traced to a research\
    \ work \nof Bottrall commissioned by the World Bank on larger irrigation projects\
    \ in Pakistan, India, \nIndonesia and Taiwan in the late 1970s (Chambers and Carruthers,\
    \ 1986). The approach used \nby Bottrall and his two co-workers (an engineer and\
    \ a local researcher) in each case study of a \nlarge irrigation system includes:\
    \ (1) 1–3 weeks gathering information in the study area \nthrough interviews with\
    \ farmers, cross-checking staff answers, inspecting records, spot \nchecks; (2)\
    \ 1–2 week general orientation including discussion with planners and \nadministrators\
    \ at the national level and brief visits to other systems for comparison. Oad\
    \ et al., \n1988 cited other early works (De los Reyes, 1980; Chamber, 1983; Yoder\
    \ and Martin, 1983; \nPotten, 1985; Latios, 1986) that contributed in the evolution\
    \ of the concepts, methods, and \nPhase 2: \nDevelopment \nand assessment \nof\

    \ \n92  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nchecklist of data for rapid appraisal. Rapid appraisal has evolved since\
    \ it was first employed \nin a number of irrigation systems. Adaptive modification\
    \ or expansion of the concept and \nprocedure of rapid appraisal was taken by\
    \ irrigation professionals to suit specific situations. \nThe common rapid appraisal\
    \ methods include: review of secondary data; interviews with \nindividuals and\
    \ groups; and direct observation of various physical parts of the system and \n\
    water supply conditions; and mini-surveys gathering quantitative data on narrowly\
    \ focused \nquestions (USAID, 1996 and 2010; Bos et al., 2005). \nOad et al. (1988)\
    \ remarked that the rapid appraisal and the diagnostic analysis \nmethodologies\
    \ are conceptually similar in adopting an interdisciplinary view of an irrigation\
    \ \nsystem, in gathering data through field observations and interviews of farmers\
    \ and staff of \nirrigation agency and in their overall purpose. The difference\
    \ between the two approaches in \ndiagnosing irrigation systems is in their emphases.\
    \ Diagnostic analysis methodology is \nnormally longer, more involved study with\
    \ highly structured procedure or sequence of field \nactivities based on more\
    \ specifically defined concepts. Rapid appraisal gives more emphasis \non the\
    \ procedures of collecting and analyzing key information on the present condition\
    \ and \nindicators of performance of the irrigation system in order to identify\
    \ the likely cause of \nproblems within relatively limited time.  \nAs cited by\
    \ Bos et al. (2005), participatory rural appraisal is a family of approaches and\
    \ \nmethods to enable local people to share, enhance and analyze their knowledge\
    \ of life and \nconditions and to plan and act (Chambers, 1994). The local communities\
    \ participate in the \nresearch by developing sketches and maps, transects showing\
    \ resource use patterns, seasonal \ncalendars, trend analysis and daily activity\
    \ profiles. The participatory rural appraisal aims to \ntap local knowledge about\
    \ the operation and performance of irrigation systems. It can be used \nas a complement\
    \ to other tools when assessing performance, identifying problems and \ndeveloping\
    \ interventions. It is ideally suited for developing and improving service \n\
    arrangements between the irrigation providers and users. \nPerformance of irrigation\
    \ systems is determined by many factors such as technical \ndesign of the physical\
    \ structures, quality of construction, system operation and maintenance, \nwater\
    \ supply conditions, agro-climatic factors, farmers’ preference and farming practices,\
    \ and \ninstitutional factors, among others. One or combinations of these factors\
    \ are possible causes \nof a typical irrigation problem. Further, one cause might\
    \ have originated from one or more \nAssesment of irrigation systems \n93 \n \n\
    \ \ncauses. Diagnosis is done to sort out and determine which cause is leading\
    \ to the observed \nfield problem. Tracing the possible causes of the observed\
    \ problem can be structured into a \nhierarchical diagnostic tree, where any given\
    \ problem can be both a cause and an effect \n(Figure 5.5), and can led, eventually,\
    \ to the identification of the root cause of the observed \nfield problem (Burton\
    \ et al., 1999; Bos et al., 2005). An example of the application of a \ndiagnostic\
    \ tree, also known as problem tree, in diagnosing an irrigation system is \ndemonstrated\
    \ in Bruscoli et al. (2001). \n \n \nFigure 5.5. Structuring the problem and likely\

    Modernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \n5.3.2 \nRapid Appraisal Procedure \n \nIn the mid-1990s, a methodology\
    \ to assess the impact of introduction of modern control and \nmanagement practices\
    \ on irrigation system performance was developed by the Irrigation \nTraining\
    \ and Research Centre (ITRC) at the California Polytechnic State University for\
    \ a \nresearch program. This methodology called Rapid Appraisal Procedure (RAP)\
    \ has been used \nsince then by the World Bank and FAO for diagnosing irrigation\
    \ systems in Asia, Latin \nAmerica and North Africa (FAO, 1999; Renault et al.,\
    \ 2007). Variations of the RAP have \nbeen used since 1989 by ITRC on irrigation\
    \ modernisation projects throughout the western \nUnited States of America (Burt,\
    \ 2001; Burt and Styles, 2004). A detailed description of the \nconcept and procedures\
    \ of RAP is found in Burt and Styles (1999), Burt (2001), and Renault \net al.\
    \ (2007). \nThe conceptual framework of RAP for the analysis of irrigation system\
    \ performance is \nbased on the recognition that such systems operate under a\
    \ set of physical and institutional \nconstraints and with a certain resource\
    \ base (Figure 5.6). The irrigation system is analyzed as \na series of management\
    \ levels, each level providing water delivery service through internal \nmanagement\
    \ and control processes of the system to the next lower level, from the bulk water\
    \ \nsupply to main canals down to the individual farm or field. The quality of\
    \ service delivered \ndepends on a number of hardware design and management factors\
    \ and can be appraised based \non equity, flexibility, reliability and accuracy\
    \ of control and measurement. With certain levels \nof service provided to the\
    \ farm, and under given constraints, farm management can achieve \ncertain results\
    \ (e.g.: crop yields, irrigation intensity, water use efficiency). \nRAP uses\
    \ external indicators and internal indicators to evaluate irrigation system \n\
    performance (Table 5.1). External indicators examine input and outputs for a system\
    \ and they \nare expressions of various forms of efficiency relating to budgets,\
    \ water and crop yields. RAP \nexternal indicators focus on items of a typical\
    \ water balance. They give an indication whether \nit is possible to conserve\
    \ water and enhance the environment through improved water \nmanagement. Meanwhile\
    \ internal indicators examine the processes and hardware used within \nthe project.\
    \ They quantitatively assess the project management and institutional setup, system\
    \ \noperation, hardware used and water delivery service provided at all canal\
    \ levels with the \nassigned values ranging from 0 (indicating least desirable)\
    \ to 4 (denoting most desirable). \nAssesment of irrigation systems \n95 \n \n\

    \ \nThe MASSCOTE approach \n \nThe Mapping System and Services for Canal Operation\
    \ Techniques (MASSCOTE) is a \nmethodology for diagnosing canal irrigation system\
    \ performance and analyzing modernisation \nof canal operation in order to improve\
    \ the water delivery service and cost-effectiveness of \ncanal operation (Renault\
    \ et al., 2007). It has been developed, and launched, by the FAO in \nresponse\
    \ to the findings of its studies that highlighted inadequate attention to canal\
    \ operation \nas among the major causes of underperformance of many canal irrigation\
    \ systems. \nMASSCOTE is a stepwise procedure of developing a modernisation plan\
    \ starting from \nestablishing baseline information on the state and performance\
    \ of an irrigation system, \ncapacity and sensitivity of the system, perturbation,\
    \ water networks (flow route) and O&M \ncost to formulation of a vision of service-oriented\
    \ management and modernisation of canal \noperation (Figure 5.7). Mapping the\
    \ vision involves delimiting spatially manageable subunits \nbased on demand for\
    \ water delivery service and operation, defining the strategy for service \nand\
    \ operation for each unit, and integration of service-oriented management options\
    \ for the \nentire command area. \n \n5.4 Conclusion \n \nAn assessment of initial\
    \ conditions and performance of irrigation systems will provide useful \ninputs\
    \ to better design and strategic planning of the physical and management improvements\
    \ \nfor the irrigation system. A diagnostic performance assessment using a combination\
    \ of rapid \nappraisal, water budget and accounting tools (including in-situ measurements\
    \ of seepage and \npercolation), and use of a hydraulic model is deemed as an\
    \ appropriate assessment approach \nfor NIS performance. Rapid appraisal is preferred\
    \ over the standard diagnostic analysis for its \ntime- and cost-effectiveness\
    \ to give an overview of the current state and performance of \nirrigation systems\
    \ and, at times, reasonable accuracy in tracing the root of problems, allowing\
    \ \nfor identification of intervention measures that can be taken (Chambers and\
    \ Carruthers, 1986; \nBurt and Styles, 2004; Bos et al., 2005; Renault et al.,\
    \ 2007). Based on its results, initial \nhypothesis can be validated or rejected\
    \ and a more specific field study can be developed. \nAssesment of irrigation\

    \ Philippines \n \n \nThe NIS performance will be best assessed from the perspective\
    \ of the irrigation system \ndesign and management. The system approach, which\
    \ focuses on irrigation system’s inputs, \nprocess, outputs and impact and, hence,\
    \ recommended for a diagnostic assessment (Bos et al., \n2005) will be adopted.\
    \ The ultimate objective of the diagnostic assessment of NIS is to gather \nor\
    \ generate relevant information or guidelines in the design and development of\
    \ a \nmodernisation plan. The results of the performance assessment would be useful\
    \ to the NIA \nand to the research/scientific community.  \nThe Mapping System\
    \ and Services for Canal Operation Techniques (MASSCOTE) \napproach is a specific\
    \ methodology that can be applied in diagnosing the state of the physical \nstructure\
    \ and analyzing canal operation modernisation. It conforms to the nature of the\
    \ desired \nassessment approach described above, except that it does not include\
    \ hydraulic simulation. A \nservice-oriented management of improving water service\
    \ delivery is central to the \nmodernisation approach of MASSCOTE. As noted by\
    \ Ertsen (2009), the list of the pertinent \nissues in irrigation within the context\
    \ of service delivery is most complete in MASSCOTE \ndocuments. \nFurther the\
    \ rapid appraisal procedure (RAP), a diagnostic tool that quantifies both the\
    \ \nexternal and internal indicators of irrigation system performance, is embedded\
    \ in \nMASSCOTE. It examines external inputs such as water supplies and outputs\
    \ such as water \ndestinations (e.g.: evapotranspiration, runoff). It provides\
    \ a systematic examination of \nhardware and processes used to convey and distribute\
    \ water to all levels within the irrigation \nsystem, from the source to the field.\
    \ The RAP external indicators involve typical water \nbalance parameters, thus,\
    \ would give an idea whether or not it might be possible to conserve \nwater through\
    \ improved water management. Its internal indicators give a detailed perspective\
    \ \nof how the system is operated and the water delivery service that is provided\
    \ at all levels. \nThe use of both external and internal indicators is necessary\
    \ for developing a relevant \nmodernisation plan. External indicators and traditional\
    \ benchmarking indicators are \nexpressions of efficiency (ratio of output to\
    \ input) and, by themselves, only indicate that \nthings should be improved and\
    \ provide only little guidance as to what must be done to \naccomplish such improvement.\
    \ Internal indicators which examine the processes and hardware \nused within the\
    \ system are necessary to identify intervention measures to improve the external\
    \ \nindicators. \nAssesment of irrigation systems \n101 \n \n \nThe RAP was originally\
    \ developed by the Irrigation Training and Research Centre of \nCalifornia Polytechnic\
    \ University and has been used by the FAO and the World Bank for \nappraising\
    \ irrigation projects in Asia, Latin America and North Africa. Its use in irrigation\
    \ \nevaluation and appraisal is recommended by the FAO because of its rapid nature,\
    \ systematic \nprocedures, and comprehensive approach as it covers the physical,\
    \ management and \ninstitutional aspects of an irrigation system (Renault et al.,\
    \ 2007). \nIn MASSCOTE, the analysis of the behaviour of irrigation structures\
    \ is done through \nthe assessment of their sensitivity: (1) for each type of\
    \ main structure taken in isolation; (2) \nfor a combination of associated structures;\
    \ (3) at the reach and subsystem levels. The \nsensitivity of the flow control\
    \ structures is defined as the ratio of a rate of change in output to \nthe rate\
    \ of change in the input. The input and output refer to either water level or\
    \ discharge, \ndepending on the function of the structure. The sensitivity analysis\
    \ approach has also been \nproposed by a number of authors (Renault, 1999: Renault,\
    \ 2001; Kouchakzadeh and \nMontazar, 2005) as an intermediate approach between\
    \ the simple but limited steady state \napproach and the comprehensive but complex\
    \ unsteady state approach. While hydraulic \nmodels can also be used, sensitivity\
    \ analysis is considered a practical approach that makes \nmore explicit the behaviour\
    \ of irrigation structures (Renault et al., 2007; Renault, 2008). \n \n \n \n\
    6. REHABILITATION OF NATIONAL IRRIGATION \nSYSTEMS \n \n6.1 Overview on rehabilitation\
    \ \n \nThe major irrigation development projects in the 1970s included construction\
    \ of new \nirrigation structures as well as rehabilitation and improvement works\
    \ of existing individual \nirrigation systems (Table 6.1, Figures 6.1 and 6.2,\
    \ Annex C). These projects were mainly \nfunded by foreign financial institutions,\
    \ especially prior to 2000. Rehabilitation and \nimprovement projects were carried\
    \ out to either achieve 100% irrigation coverage of the \nservice area; extension\
    \ of the service areas, integration of the existing systems to form parts of \n\
    the new, bigger irrigation system or multi-purpose water development projects\
    \ or a \ncombination of any of these objectives. The major projects focusing on\
    \ rehabilitation and \nimprovement of irrigation systems in the country started\
    \ in the late 1970s. Among the first of \nthese projects were the Laguna de Bay\
    \ Irrigation Project, Second Laguna de Bay Irrigation \nProject and the first\
    \ and second Irrigation Operations Support Projects implemented in Sta. \nMaria\
    \ RIS, Balanac RIS and in both systems, respectively. \nThe main criticism on\
    \ rehabilitation stemmed from the perceived frequent needs to \nrehabilitate the\
    \ existing NIS and the insignificant increase in cropping intensities. Despite\
    \ of \ncontinuing rehabilitation and improvement works, often combined with a\
    \ notion of \nparticipatory irrigation management, the NIA data show that the\
    \ areas irrigated by the NIS for \nthe period 2000-2014 averaged 73 and 71% for\
    \ the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The \ncorresponding cropping intensity\
    \ was 144%. David (2008, 2009) estimated even a lower dry \nseason irrigation\
    \ intensity in the order of 50-60% of the design irrigation service area. \nThe\
    \ apparent norm of lower actual area served by NIS has been attributed to \nshortcomings\
    \ either in the design, technology, system operation and maintenance or to a \n\
    combination of these factors. David et al. (2012a) concluded that the low dry\
    \ season irrigation \nintensities of the four canal irrigation systems in Ilocos\
    \ Norte were mainly due to design \nshortcomings in the headworks. These shortcomings\
    \ included underestimation of flood flows \nand sediment loads, inadequate provision\
    \ for sediment control and underestimation of \nreservoir inflow and outflow hydrographs.\
    \ The results of their complementary study on nine \n104  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nNIS (David et\
    \ al., 2012b) showed that the lower percolation rates used during the design stage\
    \ \nof the project resulted in the gross underestimation of irrigation water requirement\
    \ and, hence, \ndesign canal discharge capacities. David (2003) and David et al.\
    \ (2012a, 2012b) argued that \nthe insignificant impact of rehabilitation efforts\
    \ has been mainly due to the adopted approach \nof restoring the original physical\
    \ structure without rectifying unrealistic design considerations. \n \nTable 6.1.\

    \ well such factors are assessed and adjustments are made in the rehabilitation\
    \ \ndesigns. \nIn this chapter, the process, nature and impacts of the rehabilitation\
    \ approach adopted in \nthe NIS in the Philippines will be examined. The first\
    \ objective of this examination was to \nassess the impact of rehabilitation in\
    \ terms of maintaining the irrigation service area and \nclosing the gap between\
    \ the actual area irrigated and the design service area. The other \nobjective\
    \ was to identify effective improvement practices and pitfalls of the adopted\
    \ \nrehabilitation approach so as to provide feedback for an improved irrigation\
    \ modernisation \napproach, including enrichment of the available baseline information\
    \ for planning irrigation \nsystem modernisation in the Philippines. \n \n6.2\
    \ General methodology \n \nThe study analyzed the historical data on rehabilitated,\
    \ restored and newly generated service \nareas vis-a-vis the cumulative service\
    \ area and actual irrigated areas in the Philippines during \nthe wet and dry\
    \ seasons. The percentage of irrigation service areas actually served was used\
    \ \nas an indicator of the impact or performance of rehabilitation or improvement\
    \ projects. The \nvalues of this indicator were computed for the different service\
    \ area terminologies used in \nNIA reports, namely: design, developed, operated\
    \ and maintained (O&M) and firmed-up \nservice areas. The main sources of the\
    \ data for this analysis were the NIA Annual Reports, \nNIA Year End Reports to\
    \ the President of the Philippines for the years 1974 to 2012 and \nrecords provided\
    \ by the NIA Management Information Division. \nUnlike the data on the developed\
    \ and O&M service areas, the data on total area \nprovided with irrigation facilities\
    \ were not readily available. Historical data on these \naggregate values of the\
    \ design service areas of all irrigation systems that had been built would \n\
    indicate the level of irrigation development efforts carried out so far. A data\
    \ set on the \naggregated NIS 'design' service area of the country was constructed\
    \ to serve as one of the \nbenchmarks of a trend analysis. It was constructed\
    \ by using the reported O&M service area in \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation\
    \ Systems \n107 \n \n \n1979 as the starting value. The 'design' service areas\
    \ for succeeding years were computed by \nadding the reported new NIS service\
    \ areas generated each year thereafter. The year 1979 was \nselected because it\
    \ was the year when different terminologies pertaining to irrigation service \n\
    area approximate each other's reported values the closest.  \nThe ratios of the\
    \ irrigated area to the different service area terminologies were also \ncomputed\
    \ for each of the irrigation systems under study, namely: Agos RIS, Balanac RIS\
    \ and \nSta. Maria RIS. The data on different service area terminologies were\
    \ sourced from their \ncorresponding Irrigation Management Office and system offices.\
    \ The statistics on areas not \nirrigated by the three irrigation systems under\
    \ study were verified with respective system staff \nand irrigators association\
    \ (IA) leaders to ensure that data only included those farms where the \nirrigation\
    \ systems failed to deliver water. Hence, non-irrigation of crops due to reasons\
    \ other \nthan water-related problems did not reflect negatively on the impact\
    \ of rehabilitation efforts. \nThe program of works (POW) of the rehabilitation\
    \ projects implemented for each of the \nsystems since mid-1990s were obtained\
    \ from the concerned NIA offices. Each individual item \nof work was categorized\
    \ according to its nature or the physical component involved (Annex \nD). The\
    \ analysis also included the three foreign-assisted projects implemented during\
    \ the past \nthree decades, namely: the Second Irrigation Operations Support Project\
    \ and the Participatory \nIrrigation Development Project that covered the three\
    \ systems between 1993–1999 and 2011–\n2012, respectively; and the Water Resources\
    \ Development Project that was implemented in \nBalanac RIS from 1997–2001. \n\
    The key persons at different levels of the NIA offices (i.e., central, regional\
    \ and field \noffices) were interviewed to solicit information and insights on\
    \ the planning and \nimplementation process of rehabilitation projects. A questionnaire\
    \ was developed and used \nfor the purpose of the interviews. \nA walkthrough\
    \ from the dam or main intake structure down to the canal network of each \nNIS\
    \ was carried out to have a visual assessment of the operational status and physical\
    \ \ncondition of irrigation structures that had undergone rehabilitation and improvement.\
    \ The \noperation and maintenance staff and farmers in the area were interviewed\
    \ during the \nwalkthrough. The interview questions mostly related to the previous\
    \ rehabilitation projects, \nfunctional status of flow control structures, adequacy\
    \ of water supply, water management, and \nsystem operation practices, quality\
    \ of irrigation service and IMT, among others. \n108  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \n6.3 Definition\
    \ of terminologies \n \nA number of service area terminologies are used in NIA\
    \ reports and documents. The \ndefinition for each terminology discussed in this\
    \ thesis is given below.  \n• \ndesign service area is the area provided with\
    \ irrigation facilities and from which the \nprojections of benefits from the\
    \ irrigation system were inferred from during the project \nfeasibility and appraisal\
    \ stages; \n• \nO&M service area refers to the service area that has been turned\
    \ over by the design and \nengineering unit of the NIA to the operations unit\
    \ for actual operation; \n• \nnew generated area refers to the design service\
    \ area of newly built irrigation systems \nduring the period or year of reporting\
    \ and new area covered by extending the original \nservice areas of existing irrigation\
    \ systems. It is an addition to the total design service \narea or developed service\
    \ area reported for the previous period or year; \n• \ndeveloped NIS service areas\
    \ include the O&M service areas as well as those newly \ngenerated areas that\
    \ have not been turned over yet to the operations unit; \n• \nrehabilitated area\
    \ is a water-deficit irrigation service area where a reliable delivery of \nsufficient\
    \ water is expected as a result of repairs or improvement in the physical \nstructures\
    \ influencing the flow of water to this service area; \n• \nrestored area is a\
    \ part of the original service area that was deprived of irrigation water \nbut\
    \ can now be irrigated as result of rehabilitation or improvement works; \n• \n\
    firmed-up service area (FUSA) is defined as the estimated maximum area that can\
    \ be \nserved after unforeseen design and operational constraints as well as any\
    \ over optimism \non the estimation and delineation of the design service area\
    \ are manifested by \noperational reality. It also accounts for any shift in land\
    \ use from irrigated areas to non-\nirrigated areas or non-agricultural uses as\
    \ well as any increase in service area as result \nof area restoration and extension\
    \ works. FUSA is a system level data and was included \nin NIA Annual Reports\
    \ starting 2012; \n• \nprogrammed area refers to the area scheduled for irrigation\
    \ in the forthcoming wet and \ndry cropping seasons. It is estimated by operations\
    \ staff based on their assessment of \nwater supply availability and expected\
    \ O&M situations. \n \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation Systems \n109 \n\
    \ \n \nBoth the developed and the O&M service areas also reflect changes in area\
    \ resulting \nfrom land conversion to non-cultivated uses and permanent loss of\
    \ service area due to \ninsufficiency of water supply or inadequacy in irrigation\
    \ facilities to deliver the water. Such \nchanges account for the lower values\
    \ of reported O&M service areas and developed service \nareas compared to the\
    \ design service area. \nRehabilitation as defined by the NIA does not distinguish\
    \ between system improvement \nand conventional rehabilitation, which re-establishes\
    \ the physical design of the original \nstructure. The same convention was adopted\
    \ in the succeeding discussion for this Chapter. \n \n6.4 Magnitude and impacts\
    \ of rehabilitation or improvement projects \n \nThe total rehabilitated and restored\
    \ service areas of NIS and communal irrigation systems \n(CIS) for the period\
    \ from 1980 to 2014 totalled almost 4.8 million ha (Table 6.2). The average \n\
    rehabilitation and restoration efforts in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s covered 113,000\
    \ ha yr-1, \n112,000 ha yr-1 and 168,000 ha yr-1, respectively. These efforts\
    \ covered 195,000 ha yr-1 during \nthe past five years (2010–2014). \nThe information\
    \ in Table 6.2 points some questions with respect to the efficiency of \nplanning\
    \ and implementation of canal irrigation projects. During the same period, the\
    \ new \nservice area generated by constructing new NIS and CIS and expanding the\
    \ areas of existing \nNIS and CIS beyond the original design area was almost 849,000\
    \ ha. Meanwhile, the \ncombined net increase of developed irrigation service areas\
    \ of these systems was about \n563,000 ha. It is about 66% of the new service\
    \ area provided with these irrigation facilities \nduring the same period. This\
    \ would mean that about 285,000 ha were lost to irrigation despite \nthe significant\
    \ rehabilitation efforts carried out to maintain the irrigation service area.\
    \ \nAlmost 80% (3.7 million ha) of the combined NIS and CIS service areas rehabilitated\
    \ \nand restored were NIS service areas (Figure 6.3). The average NIS rehabilitation\
    \ and \nrestoration efforts in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s covered about 94,500\
    \ ha yr-1, 94,900 ha yr-1 \nand 122,200 ha yr-1, respectively. For the period\
    \ 2010–2014 these efforts covered 141,200 ha \nyr-1. This advantage of NIS over\
    \ CIS in terms of magnitude of rehabilitation efforts resulted in \na lesser NIS\
    \ service area lost to irrigation of about 101,400 ha than that of CIS. The NIS\
    \ \nservice area lost was about 23% of the new NIS service area generated during\
    \ that period. \n110  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\

    \ widest gap with the 'design' service area. Such gap is due to the fact that\
    \ the design \nservice area is a fixed value for a given NIS while the values\
    \ for the other service area \nterminologies are adjusted periodically to account\
    \ for lands that were permanently excised out \nof the service area due to conversion\
    \ to non-irrigated uses or failure of irrigation service. \n \n \nFigure 6.4.\
    \ NIS service areas by different terminologies, rehabilitated and restored areas\

    \ actual area irrigated by NIS nationwide ranged from \n57-65% of the \"design\"\
    \ service area with average values of 62% and 61% for the wet season \nand dry\
    \ season, respectively (Figure 6.5). The corresponding annual irrigation intensity\
    \ of \n123% was much less than the 160-200% levels projected during project planning\
    \ stages. The \npercentages of irrigated area with respect to the design area\
    \ were the lowest among their \ncorresponding values in the case of the O&M design\
    \ and developed service areas. This is \nbecause the design area is fixed for\
    \ a given system while developed and O&M are adjusted \nfrom time to time. Such\
    \ adjustments tend to distort the trends. The percentages of design area \nirrigated\

    \ of the O&M service area irrigated ranged from 67-81% with an \naverage of 73%\
    \ for the wet season and 71% for the dry season. On average, they were 10% \n\
    higher than those of the 'design' service area. However, the average annual irrigation\
    \ intensity \nremained below the projected level at 144%. In terms of the developed\
    \ service, the actual area \nirrigated ranged from 67-73%, with average values\
    \ of 71 and 69% for the wet and dry \nseasons, and average cropping intensity\
    \ of 140%. \nIt is noteworthy that the irrigation intensity associated with O&M\
    \ and developed service \nareas remained below the level projected in the design\
    \ despite the periodic reduction in the \noriginal service area. The trend of\
    \ lower-than-projected irrigation intensities despite an \naverage rehabilitation\
    \ frequency of once in six to seven years is symptomatic for \nshortcomings in\
    \ the design and management of irrigation systems. It also casts doubt on the\
    \ \neffectiveness of the rehabilitation efforts. \nIn general, higher percentages\
    \ of service area actually irrigated were achieved during \nthe wet season than\
    \ during the dry season for each service area terminology. This trend was \nmore\
    \ pronounced during 1980s to late 1990s. Smaller differences in actual area irrigated\
    \ \nbetween the two cropping seasons can be observed starting 2000 as the values\
    \ for the dry \nseason gradually increased. \nEstablishing the reasons for the\
    \ trend of increasing percentages of dry season irrigated \narea was beyond the\
    \ scope of this study. However, it is reasonable to assume that much of the \n\
    increase can be attributed to the growing popularity of shallow tubewell (STW)\
    \ irrigation in \nNIS service areas that suffer from inadequacy of surface water\
    \ supply. Beginning early 1990s, \nthe STWs grew at a fast rate. The Department\
    \ of Agriculture and the NIA launched programs \npromoting the installation of\
    \ tubewells in NIS service areas. In the 2002 Census of \nAgriculture, the farm\
    \ areas reporting presence of individual irrigation systems (primarily \ntubewells)\
    \ totalled over a million ha. \nThe apparent trend of decreasing percentages of\
    \ irrigated area during the wet season \ncould be due to the following: a shift\
    \ in cropping calendars among farmers with STW towards \nthe less risky months\
    \ from typhoons and floods; changing hydrographs; and the increasing \nincidence\
    \ of flooding and siltation of canal irrigation service areas. The latter exacerbate\
    \ \ndamages to headworks and major canal systems and weaknesses in operation,\
    \ management \nand flow control structures of irrigation systems to deal with\
    \ extreme rain events. \n114  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \n6.5 Planning and implementation process of\
    \ rehabilitation projects \n \nIrrigation development and management in the country\
    \ is the primary responsibility of the \nNIA. The NIA has three levels of offices\
    \ in carrying out this mandate, namely: Central Office \n(CO), Regional Irrigation\
    \ Office (RIO) and Irrigation Management Office (IMO). The CO \nissues guidelines\
    \ and policies and exercises control over field operations nationwide. The RIO\
    \ \nimplement the ensuing plans, programs and policies of the NIA in their respective\
    \ region, \nwhich is composed of a number of provinces. The IMO are responsible\
    \ for the construction \nand rehabilitation of irrigation systems in their respective\
    \ province or cluster of provinces, \nand for the implementation of the system\
    \ O&M plans in collaboration with the farmer-\nirrigators. Foreign-assisted irrigation\
    \ projects are implemented through the Project \nManagement Offices (PMO) which\
    \ are created and are co-terminus with their respective \nprojects. There are\
    \ 14 RIOs and 51 IMOs nationwide. The number of PMOs varies depending \non the\
    \ number of on-going foreign-assisted projects.  \nThe planning of rehabilitation\
    \ projects involves the CO, RIOs and IMOs. Each of these \noffices has an engineering\
    \ and operations group that carries out the work involved in \nrehabilitation\
    \ projects. At the CO level, locally funded rehabilitation projects are handled\
    \ by \nits System Management Division while foreign-assisted and large or special\
    \ rehabilitation \nprojects are handled by its Engineering Department. The Planning\
    \ and Programming Division \nof CO administers the budget allocation and prioritization\
    \ process. \nProposals on rehabilitation and system improvement basically originate\
    \ from an IMO \n(Figure 6.6). Depending on the physical component to be rehabilitated\
    \ and the associated cost, \nPOW and detailed engineering of proposed rehabilitation\
    \ projects are carried out either solely \nby the IMO or in collaboration with\
    \ the RIO or CO. Per Memorandum Circular 68 on \nDelegated Authorities of NIA\
    \ officials issued in 2010, the IMOs and RIOs have basically the \nsame delegated\
    \ authorities concerning project engineering designs, plans and drawings which\
    \ \ninclude the following: (1) farm-level facilities and parcellation maps of\
    \ new national \nirrigation projects; (2) diversion dams lower than 2.5 m high\
    \ and with drainage area of 10 km2 \nor less; (3) canal and drainage structures\
    \ costing less than PhP 25 million per structure; (4) \nmain intake structures\
    \ with service area of not more than 1,000 ha; (5) repair of river \nprotection\
    \ works/dikes; (6) repair of roads and appurtenant structures; (7) detailed design\
    \ of \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation Systems \n115 \n \n \ndiversion dams\
    \ to be rehabilitated; (8) rehabilitation of canals and hydraulic structures.\
    \ In the \ncase of the NIS studied, the IMO prepares the engineering aspects of\
    \ the proposals while \nengineers of the RIO review them or provide technical\
    \ backstopping in the preparation. \n \n \nFigure 6.6. Schematic of the project\

    \ involvement usually includes identification of rehabilitation needs and \npreparation\
    \ of the Memorandum of Agreement. In the case of the three NIS studies, \nidentification\
    \ and preliminary prioritization of rehabilitation needs is a joint undertaking\
    \ of \nthe system office of IMO and IA leaders. The irrigation system superintendent\
    \ recommends \nthe list of rehabilitation needs to the IMO head, who will endorse\
    \ the projects to their \nEngineering Division. \nEach IMO submits its priority\
    \ list of proposed rehabilitation projects to the RIO, which \nin turn makes its\
    \ list of priority rehabilitation projects of the region from the proposals \n\
    forwarded by the different IMOs it oversees. The RIOs submit their lists to the\
    \ CO when there \nis a call for submission of rehabilitation project proposals\
    \ by the latter. The CO conducts \ndeliberation of project proposals with project\
    \ proponents at the RIO level. A priority \nallocation of funds for rehabilitation\
    \ among the RIO is agreed upon based on a set of criteria. \nThe criteria for\
    \ prioritization may include spatial extent of the area to be rehabilitated or\
    \ \ngenerated, adequacy of water supply for the project area, whether or not the\
    \ irrigation system \nis situated in priority rice areas, urgency of rehabilitation\
    \ to avoid further deterioration of the \nirrigation facilities, compliance with\
    \ the set cost guidelines for the different rehabilitation \nwork categories,\
    \ least investment cost per hectare and willingness and capability of the \nfarmers\
    \ to manage O&M after rehabilitation. \nIn evaluating the relative merits of the\
    \ proposals, the CO relies on the RIOs and IMOs \nfor the accuracy of some of\
    \ the data such as adequacy of water supply for the proposed \nproject and spatial\
    \ extent of the area that can be rehabilitated, restored or generated. More \n\
    weight is given to rehabilitation or improvement projects that will result in\
    \ larger service area \nmaintained or added to the total irrigated area of the\
    \ country. Political consideration is said to \nbe a factor also in the prioritization\
    \ of rehabilitation projects. The CO, eventually, makes the \nfinal selection\
    \ of projects to be funded. \nTogether with other large projects or projects of\
    \ special nature initiated by the CO itself, \nthe CO prepares and submits a NIA\
    \ Irrigation Program or Budget Proposal to the Department \nof Agriculture (DA).\
    \ The DA, where the NIA is an attached agency, submits the proposal to \nthe Department\
    \ of Budget and Management (DBM) that prepares and submits a National \nExpenditure\
    \ (NEP) to the President of the Philippines and informs the CO about the NEP.\
    \ The \nPresident approves and submits the NEP to the Philippine Congress who\
    \ legislates and \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation Systems \n117 \n \n \n\
    approves the national budget (General Appropriation Act). While waiting for the\
    \ enactment of \nthe budget, the CO revises or finalizes its irrigation program\
    \ based on the NEP and informs \nthe concerned RIOs and PMOs, which in turn, finalize\
    \ their POWs accordingly. The project \nproponents start the bidding process if\
    \ the final POW worth less than PhP 40 million (US$ \n920,000 as of October 2013).\
    \ Otherwise, it is first submitted to CO for evaluation and \napproval. Once the\
    \ national budget is passed by Congress and approved by the President, the \n\
    DBM notifies the CO and DA and issues a notice of funds availability. Concerned\
    \ project \nproponents will proceed with the awarding of contract and issuance\
    \ of notice to proceed to the \nwinning bidders for the project construction.\
    \ For foreign-assisted projects, bids resolutions are \nsubmitted to the lending\
    \ institution for approval prior to awarding and signing of a contract. \nThe\
    \ implementation of rehabilitation projects is a responsibility of the IMO. It\
    \ \nsupervises the construction and accepts the completed work. The RIO or PMO\
    \ coordinates \nwith IMO in the preparation of financial and physical accomplishment\
    \ reports and contractors' \nprogress billing. The CO processes and effects payments\
    \ and submits a statement of \nexpenditure to DA and DBM. \nAt present, monitoring\
    \ of project implementation and evaluation of the \naccomplishments of targets\
    \ or objectives of completed projects is not part of the process of \nrehabilitation.\
    \ Unlike in the case of foreign-assisted projects where review missions go to\
    \ the \nfield, higher offices of NIA rely on reports from their implementing offices\
    \ regarding project \ncompletion. Impact evaluation after full project development\
    \ stage is also not part of the \nrehabilitation program. \nThe benefits of involving\
    \ the IAs in the planning and implementation process were well \nrecognized by\
    \ the NIA staff interviewed. The involvement of IAs is basically limited to \n\
    identification of rehabilitation needs. \nThough there is recognition of water\
    \ adequacy as an important criterion in planning \nirrigation development and\
    \ rehabilitation work, thorough technical assessments of water \nsupply availability\
    \ are not among the priority undertakings currently pursued by NIA. In the \n\
    case of the three NIS studied measurement of river flow at diversion points has\
    \ not been done \nfor the past three decades. While water diverted for irrigation\
    \ is being measured in Sta. Maria \nRIS at the initiative of its IA, it has not\
    \ been measured in Agos RIS and Balanac RIS. \nEngineers and technical staff of\
    \ IMO based their estimates of water adequacy for a proposed \n118  \nModernisation\
    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nproject\
    \ on their field experience or observation in the past. The RIO relies on the\
    \ IMO for the \ncorrectness of such information. Without river flow gauging activities\
    \ in most NIS, the \nemphasis on water adequacy criterion would be reduced to\
    \ just a lip service. \nIt was gathered from the interviews that there was a general\
    \ tendency of the project \nproponents to focus their system improvement plans\
    \ to rehabilitation works with apparent \nlarge target area in order to bring\
    \ the cost per hectare within the cost guidelines set by the CO. \nThe least investment\
    \ cost criterion combined with the emphasis on total service expansion \nmight\
    \ be counterproductive as these would screen out rehabilitation or improvement\
    \ works \nwith relatively high initial investment even though they are more cost-effective\
    \ in the long \nrun. \n \n6.6 Nature and impact of rehabilitation: a system level\
    \ study \n \n6.6.1 \nMagnitude of rehabilitation \n \nThe magnitude of rehabilitation\
    \ efforts carried out in Balanac RIS, Agos RIS and Sta. Maria \nRIS during the\
    \ period from 2000 to 2014 were at least 780 ha yr-1, 440 ha yr-1 and 330 ha yr-1,\
    \ \nrespectively (Table 6.3). These rates accounted for about 76% of FUSA of Balanac\
    \ RIS and \n34% of FUSA of Agos RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. \n \n6.6.2 \nNature of\
    \ rehabilitation \n \nLining of canals was the most frequent and most invested\
    \ work, accounting for about 40-60% \nof the total rehabilitation expenses for\
    \ each NIS (Figures 6.7 and 6.8). Canal lining materials \nused included class\
    \ B concrete mix, concrete hollow blocks and grouted riprap. The first two \n\
    types of lining materials were the most prevalently used in canal lining works\
    \ for Sta. Maria \nRIS, while grouted riprap was most common in Balanac RIS. In\
    \ most cases, the canal lining \nworks were carried out on earthen canals of the\
    \ three NIS. The few exceptions were the canal \nre-lining works in Balanac RIS.\
    \ \n \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation Systems \n119 \n \n \nHeadworks,\
    \ roads and canal structures were among the next three most invested projects\
    \ \nin the three NIS. They each comprised less than 10% of the total investment\
    \ for respective \nsystems with the exception of the dams of Balanac RIS and Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS and the road in \nSta. Maria RIS, which accounted for 39%, 12% and\
    \ 16%, respectively. Headwork \nrehabilitation and improvements in Balanac RIS\
    \ involved construction of an upstream \nprotection wall and additional length\
    \ of the crest and apron of the dam, provision of \nmechanical lifting mechanism\
    \ for sluice gates, installation of safety railings and repairs of the \nsluice\
    \ and main intake gates. In Sta. Maria RIS and Agos RIS, headwork rehabilitation\
    \ and \nimprovements included construction of approach protection walls or dikes,\
    \ river channelling \nand repairs of main intake gates. They also involved brush\
    \ damming and lengthening of dam \naprons for Agos RIS and Sta. Maria RIS, respectively.\

    \ Systems \n121 \n \n \nThe rehabilitation and improvement projects carried out\
    \ for the three NIS were mainly \naimed at maintaining their respective service\
    \ areas as implied in each project's reported \naccomplishments. They were carried\
    \ out with an end view of enabling the physical system to \nirrigate the whole\
    \ service area. Though commonly referred to as rehabilitation, most of such \n\
    projects are mainly improvement works as they involved provision or construction\
    \ of physical \nfeatures that were not part of the original physical structures.\
    \ In a way they were interventions \nto partly rectify the perceived design shortcomings\
    \ and to adapt to changing hydrological \nregimes. \n \n \nFigure 6.8. Deflated\

    \ \n \nThe provision of concrete lining on earthen canals and the installation\
    \ of check gates to \nreuse irrigation water or to divert additional water from\
    \ creeks crossing the service area were \ninterventions aimed at decreasing water\
    \ conveyance losses and augmenting water supply, \nrespectively. Systems officials\
    \ and farmers deemed canal lining as means of improving \nconveyance efficiency\
    \ and shortening the travel time of irrigation water. However, assessment \nof\
    \ percolation and seepage rates, water supply adequacy and canal discharge capacity\
    \ were \nnot among the factors considered in canal lining project proposals. \n\

    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nThe proportional weirs were constructed to\
    \ replace the dilapidated, original spindle type \nvertical gates installed at\
    \ major branching points of Balanac RIS, to simplify the system \noperations to\
    \ distribute water. However, they were vandalized with significant length of their\
    \ \ncrests destroyed. Such vandalisms reflected disharmony among farmers and system\
    \ officials \non the newly adopted mode of water distribution. \nCanal desilting,\
    \ which was relatively prevalent in Agos RIS, is the result of \ninsufficiently\
    \ taking into consideration in the original system design and subsequent \nrehabilitation\
    \ or improvement works, the sediment load that would be expected especially for\
    \ \njust a barrel-type main intake structure like that of the Agos RIS. However,\
    \ provision of a silt \nexcluder or any other structure to trap the silt and minimize\
    \ its entry into the canal network \nwas neither among the investment made in\
    \ at least the past 20 years nor included in an on-\ngoing foreign-assisted project\
    \ in Agos RIS. \nThe gabion dikes and concrete walls at the approaches of the\
    \ headwork were \nconstructed to protect the dams from strong floods. The construction\
    \ of additional length of \nthe crest of the diversion dam of Balanac RIS became\
    \ an urgent task in 2010 for the IMO in-\ncharge of the system. The damage caused\
    \ by the flood spawned by a strong typhoon in that \nyear had seriously compromised\
    \ the stability of the dam. The construction of additional crest \nlength to better\
    \ anchor the dam on one side of the river bank was completed in 2013. This was\
    \ \nthe fourth time a crest segment of the dam was added. \nThe typhoon event\
    \ underscored the need for a more reliable assessment of probable \nflood magnitudes\
    \ for Balanac River for the purpose of planning and design of rehabilitation or\
    \ \nimprovement works. However, an analysis that would provide insights in the\
    \ magnitudes of \nflood events associated with different chances of occurrence\
    \ for the Balanac River has yet to \nbe done. River gauging or discharge measurement\
    \ has not been done since 1980. \nIn terms of investment made, access roads were\
    \ given more emphasis than some key \nphysical components of the irrigation systems.\
    \ Roads had a much higher level of investment \nthan the headwork and canal structures\
    \ in Sta. Maria RIS. It also had higher investment than \ncanal structures in\
    \ Balanac RIS. Road projects have positive externalities for the local \npopulation.\
    \ However, unlike the physical structures of irrigation systems, they have no\
    \ direct \ncontribution to the goal of expanding the actual area irrigated. \n\
    \ \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation Systems \n123 \n \n \nThere was a significant\
    \ difference in terms of rehabilitation expenses and magnitude \namong the three\
    \ systems during the past 16 years (2000–2015). Balanac RIS had the highest \n\
    rehabilitation expenses and highest reported total area rehabilitated while Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS had \nthe least for both. \n \n6.6.3 \nImpacts of rehabilitation \n\
    \ \nThe impacts of the rehabilitation and improvement projects carried out for\
    \ the three NIS were \nassessed in terms of the trend in service area and actual\
    \ irrigated area during the period 2000–\n2015 (Table 6.4). Agos RIS had the highest\
    \ percentages of the design service area actually \nirrigated during both seasons,\
    \ with average values of 80% and 81% for the wet season and dry \nseason, respectively.\
    \ For the Balanac RIS, the corresponding percentages for the wet and dry \nseasons\
    \ were 70% and 76%, respectively. Only about 33% and 34% of the design service\
    \ area \nof the Santa Maria RIS was irrigated during wet and dry seasons, respectively.\
    \ The low \npercentage of irrigated area of Sta. Maria RIS was attributed by farmers\
    \ and NIA staff to \ninadequacy of water supply from the dam to irrigate the whole\
    \ design service area. \nIt is interesting to note that although the FUSA is significantly\
    \ smaller than the design \nservice area and adjusted periodically for design\
    \ and operational constraints as manifested by \noperational reality, there was\
    \ no season in any of the three systems that an entire FUSA has \nbeen served\
    \ during the past 10 years. The three NIS more than 80% of their FUSA except \n\
    during the 2015 dry and 2010 wet seasons for Balanac RIS and 2015 wet season for\
    \ Sta. \nMaria RIS. The dam of Balanac RIS was heavily damaged by the typhoon\
    \ and only 69% of its \nFUSA was irrigated during the 2010 dry season. The low\
    \ percentages of FUSA actually \nirrigated in these systems in 2015 were attributed\
    \ to the El Niño-induced drought. \nAgos RIS had the highest percentages of actual\
    \ area irrigated, averaging more than 90% \nfor both cropping seasons, except\
    \ in 2006. The main intake structure and upstream portion of \nthe main canal\
    \ of Agos RIS were heavily silted and rendered inoperable during the 2005 dry\
    \ \nseason by the record-high flash flood in late 2004. \n \n \n \n124  \nModernisation\

    There was no discernible change in the trend of actual area irrigated in Balanac\
    \ RIS \nexcept in 2010 when the damaged dam resulted in a steep drop in the actual\
    \ area irrigated \nduring the 2010 dry season. The rehabilitation and improvement\
    \ works during the period from \n2000 to 2015 in the Balanac RIS covered at least\
    \ 12,400 ha, which was around 12 times its \nFUSA. Yet, these considerable efforts\
    \ had at best helped maintain an average actual irrigated \narea of around 870\
    \ ha during the 2006–2015 period or 86% of its FUSA. As of 2015, the dry \nseason\
    \ actual areas irrigated were way below their levels prior to 2010. Meanwhile,\
    \ the \npercentages of FUSA actually irrigated during the wet season were declining\
    \ in recent years. \nA decreasing trend in the actual area irrigated can be observed\
    \ in Agos RIS in both \nseasons during the period from 2000 to 2005. An abrupt\
    \ drop in actual area irrigated from \n2005 to 2006 was attributed to damage to\
    \ the physical structures caused by a flash flood event \nRehabilitation of National\
    \ Irrigation Systems \n125 \n \n \nin late 2004. The flash flood also resulted\
    \ in heavy siltation of canals and service area and, \nconsequently non-cultivation\
    \ of many farms during the subsequent cropping seasons. A \ngradual recovery from\
    \ the effects of the flash flood can be observed from 2006 onwards. A \ntotal\
    \ of at least 5,700 ha (or about four times the service area) has been rehabilitated\
    \ and \nrestored and 30 ha has been generated during the period from 2006–2015.\
    \ Starting 2013 the \nactual area irrigated was 1,284 ha, the highest value achieved\
    \ in Agos RIS for the 2000-2015 \nperiod. \nThere was no discernible change in\
    \ the actual area irrigated in the Sta. Maria RIS. With \nthe rehabilitation and\
    \ restoration efforts during 2000–2015 that covered about 5,300 ha, or at \nleast\
    \ five times of its FUSA, Sta. Maria RIS was able to irrigate an average of at\
    \ least 827 ha \nor 85% of its FUSA during the 2006-20015 period. \nThe disparity\
    \ between rehabilitation efforts and system performance among the three \nNIS\
    \ is noteworthy. Balanac RIS had the highest total area rehabilitated and most\
    \ \nrehabilitation investments. Yet, it had the lowest percentage of FUSA actually\
    \ irrigated. \nThere are notable differences in the trends of data on actual area\
    \ irrigated between that \nof the national level and the NIS studied. The percentages\
    \ of the service area actually irrigated \nfor both cropping seasons were significantly\
    \ higher than the national average, which is about \n73% and 71% during the wet\
    \ season and dry season, respectively. Also, the actual area \nirrigated during\
    \ the dry season for each of these three NIS was, in general, either higher or\
    \ \nequal to its corresponding wet season value. In contrast, the wet season irrigated\
    \ area of \nexisting NIS in the country remained consistently higher than that\
    \ of the dry season. \nIn general, it is expected that an irrigation system can\
    \ irrigate a larger area during the \nwet season due to higher rainfall and river\
    \ flows at the diversion sites. Some of the possible \nfactors that resulted in\
    \ the observed reverse trend for the three NIS could include the \nfollowing:\
    \ site-specific constraints (e.g., inundation during monsoon months); potentials\
    \ to \naddress limitations on surface water supply (presence of creeks and groundwater\
    \ for \naugmenting water supply); availability of irrigation technologies (well\
    \ drilling and \ndevelopment); and the capability and willingness of system managers\
    \ and farmers to adopt an \nappropriate technology or course of actions. \n \n\
    \ \n126  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nIn the sample NIS, some of the above mentioned factors have been circumvented\
    \ to \nsome extent. The farmers downstream in Agos RIS and Balanac RIS are using\
    \ shallow \ntubewells to tap groundwater either for supplemental irrigation or\
    \ as sole source of irrigation \nwater during the dry season. Check gates were\
    \ constructed for the purpose of tapping \nadditional water from creeks and recapturing\
    \ drainage water from upstream farms for reuse in \ndownstream farms of Sta. Maria\
    \ RIS and Balanac RIS. \nThe lower actual area irrigated during the wet season\
    \ in the case of the Balanac RIS was \nattributed by NIA field personnel and farmers\
    \ to the submergence of the portions of the \nservice area bordering the Laguna\
    \ Lake during rainy months. During the wet seasons of 2008 \nto 2011, flooded\
    \ areas ranged from 46 to 300 ha of the service area. This inundation problem\
    \ \nis yet to be addressed. Meanwhile, a strategy of starting the wet season cropping\
    \ earlier than \nthe traditional practice was adopted to circumvent a similar\
    \ flooding problem in Sta. Maria \nRIS. Flood-prone rice areas are scheduled to\
    \ be irrigated and planted first so that when the \npeak of the monsoon season\
    \ comes the rice plants in these areas are already in their vegetative \nstage,\
    \ thus, have better chance of withstanding intermittent floods or submergence.\
    \ In Agos \nRIS excess water that enters the canal network drains into creeks\
    \ through a spillway adjacent \nto the intake end of inverted siphons. Escape\
    \ ways for surplus irrigation water were \nconstructed in strategic points along\
    \ the canal network. \n \n6.6.4 \nPotentials for increasing the irrigated area\
    \ and for irrigation \nmodernisation \n \nAgos River has a river basin area of\
    \ at least 879 km2 and an estimated minimum dry season \nsurplus of 67.8 MCM (million\
    \ cubic metres) and 19.1 MCM at the start of February and at the \nend of May,\
    \ respectively (NIA, 2006). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that a higher \n\
    percentage of actual area irrigated in Agos RIS is not constrained by the inadequacy\
    \ of water \nsupply at the source. This view was consistent with the view of system\
    \ officials and farmers \nthat Agos River has enough flow to meet the irrigation\
    \ requirement of the entire service area \neven during the dry season. However,\
    \ unlike Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS that both have a \ndiversion type dam,\
    \ Agos RIS has only a 2 x 2 m2 barrel opening at the river bank as main \nintake\
    \ structure. A temporary brush dam is built at the start of each dry season to\
    \ increase \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation Systems \n127 \n \n \nriver\
    \ flow into the main intake structure. The high river flows during the rainy season\
    \ wash \naway such a dam, hence the need to construct a new one. The construction\
    \ of such a brush \ndam has become the regular major activity of the NIA field\
    \ office. Such diversion method \nbecomes the limiting factor in diverting water\
    \ into the service area during the dry cropping \nseason. Also, it did not have\
    \ provision to prevent sediment transport into the main intake \nstructure. \n\
    A number of downstream canals of Agos RIS were already inoperable due to heavy\
    \ silt \ndeposit, which was exacerbated by the record-high flash food in 2004.\
    \ The silt that \naccumulated in the canals had practically buried the canals\
    \ including the flow control \nstructures. Re-canalization would be needed to\
    \ improve irrigation to downstream service area. \nMoreover, a mechanism to minimize\
    \ entry of sediment through the main intake structure or \ntrap it before it is\
    \ carried farther into the canal network would need to be put in place. \nBy design,\
    \ water supply of Sta. Maria RIS was limited. The design diversion capacity of\
    \ \n0.8 l s-1 ha-1 for Sta. Maria RIS is just about half of the 1.5 l s-1 ha-1\
    \ water requirement NIA \nadopted in its design guidelines for lowland rice irrigation.\
    \ This inherent low water supply \ncould be the main reason behind the 1,600 ha\
    \ difference between the design service area and \nthe FUSA. Even though the service\
    \ area was reduced from the original 2,580 ha to 974 ha, \nsystem officials have\
    \ not been able to irrigate the entire FUSA. They attributed this shortfall \n\
    to the low dry season flows of Sta. Maria River to meet the irrigation requirement\
    \ of the \nservice area. They are addressing their water scarcity problem by lining\
    \ the canals to increase \nconveyance efficiency, reusing drainage water from\
    \ upstream farms, staggering planting dates \nwithin the service area and by installing\
    \ water distribution structures to enforce the agreed \nirrigation schedule for\
    \ the different turnout service areas. \nPreliminary results of a complementary\
    \ study on the water balance of Sta. Maria RIS \nsuggest a relatively efficient\
    \ use of diverted water. About 108 ha of the service area is \nirrigated using\
    \ drainage water from upstream farms within the service area and nearby farms\
    \ \noutside the service area. Meanwhile, springs and minor waterways from nearby\
    \ mountains are \ntapped for irrigation water for about 78 ha of the service area.\
    \ It is evident that the potential \nfor increasing the actual area irrigated\
    \ through a more efficient use and management of \ndiverted water is quite limited.\
    \ A substantial increase in irrigated area can be realized with an \nincrease\
    \ in water supply. \n128  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nA number of springs can be found along the\
    \ foot of the mountain surrounding the \nservice area of Sta. Maria RIS. Development\
    \ of small irrigation systems that will tap spring \nwater presents an opportunity\
    \ to augment the water supply. It would be worthwhile to study \nthe feasibility\
    \ of spring development for irrigation for future improvement projects.  \nThe\
    \ quantity of water diverted for Balanac RIS is not being measured. Based on the\
    \ \nsystem profile document and field observation, there would be sufficient supply\
    \ of water into \nthe Balanac RIS to meet its irrigation requirement. This view\
    \ is supported by a common \nresponse of farmers and system officials to questions\
    \ relating to adequacy of river flows and \ndiverted water based on their own\
    \ observation and experience with the dam and canal \noperation. \nThere are compelling\
    \ reasons to assume that the cause of inability to irrigate the whole \nFUSA of\
    \ Balanac RIS during the dry season lies in water management and distribution.\
    \ \nSystem operation carried out by the NIA field staff in Balanac RIS mainly\
    \ involves opening \nand closing of gates of the main intake structure at the\
    \ dam. Basically, the system operation is \nfor continuous irrigation. Farm ditches\
    \ directly offtaking from the main through ungated \nturnouts are prevalent. Also,\
    \ many head control structures at major distribution points along \nthe main canal\
    \ are either in disrepair or missing the spindle and metal plate. Most offtakes\
    \ of \nsecondary canals and major turnouts are ungated. The use of makeshift gates\
    \ made of stop \nlogs, bamboo poles and banana trunks is common in the area. Consequently,\
    \ irrigation water \nwould be available to downstream farmers whenever it is not\
    \ needed upstream. However, this \nsetup does not work well with farmers downstream\
    \ especially during the dry season. \nDownstream farmers faulted their upstream\
    \ counterparts for diverting water much more than \nwhat is needed and for wasteful\
    \ use of diverted water. \nThe potentials for achieving full service area coverage\
    \ in Balanac RIS are in \nimprovement of management and delivery of irrigation\
    \ water. Flow control structures \nnecessary to achieve a more efficient water\
    \ management would need to be installed to help \ncurtail any unreasonable rates\
    \ of water diversion in upstream farms, thus, increase water \navailable to downstream\
    \ farms during the dry season. A rule-based water allocation scheme \naimed at\
    \ irrigating the whole service area would need to be formulated. \nBalanac RIS\
    \ had the lowest percentages of FUSA irrigated during wet seasons among \nthe\
    \ three systems studied. It also had the biggest difference in actual area irrigated\
    \ between \nRehabilitation of National Irrigation Systems \n129 \n \n \nthe wet\
    \ and dry cropping seasons. This difference was attributed to the inundation of\
    \ the \nservice area adjacent to the Laguna Lake. Pilot testing strategy adopted\
    \ by system officials \nand farmers of Sta. Maria RIS for a similar inundation\
    \ problem would be a sensible course of \naction for Balanac RIS. A shift in cropping\
    \ calendar for the downstream service area to avoid \nflood months or minimize\
    \ the detrimental effects of floods on crops would make cultivation \nof normally\
    \ submerged farms possible. \nThe lack of data on river discharge at diversion\
    \ points, diverted water for irrigation, \nrainfall and other climatic parameters\
    \ for estimation of evapotranspiration, seepage and \npercolation rates poses\
    \ a challenge to a water balance study whose results could indicate the \npotentials\
    \ for irrigated area expansion or irrigation system modernisation. Flow or head\
    \ \nmeasurements at major water control or distribution points along the canal\
    \ network and \nparcellation maps of different irrigation zones that would be\
    \ useful in identifying critical \npoints and bottlenecks in achieving water delivery\
    \ targets are non-existent. Separate studies \nwould need to be carried out first\
    \ to generate data needed as inputs in the formulation of \nmodernisation plans.\
    \ \n \n6.7 Conclusion \n \nThe continued mediocre performance of canal irrigation\
    \ systems has been a cause for an \naction in a country striving to achieve rice\
    \ self-sufficiency and food security. This \nperformance and the escalating cost\
    \ of canal irrigation development and the deterioration of \nexisting systems\
    \ were the primary reasons for the mandated public expenditure shift towards \n\
    rehabilitation and improvement of existing irrigation systems and the development\
    \ of \neffective, affordable and efficient minor irrigation systems by the Agriculture\
    \ and Fisheries \nModernisation Act. \nAvailable information on rehabilitated,\
    \ restored and actually irrigated areas suggests \nthat there are problems in\
    \ the planning, design and operation and maintenance of canal \nirrigation systems,\
    \ which are largely unaddressed during rehabilitation and improvement. \nEven\
    \ with available water supply and considerable rehabilitation efforts, the average\
    \ \npercentage of O&M service area actually irrigated in both seasons during the\
    \ past 10 years \naveraged 73%. It is compelling to examine the root cause of\
    \ these problems. \n130  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nThe inclusion of water adequacy among the\
    \ criteria for prioritization of rehabilitation \nprojects for funding approval\
    \ reflects recognition to the fact that the availability of water for \nthe proposed\
    \ rehabilitation, restoration and expansion of service area is important. Indeed,\
    \ \navailability of water is a precondition for realizing the benefits of rehabilitation\
    \ or \nimprovement works. Therefore, it needs to be ascertained before a proposal\
    \ can be considered \nin the prioritization process. The merit of the proposal\
    \ in terms of the water adequacy \ncriterion would have to be supported with a\
    \ water assessment study or water flow data. \nA strategic monitoring and evaluation\
    \ system to ensure quality of construction and to \nassess the performance of\
    \ rehabilitation projects against their stated targets would have to be \nput\
    \ in place to promote accountability among the parties involved in the project\
    \ planning, \ndesign and implementation and to serve as a feedback mechanisms\
    \ for policy- and decision \nmakers. Farmers and independent research groups or\
    \ institutions would be viable partners in a \nmonitoring and evaluation process.\
    \ \nAgos RIS, Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS had consistently higher percentages\
    \ of \nFUSA irrigated than the national average. Such a performance could be attributed\
    \ to the \nimprovement works that have addressed the apparent design shortcomings\
    \ in their respective \nsystems and also to the measures adopted to circumvent\
    \ the inherent and site-specific \nconstraints. Some of the notable improvement\
    \ efforts included the use of tubewells for \nirrigation, provision of canal structures\
    \ for drainage water reuse and water distribution and a \nshift in cropping calendar\
    \ and provision of escape way for excess water to adapt to prevailing \nweather\
    \ patterns. The experiences in rehabilitation and improvement in these three irrigation\
    \ \nsystems demonstrated what would work and provided insights of what would have\
    \ to be done \nto increase the chance of closing the gap between the service area\
    \ and the actual irrigated \narea. The case of Sta. Maria RIS showcased the utility\
    \ of flow control structures and a shift in \ncropping calendar in overcoming\
    \ its water constraints. \nA more systematic approach to rehabilitation of irrigation\
    \ systems would need to be \npursued. There is a need to develop a modernisation\
    \ plan for each irrigation system. Site-\nspecific potentials and constraints\
    \ to irrigation modernisation need to be taken into account in \nthe formulation\
    \ of such a plan. Diagnostic assessment of the physical structure and operation\
    \ \nand maintenance of irrigation systems and field validation of design values\
    \ of water balance \nparameters need to be carried out to identify constraints\
    \ and prioritize improvement options. \n \n \n7 DIAGNOSTIC ASESSMENT OF THE IRRIGATION\
    \ \nSYSTEM DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE \n \n7.1 Introduction \n \nThe continued performance\
    \ of national irrigation systems below the expected levels despite \nrehabilitation\
    \ and improvement efforts have been a subject of discussions by concerned \ngovernment\
    \ policy- and decision-makers. Many questioned what constrains the performance\
    \ \nof irrigation systems and what intervention measures should be implemented.\
    \ There have \nbeen assertions coming from different stakeholders on the reasons\
    \ of poor performance of \nirrigation systems. Irrigation professionals, academicians\
    \ and individual experts, system \noperators and farmers groups have a number\
    \ of contrary opinions on what are the problems \nand effective solutions. \n\
    While everyone would easily agree that each of the problems raised contribute\
    \ to \nmediocre performance, a consensus on what is the right approach to address\
    \ these constraints \nis hardly reached. This may be due to the fact that many\
    \ stakeholders are coming from \ndifferent viewpoints and have different expectations.\
    \ Many may have first-hand experience \nwith specific constraints or causes of\
    \ a problem at a particular tier of planning, management \nand operation of irrigation\
    \ systems. However, clear-cut common understanding of the \ninterrelations of\
    \ individual constraints and comparative contribution to the problem of poor \n\
    irrigation system performance as a whole is lacking. There is a need for a holistic\
    \ view on the \nirrigation systems to clarify the causal relationships among the\
    \ observed problems. Analysis \nof the mechanisms and processes of water delivery\
    \ at the system-level would distinguish the \nroot causes from intermediate effects.\
    \ Only after the root causes are identified an appropriate \napproach can be formulated.\
    \ \nDiagnostic assessment is a performance evaluation method specifically aimed\
    \ at \nidentifying the bottlenecks of irrigation system performance and, hence,\
    \ an appropriate \napproach and solutions to address them. It has been carried\
    \ out (Burt and Styles, 1999; Kumar \net al., 2010; Garcia-Bolanos et al., 2010;\
    \ Bruscoli et al., 2011). It is considered a crucial \nprelude in the modernisation\
    \ process (Renault et al., 2007). \n \n132  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nThe planning and formulation process\
    \ for system improvement projects in the \nPhilippines does not include a diagnostic\
    \ assessment (Delos Reyes et al., 2015). Hence, \ndiagnostic evaluation is rarely\
    \ carried out for government-funded canal irrigation systems. \nThis lack of emphasis\
    \ on the importance of a sound diagnosis of irrigation systems is \nunfortunate,\
    \ especially when the development of most canal irrigation systems represent a\
    \ \ntypical case that would greatly benefit from a diagnostic study. Most NIS\
    \ have undergone a \nmix of technical, management, policy and institutional changes\
    \ whose interplay and effects \ncould have provided leads on how the system performance\
    \ can be improved had they been \nwell understood. During different periods since\
    \ the early 1990s, irrigation development of the \ncountry was aimed at achieving\
    \ a combination of broad societal goals such as food security, \nrice self-sufficiency,\
    \ increased farming productivity and income, creation of livelihood \nopportunities\
    \ and acceleration of development in rural areas. The planning and design of \n\
    large-scale NIS projects involved foreign expertise and design guidelines and\
    \ irrigation \ntechnologies based mainly on the United States Bureau of Reclamation\
    \ standards. Implicit to \nthe design of the physical structures of these systems\
    \ were operational and institutional \nrequirements, which proved to be beyond\
    \ what the Government can sustain (World Bank, \n1982, 2006; David, 2003; Asian\
    \ Development Bank, 2007, 2011). The NIA modified and \nreplaced the physical\
    \ components of most irrigation systems as necessitated by clamours for \nimproved\
    \ water delivery, changes in water demand and allocation, shift in irrigation\
    \ \ndevelopment thrusts and policy directions of the Government, as well as, the\
    \ requirements of \ninternational financing institutions. Recent system improvement\
    \ and modernisation projects \nhave replaced the gated, adjustable flow control\
    \ structures with fixed weirs. Also, the NIA \npromotes the IMT, through which,\
    \ many of the water distribution responsibilities have been \ntransferred to farmer’s\
    \ groups. The IMT program aims for a gradual transfer of full system \nmanagement\
    \ to IAs. With such mix of changes in institutional and technical aspects of \n\
    irrigation systems, the more compelling it is to conduct system diagnosis to examine\
    \ the \ninteractions or interdependence among different system components, irrigation\
    \ water \nrequirements and system operations and to better understand the implications\
    \ of the changes \nin any of them. Consequently, the root causes can be systematically\
    \ identified. Such findings \nof diagnostic assessment are relevant inputs in\
    \ the formulation of a modernisation plan and \ndesign of system improvement works.\
    \  \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system design and performance \n133 \n\
    \ \n \nThis chapter explores the utility of coupled diagnostic assessment techniques\
    \ deemed \nrelevant in the formulation of a modernisation strategy for many NIS\
    \ in the Philippines. This \ndiagnostic technique is a combination of a design\
    \ logic framework advocated by Ankum \n(2001) and diagnostic tools used in the\
    \ mapping system and services for canal operation \ntechniques (MASSCOTE) (Renault\
    \ et al., 2007) in diagnosing the performance of small-scale \nNIS in the Philippines.\
    \ In the design logic framework, the coherence of the philosophy, \nobjectives\
    \ of system operation and design of physical structures are examined. The physical\
    \ \nand operational constraints of performance that are inherent to the system\
    \ design are \nidentified. \nThe design logic framework of analysis recognizes\
    \ the fact that irrigation systems were \nbuilt to realize a set of irrigation\
    \ objectives in particular socio-political and agro-climatic \nsettings. The water\
    \ supply availability and existing water laws, water rights or water \ndistribution\
    \ philosophy of the society for meeting irrigation need of the population shape\
    \ the \ndesign framework of irrigation systems. For a stated system objective,\
    \ certain design \nparameters, system configuration and combinations of flow control\
    \ structures are more logical \nthan the others. For example, a maximum crop production\
    \ would need reliable water supply. \nIt would necessitate a storage-type dam\
    \ in cases where the water sources have significant \nseasonal fluctuations. The\
    \ a priori rights or first-in-use rights consideration would require \nsome flow\
    \ control structures while riparian rights might not require any. Similarly, a\
    \ \nproportional sharing of water supply would mean less physical components to\
    \ regulate the \nflow.  \nAlso, the design logic framework tackles examination\
    \ of the design configuration and \ncanal structures, which largely determine\
    \ the options for operations and influences the \nhydraulic behaviour of the canal\
    \ system. In gated irrigation systems, the hydraulic \ncharacteristics and operation\
    \ of the selected combination of flow control structures can either \nfacilitate\
    \ or hamper achieving the water delivery targets. The net effect depends on how\
    \ the \ncanal structures behave under unsteady state flow conditions and perturbations\
    \ or significant \nchanges in canal discharges and water levels occurring along\
    \ a canal network as a result of \nintended or unpredicted changes in inflows\
    \ or outflows, adjustments in the setting of \nstructures, or transient flow during\
    \ distribution changes. Different types of water level control \nstructures exhibit\
    \ different levels of sensitivity or change in observed head for a given change\
    \ \n134  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nin incoming discharge. Same case is true in the sensitivities of canal\
    \ offtakes and turnouts. \nThe more sensitive structures generate or amplify perturbations\
    \ or a significant change in flow \nalong a canal network. They require more frequent\
    \ resetting or adjustments than less sensitive \nstructures to keep water delivery\
    \ within an acceptable range of the delivery targets. Ungated \nsystems and those\
    \ under the principle of proportional flow distribution do not have such \nconcerns.\
    \ \nThe diagnostic tools of MASSCOTE, which include the rapid appraisal procedure\
    \ \n(RAP) and assessments of physical capacity and hydraulic behaviour (sensitivity\
    \ and \nperturbations) of irrigation systems, are aimed at systematic and comprehensive\
    \ evaluation of \nthe performance of large-scale canal irrigation systems to modernize\
    \ canal operation (Renault \net al., 2007). They consider the water balance, internal\
    \ processes and mechanisms (hardware, \noperational procedures, management and\
    \ institutions) of water delivery at different canal \nlevels, irrigated area\
    \ and crop production in diagnosing the system performance. The actual \nperformance\
    \ of the system, as built and operated is gauged from the perspective of service-\n\
    oriented management. \nBy the nature of their respective analytical approaches,\
    \ it is deemed that a combination \nof the two techniques would lead to better\
    \ segregation of the constraints of performance with \ntheir respective root causes\
    \ – whether they are due to design, operation or unrealistic \nexpectations. The\
    \ coupled diagnostic performance assessment was carried out for Balanac \nRIS\
    \ and Sta. Maria RIS. The findings of the assessments are discussed in this chapter.\
    \ \nIdentification of the root causes of performance will help in the formulation\
    \ of appropriate \nintervention measures for consideration in the formulation\
    \ of modernisation strategies for \nthese systems and similar irrigation systems\
    \ in the country. \n \n7.2 Assessment methodology \n \nThe first part of the diagnostic\
    \ assessment critically analyzed the logical coherence of the \nstated irrigation\
    \ system objectives, design philosophy, flow control structures, system \noperations,\
    \ water supply and water delivery targets of Balanac and Sta. Maria RIS based\
    \ on \nthe analytical framework (Figure 4.4) proposed by Ankum (2001). The consistency\
    \ among \nthem was evaluated based on established logical combinations of flow\
    \ control methods \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system design and performance\
    \ \n135 \n \n \n(e.g.: upstream control, proportional control), operational objectives\
    \ of the main system (e.g.: \nmethod of water allocation to offtake service area\
    \ and method of water distribution through \nmain canals) and the stated design\
    \ philosophy (e.g.: flexible supply based on water need and \navailability, proportional\
    \ allocation of water supply based on farm size). The appropriateness \nof the\
    \ flow control structures was evaluated based on recognized logical combinations\
    \ of \nhydraulic structures to meet the stated operational objectives (imposed\
    \ or semi-demand \nallocation, splitted, intermittent or adjustable flow to offtake\
    \ service area; splitted, rotational \nflow or adjustable flow through the main\
    \ canals) and on the ease or simplicity of required \ncanal operations. The project\
    \ feasibility study and original project design documents, which \nusually contain\
    \ the required information to characterize the case study systems according to\
    \ \nthe design logic framework, were sought. The information on these documents\
    \ provided a \nperspective on what was originally intended, how well the means\
    \ can achieve the goal, and \nhow coherent the succeeding modifications or improvement\
    \ works are to the original or the \npresent objectives. Unfortunately, copies\
    \ of the project feasibility and project design \ndocuments for Balanac RIS and\
    \ Sta. Maria RIS were no longer available at the Central Office \nand field offices\
    \ of the NIA. Hence, such information was gleaned from available, more \nrecent\
    \ project documents for the system under study, design manuals or guidelines of\
    \ the \nNIA, system walkthrough, and informal interviews with design and operation\
    \ staff of NIA \nand water tenders of irrigators associations. \nThe second part\
    \ of the diagnostic assessment involved field investigation of the current \n\
    state of the physical structure and canal operation of the selected NIS. This\
    \ included the \nconduct of the first three steps in MASSCOTE: the Rapid Appraisal\
    \ Procedure (RAP), system \ncapacity and sensitivity assessments and perturbation\
    \ analysis. The required data input for the \ncalculation of RAP indicators of\
    \ system performance were gathered from system documents \nand the weather agency.\
    \ They were also obtained through interviews of irrigation managers, \noperation\
    \ staff, irrigators associations and system walkthroughs. The interview questions\
    \ \nrelated to their perceptions on how the irrigation system functions – what\
    \ levels of irrigation \nservice the main canal delivers, what the operators do\
    \ and how water reaches individual \nfarmers. A walk through the canal network,\
    \ from the dam to the end checks of main canals \nand second-level canals or major\
    \ bifurcation canals were carried out for each NIS. The actual \nmethods of operation,\
    \ level of maintenance and general condition of the hardware or physical \n136\
    \  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nstructures (headwork, canals and flow control structures) were observed\
    \ during the \nwalkthroughs. The system capacity was assessed in terms of the\
    \ physical capacities of the \nirrigation system to perform its functions of conveyance,\
    \ diversion, division, water level \nregulation, flow measurement, storage and\
    \ transfer capacity. The actual capacity for each \nfunction was compared to the\
    \ design capacity and the current required capacity. Also, the \norigins of perturbations\
    \ were identified for the purpose of determining whether the main canal \nis self-reacting\
    \ or if specific interventions (e.g.: adjustments in system operations and \n\
    management or changes in flow control structures) must be carried out to improve\
    \ the water \ndistribution. \n \n7.3 Assessment of the consistency among the design\
    \ philosophy, \noperational objectives and physical structure of the irrigation\
    \ system \n \nA review on the general guidelines and practices on irrigation system\
    \ planning and design \nwas carried out to gain insights on the design philosophies\
    \ and goals adopted in the country. \nThe findings include the following design\
    \ considerations and objectives: \n• \nrice monoculture. Self-sufficiency in rice,\
    \ the staple food in the country, has been the \npolicy of the Government. Canal\
    \ irrigation systems are designed to supply water for \npaddy rice cultivation\
    \ during the wet and dry cropping seasons; \n• \nproductive irrigation. The crop\
    \ water requirement during periods of favourable climatic \nconditions to rice\
    \ production was the foremost consideration in determining the \ncapacities of\
    \ canals and flow control structures. This implies that the irrigation systems\
    \ \nwere intended for productive irrigation, that is, to provide water for optimum\
    \ crop \ngrowth; \n• \ndry season as the design main irrigation season. The highest\
    \ irrigation water \nrequirement for a unit duration of the cropping pattern is\
    \ considered as the design \nirrigation water requirement. As the country receives\
    \ abundant rainfall during the wet \nseason, the highest irrigation water requirement\
    \ is usually obtained during the dry \ncropping months. This design approach suggests\
    \ that the irrigation system is aimed at \nsatisfying the crop water requirement\
    \ in the service area during the dry season; \n \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation\
    \ system design and performance \n137 \n \n \n• \nequitable supply and flexible\
    \ supply. The use of water duty (flow rate per ha) as a \ndesign criterion suggests\
    \ a design philosophy of equitable supply of irrigation water to a \nunit area.\
    \ Canals and flow control structures are designed to operate under two flow \n\
    regimes: high-flow condition during land soaking and preparation; and low-flow\
    \ \ncondition during the crop maintenance period. Adjustable gates are selected\
    \ to effect \nthis amenability for flexible water delivery; \n• \nimposed allocation\
    \ and upstream control. The final water distribution plan and \noperational procedures\
    \ are decided by system officials. The NIA system operators are \nresponsible\
    \ for managing the dam and main intake operation and have the authority on \n\
    the control of head gates and other flow control structures along the main canal\
    \ and \nother major conveyance canals, which include the second- and third-level\
    \ canals in \nmedium- to large-scale systems. Cross-regulators are used to maintain\
    \ the upstream \nwater level at the levels that correspond to the target offtake\
    \ or turnout discharges. \nFlumes and weirs were constructed for discharge measurement.\
    \ \n \n7.3.1 \nThe original design of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS \n \nThe\
    \ Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS schemes were designed to irrigate paddy or lowland\
    \ rice \nin their respective municipalities. Their diversion dams are of run-of-the-river\
    \ type with at \nmost two manually operated vertical steel gates for the culvert-type\
    \ main intake structure and \nsluice gates for flushing out sediments (Figures\
    \ 7.1-7.3). Balanac RIS has a bifurcating canal \nlayout (Figure 7.4) while Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS has a hierarchical one (Figure 7.5). They were \ndesigned as gated\
    \ system as indicated by gated flow control structures along their respective\
    \ \ncanal networks and flow measurement structures upstream of secondary canals\
    \ and at some \npoints along the main canal. \nA combination of concrete pipe\
    \ farm turnout, concrete pipe bifurcating canal intake and \ncross regulator or\
    \ water level control were originally constructed at major bifurcation points\
    \ \nin Balanac RIS (Figure 7.6a). Each of these flow control structures were with\
    \ spindle-type \nvertical steel gate and a pair of premade guides or grooves on\
    \ the side wall of the concrete \nupstream approach. \n \n138  \nModernisation\

    \ points especially along its main canals \n(Figure 7.6b) All of its vertical\
    \ gates were of spindle type. Its secondary canal intakes had a \nsimilar construction\

    \ culverts without immediate cross regulators (that is, free \nofftake arrangement)\
    \ and CHOs were also used as minor turnouts and offtakes along canal \nreaches\
    \ between major distribution points of the main canals and second-level canals\
    \ or major \nbifurcating canals. Also, the cross regulators at major distribution\
    \ points of both systems were \ncombined with a drop structure making canal reaches\
    \ hydraulically independent from each \nother. The offtakes of dependent canals\
    \ at these junctions were either set lower than the parent \ncanal bottom or with\
    \ significant drop also. In both systems, the design cross section for main \n\
    distributary canals was trapezoidal. All canals of the two systems were originally\
    \ earthen \ncanals. \n \n \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system design\
    \ and performance \n143 \n \n \n7.3.2 \nThe present design of Balanac RIS and\
    \ Sta. Maria RIS \n \nRehabilitation and installation of additional structures\
    \ have been carried out in the two \nsystems since their first years of operation\
    \ (Tables 7.1 and 7.2). In the late 1970s, pumping \nstations and the corresponding\
    \ canal network were constructed to irrigate rice areas within the \nvicinity\
    \ of the present Sta Maria RIS. This pump irrigation scheme had long been abandoned\
    \ \nmainly because of the prohibitive costs of pumping. A more recent addition\
    \ to the dam of Sta. \nMaria RIS was the gabion wall for upstream protection of\
    \ its right abutment. The major \nchanges in the headwork of Balanac RIS were\
    \ the added lengths or segments of the crests of \nthe dam and the concrete protection\
    \ wall of the dam approach (Figure 7.7). The manual lifting \nmechanisms for the\
    \ sluice gates of the dams in the two systems were changed to mechanical. \nIn\
    \ the 1990s, a system modality improvement project in Balanac RIS replaced the\
    \ \nspindle-gated offtakes and water level regulators at major bifurcation points\
    \ with duckbill and \nlong-crested, proportional weirs. It also embarked on filling\
    \ up portions of the cross sectional \nareas of ungated culvert-type farm turnouts\
    \ along the main canal with concrete cement to \nreduce their intake capacities.\
    \ The reduction in size of ungated offtake openings was based on \ntheir respective\
    \ irrigation water requirements or size of service areas. Only few remnants of\
    \ \nthe spindle-type vertical gates of the offtakes, farm turnouts and cross regulators,\
    \ usually the \nsteel frames and the accompanying concrete structures were left\
    \ at major distribution points \nalong the main canal and branching points of\
    \ lower level canals. \nIn contrast, Sta. Maria remained a gated system. Most\
    \ of the original flow control \nstructures at major diversion points along its\
    \ main canals are still in-use. Additional vertical \nsteel gates to raise the\
    \ water level were installed at the downstream portion of Sta. Maria RIS \nmain\
    \ canals to facilitate water distribution. Also added to the original structure\
    \ were minor \nofftakes with non-modular stopboards as gates. They were situated\
    \ along main canals and \nsecond-level canals. Its service area was reduced to\
    \ 40% of the original. \n \n \n \n \n \n144  \nModernisation strategy for the\

    \ RIS and Sta. \nMaria RIS \n \nThis section focuses on the discussion on the\
    \ systems components whose current state \ndeviates significantly from their design\
    \ or newly-constructed state and, hence, are no longer \nfunctioning as intended.\
    \ The information presented was obtained from the findings of the \nsystem walkthroughs\
    \ carried out for each of the systems as part of RAP. \nThe lifting mechanisms\
    \ to operate the mechanical sluice gates used for water level \ncontrol and flushing\
    \ out of sediments at the main intake structures of Balanac Dam and Sta. \nMaria\
    \ dams were not operational. The lifting gears have remained untouched in gear\
    \ houses \nand have gathered rusts. The framed face and gate slides of the sluice\
    \ gates were deformed \nand misaligned. The sluice gates of Balanac Dam are manually\
    \ lifted by using a cable while \nthose of Sta. Maria dams remained closed and\
    \ had not been used since they became non-\nfunctional. The manually operated\
    \ vertical gates of the main intake structures of Balanac Dam \nand Sta. Maria\
    \ dams were still functioning, albeit they could not be fully closed due to a\
    \ bend \neither in the framed face or spindle. \nThe fixed, long-crested and proportional\
    \ weirs constructed to replace the adjustable \ngates of offtakes and cross regulators\
    \ in Balanac RIS were all vandalized with some weir \nlengths chipped off (Figure\
    \ 7.8). Many unauthorized ungated offtakes were found along the \ncanal network.\
    \ Significant lengths of the canals had broken or cracked concrete and grouted\
    \ \nriprap linings. The flow measurement structures were no longer used. The concrete\
    \ sharp \ncrested weir immediately downstream of the main intake structure was\
    \ submerged under \nnormal flow conditions. \nMeanwhile, most of the spindle-type,\
    \ vertical gates of offtakes and cross regulators \nalong the main and secondary\
    \ canals of Sta. Maria RIS remained functional (Figure 7.9). The \nCHO at main\
    \ distribution points were missing the adjustable steel component of their \n\
    upstream gates; only the concrete structure forming the rectangular orifice remained.\
    \ The \ndownstream gates were still operational. The CHO along stretches of main\
    \ canals either lost \none or both of their gates while most of the circular vertical\
    \ gates remained functional. There \nwere also unofficial ungated offtakes along\
    \ distribution canals. The concrete canals have \ncracks though not as rampant\
    \ as in Balanac RIS. The Parshall flumes immediately \n150  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \ndownstream of\
    \ the main intake structures of the Bagumbayan Dam and Mata Dam were \noverlain\
    \ with considerable volume of sediments either at their respective approach canals\
    \ or \nbottom of the throat sections. The flumes constructed immediately downstream\
    \ of secondary \ncanal offtakes were no longer used. All flumes, except for one,\
    \ were missing the staff gauge. \n \n \nFigure 7.8. Damaged long-crested weir\
    \ and unathorized turnout in Balanac RIS  \n \n7.3.4 \nThe consistency of physical\
    \ structure and present water management \npractices with systems objectives and\
    \ operational objectives \n \nThe primary objective of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria\
    \ RIS was to provide water to rice \nmonoculture. This still holds true in both\
    \ systems. The result of categorization of the system \nprofile data based on\
    \ the design framework of Ankum (2001) suggested that the original \nBalanac RIS\
    \ was designed for productive irrigation for the dry season with flexible supply\
    \ \nand imposed allocation to tertiary units or irrigation service delivery points\
    \ (Figure 7.10).  \nThe design water duty of Balanac RIS was 3.25 l s-1 ha-1 and\
    \ was more than sufficient to \nmeet the water requirements for lowland or paddy\
    \ rice cultivation in the Philippines during \ndry seasons. The adjustable and\
    \ stepwise gates for offtakes and cross regulators at major \ndistribution points\
    \ as parts of the original physical structure indicated that the design \noperational\
    \ objective of Balanac RIS was to provide flexible irrigation supply to tertiary\
    \ areas \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system design and performance \n\
    151 \n \n \nwith adjustable flow through the main conveyance system. The use of\
    \ cross regulators \nimplied upstream control as the intended method for regulating\
    \ water flow levels. Imposed \nallocation to tertiary units, or offtakes downstream\
    \ of which the water management is no \nlonger a responsibility of the NIA, has\
    \ been the water allocation practice in the country. From \nthe perspective of\
    \ design logic framework (Figure 4.4) by Ankum (2001), there was \ncoherence among\
    \ the design philosophy, overall system objectives, operational objectives and\
    \ \nflow control method in the original system design of Balanac RIS. \n \n \n\
    \ \n \nFigure 7.9. Cross regulator, CHO and offtakes along Sta. Maria RIS main\
    \ canal \n \nThe system objectives for the original Sta. Maria RIS were the same\
    \ as those of Balanac \nRIS, except in the case of the design irrigation season\
    \ (Figure 7.11). With the design diversion \ncapacity of 2.1 m3 s-1 and service\
    \ area of 2,500 ha, its water duty was 0.8 l s-1 ha-1. This water \nsupply was\
    \ much lower than the 1.5 l s-1 ha-1 typically used by NIA for paddy rice cultivation.\

    \ methods of Sta. Maria RIS \n \n154  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nA plausible logic for such low\
    \ design water duty for productive irrigation was that the \nsystem was designed\
    \ with the wet season as the main irrigation season. In other words, the \nirrigation\
    \ was designed to supplement rainfall. This further implied that during the dry\
    \ season, \nthe system objective of productive irrigation was possible only for\
    \ a portion of the total \nservice area. Covering the whole service area would\
    \ logically mean adopting protective \nirrigation. Otherwise, it was a case of\
    \ over optimistic assumption on water requirements.  \nMeanwhile, the design operational\
    \ objective of Sta. Maria RIS was the same as that of \nBalanac RIS as suggested\
    \ by the same kind of adjustable gates of offtakes and cross \nregulators installed\
    \ in the former. The original system design of Sta. Maria was logically \ncoherent\
    \ from the standpoint of design logic framework. \nThe information on recent developments\
    \ and current practices on system operations, \nrehabilitation and improvements\
    \ indicated some modifications in either the system objectives, \noperational\
    \ objectives or both in the two NIS. In Balanac RIS, productive irrigation in\
    \ the dry \nseason remained one of the system objectives. This unchanged objective\
    \ was shown in the \nadopted approach of formulating systems operation plans based\
    \ on a reckoned optimum \ncropping calendar for rice production for the incoming\
    \ crop year and on stipulated goals of \nsystem rehabilitation and improvement\
    \ works of 100% service area coverage by irrigation. \nThe fixed, long-crested\
    \ proportional weirs constructed to replace the adjustable gates at the \nmajor\
    \ flow distribution points along the main canal were an explicit sign of the change\
    \ in the \nsystem objective of equitable supply to a unit area (ha) and amenability\
    \ for flexible irrigation \nsupply to limiting it to equitable supply. The Balanac\
    \ RIS adopted the following changes in \nthe parameters of operational objectives\
    \ and flow control method: a shift in the method of \nwater allocation to tertiary\
    \ units and method of water distribution through the main system \nfrom flexible\
    \ flow to splitted flow; reinforcement of imposed allocation; and shift from \n\
    upstream control to proportional control. The reduction in opening of ungated\
    \ offtakes based \non their respective service areas was in line with the shift\
    \ to proportional distribution of water. \nEquitable flow per ha remained consistent\
    \ with productive irrigation when applied in \nrice mono-cropping. While there\
    \ was logical coherence among the parameters of the new \noperational objectives,\
    \ they did not concur well with the system objective of productive \nirrigation.\
    \ The fixed, proportional weirs that replaced the original gated offtakes, turnouts\
    \ and \ncross regulators could simply divide any surplus or deficit in incoming\
    \ canal flows in fixed \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system design and\
    \ performance \n155 \n \n \nratio. They were not amenable for necessary adjustments\
    \ in flow rate and volume that would \nbe required to optimize crop growth and\
    \ yield. The adoption of long-crested, proportional \nweirs was not well received\
    \ by most farmers as evidenced by vandalized and chipped off crest \nlength of\
    \ all weirs constructed.  \nThe present water distribution practice at major bifurcation\
    \ points has a semblance with \nthe adjustable flow method of water distribution\
    \ that was intended in the original design, \nalbeit without functional flow control\
    \ structures. The present water allocation to tertiary units \nis through ungated\
    \ culverts, open offtakes and rectangular weirs (Figure 7.12). The control of\
    \ \nofftakes discharges and water level upstream is primarily accomplished by\
    \ placing makeshift \nstoplogs such as bamboo and banana stems and wooden planks\
    \ at the old cross regulators \nconcrete structures (Figure 7.13).  \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 7.12. Ungated circular turnouts (reduced culvert diameter at left photo) along\
    \ the \nmain canal of Balanac RIS \n \nThe current state of flow control structures\
    \ along the main system of Balanac RIS will \nsupport neither splitted flow, rotational\
    \ flow nor adjustable flow through the main system. \nThe proportional weirs that\
    \ would make a logical match for splitted flow were damaged while \ngates needed\
    \ to achieve adjustable flow through the main system were non-existent. The \n\
    ungated turnouts immediately downstream of proportional weirs but at lower elevation\
    \ than \nthe latter's crest level undermined fair and orderly water distribution.\
    \ Similary, concrete \nstructures of the original gated cross regulators enabled\
    \ the use of improvised stoplogs \n156  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nimmediately downstream of the\
    \ duckbill or proportional weirs, effectively counteracting the \nlatter. The\
    \ incoherence among system and operational objectives, flow control structures\
    \ and \nmethod and farmers preferences were highlighted by lack of functioning\
    \ flow control \nstructures and lower actual area irrigated, despite of higher\
    \ water supply compared to Sta. \nMaria RIS. \n \n \nFigure 7.13. Improvised cross\
    \ regulators at distribution points officially redesigned for \nproportional flow\
    \ along the main canal of Balanac RIS \n \nWhile productive irrigation remained\
    \ one of the system objectives in Sta. Maria RIS, its \nmain irrigation season\
    \ and irrigation supply were changed to the dry season and flexible \nsupply,\
    \ respectively. This view was deduced from the following management approaches:\
    \ \nstrategic seasonal adjustments in cropping calendar for different irrigation\
    \ zones to meet the \nwater requirements for each zone; a goal of 200% irrigation\
    \ intensity in previous \nrehabilitation or system improvement projects; use of\
    \ adjustable, gated flow control structures \nfor distribution; and a 60% reduction\
    \ in design service area. For the stated design diversion \ncapacity of the system,\
    \ this firmed-up service area of 974 ha translated to a water duty of 2.73 \n\
    l s-1 ha-1, which would be sufficient for productive irrigation during the dry\
    \ season. \nThe water allocation to tertiary units or turnout service areas (TSA)\
    \ remained an \nimposed allocation. The Sta. Maria RIS Irrigators Association\
    \ (SANTAMASI) set the \nirrigation schedules in consultation with the TSA leaders\
    \ or farmers' representatives prior to \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system\
    \ design and performance \n157 \n \n \neach cropping season. The present methods\
    \ of water allocation to tertiary units of Sta. Maria \nRIS include adjustable\
    \ flow, intermittent flow and splitted flow. Intermittent flow or on/off \nflow\
    \ to minor tertiary offtakes has become the norm due to insufficient supply of\
    \ water for \nsimultaneous irrigation. It was achieved by using either adjustable\
    \ gates or non-modular \nstopboards that were either fully open, passing the maximum\
    \ flow or fully closed. Adjustable \nflow or varied flow was accomplished by adjusting\
    \ the setting of the spindle-type gates and \nremoving or adding pieces of modular\
    \ stoplogs of tertiary offtakes. The splitted flow method \nof water allocation\
    \ occurred in the case of ungated culverts and open offtakes. \nThe present water\
    \ distribution through the main system of Sta. Maria RIS is either \nadjustable\
    \ flow or rotational irrigation by secondary canals. The latter was more frequently\
    \ \nimplemented owing to the limited water supply for continuous irrigation. Water\
    \ is diverted \ninto the offtaking canals by maintaining the upstream water level\
    \ at target levels by using \nadjustable or stepwise cross regulators. \nThe changes\
    \ in the system objectives of Sta. Maria RIS logically conformed with the \nflow\
    \ control method and in the changes in the methods of distribution through the\
    \ main \nsystem and water allocation to tertiary units, except in the case of\
    \ splitted flow that is \nachieved through ungated and open offtakes. Imposed\
    \ allocation to tertiary units by adjustable \nflow and intermittent flow matches\
    \ adjustable flow and either adjustable flow or rotational \nflow through the\
    \ main system, respectively. These combinations are known to fit well with \n\
    upstream control. Imposed allocation to tertiary units by splitted flow logically\
    \ matches a \nsplitted flow through the main system under protective irrigation.\
    \ \nThe physical state of many flow control structures presented challenges in\
    \ delivering the \nwater as designed as many of the offtakes with adjustable gates\
    \ are barely functioning; most \nneeded replacement. Discharge and water level\
    \ control structures were important for Sta. \nMaria RIS to enable to implement\
    \ rotational irrigation, which is practiced during both wet and \ndry cropping\
    \ seasons to cope with its limited water supply at the source. The tree trunks\
    \ and \nleaves used as improvised gates for broken or missing offtakes and cross\
    \ regulators (Figure \n7.14) are vulnerable to unauthorized modifications. The\
    \ many ungated, or open farm turnouts \ndiverting water directly from the main\
    \ canal compromised the integrity of the rotational \nirrigation as they can readily\
    \ divert water meant for downstream farms. They disrupted \norderly distribution\
    \ of water and made management of water distribution more cumbersome. \n158  \n\
    Modernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nThe run-of-the-river dams of Balanac Dam and Sta. Maria Dam would not\
    \ support well \nthe systems objective of productive irrigation during the dry\
    \ season. The pre-condition to \ndesigning an irrigation system with such objectives\
    \ is that either water supply available at the \nsource is adequate at any time,\
    \ or sufficient water can be stored and made available to meet \nhigher requirements\
    \ associated with the dry season. The main purpose of run-of-the-river \ndams\
    \ is to raise the water level at the source so that diversion by gravity is possible.\
    \ They are \nnot specifically designed to store irrigation water. Irrigation water\
    \ supply through such dams \nis less reliable, making irrigated crop production\
    \ vulnerable to fluctuations in river discharge. \nReservoir-type dams would be\
    \ a more logical match to irrigation systems designed for \nproductive irrigation\
    \ during the dry season, especially in the context of lower low river flow \n\
    regimes attributed to climate change.  \n \n \nFigure 7.14. Improvised stoplogs\

    \ rapid system diagnosis and performance assessment through \nRAP  \n \nThe results\
    \ of RAP computation of internal indicators of system performance based on the\
    \ \ngathered information from system documents, interviews and walkthroughs for\
    \ Balanac RIS \nand Sta. Maria RIS are summarized in Tables 7.5 to 7.10 and more\
    \ detailed in Annex F.  \nIn general, the values of the primary internal indicators\
    \ of RAP were low, ranging from \n0-2 (0 and 4 indicating least and most desirable,\
    \ respectively). The only exceptions were in \nthe case of travel time of a flow\
    \ rate change through the main canals in both systems and in \nDiagnostic assessment\
    \ of irrigation system design and performance \n159 \n \n \nthe case of control\
    \ of cross-regulator along main canals of Sta. Maria RIS. The favourable \nratings\
    \ in travel time were attributed to the relatively shorter canal length of these\
    \ two \nirrigation systems. The low values of indicators for water delivery, control\
    \ and operation of \nflow control structures, and management and institutional\
    \ setups of Balanac RIS and Sta. \nMaria RIS implied that the lackluster performances\
    \ of these systems can be attributed to \ninsufficiency or shortcomings in these\
    \ aspects of water delivery structures and processes. \n \nTable 7.5. Indicators\

    \ the design, actual and required capacities of irrigation \nstructures to perform\
    \ their functions that are relevant to system operations (Tables 7.11 and \n7.12).\
    \ The design capacity was based on the information on the existing system configuration\
    \ \nand design specifications of canals and flow control structures as stated\
    \ in project documents. \nThe actual capacity was estimated based on visual assessment\
    \ of the on-site physical \nconditions and dimensions of canals including type,\
    \ combinations and locations of flow \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system\
    \ design and performance \n163 \n \n \ncontrol structures. The present capacity\
    \ requirements were estimated based on the present \nservice area and expressed\
    \ need of system managers, operation staff and farmers. The system \ncapacities\
    \ that relate to the functions of irrigation structures relevant to canal operation\
    \ are \ndefined below: \n• \ndiversion. The capacity to divert the water from\
    \ the main canal (parent canal) to the next \nlower-level canal (dependent canal)\
    \ or to a delivery point the required rates, which can \nrange from zero to maximum\
    \ discharge capacity at this point; \n• \ndivision. Refers to division of the\
    \ total flow proportionally at key points, over a number \nof downstream outlets;\
    \ \n• \nstorage. Relates to amenability of the irrigation system (canals or storage\
    \ reservoir \nbehind the dam or intermediate, regulating micro-reservoir) to impound\
    \ water to be \ndelivered at more convenient time and place or according to user’s\
    \ requirement; \n• \nconveyance. Relates to adequacy of canal dimensions and linings\
    \ to, as the term implies, \nconvey the required irrigation water along the canal\
    \ reach; \n• \nsediment control. Pertains to mechanisms of removing excessive\
    \ sedimentation from the \ncanals and flow control structures; \n• \ndischarge\
    \ transfer. Refers to the time lag between a change of discharge upstream and\
    \ \nits conversion at a downstream point of the canal; \n• \nwater level control.\
    \ Is about stabilizing the required water level (head) in the parent \ncanal;\
    \ \n• \nflow measurement. Relates to the accuracy and reliability of its flow\
    \ measurement \nstructures at strategic locations (e.g.: critical bifurcation\
    \ point, offtake); \n• \nsafety. Pertains to magnitude of freeboard and presence\
    \ of escapes for disposal of spill \nwater at critical points; \n• \ncommunication.\
    \ Relates to availability of real-time information important to system \noperations;\
    \ \n• \nwater reuse. Relates to use of structures to recapture irrigation water\
    \ along drainage and \nnatural water ways; \n• \ntransport and roads. Pertains\
    \ to the accessibility of and travel time to the whole \nphysical structure for\
    \ purposes of supervision of system operations and maintenance or \nurgent repairs.\

    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nThe concrete or grouted riprap linings improved\
    \ the conveyance and transfer capacities \nof the main and second-level canals\
    \ of the two systems. All canals were originally all earthen \nor unlined. At\
    \ present about 50% of the main canals and second-level canals of Balanac RIS\
    \ \nand 71% of that in Sta. Maria RIS are lined with either concrete, grouted\
    \ riprap or concrete \nhollow blocks. These linings resulted in higher flow velocities,\
    \ hence reduced the time lag \nbetween a change of discharge upstream and its\
    \ conversion at downstream points of the canal. \nHowever, the overall improvements\
    \ of conveyance capacities and transfer capacities, \nwhich were also attested\
    \ by canal operators and farmers, were constrained by noticeable \nsiltation and\
    \ weed growth in a number of stretches of the unlined canals of the two systems.\
    \ \nThere were also seepage losses through lined canal embankments along a number\
    \ of main \ncanal reaches of Balanac RIS (Figure 7.15). \n \n \nFigure 7.15. Balanac\
    \ RIS main canal reach with considerable grass growth (upper bank) and \nseepage\
    \ loss (lower bank) \n \nBalanac RIS shifted from upstream control to the proportional\
    \ control system. With \nsignificant segments of all proportional weirs destroyed,\
    \ except for Lateral A bifurcation, both \nthe intended division and water level\
    \ control capacities at major bifurcation points of the \nBalanac RIS were practically\
    \ obliterated (Figure 7.16). The discharges across the open, or \nungated offtakes\
    \ at these junctions were relatively more sensitive to water level fluctuations\
    \ in \nthe main canal, or parent canal due to the weir flow characteristics. Diversions\
    \ of water \nthrough these offtakes, including Lateral A offtake that has the\
    \ long crested weir still intact, \nwere effected by using tree trunks and branches\
    \ as cross regulators. This manner of water \ndiversions resulted in unruly water\
    \ distribution. \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system design and performance\
    \ \n167 \n \n \nIn Sta. Maria RIS, the main canal orifice-type offtakes and major\
    \ turnouts have lower \ncanal beds, or floors at their downstream sides enabling\
    \ free-flow conditions, hence, good and \ncontrolled diversion capacity for the\
    \ dependent canals. A super-critical flow through the \nofftakes and turnouts\
    \ ensured the independence of discharge into the second level canal from \nits\
    \ tailwater conditions. It ascertained no higher discharge than what is intended\
    \ to be \ndiverted. Further, the orifice-flow offtakes were less sensitive to\
    \ water level fluctuations of \nthe main canal and, thus, were capable of maintaining\
    \ relatively constant discharge into their \ndependent canals. However, a number\
    \ of missing, or non-operational vertical gates of these \nstructures and the\
    \ ungated culverts compromised the integrity of the distribution capacity of \n\
    the irrigation system (Figure 7.17). \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \n \n(c) \n(d) \nFigure\
    \ 7.16. Water division structures at major bifurcation points in Balanac RIS:\
    \ Buboy-\nmain canal (a); Lateral A-main canal (b); Laterals A-A1 (c); Laterals\
    \ A1-A1A (d) \n \nSpindle-type vertical gates were used as cross regulators along\
    \ Sta. Maria RIS main \ncanals and Lateral A, a major second-level canal. Twenty\
    \ one of these cross regulators were \nprocured and installed under a system improvement\
    \ component of a foreign-assisted project \n168  \nModernisation strategy for\
    \ the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nin 2011. Being an\
    \ orifice-type structure or having an undershot-flow, these vertical gates were\
    \ \nrelatively more sensitive to variations in the water level than overshot structures.\
    \ Thus, they \nwere less suitable for water level regulation. An apparent social\
    \ acceptance of these vertical \ngates in Sta. Maria RIS may be due to their amenability\
    \ for rotational irrigation being \npracticed to cope with the relatively low\
    \ water supply. \n \n \nFigure 7.17. Inoperable (spindle and frame hit and bended\
    \ by a wayward truck) Lateral A \nofftake of Sta. Maria RIS \n \nThere were neither\
    \ river gauging activities nor measurements of diverted water by the \nmain intake\
    \ structure and by offtakes at major bifurcation points being carried out for\
    \ Balanac \nRIS. There were also no river gauging activities for Sta. Maria RIS.\
    \ Though the water \ndiverted for the irrigation is measured through the Parshall\
    \ flumes by its irrigators association, \ndischarge estimates based on these water\
    \ level readings would be unreliable because the \nflumes were either with considerable\
    \ siltation at the floor or at the canal approach side. There \nwere flumes without\
    \ the staff gauges at the upstream end of each second-level canal of Sta. \nMaria\
    \ RIS, but they were not used. \nThe major distributary or main system canals\
    \ of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS have \nenough freeboard. However, there were\
    \ no escapes for disposal of excess water along the \nmain canals of each system,\
    \ except at the end of these canals. Their tailwaters drain ultimately \ninto\
    \ the Laguna Lake. They both suffered seasonal submergence by the Lake during\

    \ RIS and Sta. Maria RIS have no significant storage capacity owing to the \n\
    nature of their run-of-the-river headworks. The heavy silt accumulations at the\
    \ upstream side \nof Balanac Dam and Sta. Maria dams reduced the capacity of the\
    \ headworks to divert water \n(Figure 7.20). It also eliminated the inherently\
    \ little capacity of the system to regulate the \nfluctuations in the diverted\

    \ intended to analyze the behaviour of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS under their\
    \ \nrespective typical water distribution practices through the assessment of\
    \ the sensitivity of their \nirrigation structures at three levels: on each main\
    \ type of flow control structure (e.g.: offtake, \nwater level regulator) taken\
    \ in isolation; at key diversion and division points; and along canal \nreaches.\
    \ The proposed research method was to evaluate the sensitivity from water level\
    \ and \ndischarge records and through direct field measurements. \nDiagnostic\
    \ assessment of irrigation system design and performance \n173 \n \n \nSensitivity\
    \ assessment by using records was not possible in the case of Balanac and Sta.\
    \ \nMaria RIs since flow measurements are not carried out at key distribution\
    \ points along the \ncanal networks of the two systems. Meanwhile, direct field\
    \ measurements proved to be \nunwieldy, or intrusive. The current practice of\
    \ open ended cropping seasons and unrestrained \nofftaking along the bifurcating\
    \ and ungated canal network of Balanac RIS made it practically \nimpossible to\
    \ maintain flow conditions required for the sensitivity experiments. While there\
    \ \nwere water delivery schedules for the second-level canals and key distribution\
    \ points through \nmostly gated offtakes of Sta. Maria RIS, its water distribution\
    \ practice did not allow \nmanipulation of flow for the purposes of sensitivity\
    \ measurements. It follows tight schedules \nof rotational irrigation especially\
    \ during the dry cropping seasons. During the rainy months, \nthe main intake\
    \ structure is closed to prevent entry of flood water through the canal network\
    \ \nand some ungated offtakes, hence, submergence of the cropped areas. \nThe\
    \ assessment of sensitivity through field observations on the types and conditions\
    \ of \nflow control structures and visualisation of relative flow changes based\
    \ on their respective \ndischarge-head relations was resorted to as the pragmatic\
    \ approach in the case of Balanac RIS \nand Sta. Maria RIS. From the generic flow\
    \ equation (equation 5.5) and its logarithmic \nderivative (equation 5.6), an\
    \ overshot offtake (α = 1.5) is more sensitive than an undershoot \nofftake (α\
    \ = 0.5) for a given water level variation (Table 7.14). Based on the same equations,\
    \ \nan overshot cross regulator is less sensitive to head variation than an undershot\
    \ cross \nregulator. Inherent to their hydraulic characteristics, undershot offtake\
    \ and overshot cross \nregulator are better suited for discharge and water level\
    \ regulators, respectively. \nAlso the diversion structures at major distribution\
    \ points were designated a diversion \nsensitivity, or hydraulic flexibility classification\
    \ according to the resulting variations in \ndischarges of the structures in response\
    \ to variations in incoming flow as conceptualized by \nHorst (1998) and Ankum\
    \ (2001). In this conceptualization of hydraulic behaviour of diversion \nstructures,\
    \ a hydraulic flexibility, or a ratio of discharge variation in offtaking canal\
    \ to \ndischarge variation in the parent canal equal to unity (F = 1) is conceived\
    \ to have proportional \ndistribution of flow fluctuations through the canal network.\
    \ Low sensitivity diversion \nstructures (F < 1) are considered to pass incoming\
    \ flow fluctuations to the tail-end of the \ncanal. In case of high sensitivity\
    \ diversion structures (F > 1) the effect of incoming \nfluctuations is manifested\
    \ the most in the upstream canal reach. The combinations of \n174  \nModernisation\
    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \ndiversion\
    \ structures that yield an F = 1 is recommended by both authors for adoption in\
    \ \nirrigation systems under upstream control.  \n \nTable 7.14. Indicative sensitivity\

    \ in Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS were designed to \nproportionally distribute\
    \ any changes in canal discharge among the offtakes (F = 1). This gate \nproportional\
    \ diversion objective was surmised based on the combination of the type of \n\
    installed discharge and water level regulators and the generally accepted principle\
    \ of equitable \nflow distribution to ha. In general, the gate-proportional diversion\
    \ in upstream control is \napproximated by a combination of either both overflow\
    \ or both underflow discharge and \nwater level control structures. \nThe lack\
    \ of functional flow control structures at the bifurcation points of Balanac RIS,\
    \ \nexcept at the MC-Lat. A, suggested unproportional diversions at these points\
    \ due to either \nhigher or lower sensitivity at the offtaking canal than that\
    \ of the parent canal. For a change in \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system\
    \ design and performance \n175 \n \n \nincoming flow, the lack of regulation structures\
    \ would result in a larger discharge variation at \nthe offtaking canal than in\
    \ the continuing canal and other downstream offtakes without flow \ncontrol structures.\
    \ In the case of Lateral A - Lateral A1 junction, the offtake (Lateral A1) has\
    \ \nlower sensitivity owing to its hydraulic characteristics (discharge-head relation).\
    \ It takes \nunproportional lower discharge variation than the ongoing canal (Lat\
    \ A). Proportional weirs \nfor the continuing Balanac Main Canal and offtaking\
    \ canal Lat. A was aimed for proportional \nflow distribution at this junction\
    \ (Figure 7.21). However, this objective was altered by placing \nstoplogs at\
    \ the concrete structure of the original adjustable water level regulator. Such\
    \ \nalteration was easily done at Buboy and other bifurcation of Balanac RIS due\
    \ to the groove on \nthe upstream side of each concrete structure.  \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 7.21. Proportional weirs at MC-Lat. A bifurcation in Balanac RIS \n \nA combination\
    \ of open offtake and undershot cross regulator (vertical gate) at the \njunction\
    \ Sta. Maria Main Canal (SMMC) and Lat A would result in higher discharge \nvariations\
    \ in the offtaking canal for small fluctuations in the incoming flow (F > 1).\
    \ In theory, \ngate proportional diversion (F = 1) can be achieved at branching\
    \ points with both undershot \nflow control structures at offtaking and main canals\
    \ by adjusting the gates according to the \nchanges in the incoming water supply.\
    \ However, in the case of Sta. Maria RIS, where the \nwater supply can be highly\
    \ variable, operating the system to achieve gate proportional \ndiversion (F =\
    \ 1) is too cumbersome and impractical. The offtaking canal would have higher\
    \ \ndischarge variation than the continuing canal (F > 1). \n176  \nModernisation\

    \ Origins and causes of perturbations  \n \nThe research aimed to identify the\
    \ perturbations of discharge and water levels along main \ncanals in terms of\
    \ origin, magnitude, timing and frequency in order to know whether the main \n\
    canals are self-reacting, or if specific interventions (e.g.: adjustments in system\
    \ operations and \nmanagement or changes in flow control structures) must be carried\
    \ out to maintain the water \nlevel and discharge at the farm offtake/turn out\
    \ within a practically reasonable range of the \ntarget levels. The results of\
    \ field investigations suggested that the causes of perturbation \nincluded unauthorized\
    \ direct offtaking from main canals, irrigation return flows and overland \nflows\
    \ entering the main canals, fluctuating water supply from the river and unregulated\
    \ \ndiversion, lack of flow control structures and checking, or flow obstruction\
    \ by the locals for \ndomestic purposes (livestock tending, laundry and swimming).\
    \ \nBy design, direct offtakings from main canals through official, ungated, or\
    \ open \nturnouts have been practiced in both Balanac and Sta. Maria RIS. Results\
    \ of interviews \nshowed that direct offtaking through unofficial turnouts have\
    \ been tolerated to either \nfacilitate, or effect delivery of water for groups\
    \ of farms. Laissez faire cropping schedules, \nnon-functional flow control structures\
    \ and uncoordinated offtakings contributed in lower \npredictability of water\
    \ level and discharge fluctuations in Balanac RIS. \nThere was no lull in irrigation\
    \ activities along the main canals in both systems as \nupstream farmers in Balanac\
    \ try to have a third cropping and tight rotational irrigation is \nfollowed in\
    \ Sta. Maria RIS, except during irrigation cutoff to give way for construction\
    \ works \nalong the canal, or very low flows from the water source. The study\
    \ on perturbations was \nlimited to field identification of the origins and causes\
    \ of perturbations owing to these \nsituations. Locations of direct offtakes and\
    \ drainage inlets along the main canals are \nsummarized in Table 7.15 (Annex\
    \ E). \n \n7.8 Conclusions \n  \nThere was logical coherence among the design\
    \ philosophy, or overall system objectives, \noperational objectives and on-canal\
    \ flow control structures of the original system design of \nDiagnostic assessment\
    \ of irrigation system design and performance \n177 \n \n \nBalanac RIS and Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS from the view point of the design logic framework. The \ndesign philosophy\
    \ and system objective of productive irrigation for rice mono-cropping was \n\
    in support to the rice self-sufficiency goal of the country. The use of gated\
    \ flow control \nstructures is consistent with the need for an adjustable flow\
    \ method of water allocation and \ndistribution along major conveyance canals.\
    \ Adjustable flow was in turn a logical design \nchoice to achieve flexible supply\
    \ that fits well with the productive irrigation objective. \n \nTable 7.15. Count\

    \ F \n29\n0\n \nHowever, the shift to splitted flow and proportional water distribution\
    \ and flow control \nmethods, respectively, in Balanac RIS did not logically agree\
    \ with its unchanged system \nobjective when subjected to the same design logic\
    \ analysis. The results of RAP carried out in \nBalanac RIS supported the hypothesis\
    \ of unwieldy water distribution deduced from the design \nlogic framework analysis.\
    \ The splitted flows achieved by using the fixed proportional \nstructures did\
    \ not sit well with farmers as manifested by vandalisms that rendered these \n\
    structures non-functional. The values of RAP internal indicators for water delivery,\
    \ control \n178  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \nand operation of flow structures and social order\
    \ were low, mainly due to the lack of \nfunctional flow control structures and\
    \ presence of ungated direct offtakes and turnouts. \nFrom the design logic perspective,\
    \ a number of recent system improvements and present \nsystem operations in Sta.\
    \ Maria were consistent with the shift in its system objectives of \nproductive\
    \ irrigation from the wet season as the main irrigation season to the dry season.\
    \ \nDespite this coherence in the general system design and operations, the water\
    \ delivery service \nwas rated low in RAP context due to the poorly functioning\
    \ gates and presence of open \nturnouts or offtakes. \nThe capacity of the structures\
    \ of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS to perform their \nintended functions had\
    \ decreased due to damage, defects, dysfunctions, missing parts and \ndeviations\
    \ from preconditions for proper functioning through time. Repairs, or replacements\
    \ \nare required for sluice gates of the dam, main intake gates and discharge\
    \ and water level \ncontrol structures. Maintenance work to restore head differential\
    \ (diversion capacity) at the \ndam and approach conditions (flow measurement\
    \ capacity) for the flumes are necessary. \nIn Balanac RIS, the most telling capacity\
    \ issue was the division capacity. The social \nacceptability of proportional,\
    \ or splitted flow distribution and the technical soundness of the \ndesign configuration\
    \ of division structures (proportional long crested weirs and associated \nofftakes)\
    \ must be revalidated. The most striking issue in Sta. Maria RIS was the limited\
    \ water \nsupply from the rivers. Options to increase the storage capacity of\
    \ Sta. Maria dams or \naugment the water supply from other sources must be investigated.\
    \ \nQuantifying sensitivity proved to be impractical in the case of Balanac RIS\
    \ and Sta. \nMaria RIS where the water level is uncontrolled and ungated, direct\
    \ offtakings were not \nmanaged. A combination of ocular inspection and general\
    \ hydraulic characteristics (disharge-\nhead relation) of flow control structures\
    \ served as a pragmatic tool to gauge the sensitivity of \nthe adopted design\
    \ or present on-site configuration of the flow control regulators. The \nconceptualized\
    \ diversion sensitivity or hydraulic flexibility of commonly used design \nconfigurations\
    \ of diversion structures (combinations of offtake and water level controls) is\
    \ a \nsufficient alternative for the purpose of diagnostic assessment.  \nThe\
    \ combination of the logic design framework and the adaptively modified RAP and\
    \ \ncapacity and sensitivity assessments of the physical structures provided a\
    \ fundamental \nstructure of a system diagnostic approach for a critical examination\
    \ of the root causes of \nDiagnostic assessment of irrigation system design and\
    \ performance \n179 \n \n \nunderperformance of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS.\
    \ The design logic framework brought \nthe assessment of system performance through\
    \ RAP in perspective with the design \nphilosophy, overall system objectives,\
    \ operational objectives and physical features of flow \ncontrol structures. It\
    \ provided a clear framework on troubleshooting any inherent \ninconsistency in\
    \ system design during the planning stage. It clarified the benchmark where the\
    \ \nsystem water delivery performance can be fairly judged. Meanwhile, the RAP\
    \ compliments \nthe capacity and sensitivity assessments. \nThe present logic\
    \ design framework and diagnostic tools of MASSCOTE focus on canal \nstructures\
    \ design and operation. Inclusion of the headwork component in both diagnostic\
    \ \napproaches will put the water supply issues arising from climate change in\
    \ clear perspective. \nWith a prolonged, drier dry season, systems designed with\
    \ a productive irrigation objective, \nbut without a storage-type dam are facing\
    \ chances of failure. Such combination of diagnostic \ntools offers a comprehensive\
    \ system diagnosis approach with system modernization \norientation, particularly\
    \ suitable for mostly ungauged, run-of-the-river type irrigation systems \nin\
    \ the country. \n \n \n8. REVALIDATION OF DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS ON \nPERCOLATION\
    \ AND WATER SUPPLY \n \n8.1 Introduction \n \nOveroptimistic design values and\
    \ assumptions in water supply and irrigation efficiencies has \nbeen said to be\
    \ a major reason for the significant gap between the design service area and \n\
    actual area irrigated of most canal irrigation systems in the country. Overestimation\
    \ of \ndependable supply and underestimation of seepage and percolation would\
    \ result in larger \ndesign service area than what can be possibly irrigated with\
    \ the given water supply. \nMiscalculations of design values could be due to broad\
    \ generalization of data input in the face \nof limited information, expediency\
    \ for project implementation and use of inadequate methods \nin estimating available\
    \ water supplies. Further, changes in land use in the basin and in weather \n\
    patterns, which are known to influence the river hydrographs, compounds the uncertainty\
    \ in \nthe validity of the values of design parameters. \nIn the above cases,\
    \ revalidation of design parameters forms part of a prudent approach \nto the\
    \ formulation of irrigation modernisation plans. The findings of the study of\
    \ David et al. \n(2012b) highlighted the importance of using site-specific values\
    \ on percolation. The results of \nthe field measurements of percolation suggested\
    \ that much lower percolation rates used \nduring the design stage of nine national\
    \ irrigation systems (NIS) resulted in gross \nunderestimation of irrigation water\
    \ requirement and, consequently, design discharge \ncapacities. In the case of\
    \ Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS, operation engineers adopted the \npercolation\
    \ values found in old project documents in preparing the system operation and\
    \ \nmanagement (O&M) plan. Design engineers seldom concern themselves with water\
    \ balance \nparameters such as percolation since most of detailed engineering\
    \ design works only involve \nrestoration and improvement of existing physical\
    \ structures.  \nRainfall-runoff relations for most river basins feeding the canal\
    \ irrigation systems in the \ncountry are not yet well studied. Many of the rivers\
    \ tapped as water sources for canal \nirrigation systems remained ungauged. Flow\
    \ gauging activities were even discontinued in \nsome rivers feeding NIS. These\
    \ stopped in 1979 for Balanac River, while there has been no \ngauging station\
    \ in Sta. Maria River basin. \n182  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nThe dependable water supply for\
    \ the irrigation systems can be expected to have changed \nwith changes in land\
    \ use of the river basins. The effects of changes in dependable flows are \nmore\
    \ readily felt in these run-off-the-river diversion irrigation systems than in\
    \ storage, or \nreservoir type systems. How the recent changes affecting the water\
    \ supply sources were \naccounted for in the estimation of dependable flows reflect\
    \ the accuracy of the estimates, \nhence, their usefulness to system operation\
    \ and modernisation project planning. While \nstreamflow gauging has started in\
    \ a number of irrigation systems and plans to collect such \nbaseline information\
    \ are gaining support in recent years, a pragmatic approach to sense the \nadequacy\
    \ of river discharges for irrigation improvement projects in the immediate future\
    \ \nwould need to be formulated. \n \n8.2 Research methodology \n \nIn this study,\
    \ field measurements to estimate, percolation and irrigation conveyance \nefficiencies\
    \ were carried out within the service areas of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS.\
    \ \nMeasurements of percolation and farm ditch conveyance losses were done using\
    \ the 3-\ncylinder method and ponding test, respectively. The ponding test relates\
    \ conveyance loss rate \nto the drop in water level in an initially water-filled,\
    \ isolated canal section (no inflow and \noutflow occurring), taking into account\
    \ the evaporation. Similarly, percolation is determined \nby relating the changes\
    \ in water depths in a set of three cylinders, one with water-tight bottom \n\
    and two without bottoms, to evaporation alone, evaporation and percolation or\
    \ a combination \nof these three parameters. The changes in water level of each\
    \ cylinder and rain gauge reading \nwere algebraically added to estimate the water\
    \ that percolated. \nThese direct physical measurement techniques have been the\
    \ standard method for \npercolation and seepage measurements. Canal seepage has\
    \ also been traditionally estimated \nby using other direct measurement techniques\
    \ such as seepage meters, and inflow-outflow \ntests; indirect methods like monitoring\
    \ the groundwater table adjacent to the canal; and by \nprediction using empirical\
    \ or analytic formulae. The ponding test was selected to estimate the \ncanal\
    \ conveyance losses owing to the attributed better level of accuracy of this particular\
    \ \ntechnique when applied to small canals. \n \nRevalidation of design assumptions\
    \ on percolation and water supply \n183 \n \n \nA collaborative work to identify\
    \ the texture of the soil of the experiment sites through \nthe hydrometer method\
    \ was carried out with students as part of the latter's thesis requirement \n\
    for Bachelor degree. The corresponding percolation values for the identified soil\
    \ texture of the \nsites where determined from the design textbook and manuals.\
    \ They were compared to the \nmeasured percolation values. \nTo get a sense of\
    \ the adequacy of the river flows available for irrigation systems, local \nknowledge\
    \ on historical flows was gathered through informal interviews and field visits\
    \ to the \narea during both cropping seasons throughout the course of the study.\
    \ Old residents and long-\ntime farmers, including members of irrigators associations\
    \ were asked on the sufficiency of \ndiverted water in relation to their irrigation\
    \ need and observed river flows. Available water \nflow records were sought from\
    \ water users associations. Also, sample canal discharge \nmeasurements during\
    \ dry seasons were carried out. \nThe available flow data and basin characteristics\
    \ of the rivers feeding the Balanac RIS \nand Sta. Maria RIS were collated and/or\
    \ generated. Appropriate methods that can be used to \nestimate river flows at\
    \ main diversion or dam sites were identified based on the availability of \n\
    data input, applicability to the case study and practicality of computations.\
    \ \n \n8.3 Field measurements of percolation and farm ditch losses \n \nThe number\
    \ of experiment sites for percolation and ponding tests were determined in such\
    \ a \nway that there was at least one for each major soil type, relative to location\
    \ (upstream, \nmidstream and downstream) and every 100 ha of the service area.\
    \ For each identified \nexperiment area, a representative farm ditch and a paddy\
    \ field served by the former were \nselected as experiment site. The considerations\
    \ for the selection of the exact sites included \nproximity to a water source\
    \ for a better control of the water level within the paddy field, least \nrisk\
    \ to vandalisms and willingness of farmers to accommodate the experiment. Nine\
    \ and 10 \nexperiment sites were selected for Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS (Figures\
    \ 8.1 and 8.2). \nThe field measurements of percolation and conveyance losses\
    \ were carried out during \nMay-June 2013 and 2014 in Balanac RIS and from September-December\
    \ 2012 in Sta. Maria \nRIS. These experiments were done during lull in farming\
    \ activities in between the cropping \nseasons, while the experiment sites and\
    \ surrounding fields were saturated with water and \n184  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nisolation of\
    \ sections of canal was allowed. As such the field experiments were coordinated\
    \ \nwith farmers, irrigators association and NIA to avoid conflicts with their\
    \ normal irrigation and \non-farm water management activities. \n \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 8.1. Sites of percolation and ponding experiments in Balanac RIS \n \nA set\
    \ of three 40-cm diameter galvanized iron (GI) cylinders and a GI storage-type,\
    \ \nstandard rain gauge were installed in the selected paddy fields (Figure 8.3).\
    \ The set of \ncylinders consisted of a 50-cm high without bottom (\"P\" cylinder),\
    \ a 40-cm high with a water-\ntight bottom (\"E\" cylinder), and a 30-cm high\
    \ without bottom (\"S\" cylinder). Each cylinder \nRevalidation of design assumptions\
    \ on percolation and water supply \n185 \n \n \nhad a 3-inch diameter stilling\
    \ basin welded at its inside wall. The \"P\" cylinder was driven \nuntil its lower\
    \ end touched the plough pan of the paddy field. The \"E\" cylinder was lowered\
    \ \ninto the hole dug into the paddy field up to a depth that allowed it to have\
    \ the same length of \nexposed walls as of the \"P\" cylinder. The excavated soil\
    \ was placed inside the \"E\"cylinder. \nThe \"S\" cylinder was driven into the\
    \ soil until the same length of the exposed wall was \nachieved and its lower\
    \ end did not touch the hard pan. At least a metre distance from the levee \n\
    and between cylinders was observed for ease of the measurement readings and to\
    \ minimize \nerrors due to possible shading from the sun's rays and shielding\
    \ from the wind of the cylinder \nby the levee. The rims of the cylinders were\
    \ levelled by using a carpenter's level bar. The \nsame water level was maintained\
    \ inside and outside the cylinders to minimize thermal \nmismatch errors. \n \n\

    \ The \nwater level readings for the \"E\" cylinder measured evaporation, while\

    \ with the evaporation and percolation \nmeasurements obtained from \"E\" and\
    \ \"P\" cylinders, the readings on the \"S\" cylinder would \ngive the estimate\
    \ of the seepage loss (Figure 8.4). The measured pan evaporations were \n186 \

    \ on moderate wind speed of about 2.5 m s-1 \nand a high relative humidity greater\
    \ than 70% observed at the nearest PAGASA weather \nstation in UP Los Baños. The\

    \ on percolation and water supply \n187 \n \n \nAt least two measurements of water\
    \ levels in the cylinders each day, one in the morning \nand one in the afternoon,\
    \ were made. Additional measurements of water levels in the \ncylinders were done\
    \ in the event of high percolation and seepage rates to avoid water level \ndropping\
    \ too low or, in the event of heavy rainfall, to avoid overflowing of water from\
    \ the \ncylinders. Rainfall measurements were done either immediately right after\
    \ the rain as the \ncollected rainfall might evaporate quickly or just before\
    \ an imminent rain occurrence. For \neach site, measurements were continued until\
    \ three weeks or until the readings stabilized. \nPonding tests were carried out\
    \ on a section of each farm ditch serving the paddy field \nwhere percolation\
    \ measurements were conducted simultaneously (Figure 8.5). The selected \ncanal\
    \ sections were more or less straight, with uniform cross section, at least 20\
    \ metres in \nlength with well-maintained banks. They were isolated by installing\
    \ a rectangular GI sheet \nacross its two ends, thus, creating a pond. A plastic-sealed\
    \ earth dike or mud embankment at \nleast a metre from each end of the isolated\
    \ canal section was constructed to create a buffer \nzone. A perforated, 20-cm\
    \ diameter GI sheet stilling basin was installed at the middle of the \nisolated\
    \ or ponded canal section for measuring the water level in the canal. Its surface\
    \ was \nlevelled by using a carpenter's level bar.  \n \n \nFigure 8.5. Ponding\
    \ test setup in Balanac RIS \n \n \n188  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nAt the start of each ponding test\
    \ run, the isolated section and the buffer ponds were \nfilled with water up to\
    \ the designed full supply level of the canal at least 12 hours before \nmeasuring\
    \ the water surface drop. The measurements of the water level and top width of\
    \ the \nwater surface at one-meter interval in the ponded section were taken at\
    \ least twice a day. The \nwater level was allowed to drop within the reading\
    \ range capacity of the hook gauge. Just \nbefore the readable maximum drop is\
    \ reached, the pond was refilled with water and another \nround of measurements\
    \ started. The measurements were continued for about three weeks or \nuntil the\
    \ readings stabilized, or when at least three consecutive readings were comparable.\
    \ \nThey were corrected for observed rainfall. \n \n8.3.1 \nResults of the percolation\
    \ tests \n \nThe adjusted evaporation values averaged from 2-4 mm day-1 in the\
    \ two systems. These \nvalues were reasonably in the same order of magnitude of\
    \ the values observed at the National \nAgrometeorology Station of PAGASA during\
    \ the same period and the International Rice \nResearch Institute (IRRI) in Los\
    \ Baños, the two nearest weather stations.  \nPercolation rates in Balanac RIS\
    \ averaged from 1-30 mm day-1 (Table 8.1 and Figure \n8.6). Only four of the nine\
    \ experiment sites (Sabang, Pagsawitan, Calachuchi and Mayapa) \nhad average percolation\
    \ rates within the assumed value for the system of 2 mm day-1. Two of \nthe nine\
    \ sites (Layugan and Cabanbanan) had average values greater than 28 mm day-1.\
    \ \nNotably, the seepage rates observed in these sites were equally high as their\
    \ respective \npercolation rates. Another two sites (Buboy and Bucal) had significantly\
    \ different average \npercolation rates for two distinct soil conditions. From\
    \ the relatively settled soil of the \nexperiment site during the first half of\
    \ the duration of the experiment to disturbed, \nsurrounding soils as a result\
    \ of second ploughing, the percolation values for Buboy increased \nfrom 5 mm\
    \ day-1 to 22 mm day-1. Meanwhile, the average percolation rates for Bucal \n\
    experiment site decreased from about 12 mm day-1 to less than 1 mm day-1 when\
    \ adjacent \nfields became saturated. These changes in percolation values following\
    \ the respective changes \nin field conditions were generally expected. There\
    \ were zero and small negative values of \npercolation measured in the Balanac\
    \ experiment areas, except for Layugan, Cabanbanan and \nBuboy experiment sites.\
    \ These values could be due to upswelling of seepage flow. \nRevalidation of design\

    \ RIS, the measured average percolation rates in the 10 sites ranged from 1-\n\
    6 mm day-1 (Table 8.2 and Figure 8.7). Only three of the 10 experiment sites (Bagumbayan,\
    \ \nWilingwiling and JP Rizal) had average percolation rates within the higher\
    \ assumed value for \nthe system of 1.4 mm day-1. The highest average percolation\
    \ value of about 6 mm day-1 was \nestimated for Bubukal site. Four sites (Inayapan,\

    \ of soil texture analyses (Tables 8.3 and 8.4) showed some differences \nbetween\
    \ the soil samples from the experiment sites and their assigned soil textures\
    \ as \nindicated on the official soil classification map of the Bureau of Soil\
    \ and Water Management \n(BSWM). The most notable was the occurrence of sandy\
    \ soils in Cabanbanan, Layugan and \nBiñan sites. Sandy soils were not among the\
    \ reported soil textures, which range from clay to \nclay loam in Balanac RIS\
    \ and clay in Sta. Maria RIS. The presence of sandy soils could \nexplain the\
    \ high percolation values obtained in Layugan and Cabanbanan. Sandy or light \n\
    textured soils are associated with higher percolation and seepage rates as they\
    \ offer less \nresistance to movement of water. Among the three sites with light-textured\

    \ percolation values. The reason for this could be the continuous deep seepage\
    \ flow \nand lesser resistance of soil below 30 cm depth (loamy sand) to such\
    \ flow or even upswelling. \nThe Biñan site was located downstream. \n \n \nLS\

    \ clayey soils, only Wilingwiling and JP Rizal had measured \npercolation rates\
    \ within the assumed design value of 1.3 mm day-1 for clay soils. Meanwhile, \n\
    majority of the sites with clay loam soils had percolation rates almost twice\
    \ as much as the 1.8 \nmm day-1 design values for percolation. \nThe percolation\
    \ rates obtained in the sites with sandy soils had 25-30 mm day-1, which \nare\
    \ much higher than the 2 mm day-1 conventionally used in the design for sandy\
    \ clay loam \nsoils and 4 mm day-1 for sandy loam soils. Aside from soil texture,\
    \ other factors that could \nhave influenced the percolation rates were the relative\
    \ elevation of experiment site to the \nadjacent fields, welling up of shallow\
    \ groundwater and ploughing that loosens or breaks the \nhard pan. \n \n \n \n\

    \ showed a wide range of magnitudes of conveyance \nlosses in the representative\
    \ farm ditches of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS (Tables 8.5 and \n8.6). Considering\

    \ of water levels at the flume were being monitored by the \nirrigators association\
    \ since 2002. However, there were non-ideal conditions for accurate flow \nmeasurement\
    \ by using Parshall flumes seen during the field investigation. These included\

    \ is estimated \nbased on this sustained flow and irrigation water requirement\
    \ (Personal communication). Dry \nseason flow measurements were also carried out\
    \ in Sta. Maria RIS to approximate its low \nflows. The discharges (Table 8.8)\
    \ were estimated by using the area-volume method, which \nuses a current meter\
    \ to measure flow velocity. The results of sample flow measurements \nshowed that\
    \ the magnitude of available water supply used in projecting the areas that can\
    \ be \nirrigated by Santa Maria Main Canal during dry seasons were within the\
    \ range of the \nmeasured flow rates. In contrast, the assumed available water\

    \ values. \n \n8.5.3 \nProgrammed areas versus actual irrigated areas \n \nIn\
    \ general, a comparison between the projected area for irrigation and the actual\
    \ area served \nwould be an indication of the reliability of the assumed values\
    \ of available water supply. In \nthe case of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS,\
    \ their respective programmed areas or target areas \nfor irrigation were achieved\
    \ better during the dry season than during the wet season (Figure \n8.12). These\
    \ trends were attributed to less certainty of the spatial extent of service areas\
    \ that \nwill be submerged due to heavy downpours and floods during the monsoon\

    \ it can be observed that the areas programmed for water delivery service in both\
    \ \nsystems remained less than their respective firmed-up service areas (FUSA).\
    \ The difference \npertained to the portion of FUSA which were deemed unserviceable\
    \ due to lack of operational \nirrigation facilities or forecasted drier dry season.\
    \ These non-operational FUSA were \nexcluded in the irrigation service delivery\
    \ schedule. \n \n8.6 Prospects of technical assessment of dependable water supply\
    \ \n \nOnly about a third of the 165 rivers feeding irrigation systems the NIA\
    \ operates and maintains \nare gauged. Given the scarcity of river flow data,\
    \ hydrologic studies for many irrigation and \nmultipurpose irrigation infrastructure\
    \ projects employed various methods or techniques of \nestimating dependable water\
    \ supply. \nThe results of the review on hydrologic studies carried out in the\
    \ 20 sample irrigation \nprojects during 2010-2015 showed that the methods used\
    \ included one or a combination of \nthe following: empirical and statistical\
    \ techniques, regionalization, conceptual rainfall-runoff \nrelations, spot flow\
    \ measurements and local knowledge of the seasonal flows to assess water \nsupply\
    \ availability for irrigation projects (Annex G). The methods commonly utilized\
    \ were \nregionalization using regression and correlation analyses and drainage\
    \ area ratio and \nproportion to runoff, rational method and dry season flow measurements\
    \ using current meters. \nCognizant of the importance of reliable data on available\
    \ water supply to irrigation \nsystem modernisation plans, the potentials for\
    \ technical prediction of flows of Balanac River \nand San Antonio River, which\
    \ feed Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS, respectively, were \ninvestigated. The\
    \ results of a survey of official and popular data sources on the availability\
    \ of \ncommonly required information for estimating river flows for ungauged rivers\
    \ indicated that \nflow estimates obtained by using straight forward application\
    \ of the commonly used \nregionalization method would be fraught with considerable\
    \ uncertainty (Table 8.9). Issues on \nthe accuracy of the estimates would stem\
    \ from the scarcity of relevant data inputs for flow \nassessments. An extrapolation\
    \ of flows for recent decades based on empirical and statistical \nrelations of\
    \ recorded data prior to 1980s imply the assumption of stationarity of river basins\
    \ \nbehaviour and response to factors affecting runoff. The local knowledge on\
    \ the significant \nchanges in land use in the river basin, climate and river\
    \ flow regimes refutes such assumption.  \nRevalidation of design assumptions\

    \ in the Philippines \n \n \nIt would need to be continuing activity in order\
    \ to start building a hydrologic database for \nmore reliable flow estimates.\
    \ Information on the available streaflow records for rivers within \nthe river\
    \ basin or nearby similar basins would be relevant in designing for the methodology\
    \ \nand selecting for tools for available irrigation water supply assessment study.\
    \ Such \ninformation was gathered from the DPWH and NWRC and assembled for the\
    \ case study \nsystems (Annex H). \n \n8.7 Conclusion \n \nThe results of in-situ\
    \ measurements of percolation revealed different rates in different parts of \n\
    the service areas of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. The deviations of measured\
    \ percolations \nfrom the assumed values of 2 mm day-1 for Balanac RIS were higher\
    \ by 5-14 times of the \nformer in four of the experiment sites. In Sta. Maria\
    \ RIS, the observed deviations in four of \nthe measurement sites were higher\
    \ by about 2-5 times of the assumed rate of 1.3-1.4 mm day-\n1. The significantly\
    \ higher actual percolation rates will result in gross underestimation of crop\
    \ \nwater requirement and irrigation requirement. The wide range of measured percolation\
    \ rates \nwithin the service areas, especially in Balanac RIS, points to the deficiency\
    \ of a design and \nplanning approach of assigning a percolation value for the\
    \ whole service area based on an \nassumed homogeneity or generalized characterization\
    \ of the soil in the area. The big \ndifference between the assumed and actual\
    \ percolation rates presents a strong case for the \nneed to determine the actual\
    \ value in at least one representative site per turnout service area. \nThe magnitudes\
    \ of diverted flows computed by using the discharge-head relations for \nSta.\
    \ Maria RIS main canals and the corresponding water level data were much lower\
    \ than the \navailable flows used in projecting the area to be irrigated. The\
    \ assumed available flows for \nSta. Maria and Mata main canals have probabilities\
    \ of exceedance of only about 33 and 16%, \nrespectively. Such low probabilities\
    \ ran counter to the local knowledge and general field \nobservations of the \"\
    normal\" flows along the main canals. The low probabilities of the \nassumed flow\
    \ magnitudes that resulted in dry season actual irrigated areas within the \n\
    neighbourhood of the figures for dry season programmed areas would mean that the\
    \ \ndischarge-head relations were no longer valid. The results of sample flow\
    \ measurements lent \ncredence to the validity of the assumed flows based on field\
    \ experience and local knowledge \nRevalidation of design assumptions on percolation\
    \ and water supply \n209 \n \n \non the usual flow magnitudes of SMMC. However,\
    \ the results of similar flow measurements \ndid not support the assumption on\
    \ the water availability in the case of MMC. \nReliable data on available water\
    \ for an irrigation system are crucial inputs to the \nformulation of options\
    \ for system modernisation, especially those aimed at expanding the \nservice\
    \ area and increasing cropping intensity. Availability of water would be a rational\
    \ \ncriterion in prioritizing rehabilitation and modernisation project proposals\
    \ for budget \nallocation. Results of preliminary investigation showed that Balanac\
    \ RIS has relatively good \npotentials to adequately meet its present irrigation\
    \ demand as well as that of possible service \narea expansion. In contrast, expanding\
    \ the irrigation coverage of Sta. Maria RIS was \nconstrained by limited water\
    \ supply at the source. To better quantify the available water and \nfine-tune\
    \ modernisation plans, in-depth technical assessments of discharges of Balanac\
    \ River \nand Sta. Maria River must be pursued. The utility of the regionalization\
    \ method by using \nsimilar river basins belonging to same climate type in adjacent\
    \ regions need to be \ninvestigated. Likewise, the use of geographic information\
    \ systems (GIS) and remote sensing \ndata, which have been successfully used in\
    \ other countries in quantifying the required river \nbasin parameters, would\
    \ have to be explored. More importantly, a river flow gauging program \nneeds\
    \ to be carried out. \n \n \n \n9 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SYSTEM \nMANAGEMENT,\
    \ SERVICES AND DEMAND TO \nIDENTIFY MODERNISATION POTENTIALS \n \n9.1 Introduction\
    \ \n \nComprehensive knowledge about the water flow paths, O&M, irrigation service,\
    \ unit service \nareas and demand for operation is a crucial input to the formulation\
    \ of appropriate and \nworkable plans for irrigation system modernisation (Renault\
    \ et al., 2007). Good \nunderstanding of the existing and potential sources of\
    \ inflows and outflows in the service \narea, their routes, points of convergence,\
    \ flow magnitudes and timings is specifically \nimportant in developing water\
    \ distribution and allocation strategies, evacuation of flood water \nand identifying\
    \ locations for water reuse facilities. Meanwhile, knowing the current resource\
    \ \ninputs and cost of O&M lends insights on the cost-effectiveness of current\
    \ operation and \nmaintenance and consequently, on identifying cost-saving items\
    \ and technical options for a \nmore cost-effective operation. Also, it provides\
    \ information on setting a deliverable service \nlevel and price of water delivery\
    \ service. On the other hand, awareness of the quality of \ncurrent irrigation\
    \ service and types of services to other users within the service area, or even\
    \ \nat the basin level will facilitate a more holistic examination of the present\
    \ state of service as \nwell as the challenges and prospects for improving and\
    \ expanding it. \nOne kind and level of irrigation service requirement is easier\
    \ to fulfill than multiple \ndemands. Thus, from a management perspective, partitioning\
    \ of the service area into sub-\nareas based on homogeneity of desired service,\
    \ hydrologic characteristics and level of \nparticipatory management is desirable\
    \ as it would allow management of each partitioned area \nas a single management\
    \ unit. This would promote greater responsiveness of operation to the \nunit-specific\
    \ irrigation service needs and a more efficient system and water management. \n\
    Moreover, assessment of the corresponding operational needs to achieve the set\
    \ targets of \nwater delivery service at key distribution points is critical to\
    \ rational allocation of irrigation \nmanagement resources such as manpower, skills,\
    \ transportation, communication, water \ndistribution structures and monitoring\
    \ equipments, among others. \n212 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \nThe MASSCOTE approach involves spatial analyses\
    \ of the information on water \nnetwork, management unit, O&M, irrigation service\
    \ and demand, among others, in crafting \nfor a modernisation plan for an irrigation\
    \ system. This chapter is aimed at applying its \nanalytical concepts and tools\
    \ while crafting appropriate adaptive-modifications to suit the case \nof small-scale\
    \ national irrigation systems in the Philippines. \n \n9.2 General research methodology\
    \ \n \nCharacterization of the water network, system operation, maintenance and\
    \ management and \nirrigation service in the context of identifying potential\
    \ improvements of present and possible \nfuture scenarios necessitated analyses\
    \ of considerable system-specific data and information. \nHowever, relevant data\
    \ and information are scarce and not systematically organized in the \ncase of\
    \ Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. This may be attributed to the fact that system\
    \ \nmanagement is more focused on day-to-day field operation and institutional\
    \ administration. \nData collection, collation and generation were carried out\
    \ in preparation for irrigation system \ncharacterization and analysis. \nComposite\
    \ maps of water flow path networks were GIS-generated based on a 5 m \nresolution\
    \ digital elevation model (DTM) sourced from the National Mapping and Resource\
    \ \nInformation Authority (NAMRIA), Google earth images of the irrigation service\
    \ areas, paper \nmaps and AutoCad files of the general irrigation system layout.\
    \ GIS-usable files of the \nrelative locations of current tertiary service areas,\
    \ or management units within the service area \nwere generated based on the system\
    \ paper parcellary maps, global positioning system (GPS) \ndata and Google Earth\
    \ delineation technique. \nThe water sources and immediate supply canals, percentage\
    \ of area supplied by each \nsource and seasonal water supply situation were identified\
    \ for each TSA. Well drillings were \ncarried out in two sites in Sta. Maria to\
    \ investigate the potentials of its groundwater resource \nfor supplemental irrigation\
    \ and to identify possible schemes for conjunctive use of pumped \nwater and dam-diverted\
    \ water in improving water delivery service. \nThe cost of management, operation\
    \ and maintenance were determined based on the \nfinancial statements of the water\
    \ users associations and the NIA-system related expenses. \nPercentages of expenses\
    \ for the different cost items were determined. Actual expenses were \nCharacterization\
    \ of the system management, irrigation demand and improvement options \n213 \n\
    \ \n \ncompared with country average and standard values adopted by NIA for planning\
    \ purposes. \nThe relative quality of irrigation service was assessed in terms\
    \ of adequacy, reliability, \nequity, flexibility and measurements of water delivery\
    \ (Annex I). The assessment made use of \nthe system data gathered through questionnaires,\
    \ system walkthroughs and field interviews of \nsystem operators and turnout service\
    \ area (TSA) leaders of the water users associations. \nExcept for equity, each\
    \ of the indicators of quality of irrigation service was rated according to \n\
    the rapid appraisal procedure (RAP) rating scale of 0 to 4 (with 0 the worst and\
    \ 4 the best) for \nactual water delivery service. The equity was defined based\
    \ on the sufficiency of the irrigation \nsupply available to a turnout service\
    \ area vis-a-vis that of most upstream areas. It was rated in \na scale of 0 (very\
    \ low compared to upstream) to 4 (same as that of upstream farms) by the \nfarmer-leaders\
    \ of each turnout service area (TSA). The overall values indicating the quality\
    \ of \nservice for each TSA were computed following the RAP method. Spatial distributions\
    \ of the \nquality of water delivery service as well as those of other categories\
    \ of water uses within the \nservice areas were identified. \nThe demand for canal\
    \ operation was qualitatively assessed based on the three factors \nproposed in\
    \ MASSCOTE - demand for the service, perturbation and sensitivity (Annex I). \n\
    The demand for service was determined based on the level of crop risk or vulnerability\
    \ due to \nwater scarcity, absence of other sources of supplemental water and\
    \ occurrence of flood. A \nvalue of 1 was assigned to each risk situation existing\
    \ in the TSA of interest. Due to the lack \nof relevant flow records and infeasibility\
    \ of flow measurements to determine sensitivity and \nperturbations, indicators\
    \ were used instead. Diversion sensitivity or hydraulic flexibility was \ndetermined\
    \ based on the hydraulic type and operational status of the gates while level\
    \ of \nperturbation was based on the number of ungated offtakes and inlets upstream\
    \ of the gate or \nstructure of interest. A rating scale of 1 (low) to 3 (high)\
    \ was used for both. The aggregated \nvalues of the three factors of demand for\
    \ canal operation were reclassified into 5 groups \nindicating the different levels\
    \ of demand for canal operation. \n \n9.2.1 \nWater network \n \nThe geographic\
    \ locations of the irrigation network and developed drains are quite well known\
    \ \nto systems operators and farmers. However, this is not the case for natural\
    \ drains or \n214 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \nwaterways within the service areas. The composite\
    \ map of canals and drainage networks, \nincluding natural drains and waterways\
    \ and contour maps of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS \nlend information where\
    \ water is drained and, relatively, how much drainage water flows at \nspecific\
    \ locations (Figures 9.1 and 9.2). The use of 5 m resolution DEM for irrigation\
    \ service \nareas would greatly facilitate the task of identifying potential sites\
    \ for water reuse facilities as \ncompared to the use of conventional paper maps\
    \ generated during the project planning phase \nand feasibility study for the\
    \ original system (Annex J). Morever, such old maps may no longer \nexist at NIA\
    \ offices as in the case of Balanace RIS. \n \n9.2.2 \nCost of management, operation\
    \ and maintenance \n \nThe expenses incurred in providing water delivery service\
    \ typcially include salaries, wages, \ninsurance, repairs and maintenance, travels\
    \ and office supplies, among others. In the case of \nthe Laguna-Rizal Irrigation\
    \ Management Office (IMO), which manages Balanac RIS and Sta. \nMaria RIS among\
    \ other systems, cost accounting of irrigation management and operation per \n\
    system is not done since basically its same set of personnel, equipments and other\
    \ resources \nare used for managing all irrigation systems under its jurisdiction.\
    \ In short, the IMO is a \ncommon resource pool for the irrigation systems under\
    \ its jurisdiction. \nTo determine the cost of operation and maintenance (O&M)\
    \ of the case study systems, a \ndistinction has been made between expenses incurred\
    \ in providing frontline water delivery \nservice or basic system operation and\
    \ general management or administration. The former was \ndefined as the system\
    \ O&M cost. In the case of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS, which are \nunder Irrigation\
    \ Management Transfer (IMT) contracts, the O&M cost was grouped into two: \nthe\
    \ NIA-based expenses and the water users' association (WUA) expenses (Table 9.1).\
    \ The \nformer mostly included expenses for NIA personnel directly involved in\
    \ the system \noperations. The latter included the cost of water delivery service\
    \ and system repairs and \nmaintenance (details in Annex K). \n \n \n \n \nCharacterization\

    \ O&M for Balanac RIS was about 40% higher than \nthat for Sta. Maria RIS for\
    \ their respective period-of-analysis. The O&M costs per ha for \nBalanac RIS\
    \ and Sta. Maria RIS were about PhP 1,500 and PhP 1,100 (Figure 9.3). These \n\
    expenses were lower than the standard cost per ha (PhP 2,000-3,000) for O&M used\
    \ by NIA \nfor planning purposes. Also, these costs were lower than the PhP 2,300\
    \ ha-1 average national \nO&M budget and the PhP 1,900 ha-1 average national actual\
    \ expenses (Figure 9.4). \nThe personnel-related expenses accounted for about\
    \ 70% of the O&M expenses of each \nsystem. The slightly higher personnel expenses\
    \ for Sta. Maria RIS were due to the incentives \nits WUA gave to its officers\
    \ and workers who met their O&M targets. In contrast, Balanac did \nnot have an\
    \ incentive system for its personnel. About 12% of the budget of Sta. Maria RIS\
    \ \nwas spent for repairs and maintenance of its canal network, while only about\
    \ 6% was spent in \nBalanac RIS. The higher travel expenses of Sta. Maria RIS\
    \ were mainly due to the fuel \nallowance given to its canal operators or water\
    \ distribution men-cum-ISF collectors. There \nwere no fuel allowances given for\
    \ their couterparts in Balanac RIS. \n \n \n \n \n \n218 \nModernisation strategy\

    \ expenditure of Balanac RIS was at least four times higher \nthan that of Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS and was the second highest cost item for the system. Also, the \n\
    NIA spent at least four times more for its O&M than that for Sta. Maria RIS. \n\
    While the relatively low O&M budget for both systems present a basis for an \n\
    assumption that the budget was spent on the basic necessities for O&M, there were\
    \ cost items \nthat would need to be examined when identifying a possible cost-effective\
    \ O&M plan. \nMiscellaneous expenditure in Balanac RIS was twice the cost incurred\
    \ for a more legitimate \nand defined canal repairs and maintenance expenditure.\
    \ The average expenditures for \npersonnel services of almost 70% in both systems\
    \ were significantly higher than the \nprescribed and agreed percentage allocation\
    \ for such expenses, that is, 40% of the WUA \nbudget. This is so even after excluding\
    \ the costs of incentives and training and despite the fact \nthat only NIA field\
    \ personnel who are directly involved with the system operations and only \nIMT-prescribed\
    \ WUA personnel composition were considered in the computation of \npersonnel\
    \ expenses. \nThe issue of inadequate O&M budget of publicly funded irrigation\
    \ systems has been \nraised by a number of researchers and irrigation professionals\
    \ (McLoughin, 1988; \nWijayaratna and Vermillion, 1994; Vermillion, 2005; Burton,\
    \ 2010; Malik et al., 2014). \n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n2010\n\

    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nQuestions\
    \ on how much is a reasonably adequate budget for O&M activities that would result\
    \ \nin the achievement of the target irrigation system performance has been asked\
    \ by policy- and \ndecision-makers. However, such topic is outside the scope of\
    \ this research study. \nUnder the NIA IMT arrangement, the WUA budget mainly\
    \ comes from its share of the \nISF collection. The sharing ratio between the\
    \ NIA and WUA varies depending on the IMT \nstage level, hence, delineation of\
    \ respective O&M responsibilities. In case of Balanac RIS and \nSta. Maria RIS,\
    \ the ISF shares of the WUA were in effect the frontline O&M budget for the \n\
    systems as their respective WUA spent it to carry out canal operations, water\
    \ distribution and \nISF collection functions. For 2010-2015, the ISF shares of\
    \ Balanac RIS WUA averaged PhP \n1.07 million or about 53% of collected ISF (PhP\
    \ 2.02 million) while that of Sta. Maria RIS \nwas about PhP 839,000 million or\
    \ 38% of the PhP 2.20 million ISF collection (Figure 9.5). \nThe total ISF payment\
    \ or collection in Balanac RIS for the period 2005-2015 averaged \nabout 64% of\
    \ the total collectible ISF. It was about 59% of the payable or collectible ISF\
    \ in \nSta. Maria RIS. During the same period, the amount of ISF collected natiowide\
    \ averaged \nabout 61% of the total collectible ISF (Figure 9.6).  \nIn general,\
    \ an increase in ISF collection means an increase in ISF share, hence, in WUA\
    \ \nbudget for O&M. It is possible with the increase in collectible ISF, which\
    \ is dependent on the \nincrease in benefitted areas or irrigated areas that attained\
    \ a rice yield of more than 2 ton ha-1. \nDuring the dry season, the amount of\
    \ collectible ISF is proportional to the areas irrigated. This \nis not the case\
    \ during the wet season as moonson-related production constraints such as \ntyphoons,\
    \ floodings, pests and diseases result in low yield or no harvest in some parts\
    \ of the \nservice area. \nA shift or adjustment in cropping calendar to avoid\
    \ destructive periods of the moonson \nseason would help to minimize cases of\
    \ poor harvest, thus, exemption from ISF payment. Its \npossibility has to be\
    \ studied. Further, a strategy or a program aimed at encouraging ISF \npayment\
    \ and collection has to be part of a comprehensive modernisation plan. \n \n \n\

    \ (Table 9.2).  \n \n \nFigure 9.6 Average ISF payment at country level and in\
    \ Balanac RIS and \nSta. Maria RIS \n \nThe Balanac RIS has a relatively loose\

    \ direct offtakes, more than 60% of which are unofficial. Similarly, \nthe lower\
    \ level conveyance canals have a relatively high proportion of direct outlets.\
    \ \nThe operation of dam gates and care of water distribution along the main conveyance\
    \ \ncanals were responsibilities of a NIA gate keeper and the water users association\
    \ of Balanac \nRIS (BRISIA), respectively. The gates of the main intakes are open\
    \ most of the time and \nclosed only during occurrence of floods spewed by typhoons\
    \ and heavy monsoon rains. In \ngeneral, the wet cropping and dry cropping seasons\
    \ are from May to October and November \nto April, respectively. \nLaissez faire\
    \ planting calendar is practiced by farmers. There is no water distribution \n\

    \ of irrigation water supply within the \nservice area of Balanac RIS (Figures\
    \ 9.8a and 9.8b). The upstream farms had greater \nadvantage in securing their\
    \ water supply than the downstream farms. Most upstream TSA and \nthose along\
    \ the main canal can divert their irrigation water practically anytime they want\
    \ \nsince the irrigation is continuous. This \"quality\" irrigation service to\
    \ them was at the expense \nof the downstream farmers who had to wait for enough\
    \ water to reach their canal before \nstarting their farming activities for the\
    \ season.The high dependence of water availability \ndownstream to irrigation\
    \ practice of upstream farmers was one of the perennial issues \naffecting farms\
    \ at tail-end of the canal network. The cropping season in downstream farms \n\
    usually starts between August and September for the wet season and between December\
    \ to \nJanunary for the dry season. These starts of cropping are about three months\
    \ behind of that of \nupstream farms. Such late starts result to the latter part\
    \ of the crop growing period coinciding \nwith the onset of unfavourable weather\
    \ conditions - either well within the driest months or the \ntyphoon season. \n\
    The two major creeks (Biñan and Salasad) traversing the service areas were tapped\
    \ for \nirrigation purposed by installing check gates along their stretches. They\
    \ are fed by drainage \nwater from upstream farms, hence, are also dependent on\
    \ diverted water by the dams, \nespecially during the dry season. \nIn times of\
    \ El Niño or a prolonged dry season, downstream farms are water-scarce or \nleft\
    \ idle due to lack of irrigation water. About 59 farmers used water pumps to augment\
    \ their \nirrigation supply in about 52 ha farms downstream, 33 and 19 ha of which\
    \ were supplemented \nby groundwater and lake water, respectively (Figure 9.9).\
    \ Some upstream farmers can \ncultivate three crops in a year, while tail-end\
    \ farms can only have a maximum of two. \nDownstream farmers stated that such\
    \ unequal access to irrigation water was attributed to \npoor flow control and\
    \ laissez faire cropping and irrigation offtaking. While the irrigation \nsupply\
    \ is continuous a mix of non-functional and makeshift flow control structures,\
    \ such as \nvandalized proportional and duckbill weirs and slab-type cross regulators,\
    \ can be found along \nthe main conveyance canals. A weir-type and orifice-type\
    \ offtakes coexisted at the junction of \nthe main canal and laterals Buboy and\
    \ A. The former and the latter are located immediately \nupstream and downstream\
    \ of long-crested weirs, respectively. \n \n226 \nModernisation strategy for the\

    \ Balanac RIS with pump irrigation schemes \nCharacterization of the system management,\
    \ irrigation demand and improvement options \n229 \n \n \nMany direct ungated\
    \ offtakes further upstream are situated below the crest elevation of \nthese\
    \ proportional or duckbill weirs, giving them undue advantage in diverting the\
    \ water. This \ncould be the reasons why most fixed proportional weirs were eventually\
    \ vandalized. With \neither vandalized proportional weirs or remnants of original\
    \ vertical cross regulators at main \ndistribution points, the ditch tenders and\
    \ farmers either placed, or removed improvised check \nstructures to modify water\
    \ diversion. Consequently, the water delivery in the last two \nbifurcating canal\
    \ reaches (Lat A1 and Lat A1A) needed close tending during the dry season to \n\
    prevent illegal checking of water at upstream bifurcation points and turnouts.\
    \ Unlike those \nalong the upstream lateral (Buboy), water delivery to turnouts\
    \ along these last two \nbifurcations was affected by flow situations in at least\
    \ two layers of canal hierarchy. This \nmeans at least two layers of system dependency\
    \ and longer flow path, hence more \nmanagement resources. \n \n9.3.2 \nSta. Maria\
    \ RIS \n \nThe service area of Sta. Maria RIS is partitioned into turnout service\
    \ areas (TSA) based on \nhydraulic boundaries (Figure 9.10). Old system layout\
    \ documents indicated that there were 65 \nTSA in the original system that covered\
    \ a larger area. The present scheme has 30 TSA: 11 \ndivert water from the main\
    \ canal; 14 from secondary canals; 3 from both canals; and 2 are \nindependent\
    \ from the dam water supply, tapping drainage water, spring water, small streams,\
    \ \nor a combination of these (Table 9.3). Each TSA is also represented by a farmer-leader.\
    \ \nSimilarly, the Sta. Maria RIS has a relatively loose hierarchy of canals.\
    \ Its main canal \nhas more than 120 direct offtakes, about 80% of which are ungaged.\
    \ Its longest lateral (A) has \nmore than 70 direct offtakes. Similarly, about\
    \ 80% of its direct offtakes are either ungaged or \nwith removable metal flash\
    \ board. \nUnlike in Balanac RIS, the operation of dam gates and water distribution\
    \ along the main \ncanals were solely carried out by Santamasi, the water users\
    \ association of Sta. Maria RIS. It \nmainly involved two of its officials: one\
    \ for each dam and corresponding main canal. They \noperate the gates and effect\
    \ water distribution plans themselves. The TSA leaders may only \noperate the\
    \ gates of their turnouts following the instruction of the former. The gates of\
    \ the \nmain intakes are open most of the time and are closed only during occurrence\
    \ of floods. \n230 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\

    \ system modernisation plan \n233 \n \n \nWater distribution practice is rotation\
    \ by lateral (secondary canals) and by TSA. The \nwater delivery schedule among\
    \ the TSA is agreed upon by TSA representatives and WUA \nofficials prior to the\
    \ start of the cropping seasons. Rotation starts at the most upstream \nlaterals.\
    \ Whenever an El Niño episode is expected to occur, irrigation rotation is started\
    \ at the \nmost downstream TSA clusters along the main canal. Strict implementation\
    \ of the agreed-\nupon rotational irrigation schedule is followed during such\
    \ a dry period. The tail ends of main \ncanals, or those reaches immediately downstream\
    \ of the last laterals are treated as laterals as \nfar as irrigation rotation\
    \ is concerned. For lateral A, the longest secondary canal, irrigation \nrotation\
    \ is by group of TSA. \nThe permitted diversion schedule by direct offtakes or\
    \ turnouts along the main canals is \nconcurrent with the water delivery schedule\
    \ of their respective TSA groups. The same rule \nholds for direct turnouts along\
    \ lateral A. For the other laterals, their respective turnouts can \nsimultaneously\
    \ divert water. There are at most two levels of system dependence for most \n\
    turnouts. It has been observed and concurred with canal operators and farmers\
    \ that \nunauthorized diversions by ungated direct offtakes upstream of scheduled\
    \ water delivery point \nwere quite common. Such unpermitted diversions caused\
    \ frictions among farmers and \nrequired extended man-hours of close supervision\
    \ by the canal operators and, hence, \nmanagement resources. They were undermining\
    \ the implementation of agreed upon rotational \nirrigation. \nThe available irrigation\
    \ supply differed within the service area of Sta. Maria RIS \n(Figures 9.11a and\
    \ 9.11b). Seasonal variation in water supply was more notable than the \nspatial\
    \ variation. Most TSA (with the exception of the most downstream areas) had adequate\
    \ \nirrigation supply during the wet season. During the dry season, most farms\
    \ (except the most \nupstream) had limited-to-short water supply. \nUnlike Balanac\
    \ RIS, five of the nine check gates for water reuse in Sta. Maria RIS are \nindependent\
    \ from canal network and dam water. They are fed by small creeks and natural \n\
    drains originating from other sub-basins, dam tailwater or outflow, patches of\
    \ springs along \nthe foot of the mountain or a combination of these. Such water\
    \ reuse check gates included \nMasinao, Samala, Indocina, Tagalag and Cambuja.\
    \ The six TSA supplied by water from this \ncheck gates have the least dependence\
    \ on system operation service (Figure 9.12). \n234 \nModernisation strategy for\

    \ \n \nOn the average, the quality of irrigation service in the two case study\
    \ systems was the \nsame (Figures 9.13a and 9.13b). More TSA in Balanac RIS had\
    \ a higher flexibility and \nreliability of irrigation service than those in Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS. This can be attributed to the more \nabundant water supply and bigger\
    \ canal flows in Balanac RIS. On the other hand, a more \nequitable water delivery\
    \ service in Sta. Maria RIS could be mainly due to its strict \nimplementation\
    \ of irrigation rotation and similar water distribution schemes. However, it did\
    \ \nnot result to a better irrigation service because of the inherent inadequacy\
    \ of irrigation supply, \nespecially during the dry season. The readily apparent\
    \ ways to improve the quality of \nirrigation service in Balanac RIS and Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS lie in the improvements on water \ndistribution and increasing the\
    \ irrigation water supply, respectively. The demand for canal \noperation would\
    \ be higher in Balanac RIS mainly due to the lack of functioning flow control\
    \ \nstructures and the higher proportions of ungated turnouts along its main conveyance\
    \ canals \n(Figures 9.14a and 9.14b).  \nThe most downstream farms of Balanac\
    \ RIS and Sta. Maria RIS are subjected to \nseasonal flooding (Figures 9.15a and\
    \ 9.15b). Flood inundation is more frequent in Balanac \nRIS where a significant\
    \ stretch of its service areas are adjacent to the Laguna Lake. About 10 \nof\
    \ its TSA experience destructive flooding almost on a regular basis. Majority\
    \ of these are the \nsame farms that had to wait for their upstream counterpart\
    \ to satisfy their irrigation \nrequirement and free up irrigation water they\
    \ no longer need. Shallow tubewells and open \nsource water pumps are used in\
    \ at least three of these TSA to supplement canal water supply. \nExcept in the\
    \ most upstream service area (Magdalena) the service areas of Balanac RIS \nand\
    \ Sta. Maria RIS are well within the area classified by the National Water Resources\
    \ \nCouncil (1982) as shallow well areas or areas with static groundwater levels\
    \ within six metres \nbelow ground surface (Annex L). As evidenced by use of tubewells\
    \ by farmers in downstream \nareas of Balanac RIS, there are potentials for shallow\
    \ tubewell irrigation in these areas, which \nwould help address the high dependency\
    \ on canal water use upstream. Similarly, the number \nof free-flowing wells and\
    \ ponded areas fed by spring water located in the vicinity of Sta. \nMaria main\
    \ canal along the foot of the mountain range would indicate good potentials of\
    \ these \ngroundwater resources as supplemental source of irrigation water. There\

    \ in Sta. Maria \nRIS, would suggest that hand tubewells are appropriate for use\
    \ in these areas. \nBoth Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS were designed and constructed\
    \ to provide water for \nrice monocropping. Though still mainly for rice irrigation,\
    \ there were other water uses that \nhave emerged within the service areas. These\
    \ include fish ponds, aquarium fish nursery, \npiggery, poultry, orchard and vegetable\

    \ of each of the selected \ndrilling sites. However, the drilling activity was\
    \ not successful in both sites due to \nunfavorable formation underneath. \nThe\
    \ drilling site near TSA 13 was underlain by loose rocky formation to at least\
    \ about \n15-meter depth as indicated by the well cutting materials obtained from\
    \ the borehole. The drill \nhead (drilling stem and drill bit) detached from the\
    \ rest of the drilling stem and got stucked in \nthe formation. \nNo good aquifer\
    \ was found in the drilling site near TSA 28 within the almost 55-meter \ndrilling\
    \ depth. The site was underlain by a clayey soil formation as suggested by the\
    \ well \ncutting materials from the well borehole. The drilling activities for\

    \ sites in difficult areas are 50% while that of shallow well sites and \nnon-productive\
    \ well sites are 25% each. \n \n9.6 Conclusions \n \nThe recommended characterization\
    \ steps of water flow path, management units, O&M, \nirrigation service and demand\
    \ in MASSCOTE compelled a structured and oriented \nexamination of the present\
    \ state and prospects of the irrigation systems on these aspects. \nThus, they\
    \ provided interrelated indicative information on the promising improvement options\
    \ \nand course of action towards modernizing the systems. The service areas of\
    \ Balanac RIS and \nSta. Maria RIS are cultivated for rice monoculture and have\
    \ basically homogeneous irrigation \nrequirements. Despite the relatively relaxed\
    \ water delivery service requirements, the results of \ncharacterization of the\
    \ demands for canal operation supervision in both systems indicated \nhigh demands.\
    \ Such high demands can be attributed to the presence of many ungated direct \n\
    offtakes along the main and lateral canals and dysfunctional diversion structures\
    \ at major \ndistribution points. There should be no direct offtaking or diversion\
    \ of water to individual \nfarms and ungated offtakes or turnouts along the main\
    \ conveyance canals if a more orderly \nand equitable canal operation and water\
    \ distribution is to be realized. \nWhile there were delineated management units\
    \ and TSA organizations, many have a \nnumber of individual farm turnouts diverting\
    \ water from their respective TSA supply canals \nwhich are also supplying downstream\
    \ TSA. Some of them are diverting from the main canal. \nSuch loose canal hierarchy\
    \ resulted to unwieldy water distribution. The TSA or management \nunit should\
    \ have equal access to their common immediate supply canals, and as much as \n\
    possible, have only one diversion point for each. This would help consolidate\
    \ each TSA for a \nmore manageable system operation and strengthening WUA leadership\
    \ in carrying out water \ndistribution duties. Limiting the number of diversion\
    \ points to the optimum would require \nOptions and vision for irrigation system\
    \ modernisation plan \n249 \n \n \nrevisiting farm canal layout in each TSA and\
    \ ensuring each farm has access to a farm ditch. \nThere were spatial variations\
    \ of water adequacy within the service areas of Balanac RIS \nand Sta. Maria RIS.\
    \ Water deprivation and submergence of tail-ends TSA were experienced \nin both\
    \ systems, especially during El Niño and La Niña years. Meanwhile, composite maps\
    \ of \nthe water flow paths showed potential sites for additional water reuse\
    \ facilities. Also, the \npresence of shallow aquifers in downstream areas of\
    \ Balanac RIS and patches of springs in \nSta. Maria RIS indicated potential sources\
    \ of supplemental water for irrigation. As \ndemonstrated in Sta. Maria RIS, implementing\
    \ a system-wide cropping calendar, hence, \nrotational irrigation schedules for\
    \ each TSA helped in coping with their limited water supply, \nbut only to a limited\
    \ extent. It could not circumvent the water supply shortage caused by \nstrong\
    \ El Niño events. Also, their practice of shifting the planting season ahead of\
    \ the onset of \nrainy months to avoid the destructive period of the monsoon season\
    \ was constrained by the \nlow available water supply from the rivers. Planting\
    \ at these earlier dates is more favourable \nonly if irrigation water is available.\
    \ The groundwater resources in the service areas present an \nalternative source\
    \ of additional water. Shallow tubewell irrigation development in tail end \n\
    areas of Balanac RIS and the feasibility of spring development for irrigation\
    \ supply \naugmentation for Sta. Maria RIS would have to be explored. \nThe results\
    \ of the expenditure analysis showed that the cost of frontline O&M activities\
    \ \nin both systems were below the PhP 2,000 - 3,000 ha-1 standard planning budget\
    \ and the PhP \n1,900 ha-1 actual average expenses for O&M nationwide. The WUA\
    \ budgets, which \nconstituted the amounts spent for field system operations and\
    \ were sourced from ISF \ncollection, were much lower than the amount of ISF collected\
    \ in respective systems. For the \n2010-2015 period, they averaged at about 53%\
    \ and 38% of the ISF collected in Balanac RIS \nand Sta. Maria RIS, respectively.\
    \ It should be noted that Sta. Maria RIS received a lower \npercentage of its\
    \ ISF collection despite its slightly higher ISF collection (PhP 2.2 million)\
    \ \nthan that of Balanac RIS (PhP 2.0 million) and the same stage of IMT as Balanac\
    \ RIS.  \nThe two systems spent about 70% of their respective WUA budgets on wages\
    \ and salaries \nof its field personnel. Only about 12% and 6% were spent for\
    \ canal repair and maintenance in \nSta. Maria RIS and Balanac RIS, respectively.\
    \ While there were some cost items where \nsavings are possible such as miscellaneous\
    \ in Balanac RIS and travel in Sta. Maria RIS, an \nincrease in the current WUA\
    \ budget would have to be considered by the NIA. Meanwhile \n250 \nModernisation\
    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nunder\
    \ the current arrangement, the WUA budget increases with increased ISF payment.\
    \ Thus, \nmechanisms or programs to encourage or enforce ISF payment and collection\
    \ would have to \nbe initiated by the NIA and WUA. \nWhile the service areas of\
    \ Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS remained for rice mono \ncropping, a few other\
    \ agriculture-related uses have emerged within the service areas such as \naquaculture,\
    \ livestock and vegetable farms and orchards. As traditional rural community \n\
    development multiple uses of water can be expected. Likely-possible future scenarios\
    \ on \nmultiple uses of water may have to be integrated in irrigation system modernization\
    \ plans.  \n \n \n \n10 OPTIONS AND VISION FOR IRRIGATION \nSYSTEM MODERNISATION\
    \ PLAN \n \n10.1 Introduction \n \nPossible ways to improve the system operation,\
    \ maintenance and management, water delivery \nservice and overall system performance\
    \ would become evident as in-depth analysis of the \ndifferent aspects of an irrigation\
    \ system move through a series of impact assessment, system \ndiagnosis, design\
    \ revalidation and system characterization studies. The feasibility and \nappropriateness\
    \ of such potential management and/or technical solutions or modernisation \n\
    options would have to be examined at both the level of their respective management\
    \ units or \nturnout service areas and at the main system level. Modernisation\
    \ options identified at the \nlocal TSA level must be doable and agreeable with\
    \ the management and operations at the \nmain system level, and vice versa. \n\
    How the system officials and farmer-water users envision their desired future\
    \ scenarios \nfor the irrigation system and services in the context of foreseable\
    \ reality would set the targets \nand general direction for formulating an irrigation\
    \ system modernisation strategy. Also, such \nvision would have to serve as the\
    \ basis in selecting or developing a set of relevant \nmodernisation solutions\
    \ among the possible options. It is with a consolidated vision for an \nirrigation\
    \ system that the formulation of a modernisation plan needs to start. \nThis chapter\
    \ enumerates the promising management and technical modernization \nactivities\
    \ that have become evident from the findings of the research study. It discusses\
    \ a \nstrategy for modernising the Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS and other national\
    \ irrigation \nsystems that are in a similar situation. \n \n10.2 General methodology\
    \ \n \nPotential improvements of the physical strutures, operation, maintenance,\
    \ management and \ninstitutional aspects for the case study systems and national\
    \ irrigation systems in general as \nrevealed by the findings of the course of\
    \ studies carried out were collated for consideration for \n252 \nModernisation\
    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \ninclusion\
    \ in a modernisation plan. The mental images of the desired future state of their\
    \ \nrespective irrigation systems as perceived by the NIA system officials and\
    \ farmer-water users \nwere solicited through consultative meetings with them.\
    \ Open-ended questions on how they \nwould like the future state of their irrigation\
    \ systems, quality of irrigation service and irrigated \nagriculture in their\
    \ municipalities to be like in five to 10 years from today were fielded to \n\
    facilitate the start of the vision formation activities. These also included the\
    \ constraints and \npotentials to improved irrigation system performances and\
    \ what they can contribute to a \nmodernisation program for their systems. \n\
    Outlines of a modernization plan for the case study systems were drafted based\
    \ on \nfindings of the assessment, diagnostic and characterization studies as\
    \ well as based on the \narticulated vision by the system officials and farmer-water\
    \ users for their respective systems. \nThis can serve as working documents for\
    \ preliminary consultative meetings or planning \nworkshops for an irrigation\
    \ system modernisation program for the case study systems in the \nnear future.\
    \ \nA strategy for developing a modernization plan for similar national irrigation\
    \ systems in \nthe country was formulated based on the procedures and tools employed\
    \ in the case study \nsystems. Central to the modernisation strategy is the foremost\
    \ importance of a coherent link of \nthe system design, operation, maintenance\
    \ and water supply to improve irrigation water \ndelivery. \n \n10.3 Modernisation\
    \ options for Balanac RIS \n \n10.3.1 \nSystem management \n \nThe following modernisation\
    \ options for the management of Balanac RIS have been \nformulated: \n• \nadoption\
    \ of coordinated, system-wide cropping and irrigation delivery schedules. \nLaissez\
    \ faire planting schedules and diversion of irrigation by upstream farmers \n\
    disadvantaged downstream farmers in terms of ready access to irrigation water\
    \ and a \nlost opportunity to strategically schedule their farming activites to\
    \ avoid typhoon-and \nOptions and vision for irrigation system modernisation plan\
    \ \n253 \n \n \ndrought-prone months. While upstream farmers can start their land\
    \ preparation at their \npreferred dates, the downstream have to wait until upstream\
    \ farmers do not need much \nwater before they can start cultivating their farms.\
    \ Well-defined and agreed-upon \ncropping and water delivery schedules among clusters\
    \ of turnout service areas or \nmanagement units would promote equity in access\
    \ to water, orderliness in water \ndistribution and increase in irrigation coverage\
    \ in downstream areas; \n• \nadjustment of the cropping calender to earlier planting\
    \ dates. The downstream portion \nof the service areas of Balanac RIS bordering\
    \ the Laguna Lake are subjected to \nperrenial floods or inundation. The actual\
    \ service areas irrigated were smaller during the \nwet season mainly because\
    \ a significant portion of downstream service areas was \nsubmerged. Typhoon and\
    \ destructive monsoon damages were the main reasons for \nlower yield and more\
    \ ISF payment exemptions. Shifting of planting season to an earlier \nperiod would\
    \ help to avoid the destructive part of the monsoon season; \n• \ndownstream-to-upstream\
    \ irrigation schedule. Cultivation and irrigation water delivery \nfor the wet\
    \ season or a crop year can be started at downstream areas then gradually \ngoing\
    \ upstream so that farms or crop submergence can be avoided; \n• \nconjunctive\
    \ use of shallow tubewells (STW) in downstream areas. The use of small, \nindividual\
    \ pumps for irrigation were in recent years not promoted by the system \nofficials\
    \ to prevent issues on ISF payment exemptions for those farmers who pumped \n\
    their own irrigation water and reduction in collectible ISF. With a more frequent\
    \ \nprolonged drought and lower dry season river flows, alternative modes of irrigation\
    \ like \ntubewells would have to be supported as part of the coping mechanisms\
    \ of irrigated \nagriculture to El Niño-induced drought. The irrigation agency\
    \ can initiate aquifer \ncharacterization in the area to determine sustainable\
    \ pumping rates and population \ndensity of STW;  \n• \ncanal operation supervision.\
    \ Water distribution and delivery were carried out by the \ntwo WUA ditch tenders\
    \ who were deemed without authority in water distribution \nfunctions and hence,\
    \ whose daily canal tending duties are dismissed or overruled by \nmost water\
    \ users. Canal operation would need to be under the supervision of persons \n\
    elected or consented by the water users to be the authority so that the implementation\
    \ of \nagreed-upon water distribution and delivery schedules may be respected\
    \ by them; \n254 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems\
    \ in the Philippines \n \n \n• \nminimize flow dependence of sub-lateral canals.\
    \ Availability and accessibility of \nirrigation water for turnout service areas\
    \ served by Laterals A1 and A1A are dependent \non flow situations of at least\
    \ two levels of canal hierarchy. Operational adjustments for \nthe conveyance\
    \ losses and travel time of allocated discharge for these canals would \nhave\
    \ to be incorporated in the water distribution plan. Lateral A and Lateral A1\
    \ would \nhave to be considered as part of the main conveyance canal system to\
    \ level off system \ndependence of the major distribution canals; \n• \nwater\
    \ distribution plan and gate operation manual. While fixed proportional long \n\
    crested weirs were installed at the diversion point of the first two laterals\
    \ and in some \nlower level canals, makeshift check structures were sometimes\
    \ also used to divert water \ninto these laterals. Rotation by lateral was also\
    \ practiced during times of low river \nflows. Irrigation rotation and makeshift\
    \ check structures were employed on an ad hoc \nbasis and often unilaterally by\
    \ system operation personnel. An official water distribution \nplan and canal\
    \ operation instructions would have to be developed in consultation with \nthe\
    \ turnout service area leaders and dissiminated prior to the start of a crop year\
    \ and \neach cropping season; \n• \ndam desilting. Almost the whole length of\
    \ the Balanac dam as filled with mixed of \nrocks, boulders, silt and other river\
    \ sediments up to the crest level. As a result, the \nheadwork was reduced to\
    \ somewhat like an intake barrel type structure. The sluice gates \ndesigned to\
    \ flush sediments and prevent them from flowing into the main intake are \nused\
    \ to raise the water level near the main intake and effect diversion by gravity.\
    \ The \ndam would have to be desilted to restore its diversion capacity and limited\
    \ flow \nmodulation capacity;  \n• \nflow measurement. Measurements of available\
    \ water supply and diverted water have to \nbe carried out to collect flow data\
    \ that can be analyzed to support the seasonal \nprogramming of the areas to be\
    \ irrigated and the corresponding budget and resources \nallocation. A more realistic\
    \ system operation, maintenance and management plan and \nprojection of additional\
    \ service areas and areas that can be restored or modernised \nwould be possible\
    \ with analysis of actual flow data.  \n \n \nOptions and vision for irrigation\
    \ system modernisation plan \n255 \n \n \n10.3.2 \nPhysical system \n \nThe following\
    \ modernisation options for the physical system of Balanac RIS have been \nformulated:\
    \ \n• \nconsolidation of turnouts along the major conveyance canals. The total\
    \ number of \nturnouts along the Balanac main canal was more than double their\
    \ original count. Most \nof the additions were unofficial turnouts. Each turnout\
    \ along the major conveyance \ncanals represents a unit workload for canal operations\
    \ and management. The existence \nof turnouts along the main canal needs to be\
    \ rationalized based on hydraulic \nconsiderations. Restoration of the original\
    \ and construction of additional main farm \nditches would have to be carried\
    \ out to reduce the many turnouts to an optimal number; \n• \nrepair of canal\
    \ embankments. The canal embankments of the main canal at several \nlocations\
    \ need to be compacted to stop considerable water leakage through them so that\
    \ \nconveyance losses can be minimized and irrigation water can be delivered within\
    \ the \ntarget rates and duration;  \n• \nconsistency in system operational objectives.\
    \ The continued use of the original orifice \nturnouts and check structures at\
    \ the bifurcation points for upstream laterals and at some \ndownstream diversion\
    \ points ran counter to the operation objective of a splitted flow \nmethod of\
    \ water allocation to laterals and splitted flow method of water distribution\
    \ \nthrough the main system apparently adopted in the Balanac RIS as manifested\
    \ by long-\ncrested, fixed proportional weirs. Also, the presence of ungated direct\
    \ offtakes below \nthe crest elevation of the proportional weirs immediately downstream\
    \ undermines the \npurpose of the proportional flow control method. The flow control\
    \ structures need to be \nconsistent with the goal of the chosen canal operation\
    \ and water distribution; \n• \nrepair or replacement of disfunctional flow control\
    \ structures. A fixed, long-crested \nproportional weir that replaced the original\
    \ vertical gates was vandalized with a section \nof its crest destroyed. Contemporary\
    \ duck bill weirs along minor conveyance canals \nwere also vandalized. The original\
    \ gated turnouts and check structures at major \nbifucation points still exist\
    \ in their place without their gates and other movable parts. \nThese lack of\
    \ functional flow control structures resulted in unwieldy water distribution \n\
    and chaotic water delivery. Socially acceptable and a solid hydraulical combination\
    \ of \n256 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the\
    \ Philippines \n \n \nflow control structures would have to be adopted for a more\
    \ orderly water distribution \nand equitable water delivery service; \n• \nrepair\
    \ of the dam intake gate and sluice gates. The mechanical lifting mechanism and\
    \ \nthe metal guides of the dam sluice gates would have to be replaced by new\
    \ ones to \nfacilitate ease in dam operation. The bended steel frame of the intake\
    \ gate needs to be \nrepaired or replaced so that it can be fully closed during\
    \ times of big floods to prevent \nentry of flood water and submergence of the\
    \ service area; \n• \nconstruction of a reservoir-type dam. The run-of-the-river\
    \ diversion dam has inherently \nlimited capacity to support productive irrigation\
    \ for rice monoculture in times of \nprolonged drought and low river flows. Construction\
    \ of a reservoir-type dam to support \nirrigated agriculture is increasingly becoming\
    \ a necessity to cope with climate change; \n• \nsecond Balanac dam at Lower Balanac\
    \ River. Considerable volume of water supply just \nflows over the diversion dam\
    \ especially in cases where the dam is heavily silted. Such \nwater can also be\
    \ diverted at some downstream river locations within the vicinity of the \nmidstream-to-downstream\
    \ service area. This will minimize system dependence of \ndowstream areas and\
    \ decouple downstream canal operation from that of the upstream. \n \n10.4 Modernisation\
    \ options for Sta. Maria RIS \n \n10.4.1 \nSystem management \n \nThe following\
    \ modernisation options for the management of Sta. Maria RIS have been \nformulated:\
    \ \n• \nflow measurements. The approach sections of the flumes, which are used\
    \ for gauging \nwhether the diverted flows would allow relatively relaxed water\
    \ distribution schedules \nor require implementation of a tight irrigation rotation,\
    \ need to be desilted and restored \nto their ideal conditions for a more accurate\
    \ flow estimation. Staff gauges for these main \nintake flumes need to be reinstalled\
    \ and the respective discharge rating curves \nrevalidated. Similarly, flow measurement\
    \ structures at major distribution points have to \nbe revived to enable monitoring\
    \ of incoming supply and diverted water for more \nOptions and vision for irrigation\
    \ system modernisation plan \n257 \n \n \ntransparent and objective rules for\
    \ water distribution and verifiable irrigation service \ndelivery; \n• \ndesilting\
    \ of dams. The Bagumbayan and Mata dams could only raise the surface \nelevation\
    \ of a limited volume of river flows as they were heavily silted that bushes were\
    \ \ngrowing on the island of river soil created at the upstream approach of the\
    \ dams. The \nupstream approaches of the dams need to be dredged to restore the\
    \ diversion and the \ninherent storage capacity of the dams. \n \n10.4.2 \nPhysical\
    \ system \n \nThe following modernisation options for the physical system of Sta.\
    \ Maria RIS have been \nformulated: \n• \nrepair of dam intake and sluice gates.\
    \ The sluice gate of Bagumbayan Dam remained \nfully closed and inoperational\
    \ during at least the past 10 years. It would have to be \nreplaced by a new one\
    \ so that entry of sediments and rocks into the canal network can \nbe avoided.\
    \ Meanwhile the flushboard-covered sluice gate of Mata Dam is inherently \ninsufficient\
    \ to effectively flush out sediments and risky to adjust during times of flood\
    \ \nwhen it is best left open. The intake gates of both dams need repair and/or\
    \ replacement; \n• \nrepair or replacement of disfunctional flow control structures.\
    \ Several major turnouts \nand check structures along the main canals are either\
    \ damaged or missing their gates. \nThe lack of functional gates results in insufficient\
    \ control of canal flows and difficult \nmanagement of water distribution. Morever,\
    \ it makes supervision of water distribution \ncumbersome as unauthorized gate\
    \ opening or adjustment can be easily done with \nmakeshift flow control structures,\
    \ hence, the need for frequent rounds along the canals \nby the operators. Disfunctional\
    \ and missing gates need repair or replacement by new \nones to improve flow control\
    \ and to achieve the water delivery targets; \n• \nconsolidation of turnouts along\
    \ the main canals and lateral A. The number of official \nturnouts along these\
    \ canals where irrigation rotation by service areas was practiced \naccounted\
    \ for about 50% of the existing turnouts along these canals. The total number\
    \ \nof turnouts needs to be reduced to an optimal number based on hydraulic considerations\
    \ \nto simplify and more efficiently manage canal operation and water distribution.\
    \  \n258 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nAdditional main farm ditches that can serve several neighbouring turnouts\
    \ can be \nconstructed so that integration of such loose turnouts into a more\
    \ well-defined canal \nhierarchy would be possible; \n• \nclosure of ungated direct\
    \ offtakes along major conveyance canals. The presence of \ndirect offtakes along\
    \ the main canals and lateral A would undermine an orderly \nimplementation of\
    \ irrigation rotation. Ungated direct offtakes would need to be closed \npermanently\
    \ to prevent any unauthorized diversion that causes chaos in achieving the \n\
    water delivery targets, and consequently, conflicts among water users and canal\
    \ \noperators; \n• \nreservoir-type dam. The segmental relay cropping and irrigation\
    \ rotation practices, \nwhich have been adopted to cope with the limited water\
    \ supply, may have sustained the \nperennial presence of pest and diseases that\
    \ resulted to lower yields in several turnout \nservice areas. The irrigation\
    \ system would need reservoir-type dams, which would \nenable storing water during\
    \ high river flows and making it available for use especially \nduring the dry\
    \ seasons; \n• \nspring development. The several springs found along the foot\
    \ of the mountain bordering \nthe service represents potential sources of additional\
    \ irrigation water for the irrigation \nsystems. The feasibility of developing\
    \ these groundwater supply sources to augment the \nirrigation supply from the\
    \ dams would need to be explored; \n• \nConstruction of structures for drainage\
    \ water reuse. Drainage water flowing near TSA \n18 and 19 presents an opportunity\
    \ to augment water supply for these areas. Additional \ncheck gates would need\
    \ to be constructed to capture this water for irrigation purposes. \nDrains would\
    \ need to be constructed to facilitate flows of excess water into natural \nwaterways\
    \ crossing the service area and, eventually, to strategic locations for water\
    \ \nreuse structures (check gates). \n \n10.5 Visions for system modernisation\
    \ \n \nIn general, system officials, field personnel and WUA leaders of Balanac\
    \ RIS and Sta. Maria \nRIS have hoped that an entire firm up service area (FUSA)\
    \ will be adequately irrigated in the \nnear future. For the NIA system officials\
    \ and field personnel full irrigation of FUSA would \nOptions and vision for irrigation\
    \ system modernisation plan \n259 \n \n \nindicate an exemplary system and management,\
    \ increase ISF collection and a concrete \ncontribution to the government goal\
    \ of increase in rice production. For the water users it \nwould mean more harvest,\
    \ increased income and a better life.  \n \n10.5.1 \nBalanac RIS \n \nThe current\
    \ system and WUA officials were not certain if there were a stipulated vision,\
    \ \nmission and objectives for Balanac RIS as they do not have a copy of such\
    \ document. A \nvision could be drafted based on the results of the WUA consultation-workshop\
    \ on their \ndreamt and desired state for Balanac RIS (Annex N). The general picture\
    \ emerging was that \nof a strong, progressive and well-governed WUA with active\
    \ involvement in water \ndistribution, system operation and management and planning\
    \ for system improvements to \nprovide equitable, orderly and quality irrigation\
    \ service. About two-thirds of the WUA \nofficials and TSA leaders have envisioned\
    \ the following features for their system: \n• \nequitable water distribution.\
    \ Recognition of equal rights of members to water and \nirrigation service, agreements\
    \ to allocation of water based on farm size, adequate water \nfor all members,\
    \ and approval on the implementation of irrigation rotation and system-\nwide\
    \ cropping calendar, including cropping schedule adjustments to cope with adverse\
    \ \nweather;  \n• \nstrong and progressive WUA. Desires for cooperation among\
    \ members, a more \ntransparent system governance, a quality irrigation service\
    \ to achieve at least two \ncroppings and a more active TSA leaders participation\
    \ in planning system \nadministration, physical structure improvements and water\
    \ distribution; \n• \nno-leak, well-maintained and concrete-lined canals. \n \n\
    Fifty-five to 60% of them expressed desires to have the following: legal protection\
    \ for \nthe dam against ongoing quarrying operations, operational gates for the\
    \ dam, undamaged \ncanal flow control structures, canal spillway for excess water,\
    \ additional check gates for \ndrainage water reuse, flow measurement structure\
    \ for the main intake, storage-type dam, \nreliable water delivery schedule, written\
    \ rules on opening of new farms and penalty for \nnoncompliance to water distribution\
    \ rules. \n260 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in\
    \ the Philippines \n \n \nWhile most participants have envisioned equitable allocation,\
    \ quality irrigation service \nand irrigation rotation, lesser have envisaged\
    \ water supply and canal structures aspects to \nachieve them. With the water\
    \ supply and headwork aspects not among the top most desired \nsystem features,\
    \ it can be said that the majority of farmers do not see them as a major or \n\
    urgent problem. Such view could be attributed to the adequacy of available canal\
    \ water in \nupstream areas and to the fact that seasonal water scarcity is experienced\
    \ in downstream areas \nonly. Meanwhile though the majority liked irrigation rotation\
    \ schemes to be implemented, \nthere was a divide among WUA members on the choice\
    \ between \"with adjustable gates\" canal \nflow control structures and \"without\
    \ adjustable gates\". Also, there was not only a split among \nthem in the case\
    \ of direct turnouts along the main canal, but also a low response (about 40%\
    \ \nof the participants) on this matter. Such apparent disconnect of the desired\
    \ general idea to the \nspecific mechanism to realize them could be attributed\
    \ to doubts or less clear understanding \non which physical structures and distribution\
    \ schemes would lead to the envisioned general \nscenario.  \n \n10.5.2 \nSta.\
    \ Maria RIS \n \nA written vision, mission and objective for Sta. Maria RIS is\
    \ available at the office of the \nWUA. The vision stipulates a strong association\
    \ with united and active members in pursuit of \nbetter lives for themselves and\
    \ in their community. The mission is to provide the irrigation \nservice required\
    \ to enrich farmers so that they may secure good education for their children\
    \ \nand contribute to community's progress. The stated objectives include the\
    \ following: to \nbroaden their member's knowledge on modern farming technology,\
    \ to sustain the WUA \nvision by implementing policies supportive of improved\
    \ and orderly irrigation system, and to \nhelp members have income and livelihood\
    \ through farming. \nWhile the above articulated vision, missions and objectives\
    \ are in general terms, a more \nspecific description would serve as a better\
    \ guide in the formulation of an irrigation system \nmodernisation plan. The results\
    \ of the consultation workshop carried out painted the main \nfeature of the WUA-envisioned\
    \ future Sta. Maria RIS: a water secured irrigation system \nmanaged and operated\
    \ by a strong, self-sustaining and progressive WUA and capable of \ndelivering\
    \ the required irrigation service throughout its service area, non-rice agriculture\
    \ and \nOptions and vision for irrigation system modernisation plan \n261 \n \n\
    \ \nneighbouring rainfed rice areas. The most popular (preferred by at least around\
    \ two-thirds of \nTSA leaders) of the more detailed descriptions of their desired\
    \ future scenarios (Annex N) \nincluded the following: \n• \nWUA has good governance,\
    \ capability for planning and implementing system \nrehabilitation, maintenance\
    \ and improvement works, has reached IMT stage 4 (complete \nturnover of management,\
    \ operation and maintenance of irrigation systems to WUA) and \na viable government\
    \ partner in the implementation of agricultural development projects; \n• \nincreased\
    \ irrigation supply through fully functioning and well-maintained headworks, \n\
    construction of additional water reuse structures (check gates), installation\
    \ of spring \ndevelopment structures and, eventually, construction of storage-type\
    \ dams; \n• \nflow measurements along the canals and flow gauging of the rivers;\
    \ \n• \nequitable and orderly water distribution as indicated by preference of\
    \ water allocation \nbased on farm size and equal rights of each member, legal\
    \ and authorized turnouts only, \nconstruction of sufficient number of main farm\
    \ ditches to minimize direct offtaking \nalong main canal and laterals, and having\
    \ sufficient, well-functioning flow control \nstructures; \n• \nclimate-proactive\
    \ cropping calendar and water distribution schemes (irrigation rotation, \nearly\
    \ planting dates, downstream-to-upstream-farms water delivery schedule) supported\
    \ \nby flow control structures with adjustable gates; \n• \nreliable irrigation\
    \ service as suggested by the desires to establish water rights of the \noriginal\
    \ service area, facilitate canal flows (desilted, well-maintained, without leaks,\
    \ \nlined main canals) and have structures that are amenable for timely delivery\
    \ \n(intermediate reservoir, main canals with storage capacity). \n \nThe above\
    \ list of desired scenarios suggested that a sizeable majority of WUA \nrepresentatives\
    \ had clear knowledge of their most pressing concerns on their irrigation system\
    \ \nand were more united on how they would like to address them. Unlike that of\
    \ Balanac RIS, \nWUA repsentatives of Sta. Maria RIS had a clearer vision of their\
    \ future modernised system. \nSuch coherence and specific choices in the envisioned\
    \ system could be attributed to their \nmutual experiences and struggles related\
    \ to shortcomings in their present irrigation system \nand to their more active\
    \ involvement in running the system. \n262 \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \n10.6 Development of a modernisation\
    \ plan for NIS \n \nThe NIS in the country differ in terms of type of headworks,\
    \ size of service area, vintage, \nirrigation technology, management setup, level\
    \ of development and physical environment, \namong others. While these various\
    \ types and categories would seem to require as many \nvarying solutions to improve\
    \ the systems performances, a general strategy for developing an \nirrigation\
    \ modernisation plan can be formulated. Central to this strategy is to critically\
    \ analyze \nthe link among system design, operation and water supply so that potentials\
    \ and specific \nsolutions for system modernisation can be identified. \nThe proposed\
    \ strategy for formulating a NIS modernisation plan starts with an overview \n\
    of the state of irrigation system performance based on a common and readily available\
    \ \nindicator - actual irrigated areas. Provision of irrigation to its design\
    \ service area is a common, \nbasic goal of an irrigation system. How well this\
    \ goal is achieved, that is, what percentage of \nthe design service areas was\
    \ irrigated would be indicative of the system performance. \nThe primary determinant\
    \ of the extent of areas that can be irrigated is the available \nwater at the\
    \ source. Thus, the adequacy of available water supply to irrigate the design\
    \ service \narea needs to be investigated also. In cases of ungauged water supply\
    \ source and irrigation \nsystem, local knowledge on water availability for the\
    \ system and an analysis of the historical \ndata on actual area served vis-a-vis\
    \ irrigation service areas would lend indicative information \non possible constraints\
    \ to achieving 100% irrigation coverage and potentials for expanding \nthe irrigated\
    \ areas. \nThe third step of the proposed strategy is the assessment of the nature\
    \ and impact of \nintervention measures carried out to maintain the service area,\
    \ expand the area actually served \nand to improve the water delivery service.\
    \ Understanding the nature of rehabilitation and/or \nimprovement works and their\
    \ impacts in terms of either maintaining the irrigation service \nareas, expanding\
    \ irrigated areas or improving irrigation service would reveal to what extent\
    \ \nthe different intervention measures have been carried out and which measures\
    \ would have \ngood potentials for achieving the irrigation system targets. \n\
    Irrigation systems can perform only up to their design capacity. It would be \n\
    unreasonable to expect a level of system performance that goes beyond what the\
    \ physical \nsystem is made capable of. They have to be operated in such a way\
    \ they are designed to run. \nOptions and vision for irrigation system modernisation\
    \ plan \n263 \n \n \nOtherwise, there will be chaos and frustration in the system.\
    \ With an overview of level of \nsystem performance, adequacy of available water\
    \ and efforts to maintain or improve the \nirrigation service, a more comprehensive\
    \ system diagnostic need to be carried out so that root \ncauses of mediocre performance\
    \ and specific solution can be identified. System diagnosis is \nespecially important\
    \ in the case of most NIS since they have undergone a mix of technical, \nmanagement,\
    \ policy and institutional changes whose interplay and effects needs to be \n\
    systematically analyzed to be well understood. The strategy proposes a diagnostic\
    \ assessment \nframework that links NIS performance to logical coherence among\
    \ the scheme objectives, \nphysical structures, management and water supply. It\
    \ uses a combination of the logic design \nframework by Ankum (2001), diagnostic\
    \ tools of MASSCOTE, discharge-head relations and \nhydraulic flexibility concept\
    \ (described in Chapter 7). The headwork components which are \nlacking in both\
    \ the logic design framework and diagnostic tools of MASSCOTE was included \n\
    to put the water supply concerns in clear perspective. \nSome of the design values\
    \ and ensuing canal flow hydraulics may have been based on \ngeneralization or\
    \ certain assumptions during the planning stage of irrigation system \ndevelopment.\
    \ Designing for system improvement requires location-specific data and a more\
    \ \nreliable estimate of design criteria. Thus, collection and revalidation of\
    \ values of design \nparameters form part of the necessary undertakings to support\
    \ a foreseable modernisation \nprogram. Revalidation of the percolation rates\
    \ and assumptions on water availability are \ndeemed most pressing in the case\
    \ of the NIS, especially for the ungauged systems. \nHeterogeneity in soil types\
    \ may be observed even in small-scale systems, hence, different \npercolation\
    \ rates. Even in monocropped areas, this would mean different irrigation \nrequirements\
    \ that would need to be taken into account when planning for improvements in \n\
    operation and water management schemes and designing for the corresponding flow\
    \ \ndistribution structures. Meanwhile, changes in riverflow regimes have been\
    \ generally \nobserved and were attributed by many to variability in weather patterns\
    \ and in land use \nchanges within the river basin. River flow gauging and canal\
    \ flow monitoring needs to be \nstarted in several ungauged river basins and irrigation\
    \ systems in order to have build a more \nreliable flow data set for planning\
    \ a more rational modernisation programs. Thereafter, \nassessment of water availability\
    \ by using appropriate modern flow simulation models would \nbe more sensible.\
    \  \n264 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nThe proposed strategy adopts the general concepts of the MASSCOTE methodology\
    \ of \nmapping or characterization of water flow paths, O&M, irrigation service,\
    \ unit service areas, \nand demand for operation. Whenever applicable and data\
    \ are available the MASSCOTE \nprocedures were followed. Otherwise equivalent\
    \ or applicable, related analyses in the case of \nNIS were carried out. \nParticipatory\
    \ approach to formulating a vision for an irrigation system would not only \n\
    promote a sense of responsibility for and ownership of the system among farmers\
    \ but also \nhelp ensure that the ensuing modernisation plan includes managerial\
    \ and technological \nimprovements that are coherent, technically feasible and\
    \ socially acceptable. Irrigation \ndesigners and practitioners have this crucial\
    \ role of extending techical knowledge so that \nfarmers make informed choices\
    \ and decisions concerning their future irrigation system. \nRelevant and farmer-appropriate\
    \ trainings on irrigation system operation and water \nmanagement, logical combination\
    \ of flow control structures and water distribution schemes, \ncoherent general\
    \ system design for envisioned modernised irrigation systems, among others, \n\
    may be initiated by institutional development personnel of the NIA to support\
    \ irrigation \nsystem modernisation programs. \n \n10.7 Conclusion \n \nThough\
    \ with basically the same general vision for an irrigation system such as attaining\
    \ 100% \narea coverage of water delivery service for the two cropping seasons,\
    \ water users could be \nfound either electing contrasting choices on or being\
    \ mum about the specific modernisation \nmethods. This was observed in the WUA\
    \ of Balanac RIS. An opposite situation was found in \nthe WUA of Sta. Maria RIS,\
    \ where there was clear consensus on the general and specifics \nterms on desired\
    \ features of their future modernised system. Such cases could be explained by\
    \ \nthe more active involvement of the latter in running their system. Similarly,\
    \ while objective, \nindependent analysis of modernisation prospects for a system\
    \ could come up with a \ncomprehensive draft of a modernisation plan, it has to\
    \ harmonize such draft with the specific \nmodernisation features preferred by\
    \ the water users. Participatory approach to system \nmodernisation planning would\
    \ be more fruitful if water users are equipped to make informed \nchoices. \n\
    Options and vision for irrigation system modernisation plan \n265 \n \n \nThe\
    \ options to modernise the case study systems related to both management and \n\
    physical aspects. From financial point of view, modernisation solutions would\
    \ cost much less \nthan those concerning the physical improvements. However, they\
    \ might have to weather more \nresistance, especially from the upstream farmers\
    \ of Balanac RIS who would have to adjust \ntheir farming and irrigation practices.\
    \ Winning the upstream farmers' agreement to these \nstatus quo changing modernisation\
    \ options would need an extensive educational campaign \nthat presents the benefit\
    \ and overall gains and consultation to address the specific contentions \nand\
    \ reach a compromise. \nModernisation options for the physical structures would\
    \ not only cost more but would \nneed some time for deliberation and forging agreement\
    \ among engineering and operation \npersonnel and water users on the overall system\
    \ objective and operational objectives of \nBalanac RIS. Many of the options were\
    \ improvement works whose necessity is readily \nobservable by water users and\
    \ field personnel. Although changing the type of headwork and \nadditions of a\
    \ downstream dam are not common, their merits are readily conceivable in the \n\
    context of climate change. The high investment cost associated with this option\
    \ would be an \nissue. \nIt is important to note that modernisation could be carried\
    \ out in a progressive manner, \nstarting with the relatively simple or costly\
    \ improvements to the biggest ones. Some of the \noptions could be modified and\
    \ additions of new ones are possible. The most important is that \nthe collectively\
    \ shaped vision and general direction are translated into a modernisation master\
    \ \nplan that will serve as a guide for succeeding improvements and can be handed\
    \ down to the \nnext generation of system officials and water users. \n \n \n\
    \ \n11 EVALUATION \n \n11.1 Introduction \n \nThe main objective of the research\
    \ was to formulate a strategy for developing a modernisation \nstrategy for small\
    \ national irrigation systems in the Philippines. The research methodology \n\
    was framed with deliberately selected assessment and characterization procedures,\
    \ which \nwere adaptively modified and integrated to critically analyze the state\
    \ of coherence among the \nfundamentals of irrigation system water delivery: design,\
    \ operation, management and water \nsupply; and to identify solutions for any\
    \ inconsistency that hinders the achievement of the \ndesired irrigation service.\
    \ An analysis of the applicability of the integrated procedures and the \nrelevance\
    \ of the findings and insights obtained through them will pave the way for its\
    \ \nevaluation as a plan of actions for developing a NIS modernisation plan. This\
    \ chapter \nsummarizes the key findings and conclusions for the objectives of\
    \ the study. It discusses some \nrecommendations to address the key challenges\
    \ as well as directions for further development \nof the strategy. Finally it\
    \ provides the conclusions of the study. \n \n11.2 Key findings \n \n11.2.1 \n\
    Nature and impacts of rehabilitation in terms of closing the gap \nbetween the\
    \ actual area irrigated and irrigation service area \n \nWith respect to the nature\
    \ and impacts of rehbilitation on closing the gap between the actual \narea irrigated\
    \ and the irrigation service area the following key findings can be formulated:\
    \ \n• \ndespite considerable magnitude of rehabilitation of national irrigation\
    \ systems carried \nout nationwide (122,200 ha yr-1) and in the case study systems\
    \ (780 ha yr-1 in or about \n76% of FUSA of Balanac RIS and 330 ha yr-1 or 34%\
    \ of FUSA of Sta. Maria RIS) \nduring the 2000-2014 period, the gap between the\
    \ actual area irrigated and irrigation \nservice area remains. At the national\
    \ level, about 70% of the developed service areas \nand O&M service areas were\
    \ actually irrigated and the average irrigation intensities \n268 \nModernisation\
    \ strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nwere\
    \ 140%. In terms of the design service areas, about 60% were actually served and\
    \ \nthe annual irrigation intensity was 120%; \n• \nrehabilitation had at best\
    \ helped maintain an average actual irrigated area of around 870 \nha of Balanace\
    \ RIS and 840 ha of Sta. Maria RIS or 86% of their respective FUSA \nduring the\
    \ 2006–2015 period; \n• \ncanal lining was the most frequent and most invested\
    \ in the case study systems, \naccounting for about 44% (Balanac RIS) and 51%\
    \ (Sta. Maria RIS) of the total \nrehabilitation expenses. It was followed by\
    \ headwork (38%) and road (17%) for \nBalanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS, respectively.\
    \ Canal structures accounted for less than \n5% of the expenses for both systems;\
    \ \n• \nthe underperformance of rehabilitation projects in terms of irrigating\
    \ the whole service \narea is symptomatic of shortcomings of the rehabilitation\
    \ approach to effectively \naddress the root causes of mediocre irrigation service.\
    \ \n \n11.2.2 \nEfficacy of the physical structure and operations of irrigation\
    \ systems \nto deliver the design rate, duration and frequency of irrigation water\
    \ \n \nWith respect to the efficacy of the physical structure and operations of\
    \ irrigation systems to \ndeliver the design rate, duration and frequency of irrigation\
    \ water the following key findings \ncan be formulated: \n• \nthere was coherence\
    \ among the design philosophy, objectives and flow control method \nin the original\
    \ design of the case study systems. However, the shift to 'splitted' flow and\
    \ \n'proportional control' in Balanac RIS was inconsistent with the 'productive\
    \ irrigation' \nobjectives (that is, providing irrigation for optimum crop production).\
    \ Similarly, the \nadditions of open direct turnouts along Sta. Maria RIS main\
    \ canals were incoherent with \nthe 'adjustable flow' method of water allocation\
    \ to second level canals and main canal \nand Lateral A offtakes as well as with\
    \ the 'adjustable flow' method of water distribution \nthrough these main conveyance\
    \ canals; \n• \nthere was much to be desired for the water delivery service (in\
    \ terms of equity, \nreliability, flexibility and volume measurements), control\
    \ and operation of canal \nEvaluation \n269 \n \n \nstructures, social order,\
    \ strength of water users, budget and employees. These aspects \nhad generally\
    \ low performance ratings (0-2 in the scale of 0-4) in terms of the RAP \ninternal\
    \ indicators. The low values of the RAP internal indicators for water delivery\
    \ and \ncontrol and operation of flow structures for the two systems were mainly\
    \ due to the lack \nof functional flow control structures and presence of direct,\
    \ open turnouts along the \nmain canals and other major conveyance canals; \n\
    • \nthe capacity of the physical structures of the case study systems to perform\
    \ their \nfunctions of conveyance, diversion, division, water level regulation,\
    \ flow measurement, \nstorage and discharge transfer and to satisfy present demands\
    \ was either inherently \nlimited or had decreased due to damages, dysfunctions,\
    \ missing parts and deviations \nfrom preconditions for proper functioning through\
    \ time. The most telling capacity issues \nwere the reduced diversion capacity\
    \ due to siltation and inherently limited storage \ncapacities of the run-of-the\
    \ river dams of both systems and poor division capacity of \ncanal system of Balanac\
    \ RIS due to lack of operational flow control structures; \n• \nalthough originally\
    \ designed to proportionally distribute any changes in canal discharge \namong\
    \ the offtakes (hydraulic flexibility F = 1), most of the diversion points of\
    \ Balanac \nRIS and Sta. Maria RIS would have high sensitivity (F > 1) due to\
    \ the lack of functional \nflow control structures and highly variable incoming\
    \ water supply; \n• \nunrestrained direct offtakings and discharging into the\
    \ canals, illegal flow obstructions \nand water supply fluctuation would be the\
    \ main causes of perturbations; \n• \nthe present set and state of the dams and\
    \ canal flow control structures would not support \nwell the productive irrigation\
    \ objective and equitable and wieldy water distribution. \n \n11.2.3 \nTo assess\
    \ the validity of design values for dependable water supply, \ncrop water requirement\
    \ and percolation  \n \nWith respect to the assessessment of the validity of design\
    \ values for dependable water \nsupply, crop water requirement, seepage and percolation\
    \ the key findings are as follows: \n• \ndifferent parts of the service areas\
    \ of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS could have \ndifferent percolation rates.\
    \ Four of the experiment sites each in Balanac RIS and \n270 \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nSta. Maria RIS\
    \ had higher percolation rates than the design values for the systems. \nThose\
    \ in Balanac RIS were 5-14 times higher than the system design values of 2 mm\
    \ \nday-1 while those in Sta. Maria RIS were about 2-5 times higher than the design\
    \ rates of \n1.3-1.4 mm day-1. These higher percolation rates would result in\
    \ gross underestimation \nof crop water requirement and irrigation requirement.\
    \ There would be a need to \ndetermine the actual value in at least one representative\
    \ site per turnout service area so \nthat a more realistic estimate of irrigation\
    \ requirement can be made; \n• \nthe low probability of exceedance (about 33%\
    \ for SMMC and between 14-18% for \nMMC) of the assumed values for available water\
    \ supply and the very low flows (about \n200 l s-1 for SMMC and 60 l s-1 for MMC)\
    \ associated with the conventional design \nprobability of 80% when gleaned from\
    \ their discharge rating curves were inconsistent \nwith local knowledge on observed\
    \ \"usual flows\", sample flow measurements and from \nthe fact that the irrigation\
    \ system had consistently irrigated an area of around 850 ha. \nThe flumes would\
    \ need to be recalibrated to revalidate the discharge rating curves; \n• \nwhile\
    \ there was good agreement between the programmed area (service area that can\
    \ be \nirrigated based on an assumed flow situation for the season) and the actual\
    \ area served, \nquestions on trueness of the quesswork estimation of available\
    \ water arised from the \nrecognized fact that actual irrigated areas of Balanac\
    \ RIS and Sta. Maria RIS did not \ndiffer much even though their water supply\
    \ situations significantly differed; \n• \nin-depth technical assessments of discharges\
    \ of Balanac River and Sta. Maria River \nthrough flow gauging and flow modeling\
    \ need to be pursued to better quantify the \ndependable water. \n \n11.2.4 \n\
    Identification of modernisation options for existing NIS service area \n \nWith\
    \ respect to modernisation options he following key items can be formulated: \n\
    • \nthe high demand for canal operation supervision required to achieved equitable\
    \ and \norderly water distribution in both systems can be reduced by closing the\
    \ ungated direct \nofftakes along the main canals and providing operational, technically\
    \ coherent and \nsocially acceptable flow control structures; \n \nEvaluation\
    \ \n271 \n \n \n• \nthe different turnout service areas (TSA) were not consolidated\
    \ enough as management \nunits as most of them have several turnouts directly\
    \ diverting water from the main \nconveyance canals. Such loose canal hierarchy\
    \ impedes the formation of unified TSA \nfor a more manageneable system operation.\
    \ These turnouts would need to be \nconsolidated in optimal number of farmditches\
    \ based on hydraulic considerations; \n• \nthe downstream TSA of each system experienced\
    \ water scarcity and submergence, \nespecially during El Niño and La Niña years.\
    \ A climate-proactive cropping calendar \nwould need to be implemented to cope\
    \ with the adverse climatic conditions, especially \nin Balanac RIS. Some of the\
    \ strategy can be adopted and implemented included shifting \nof the cropping\
    \ calendar to earlier dates, either from upstream farms or downstream \nfarms,\
    \ irrigation rotation and planting of less water-loving crops;  \n• \ndrainage\
    \ water and groundwater in the case study systems have been tapped to \nsupplement\
    \ the water supply from the dam. Development efforts to optimize the gains \n\
    from such water would include the following: development of the drainage network\
    \ and \nconstruction of additional water reuse structures (check gates); spring\
    \ development in \nSta. Maria RIS; and formulation of pump irrigation development\
    \ guidelines (appropriate \nspacing, sustainable withdrawal rates); and a clear\
    \ conjunctive use strategy and \ncorresponding ISF adjustments; \n• \na storage-type\
    \ dam would be a more logical headwork modernisation option in the \ncontext of\
    \ climate change; \n• \nthe cost of frontline O&M activities in both systems were\
    \ below the PhP 2,000 - 3,000 \nha-1 standard planning budget and the PhP 1,900\
    \ ha-1 actual average expenses for O&M \nnationwide. Wages and salaries of field\
    \ personnel accounted for about 70% of their \nrespective WUA budgets. Only about\
    \ 12% and 6% were spent for canal repair and \nmaintenance in Sta. Maria RIS and\
    \ Balanac RIS, respectively; \n• \nmultiple uses of water within the service areas\
    \ such as those for aquaculture, livestock \nand vegetable farms and orchards\
    \ were slowly emerging. They would need to be \nintegrated in planning irrigation\
    \ system modernization. \n \n \n \n272 \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \n11.2.5 \nInvestigation of the\
    \ potentials of shallow tubewell irrigation in the \npart of NIS service areas\
    \ that cannot be fully irrigated with surface \nwater as designed \n \nWith respect\
    \ to the potentials for shallow tubewell irrigation, the key findings are as follows:\
    \ \n• \nthere is a good potential of groundwater for irrigation in downstream\
    \ farms of Balanac \nRIS as evidenced by the actual usage of shallow tubewells\
    \ by the farmers; \n• \ndifficult and deep well areas that were encountered during\
    \ the well drilling in Sta. Maria \nRIS present a considerable challenge to tubewell\
    \ irrigation development. A geo-\nresistivity survey would be useful for preliminary\
    \ drilling explorations; \n• \nthe individual free-flowing wells used by local\
    \ residents for domestic and aquaculture \npurposes indicate a good potential\
    \ of spring water for supplemental irrigation. \nDevelopment of the springs to\
    \ augment the canal water supply would also be a viable \nalternative. \n \n11.2.6\
    \ \nIdentification of possible options of integrating conjunctive use of \ngroundwater\
    \ and surface water in the formulation of modernisation \nplans for NIS \n \n\
    With respect to the possibility of integrating conjunctive use in the modernisation\
    \ plans, the \nkey findings are as follows: \n• \nthe use of STW was a downstream\
    \ farmers' initiative to supplement their water supply \nfrom the dam; \n• \n\
    STW units were operated as private irrigation scheme, independent of the canal\
    \ network \noperation and system management of Balanac RIS; \n• \nspring water\
    \ runoff, together with drainage water from upstream farms is captured for \n\
    irrigation by means of checkgates installed along natural drainage channels crisscrossing\
    \ \nthe service area of Sta. Maria RIS and are diverted to a TSA, which are either\
    \ solely \nserved by runoff water or served by both canal and runoff water; \n\
    Evaluation \n273 \n \n \n• \nit would be best to maintain the independent operation\
    \ of STW in Balanac RIS. The \naspect where the integration of conjunctive use\
    \ of surface water and groundwater would \nhave good prospects would be on identifying\
    \ the TSA that would need to use STW for \neach cropping season. Consequently,\
    \ this will delineate the areas where water and canal \noperation can focus on.\
    \ \n \n11.3 Strategy to formulate a NIS modernisation plan \n \nThe key features\
    \ of the proposed approach for developing NIS modernisation plans are the \ncritical\
    \ examination of the logical coherence among the design, operation and water supply\
    \ \nwith respect to the desired irrigation service and, consequently, the identification\
    \ of technical \nand managerial solutions to address any inconsistencies. The\
    \ proposed approach consisted of \nassessment and characterisation procedures\
    \ that were adaptively modified, devised and pieced \ntogether to form a more\
    \ comprehensive and relevant methodology for such analysis. The step-\nby-step\
    \ methodology is as follows: \n• \nAnalysis of the nature and impacts of previous\
    \ rehabilitation on the irrigation \nperformance targets would give valuable insights\
    \ on what intervention measures had \nbeen carried out, which did not worked and\
    \ which have the potentials for improving \nirrigation service and closing the\
    \ gap between the irrigation service area and actual \nirrigated areas. Categorization\
    \ of the nature or type of rehabilitation and/or improvement \nworks and system\
    \ walkthrough would be essential in the analysis.  \n• \nAssessment of the efficacy\
    \ of the physical structure and system operations to deliver the \ndesired irrigation\
    \ service. A combination of a logic design analysis and diagnostic tools \nof\
    \ the MASSCOTE such as the RAP and assessment of system capacity, system \nsensitivity\
    \ and perturbations, was formulated and used in the system diagnosis. The \ninherent\
    \ constraints in the design of the system were identified through the former by\
    \ \nexamining the logical coherence among the design philosophy, overall system\
    \ \nobjectives, operational objectives, design configuration of the physical structures\
    \ and \nflow control methods. The integrity and soundness of the existing canal\
    \ structures, canal \noperation and ensuing irrigation service were assessed through\
    \ the diagnostic tools of \nMASSCOTE. \n274 \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nThe pragmatic or adaptive modifications\
    \ done to address some pecularities in most \nNIS included (1) the use of the\
    \ general discharge-head relation ܳ = ܿܪ∝ and the \ndiversion sensitivity or hydraulic\
    \ flexibility values of commonly design configuration as \nconceptualized in Horst\
    \ (1998) and Ankum (2001) in cases of lack of flow data and \ninfeasibility of\
    \ flow measurements; (2) review of the general design guidelines and \nhistory\
    \ of the scheme development in cases of inavailability of original design \ndocuments;\
    \ (3) use of the results of system walkthrough and field interview on \nqualitative\
    \ ratings of the adequacy of irrigation water for each turnout service areas and\
    \ \noccurrence of any tailwater, springs, pumped irrigation and creeks water in\
    \ cases of lack \nof data on water balance parameters for the RAP external indicators;\
    \ (4) and inclusion of \nheadwork components in the combined diagnostic approach.\
    \  \n• \nRevalidation of design assumptions on percolation and water supply. The\
    \ consistent gap \nbetween the design irrigation service area and actual area\
    \ irrigated have been attributed \nto the broad application of standard design\
    \ values and optimistic assumptions on \npercolation rates and dependable water\
    \ supply. More reliable data must be used in the \nplanning and design of irrigation\
    \ modernisation projects. Field measurements of \npercolation rates in different\
    \ turnout service areas and measurement and monitoring of \nthe diverted water\
    \ and river flows feeding the NIS have to be started to establish these \ncrucial\
    \ data. Modern flow estimation and simulation techniques would be useful in the\
    \ \nassessment available water for a modernisation projects. \n• \nCharacterization\
    \ of the surface water flow paths, system operation, irrigation service, \nunit\
    \ service areas and demand for canal operations would facilitate a more holistic\
    \ \nexamination of the prevailing conditions of these components and, consequently,\
    \ \nidentification of options for improvements. In cases of lack of flow data,\
    \ a sense of a \nrealistic service area estimate for the prevailing water supply\
    \ would also be apparent. \nThe spatial analysis and analytical concepts and tools\
    \ of the MASSCOTE approach in \ncharacterizing such system information would be\
    \ useful. The pragmatic modifications \nthat was adopted include: (1) characterisation\
    \ of irrigation service for each turnout \nservice area based on the RAP parameters\
    \ for actual water delivery (volume \nmeasurement, flexibility, reliability and\
    \ equity); (2) qualifying demand for canal \noperation for each turnout service\
    \ area based on associated crop risk (occurence of water \nEvaluation \n275 \n\
    \ \n \nscarcity, flood and other water sources for supplemental irrigation), operational\
    \ \nrequirements (gated or ungated) and status (functional or dysfunctional) of\
    \ flow \ndiversion structures, and perturbations based on the total count of ungated\
    \ direct \nofftakes upstream; and (3) Cost estimation based on front line irrigation\
    \ services \n(operation, maintenance and management at the irrigation system level)\
    \  \n• \nConsolidation of options and visions for irrigation system modernisation.\
    \ While \ntechnical and managerial solutions to the root causes of poor irrigation\
    \ performance are \nidentified through an objective methodology for irrigation\
    \ modernisation study, it is \ncrucial that these solutions would be a shared\
    \ belief and easily relatable by system \nofficials and water users. A workshop-consultation\
    \ with system officials and turnout \nservice area representatives would have\
    \ to be carried out so proposed modernisation \noptions can be discussed and a\
    \ collective vision of the desired future scenarios of the \nirrigation system\
    \ can be drawn. Sufficient information about the different modernisation \noptions\
    \ and their relevant implications would need to be provided to system officials\
    \ \nand farmers so that they may be facilitated to make informed choices. Options\
    \ for \nmodernisation would need to be integrated and harmonized in a logical\
    \ manner with the \nenvisioned modernised irrigation system. The results of such\
    \ consultation would be \nuseful in fine-tuning and finalizing the draft of an\
    \ irrigation system modernisation plan. \n• \nThe utility of the proposed methodology\
    \ in the formulation of modernisation plan for \nNIS was demonstrated in the case\
    \ of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. The methodology \nwould be applicable in\
    \ other small- to medium-scale NIS and similar ungauged canal \nirrigation systems.\
    \ \n \n11.4 Challenges \n \nThis research has benefitted from and has successfully\
    \ used and/or adaptively modified a \nnumber of existing methodologies, analytical\
    \ tools, concepts and techniques to craft a \nmethodology that would be relevant\
    \ to the formulation of a modernisation plan in the case of \ngovernment funded\
    \ canal irrigation systems in the Philippines. However, some of the \nchallenges\
    \ remain, such as: \n \n276 \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \n• \nthe continued incommensurate actions\
    \ to scientific determination of water supply \navailability with the articulated\
    \ recognition of the paramount importance of water \navailability in prioritizing\
    \ irrigation development and improvement projects illustrated \nby many ungauged\
    \ NIS and water supply sources; \n• \nthe long-held view of irrigation as a social\
    \ benefit rather than as an economic service \ndoes not stimulate innovative thinking\
    \ or actions to modernise; \n• \nmanagement complacency, either a strongly held\
    \ belief that irrigation systems are \noperated and managed in the best possible\
    \ way or resigned acceptance to current \nsituation and unconcerned with changing\
    \ it;  \n• \nless critical use or adoption of generalized design values, assumptions\
    \ and long existing \ntechnology conventionally used for irrigation system design;\
    \ \n• \nscarcity of data and information for planning for modernisation. \n \n\
    11.5 Recomendations  \n \nTo further test the applicability of the identified\
    \ modernisation options for NIS, the following \nreccomendations based on the\
    \ findings of the research are forwarded: \n• \nupon completion of the critical\
    \ examination of the root causes for poor water delivery \nand identification\
    \ of solutions, crafting of the comprehensive plan to improve it, \nplanning for\
    \ irrigation system modernisation need the support of and agreement by both \n\
    irrigation agency officials and water users. Thus, it is important to have series\
    \ of \nextensive consultations regarding the proposed modernisation options and\
    \ general \ndirections; \n• \na coherent link among the physical structures, system\
    \ operation and water supply was \ncentral to the identified modernisation options\
    \ and framing of the modernisation \nstrategy for NIS. Nevertheless, economic\
    \ considerations, rational planning and \nuniqueness of each NIS compel testing\
    \ of feasibility and the actual functioning of the \ncanal system with the identified\
    \ or adjusted modernisation solutions through modelling \nor simulation of modernisation\
    \ scenarios; \n \n \nEvaluation \n277 \n \n \n• \nflow gauging activity, estimation\
    \ of water supply of ungauged rivers and determination \nof percolation rates\
    \ are major undertakings of thesis topics by themselves and are \ncrucial inputs\
    \ to irrigation modernisation planning. These undertakings could be \nseparately\
    \ initiated to support planning for modernisation; \n• \nwith more distinct dry\
    \ and wet seasons and high and low river flow regimes, storing \nwater during\
    \ times of plenty has increasingly become crucial to irrigated agriculture. \n\
    Construction of reservoir or storage-type dams, though requiring major investments,\
    \ \nwould be needed to modernise the case study systems. Dams would have to be\
    \ desilted \nand repaired in the short term modernisation plan. The technical\
    \ feasibility of a second \ndam at Lower Balanac River would need to be studied.\
    \ If found to be feasible, such a \ndam would imply cutting of canal dependence\
    \ or delinking of lower canal operations \nwith the upstream canals, hence operations\
    \ can be simplified and water delivery can be \nimproved; \n• \nthe cropping calendar\
    \ and irrigation practices would need to be adjusted with changes in \nhydrology\
    \ and climate. It would be necessary for Balanac RIS to adopt a coordinated, \n\
    system-wide cultivation and irrigation schedule; \n• \nwater distribution and\
    \ allocation in Balanace RIS would need to employ only one flow \ncontrol method\
    \ (proportional control or upstream control) and its corresponding flow \ncontrol\
    \ structures to avoid chaotic and unwieldy water distribution. The other structures\
    \ \nwould need to be removed or closed to avoid conflicting system management;\
    \ \n• \nthe following canal-related improvement options are recommended: replacement\
    \ of \ndysfunctional structures; repairs and desilting of canals; closing of ungated\
    \ direct \nofftakes along the main canals; consolidation of turnouts along the\
    \ main conveyance \ncanals to main farm ditches and provision of flow measurement\
    \ structures downstream \nof main intake structures and at distribution points;\
    \ \n• \nan official water distribution plan and canal operation instructions manual\
    \ would have \nto be written and accessible to water users to promote transparency\
    \ and accountability \nin system management. \n \n \n \n278 \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \n11.6 Future activities\
    \ \n \nSome future activities arising from this research are as follows: \n• \n\
    river flow monitoring would need to be resumed to provide the necessary flow data\
    \ \ninputs for programming areas to be irrigated and corresponding O&M plan, a\
    \ more \nreliable estimation of water availability for modernisation projects\
    \ and simulation of \ninstantenous river flows for reservoir design and operation\
    \ studies; \n• \nin view of difficulty or sometimes practical infeasibility field\
    \ measurement of \nsensitivity, simulation of the hydraulic behaviour of the canal\
    \ network would be useful; \n• \nan assessment of the sustainable yield of shallow\
    \ aquifers and artesian wells in Balanac \nRIS and Sta. Maria RIS would need to\
    \ be carried out to determine their potentials as \nsupplemental sources and for\
    \ conjunctive use; \n• \nthe strategy for planning for irrigation system modernisation\
    \ developed in this research \ncan be applied in some medium- to large-scale NIS\
    \ to determine its utility in such NIS. \n \n11.7 Conclusion \n \nAs demonstrated\
    \ in this study, it can be stated that the set of procedures used in examining\
    \ the \ndifferent aspects of planning and operations of NIS with an end view of\
    \ modernising the \nsystem provides a more comprehensive and applicable methodology\
    \ for drawing up of a more \nrelevant plan for NIS modernisation. The knowledge\
    \ gained on the case study systems \nthrough this endeavor provides a sound basis\
    \ for the design of appropriate modernisation \nsolutions for the systems and\
    \ other systems under similar conditions. The methodology \ndeveloped in this\
    \ study could serve as a blueprint for a modernisation program for NIS. It \n\
    would also lead to more concerted system improvement projects and programs towards\
    \ \nsystem modernisation. \nFundamental to the strenght of the modernization strategy\
    \ is the strong emphasis on the \ncoherent link among the system physical structure,\
    \ operation and water supply during the \nexamination of the state of irrigation\
    \ systems and during the formulation of modernisation \nsolutions. Nevertheless,\
    \ external factors such as emerging multiple water uses, cultural norms, \nEvaluation\
    \ \n279 \n \n \nnational laws, policy and development thrust of the government\
    \ and pertaining to irrigation \nand water use could greatly influence directions\
    \ and outcomes of modernisation programs. \nIndeed, irrigation system modernisation\
    \ is not a fixed blueprint of course of actions but a \nprocess of upgrading irrigation\
    \ system technology and management to provide better \nirrigation service. \n\

    \ relation\n \n \nAnnex O. Summary  \n \nThe actual areas irrigated by publicly\
    \ funded canal irrigation systems, commonly known as \nnational irrigation systems\
    \ (NIS) in the Philippines, are significantly lower than their design \nservice\
    \ areas. The associated cropping intensities and crop yields are below the projected\
    \ \nlevels during the design stage. Such mediocre performance has been attributed\
    \ to design \nshortcomings related to the use of too optimistic assumptions on\
    \ canal hydraulics, water \nsupply availability and water demand parameters such\
    \ as seepage, percolation and \nevapotranspiration. \nIn most cases, the current\
    \ design features of physical structures are not amenable to \nefficient and effective\
    \ management and distribution of irrigation water. These include lack of \nhead\
    \ control structures, hydraulically inconsistent combinations of flow control\
    \ structures, \ndirect offtakes along main canals, ungated offtake structures,\
    \ insufficient discharge capacity \nof canals and offtakes, and inadequate protection\
    \ of main intake structures from siltation. \nAlso, a number of studies pointed\
    \ to overestimation of surface water supply availability and \nunderestimation\
    \ of seepage and percolation as causes of a low ratio of irrigated area to \n\
    irrigation service area. \nThe government on its part has been implementing various\
    \ irrigation system \nrehabilitation and improvement projects. Despite considerable\
    \ rehabilitation and improvement \nefforts, about 30-40% of the irrigation service\
    \ areas of the country are not irrigated. The \nchanges in weather pattern, water\
    \ supply availability, crops, irrigation water and service \nrequirements and\
    \ physical structures of irrigation systems add some difficulty to irrigating\
    \ the \nwhole service areas. \nModernisation of irrigation systems is now viewed\
    \ as a process of technical and \nmanagerial upgrading to improve irrigation service\
    \ to farmers. This becoming widely \naccepted definition of modernisation distinguishes\
    \ it from rehabilitation, which simply \nrestores the physical design of the original\
    \ system. With an increasing competition for water \nand land and increasing cost\
    \ of developing new irrigation systems, experts say the \nperformance of existing\
    \ canal irrigation systems in terms of water use and crop production \nhas to\
    \ improve in order to increase the chance of meeting the global food requirement\
    \ in the \nnear future. They hold the opinion that irrigation system modernisation\
    \ is a strategic option to \nimprove the performance of canal irrigation systems.\
    \ As many of the irrigation systems have \n398  \nModernisation strategy for the\
    \ national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \naged, weather patterns\
    \ and hydrographs of water sources have changed and farmers' desire to \nintensify\
    \ cropping has increased, the physical structure of existing irrigation systems\
    \ and the \nassociated canal operation requirements have become less responsive\
    \ to the present irrigation \nservice demands. Thus, upgrading of irrigation structures\
    \ and system operations has become a \nnecessary undertaking. \nThe general objective\
    \ of this research was to identify technically feasible and \nhydrologically sound\
    \ modernisation plans for national irrigation systems in the Philippines. \nTo\
    \ achieve this objective, the following studies have been carried out and the\
    \ findings \nsynthesized: (1) analysis of the nature of previous rehabilitation\
    \ or modernisation efforts and \ntheir impacts in terms of closing the gap between\
    \ the actual area irrigated and the design and \nfirmed-up service areas; (2)\
    \ assessment of the efficacy of the physical structure and operation \nof irrigation\
    \ systems to deliver the design rate, duration and frequency of irrigation water\
    \ or a \nmodified irrigation water demand at the offtakes of secondary canals;\
    \ (3) assessment of the \nvalidity of design values for dependable water supply,\
    \ crop water requirement, seepage and \npercolation; (4) identification of modernisation\
    \ options for the realistic NIS service areas; (5) \ninvestigation of the potentials\
    \ of shallow tubewell irrigation in the part of NIS service areas \nthat cannot\
    \ be fully irrigated with surface water as designed; (6) identification of possible\
    \ \noptions of integrating conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water in\
    \ the formulation of \na modernisation plan for NIS. \nThree NIS located in Region\
    \ IV-A of the country were selected for the case study, \nnamely: the Agos River\
    \ Irrigation System (RIS), Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. The \nselection was\
    \ based on a classification of the condition of the physical facilities as a result\
    \ of \nprevious rehabilitation works, hence, readiness for irrigation management\
    \ transfer (IMT). \nUnder such classification, Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS\
    \ are considered ready for IMT after \nminor repairs of some of their physical\
    \ components. Meanwhile, Agos RIS is deemed in need \nof major rehabilitation\
    \ works before it becomes amenable for operation, maintenance and \nmanagement\
    \ by farmers. \nThe 1980-2012 data on rehabilitated, restored and newly generated\
    \ service areas vis-a-\nvis the cumulative service areas and actual irrigated\
    \ areas nationwide were analyzed to assess \nthe impacts of rehabilitation in\
    \ terms of maintaining developed irrigation service areas and \nclosing the gap\
    \ between service areas and actual areas irrigated. Similar trend analysis was\
    \ \nSummary \n399 \n \n \ncarried out for the 1990-2012 data for each of the three\
    \ systems. The nature of rehabilitation \nworks or the physical components involved\
    \ in the rehabilitation projects implemented for \neach of the systems since mid-1990s\
    \ were examined. Key persons at different levels of NIA \noffices and concerned\
    \ water users associations (WUA) were interviewed to solicit information \nand\
    \ insights on the planning and implementation process of rehabilitation projects.\
    \ \nFrom 1980 to 2012, the total service area of NIS in the country increased\
    \ by almost \n319,000 ha. During the same period, the new service area generated\
    \ by constructing new NIS \nand expanding the service areas of the existing systems\
    \ beyond the original size was about \n415,000 ha. A total of about 3.5 million\
    \ ha NIS service areas were rehabilitated during this \nperiod. This implies that\
    \ the country's NIS service area was rehabilitated once every 6-7 years \nsince\
    \ 1980. On the average, the rehabilitated NIS area was about 1.6 times its service\
    \ area for \neach decade. Meanwhile, the average annual rates of rehabilitation\
    \ for the systems under \nstudy were about 75% of the firmed-up service area (FUSA)\
    \ of Balanac RIS and 40% of \nFUSA of Agos RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. The three systems\
    \ have undergone more frequent \nrehabilitation than that of the national level.\
    \ \nAt the country level, rehabilitation projects were neither able to maintain\
    \ the irrigation \nservice area nor to close the gap between the irrigation service\
    \ area and actual irrigated area. \nIn the case of the three systems, rehabilitation\
    \ had, at best, maintained the percentages of the \nFUSA actually irrigated since\
    \ 2000. The magnitude of rehabilitation reflected a fast rate of \ndeterioration\
    \ of the irrigation systems in the country. These findings point some questions\
    \ \nwith respect to the efficiency of planning and implementation of canal irrigation\
    \ projects. It \ncasts doubt on the effectiveness of the rehabilitation efforts.\
    \  \nThe findings of the analysis of underlying details of rehabilitation projects\
    \ show that the \nrehabilitation works generally focused on restoring the original\
    \ physical structure. Concrete \ncanal lining was the most frequent and most invested\
    \ activity, accounting for about 50-60% of \nthe total rehabilitation expenses\
    \ for each NIS. Headworks, roads and canal structures were \namong the next two\
    \ most invested projects in the three NIS. They each comprised less than \n10%\
    \ of the total investment for the respective systems with the exception of the\
    \ dam of \nBalanac RIS and road in Sta. Maria RIS, which accounted for 22 and\
    \ 15%, respectively. \nThe adopted planning and design process lacked revalidation\
    \ of design criteria and \nassumptions used in the original system design. It\
    \ did not have the benefit of diagnostic \n400  \nModernisation strategy for the\
    \ national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nassessment studies. No\
    \ technical assessments of water supply adequacy for proposed projects \nwere\
    \ carried out. The rehabilitation process lacked an impact evaluation component.\
    \ \nA combination of a logic design framework by Ankum, diagnostic tools of the\
    \ mapping \nsystem and services for canal operation techniques (MASSCOTE), discharge-head\
    \ relations \nand hydraulic flexibility were applied to diagnose the performance\
    \ of Balanac RIS and Sta. \nMaria RIS and identify options for system improvements.\
    \ The logic design framework \nexamines the coherence of the design philosophy,\
    \ overall system objectives, objectives of \nsystem operation, design configuration\
    \ of physical structures and flow control methods. For a \nset of stated design\
    \ philosophy and system objectives, certain design parameters, system \nconfiguration\
    \ and combinations of flow control structures fit well or maybe the only logical\
    \ \nmatch. Meanwhile, the diagnostic tools of MASSCOTE, which include the rapid\
    \ appraisal \nprocedure (RAP) and assessments of physical capacity and hydraulic\
    \ behaviour (sensitivity \nand perturbations) of irrigation systems, are aimed\
    \ at systematic and comprehensive \nevaluation of the performance of large-scale\
    \ canal irrigation systems to modernize canal \noperation. They consider the water\
    \ balance, internal processes and mechanisms (hardware, \noperational procedures,\
    \ management and institutions) of water delivery at different canal \nlevels,\
    \ irrigated area and crop production in diagnosing system performance. \nA review\
    \ of the general design considerations and guidelines for canal irrigation of\
    \ the \nNIA and interviews with system officials on history of system development\
    \ including \nprevious rehabilitations, changes in system design and management\
    \ were carried out. The \ndesign philosophies, system objectives, design configurations\
    \ of physical structures and flow \ncontrol methods were derived from this collected\
    \ information and were classified according to \nthe parameters of the logic design\
    \ framework. \nThe RAP worksheets were used as a set of questionnaires for collecting\
    \ the information \nrequired for system diagnosis. The information was obtained\
    \ from system documents, the \nweather agency as well as through system walkthroughs\
    \ and interviews of irrigation \nsuperintendents, operation staff and water users\
    \ associations. The walkthroughs from the dam \nto the end checks of main canals\
    \ and major distribution canals of each NIS were carried out as \npart of the\
    \ RAP in getting an impression on the current state of physical structures and\
    \ system \noperations. The values of RAP indicators of system performance were\
    \ calculated from the \nRAP computer spreadsheet data. \nSummary \n401 \n \n \n\
    The applicability of the water-related RAP external indicators and structures\
    \ sensitivity \nassessment as diagnostic tools was limited by the lack of flow\
    \ data and the infeasibility of \nfield experiments due to tight rotational irrigation\
    \ schedules and laissez-faire direct offtakes. \nHence, a pragmatic approach of\
    \ using discharge-head relations, hydraulic flexibility concept, \nand the findings\
    \ from walkthroughs and interviews was adopted for the analyses. \nThe result\
    \ of categorization of the system profile data based on the logic design \nframework\
    \ showed that the original Balanac RIS was designed for 'productive irrigation'\
    \ \nduring the dry season based on 'equitable supply per hectare'. The operational\
    \ objective was \n'imposed allocation' to tertiary units or irrigation service\
    \ delivery points by 'adjustable flow' \nand with 'adjustable flow' through the\
    \ main system or major conveyance canals and \nemploying upstream control. It\
    \ was equipped with adjustable vertical gates for controlling \nofftake discharges\
    \ and water levels upstream. The original design of Sta. Maria RIS had these \n\
    same philosophies, overall system objectives and operational objectives, except\
    \ in the case of \nthe design irrigation season. Its design water duty of 0.8\
    \ l s-1ha-1 is very low and logically \nsuggests that the design 'irrigation season'\
    \ was the wet season. In other words, the system was \ndesigned to supplement\
    \ rainfall and could not irrigate the whole service area during the dry \nseason.\
    \ \nThere existed a logical coherence among the design philosophy or overall system\
    \ \nobjectives, operational objectives and on-canal flow structures of the original\
    \ design of \nBalanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. However, the shift to 'splitted'\
    \ flow and 'proportional \ncontrol' manifested by duckbill weirs at major bifurcation\
    \ points of Balanac RIS was not \nconsistent with its unchanged overall system\
    \ objectives. In contrast, the reduction in service \narea of Sta. Maria RIS and\
    \ the shift to the dry season as the main irrigation season had \nmaintained the\
    \ coherence among its objectives. Further, the addition of open direct turnouts\
    \ \nalong the main canals of both systems is inconsistent with the systems' operational\
    \ objectives. \nIn general, the values of the primary internal indicators of RAP\
    \ calculated for the two \nsystems were low, ranging from 0 - 2 (0 and 4 indicating\
    \ least and most desirable, \nrespectively). The only exceptions were in the case\
    \ of 'travel time of a flow rate change \nthrough the main canals' in both systems\
    \ and in the case of control of the 'cross-regulators \nalong the main canals'\
    \ of Sta. Maria RIS. The results of RAP carried out in Balanac RIS \nsupport the\
    \ hypothesis of unwieldy water distribution deduced from the logic design \n402\
    \  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines\
    \ \n \n \nframework analysis. The values of RAP internal indicators for water\
    \ delivery and control and \noperation of flow structures for the two systems\
    \ were low mainly due to the lack of functional \nflow control structures and\
    \ presence of direct, open turnouts along the main canals and other \nmajor conveyance\
    \ canals. \nThe capacity of physical structures of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria\
    \ RIS to perform their \nintended functions had decreased due to damage, defects,\
    \ dysfunctions, missing parts and \ndeviations from preconditions for proper functioning\
    \ through time. Repairs or replacements \nare needed for non-functional structures\
    \ and maintenance works to restore head differentials \nat the dam and approach\
    \ conditions for the flumes. In Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS, the \nmost telling\
    \ capacity issues were the division capacity and the limited water supply from\
    \ the \nrivers, respectively. Options to increase the storage capacity of Sta.\
    \ Maria dams or \naugmenting the water supply from other sources need to be investigated.\
    \ \nThe original diversion structures at major distribution points of Balanac\
    \ RIS and Sta. \nMaria RIS consisted of adjustable underflow discharge and water\
    \ level controls, which are \namenable for gate proportional diversion or attaining\
    \ same discharge variations at major head-\nend and tail-end offtakes of the systems.\
    \ However, the required frequent gate adjustments to \nmaintain proportional diversion\
    \ makes adjustable underflow structures a less practical match \nfor the runoff-off-the-river\
    \ dams and variable water supply from the rivers. The present lack \nof functional\
    \ flow control structures and combinations of overflow and underflow at major\
    \ \ndistribution points result in unproportional discharge variations at the offtaking\
    \ canals, \ncontinuing canals and other downstream offtakes. The many ungated\
    \ direct offtakes further \ncontribute to inherent flow variations and perturbations\
    \ along the major canals.  \nField experiments and in-depth review of design values\
    \ and assumptions on percolation \nand water supply were carried out to gauge\
    \ their validity and the accuracy of the projected \nirrigation service areas.\
    \ Also, the validity of the estimates was assessed in terms of the \npercentage\
    \ of programmed irrigation area actually served. As copies of original feasibility\
    \ \nstudy and design documents no longer existed at NIA offices, design engineers,\
    \ hydrologists \nand operation engineers of the NIA were interviewed on the procedures\
    \ and methods used by \nthe agency in estimating available streamflow for irrigation\
    \ systems. Further, the procedures \nand methods adopted in estimating the service\
    \ areas in feasibility studies for 20 sample \nirrigation projects implemented\
    \ during 2010-2014 were reviewed. \nSummary \n403 \n \n \nThe percolation tests\
    \ using the 3-cylinder method and ponding tests were conducted in \n19 sites within\
    \ the service areas of Balanac RIS and Sta. Maria RIS. A collaborative study to\
    \ \ndetermine the physical and hydraulic characteristics of the soil of the experiment\
    \ sites was \ncarried out with students. The parameters that were identified included\
    \ the soil texture, bulk \ndensity, particle density, porosity and hydraulic conductivity.\
    \ They were determined through \nhydrometer, oven dry, volume displacement and\
    \ falling-head permeater methods, \nrespectively. The results of soil texture\
    \ analyses were used to identify the percolation values \nfor each soil type as\
    \ cited in literature and, eventually, to countercheck the measured \npercolation\
    \ values. \nThe measured percolation rates in Balanac RIS have a wide range of\
    \ values, averaging \nfrom 1-30 mm day-1. The design value of 2 mm day-1 for the\
    \ system was valid in only 3 of the \n9 experiment sites. The average percolation\
    \ rates were greater than 28 mm day-1 in two of the \nnine sites. The respective\
    \ average percolation in another two sites differed significantly when \nthe conditions\
    \ of the surrounding soils of the experiment fields changed - from 5 mm day-1\
    \ \nwith settled soil to 22 mm day-1 during newly ploughed and from 12 mm day-1\
    \ in saturated to \nless than 1 mm day-1 when unsaturated. In Sta. Maria RIS,\
    \ the measured average percolation \nrates in the 10 sites ranged from 1-6 mm\
    \ day-1. The design value of 1.4 mm day-1 for the \nsystem was observed in five\
    \ of the 10 experiment sites. The average percolation values of \nabout 6 mm/day\
    \ and 3-4 mm day-1 were obtained in one site and four experiment sites, \nrespectively.\
    \ \nThe results of soil texture analyses showed some differences between the soil\
    \ type in the \nexperiment sites and those indicated in the official soil classification\
    \ maps, which range from \nclay to clay loam in Balanac RIS and clay in Sta. Maria\
    \ RIS. The most notable difference in \nBalanac RIS was the occurrence of sandy\
    \ soils in three experiment sites. The percolation rates \nobtained in sites with\
    \ sandy soils had 25-30 mm day-1, which are much higher than the 2 mm \nday-1\
    \ conventionally used in the design for sandy clay loam soils and 4 mm day-1 for\
    \ sandy \nloam soils. Clay loam and loam soils were also found in six of the 10\
    \ experiment sites in Sta. \nMaria RIS. For the four sites with predominantly\
    \ clayey soils, two had measured percolation \nrates within the general design\
    \ value of 1.25 mm day-1 for clay soils. Meanwhile, majority of \nthe sites with\
    \ clay loam soils had percolation rates almost twice as much as the conventional\
    \ \n1.75 mm day-1 design values for percolation. \n404  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nAlthough the\
    \ relative rates of percolation based on soil texture classification were \nobserved,\
    \ the actual values of percolation significantly differed from their associated\
    \ values \ngiven in the literature and design guidelines. Other factors that could\
    \ have influenced the \npercolation rates were the relative elevation of the experiment\
    \ site to the adjacent fields, \nwelling up of shallow groundwater and ploughing\
    \ that loosens or breaks the hard pan. Thus, \nsample in-situ measurements should\
    \ be done at least per tertiary service area. \nThe results of the study suggest\
    \ that the potentials for increasing the actual area irrigated \nlie in augmentation\
    \ of water supply or increasing the system storage capacity, use of flow \ncontrol\
    \ structures that are amenable to flexible water distribution schemes and strategic\
    \ timing \nof irrigation schedules among tertiary areas to adapt to prevailing\
    \ hydrological regimes. \nThe experiences in the three sample NIS showed that\
    \ a more systematic approach to \nirrigation system improvements would need to\
    \ be pursued. This approach would include \ndiagnostic assessment of the physical\
    \ structure, operation, maintenance and water delivery of \nirrigation systems;\
    \ identifying constraints, potentials and options for improvements; \nascertaining\
    \ water adequacy for improvement projects; due consideration to the acceptability\
    \ \nof improvement options to farmers; development of a blueprint for modernisation\
    \ plans for \nindividual systems, and establishing a strategic monitoring and\
    \ evaluation (M&E) system. \nThe observations, analyses, findings and recommendations\
    \ as presented in this thesis are \nexpected to create a solid basis for such\
    \ activities. \n \n \nAnnex P. Samenvatting \n \nDe werkelijk geïrrigeerde gebieden\
    \ met door de overheid gefinancierde kanaal \nirrigatiesystemen, in de Filippijnen\
    \ beter bekend als de nationale irrigatiesystemen (NIS), zijn \naanzienlijk geringer\
    \ dan de ontworpen gebieden. De bijbehorende gewas intensiteiten en \ngewasopbrengsten\
    \ zijn minder dan de tijdens de ontwerpfase geraamde niveaus. Een dergelijk \n\
    middelmatig functioneren wordt toegeschreven aan tekortkomingen in het ontwerp\
    \ met \nbetrekking tot het hanteren van te optimistische veronderstellingen betreffende\
    \ kanaal \nhydraulica, de beschikbaarheid van water en parameters betreffende\
    \ de waterbehoefte zoals \nkwel, percolatie en gewasverdamping. \nIn de meeste\
    \ gevallen zijn de huidige ontwerpkenmerken van de kunstwerken niet \ngeschikt\
    \ voor een efficiënt en effectief beheer en verdeling van irrigatiewater. Dit\
    \ betekent \neen gebrek aan controle over het hoofd inlaatwerk, hydraulisch inconsistente\
    \ combinaties van \nkunstwerken voor controle van de stroming, directe wateronttrekking\
    \ langs de hoofd kanalen, \nopen kunstwerken voor de wateruitlaat, onvoldoende\
    \ afvoercapaciteit van kanalen en uitlaten \nen onvoldoende bescherming van de\
    \ hoofd inlaatwerken tegen aanslibbing. Ook wezen een \naantal studies op overschatting\
    \ van de beschikbaarheid van oppervlaktewater en \nonderschatting van kwel en\
    \ percolatie als oorzaken van de lage verhouding tussen geïrrigeerd \ngebied en\
    \ irrigatie verzorgingsgebied.  \nDe overheid van haar kant heeft in verschillende\
    \ irrigatiesystemen renovatie en \nverbeteringsprojecten uitgevoerd. Ondanks aanzienlijke\
    \ herstel en verbetering inspanningen, \nwordt ongeveer 30-40% van de irrigatie\
    \ verzorgingsgebieden van het land niet geïrrigeerd. De \nveranderingen in het\
    \ weerpatroon, de beschikbaarheid van water, gewassen, irrigatiewater en \nvoorwaarden\
    \ aan de dienstverlening, alsmede kunstwerken in irrigatiesystemen resulteren\
    \ in \nde nodige problemen om de totale verzorgingsgebieden te irrigeren. \nModernisering\
    \ van irrigatiesystemen wordt nu gezien als een proces van technische en \nbestuurlijke\
    \ verbetering om de irrigatie dienstverlening aan de boeren op een hoger niveau\
    \ te \nbrengen. Deze inmiddels op grote schaal aanvaarde definitie van modernisering\
    \ onderscheidt \nhet van renovatie, waarbij gewoon het fysieke ontwerp van het\
    \ originele systeem wordt \nhersteld. In het licht van de toenemende competitie\
    \ om water en land en de toenemende \nkosten voor de ontwikkeling van nieuwe irrigatiesystemen,\
    \ stellen experts dat het \nfunctioneren van bestaande kanaal irrigatiesystemen\
    \ op het gebied van water en \n406  \nModernisation strategy for the national\
    \ irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \ngewasproductie moeten verbeteren\
    \ om de kans op het voldoen aan de wereldwijde behoefte \naan voedsel in de nabije\
    \ toekomst te verhogen. Zij zijn van mening dat modernisering van \nirrigatiesystemen\
    \ een strategische optie is om het functioneren van kanaal irrigatiesystemen te\
    \ \nverbeteren. Omdat veel irrigatiesystemen verouderd zijn, weerpatronen en hydraulische\
    \ \neigenschappen van waterbronnen veranderd en de wens van boeren om gewassen\
    \ te \nintensiveren is toegenomen, zijn de fysieke structuur van bestaande irrigatiesystemen\
    \ en de \nbijbehorende eisen aan het beheer van de kanalen minder geschikt om\
    \ aan de huidige eisen \nvoor irrigatie dienstverlening te voldoen. Zo zijn opwaardering\
    \ van kunstwerken en het \nbeheer van systemen noodzakelijke activiteiten geworden.\
    \ \nDe algemene doelstelling van dit onderzoek was om technisch haalbare en hydrologisch\
    \ \nsolide moderniseringsplannen voor de nationale irrigatiesystemen in de Filippijnen\
    \ te \nidentificeren. Om deze doelstelling te bereiken, zijn de volgende studies\
    \ uitgevoerd en de \nbevindingen geanalyseerd: (1) analyse van de aard van de\
    \ vorige renovatie of modernisering \ninspanningen en de gevolgen daarvan in termen\
    \ van het verschil tussen de werkelijk \ngeïrrigeerde oppervlakte en de ontworpen\
    \ gebieden; (2) de beoordeling van de effectiviteit \nvan de kunstwerken en het\
    \ beheer van irrigatiesystemen om de water hoeveelheden op basis \nvan het ontwerp,\
    \ de duur en de frequentie van irrigatiewater te leveren of een gewijzigde \n\
    vraag naar irrigatiewater aan de uitlaten naar de secundaire kanalen te leveren;\
    \ (3) \nbeoordeling van de geldigheid van de ontwerp waarden voor betrouwbare\
    \ watervoorziening, \nde waterbehoefte van de gewassen, kwel en percolatie; (4)\
    \ identificeren van opties voor \nmodernisering van realistische NIS verzorgingsgebieden;\
    \ (5) onderzoek naar de \nmogelijkheden van ondiepe grondwater irrigatie met putten\
    \ in het deel van de NIS \nverzorgingsgebieden die niet volledig kunnen worden\
    \ geïrrigeerd met oppervlaktewater zoals \nontworpen; (6) de identificatie van\
    \ mogelijkheden voor het integreren van samengesteld \ngebruik van grondwater\
    \ en oppervlaktewater bij het formuleren van een moderniseringsplan \nvoor NIS.\
    \  \nDrie NIS die liggen in de regio IV-A van het land zijn geselecteerd voor\
    \ de voorbeeld \nstudie, te weten: het Agos Rivier Irrigatie Systeem (RIS), Balanac\
    \ RIS en Sta. Maria RIS. De \nselectie was gebaseerd op een classificatie van\
    \ de toestand van de fysieke voorzieningen als \ngevolg van eerdere renovatie\
    \ werkzaamheden, derhalve, gereedheid voor overdracht van het \nirrigatiewater\
    \ beheer (IMT). Bij een dergelijke indeling worden Balanac RIS en \nSamenvatting\
    \ \n407 \n \n \nSta. Maria RIS geacht na kleine reparaties van een aantal van\
    \ hun fysieke componenten klaar \nte zijn voor IMT. Terwijl voor Agos RIS grote\
    \ herstelwerkzaamheden noodzakelijk worden \ngeacht voordat het geschikt kan zijn\
    \ voor exploitatie, onderhoud en beheer door boeren. \nDe gegevens van gedurende\
    \ 1980-2012 gerenoveerde, gerestaureerde en nieuw \naangelegde verzorgingsgebieden\
    \ ten opzichte van de cumulatieve verzorgingsgebieden en \nwerkelijk geïrrigeerde\
    \ gebieden in het hele land zijn geanalyseerd om de effecten van de \nrenovatie\
    \ met betrekking tot het handhaven van ontwikkelde irrigatie verzorgingsgebieden\
    \ en \nhet verkleinen van het verschil tussen de verzorgingsgebieden en de werkelijk\
    \ geïrrigeerde \ngebieden te bepalen. Een overeenkomstige trendanalyse is voor\
    \ elk van de drie systemen \nuitgevoerd op basis van de gegevens over 1990-2012.\
    \ De aard van de renovatie \nwerkzaamheden aan de fysieke componenten die onderdeel\
    \ waren van de renovatie projecten \ndie sinds halverwege de jaren 1990 voor elk\
    \ van de systemen zijn uitgevoerd zijn onderzocht. \nDe belangrijkste personen\
    \ op verschillende niveaus in de NIA kantoren en betrokken \nverenigingen van\
    \ watergebruikers (WUA) zijn geïnterviewd om informatie en inzichten te \nverzamelen\
    \ over het planning en realisatie proces van de renovatie projecten. \nVan 1980\
    \ tot 2012 is het totale verzorgingsgebied van de NIS in het land met bijna \n\
    319.000 ha toegenomen. In dezelfde periode, bedroegen de nieuwe verzorgingsgebieden\
    \ door \nde aanleg van nieuwe NIS en het uitbreiden van de verzorgingsgebieden\
    \ van bestaande \nsystemen ongeveer 415.000 ha. Een totale oppervlakte van ongeveer\
    \ 3,5 miljoen ha NIS \nverzorgingsgebieden zijn tijdens deze periode gerenoveerd.\
    \ Dit houdt in dat de NIS-\nverzorgingsgebieden in het land sinds 1980 eens in\
    \ de 6-7 jaar zijn gerenoveerd. Gemiddeld, \nwas voor elk decennium het gerenoveerde\
    \ NIS gebied ongeveer 1,6 maal het \nverzorgingsgebied. Intussen was het gemiddelde\
    \ jaarlijkse tempo van de renovatie voor de \nsystemen in het kader van dit onderzoek\
    \ ongeveer 75% van het verbeterde verzorgingsgebied \n(FUSA) van Balanac RIS en\
    \ 40% van FUSA van Agos RIS en Sta. Maria RIS. De drie \nsystemen zijn vaker gerenoveerd\
    \ dan de andere systemen op nationaal niveau. \nOp nationaal niveau, waren de\
    \ renovatie projecten niet in staat om het irrigatie \nverzorgingsgebied te handhaven,\
    \ noch om het verschil tussen het irrigatie verzorgingsgebied \nen het daadwerkelijk\
    \ geïrrigeerde areaal weg te werken. In het geval van de drie systemen, \nkonden\
    \ door de renovatie, op zijn best, de percentages van de FUSA daadwerkelijk \n\
    geïrrigeerd gebied sinds 2000 worden gehandhaafd. De omvang van de renovatie gaf\
    \ het \n408  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation systems in the\
    \ Philippines \n \n \ntempo van de verslechtering van de irrigatiesystemen in\
    \ het land weer. Deze bevindingen \nwijzen op een aantal vragen met betrekking\
    \ tot de efficiëntie van de planning en uitvoering \nvan de kanaal irrigatieprojecten.\
    \ Het doet twijfels rijzen over de effectiviteit van de renovatie.  \nDe resultaten\
    \ van de analyse van de onderliggende gegevens van de renovatie projecten \nlaten\
    \ zien dat de renovatie in het algemeen was gericht op het herstellen van de \n\
    oorspronkelijke fysieke structuur. Bekleding van kanaal oevers met beton was de\
    \ meest \nvoorkomende activiteit en waarin ook het meest geïnvesteerd is, goed\
    \ voor ongeveer 50-60% \nvan de totale kosten van renovatie voor elke NIS. Hoofd\
    \ inlaatwerken, wegen en kunstwerken \nbehoorden in de drie NIS tot de volgende\
    \ twee soorten projecten waarin het meest \ngeïnvesteerd is. Ze betroffen elk\
    \ minder dan 10% van de totale investering voor de \nrespectievelijke systemen,\
    \ met uitzondering van de dam van Balanac RIS en de weg in Sta. \nMaria RIS, die\
    \ respectievelijk goed waren voor 22 en 15%. \nBij het toegepaste planning en\
    \ het ontwerp proces ontbrak het opnieuw valideren van \nontwerpcriteria en de\
    \ veronderstellingen die waren gebruikt bij de oorspronkelijke ontwerpen \nvan\
    \ de systemen. Ook is er geen profijt geweest van diagnostische onderzoek studies.\
    \ Er zijn \ngeen technische evaluaties van de effectiviteit van de watervoorziening\
    \ bij de voorgestelde \nprojecten uitgevoerd. Bij het renovatie proces ontbrak\
    \ een component om het effect ervan te \nevalueren.  \nEen combinatie van een\
    \ logisch ontwerp kader door Ankum (2001), diagnose-\ninstrumenten van het kartering\
    \ systeem en methoden voor het beheer van kanalen \n(MASSCOTE), afvoer waterhoogte\
    \ relaties en het hydraulische flexibiliteit concept zijn \ntoegepast om het functioneren\
    \ van Balanac RIS en Sta. Maria RIS te analyseren en \nmogelijkheden voor verbetering\
    \ van de systemen the identificeren. Het logisch ontwerp kader \nonderzoekt de\
    \ samenhang van de ontwerp filosofie, de algemene doelstellingen van een \nsysteem,\
    \ de doelstellingen van het beheer van het systeem, ontwerp configuratie van de\
    \ \nkunstwerken en methoden voor het controleren van de stroming. Voor een set\
    \ van de \nvoorgestane ontwerpfilosofie en doelstellingen voor het systeem, bepaalde\
    \ ontwerp \nparameters, systeemconfiguratie en combinaties van kunstwerken voor\
    \ controle van de \nstroming passen goed bij elkaar of zijn misschien de enige\
    \ logische mogelijkheid. Intussen \nzijn \nde \ndiagnose-instrumenten \nvan \n\
    MASSCOTE, \ndie \nbestaan \nuit \neen \nsnelle \nbeoordelingsprocedure (RAP) en\
    \ de beoordeling van de fysieke capaciteit en het hydraulische \nSamenvatting\
    \ \n409 \n \n \ngedrag (gevoeligheid en verstoringen) van irrigatiesystemen, gericht\
    \ op systematische en \nuitgebreide evaluatie van het functioneren van grootschalige\
    \ kanaal irrigatie systemen om het \nbeheer van kanalen te moderniseren. Zij beschouwen\
    \ de waterbalans, interne processen en \nmechanismen (hardware, operationele procedures,\
    \ het beheer en de instellingen) van water \nvoorziening op verschillende kanaal\
    \ niveaus, geïrrigeerd areaal en de productie van gewassen \nin het diagnosticeren\
    \ van het functioneren van het systeem. \nEen overzicht van de algemene ontwerp\
    \ overwegingen en richtlijnen voor kanaal \nirrigatie van de NIA en interviews\
    \ met de staf van de irrigatie dienst betreffende de \ngeschiedenis van de ontwikkeling\
    \ van de systemen met inbegrip van vorige renovaties, \nveranderingen in het ontwerp\
    \ van de systemen en het beheer zijn uitgevoerd. De \nontwerpfilosofieën, systeemdoelstellingen,\
    \ ontwerpconfiguraties van de kunstwerken en \nmethoden voor controle van de stroming\
    \ zijn ontleend aan deze verzamelde informatie en zijn \ngeclassificeerd volgens\
    \ de parameters van het logisch ontwerp kader.  \nDe RAP werkbladen zijn gebruikt\
    \ als een set van vragenlijsten voor het verzamelen van \nde informatie voor diagnose\
    \ van de systemen. De informatie is verkregen uit documenten \nbetreffende de\
    \ systemen, van de meteorologische dienst alsmede via 'wandelingen door de \n\
    systemen' en interviews met irrigatie opzichters, de operationele staf en verenigingen\
    \ van \nwatergebruikers. De 'wandelingen door de systemen' van de dam tot aan\
    \ de laatste uitlaat van \nde hoofd kanalen en grote distributie kanalen van elk\
    \ NIS zijn uitgevoerd in het kader van de \nRAP voor het verkrijgen van een indruk\
    \ van de huidige staat van de kunstwerken en de \nwerking van de systemen. De\
    \ waarden van de RAP indicatoren betreffende het functioneren \nvan de systemen\
    \ zijn berekend uit de RAP computer spreadsheet gegevens.  \nDe toepasbaarheid\
    \ van de watergerelateerde externe RAP indicatoren en gevoeligheid \nevaluatie\
    \ van de kunstwerken als diagnostische instrumenten was beperkt door het gebrek\
    \ aan \nstromings gegevens en de onmogelijkheid om veld experimenten uit te voeren\
    \ ten gevolge \nvan de strakke rotatie irrigatie schema's en laissez-faire directe\
    \ uitlaten. Daarom is een \npragmatische aanpak toegepast door voor de analyses\
    \ gebruik te maken van afvoer \nwaterhoogte relaties, hydraulische flexibiliteit\
    \ concept, de bevindingen tijdens de \n'wandelingen door de systemen' en interviews.\
    \ \nHet resultaat van de indeling van de systeem profiel gegevens op basis van\
    \ het logische \nontwerp kader toonde aan dat het oorspronkelijke Balanac RIS\
    \ systeem is ontworpen voor \n410  \nModernisation strategy for the national irrigation\
    \ systems in the Philippines \n \n \n'productieve irrigatie' tijdens het droge\
    \ seizoen op basis van 'gelijkwaardige wateraanvoer per \nhectare'. De operationele\
    \ doelstelling was 'opgelegde toewijzing' aan de tertiaire eenheden of \nirrigatie\
    \ voorziening leveringspunten met 'instelbare aanvoer' en door 'instelbare aanvoer'\
    \ door \nhet hoofdsysteem of grote transport kanalen en het toepassen van bovenstroomse\
    \ controle. \nHet was uitgerust met verstelbare verticale schuiven voor het regelen\
    \ van afvoeren door de \nuitlaten en bovenstroomse waterstanden. Het oorspronkelijke\
    \ ontwerp van Sta. Maria RIS had \ndiezelfde filosofieën, de algemene doelstellingen\
    \ van het systeem en de operationele \ndoelstellingen, behalve in het geval van\
    \ het ontwerp irrigatie seizoen. De ontwerp water \nleveringscapaciteit van 0,8\
    \ l/s/ha is zeer laag en suggereert logischer wijze dat het ontwerp \n'irrigatie\
    \ seizoen' het natte seizoen was. Met andere woorden, het systeem was ontworpen\
    \ om \nde regenval aan te vullen en kon tijdens het droge seizoen niet het hele\
    \ verzorgingsgebied \nirrigeren. \nEr bestond een logische samenhang tussen de\
    \ ontwerp filosofie of de algemene \ndoelstellingen van de systemen, operationele\
    \ doelstellingen en kunstwerken in de kanalen van \nhet oorspronkelijke ontwerp\
    \ van Balanac RIS en Sta. Maria RIS. Echter, de overgang naar \n'gesplitste' stroming\
    \ en 'proportionele controle' zoals gemanifesteerd door de eendenbek \nstuwen\
    \ op de grote splitsingspunten van Balanac RIS was niet in overeenstemming met\
    \ de \nongewijzigde algemene doelstellingen van het systeem. In tegenstelling\
    \ daarmee, is bij de \nvermindering van het verzorgingsgebied van Sta. Maria RIS\
    \ en de overgang naar het droge \nseizoen als het belangrijkste irrigatie seizoen\
    \ de samenhang tussen de doelstellingen \ngehandhaafd. Verder is de toevoeging\
    \ van open directe uitlaten langs de hoofd kanalen van \nbeide systemen niet in\
    \ overeenstemming met de operationele doelstellingen van de systemen. \nIn het\
    \ algemeen waren de berekende waarden van de primaire interne RAP indicatoren\
    \ \nvoor de twee systemen laag, variërend 0-2 (0 en 4 geven respectievelijk de\
    \ minst en meest \nwenselijke waarde aan). De enige uitzonderingen waren in het\
    \ geval van looptijd van een \nverandering in het debiet door de hoofd kanalen\
    \ in beide systemen en in het geval van \ncontrole over de verdeelwerken langs\
    \ de hoofd kanalen van Sta. Maria RIS. De resultaten van \nde RAP die is uitgevoerd\
    \ in Balanac RIS ondersteunen de hypothese van starre water \nverdeling zoals\
    \ afgeleid uit de logische ontwerp kader analyse. De waarden van de interne \n\
    RAP indicatoren voor waterlevering en besturing en beheer van de kunstwerken waren\
    \ laag \nvoor de twee systemen, vooral door het gebrek aan functionele kunstwerken\
    \ voor de controle \nSamenvatting \n411 \n \n \nvan de stroming en de aanwezigheid\
    \ van directe open uitlaten langs de hoofd kanalen en \nandere hoofd transport\
    \ kanalen. \nDe capaciteit van de kunstwerken van Balanac RIS en Sta. Maria RIS\
    \ om hun beoogde \nfuncties te realiseren is afgenomen als gevolg van schade,\
    \ defecten, slecht functioneren, \nontbrekende onderdelen en afwijkingen van de\
    \ randvoorwaarden voor een goede werking \ndoor de tijd heen. Reparaties of vervangingen\
    \ zijn nodig voor niet-functionele kunstwerken en \nonderhoudswerkzaamheden om\
    \ de hoofd verdeelwerken op de dam te herstellen en de \nwateraanvoer condities\
    \ naar de goten. In Balanac RIS en Sta. Maria RIS, waren de meest \nsprekende\
    \ capaciteitsproblemen respectievelijk de verdeling capaciteit en de beperkte\
    \ \nwatertoevoer uit de rivieren. Mogelijkheden om de opslagcapaciteit van de\
    \ Sta. Maria \ndammen te vergroten of de watertoevoer uit andere bronnen te verhogen\
    \ moeten worden \nonderzocht.  \nDe originele werdeelwerken bij de hoofd verdeelpunten\
    \ van Balanac RIS en Sta. Maria \nRIS bestonden uit zowel verstelbare onderstroom\
    \ afvoer en water niveau controles, die \ngevoelig zijn voor proportionele afleiding\
    \ door de schuiven of het bereiken van dezelfde \nvariaties in de afvoer bij de\
    \ hoofd inlaat en uitlaat kunstwerken van de systemen. Echter, de \nbenodigde\
    \ frequente aanpassingen van de schuiven voor het handhaven van evenredige \n\
    verdeling maakt de verstelbare onderstroom kunstwerken minder praktisch toepasbaar\
    \ voor de \ndammen voor het afleiden van water uit de rivieren en voor variabele\
    \ watertoevoer vanuit de \nrivieren. Het huidige gebrek aan functionele kunstwerken\
    \ en de combinaties van overstroming \nen onderstroming bij hoofd verdeelpunten\
    \ resulteren in niet proportionele variaties in de \nafvoer in de afleidingskanalen,\
    \ de aansluitende kanalen en andere benedenstroomse uitlaten. \nDe vele ongecontroleerde\
    \ directe uitlaten dragen verder bij aan de inherente variaties in de \nstroming\
    \ en verstoringen langs de hoofd kanalen. \nVeldexperimenten en een grondige analyse\
    \ van de ontwerp waarden en \nveronderstellingen betreffende percolatie en watervoorziening\
    \ zijn uitgevoerd om de \ngeldigheid en de juistheid van de geprojecteerde irrigatie\
    \ verzorgingsgebieden te meten. Ook \nis de geldigheid van de aannamen beoordeeld\
    \ in termen van het percentage van het \ngeprogrammeerde irrigatiegebied het in\
    \ feite geïrrigeerde gebied. Omdat kopieën van \noriginele haalbaarheidsstudies\
    \ en ontwerp documenten niet meer in de NIA kantoren \naanwezig waren, zijn ontwerpers,\
    \ hydrologen en de ingenieurs voor het beheer van de \n412  \nModernisation strategy\
    \ for the national irrigation systems in the Philippines \n \n \nsystemen van\
    \ de NIA geïnterviewd over de procedures en methoden die door het agentschap \n\
    zijn gebruikt bij het bepalen van de beschikbare waterhoeveelheden voor de irrigatie\
    \ \nsystemen. Verder zijn de procedures voor het ramen van de verzorgingsgebieden\
    \ in \nhaalbaarheidsstudies voor een steekproef van 20 irrigatieprojecten die\
    \ in 2010-2014 zijn \nuitgevoerd geanalyseerd. \nDe percolatie testen met behulp\
    \ van de 3-cilinder-methode en inundatie testen zijn op \n19 plaatsen in de verzorgingsgebieden\
    \ van Balanac RIS en Sta. Maria RIS uitgevoerd. Een \ngezamenlijke studie om de\
    \ fysieke en hydraulische eigenschappen van de bodem ter plaatse \nvan de experimenten\
    \ te bepalen is met studenten uitgevoerd. De parameters die zijn \ngeïdentificeerd\
    \ omvatten de bodem textuur, bodemdichtheid, deeltjesdichtheid, porositeit en\
    \ \ndoorlatendheid. Ze werden respectievelijk bepaald met een hydrometer, oven\
    \ drogen, volume \nverplaatsing en verval permeameter methoden. De resultaten\
    \ van bodemtextuur analyses zijn \ngebruikt om de percolatie waarden voor elke\
    \ grondsoort te bepalen zoals deze in de literatuur \nzijn vermeld en uiteindelijk\
    \ de gemeten percolatie waarden te verifiëren. \nDe gemeten percolatie snelheden\
    \ in Balanac RIS vertoonden een breed scala aan \nwaarden, met een gemiddelde\
    \ van 1-30 mm/dag. De ontwerp waarde van 2 mm/dag voor het \nsysteem was slechts\
    \ van toepassing in drie van de negen experiment locaties. De gemiddelde \npercolatie\
    \ waarden waren groter dan 28 mm/dag in twee van de negen locaties. De \nrespectievelijk\
    \ gemiddelde percolatie in twee andere locaties verschilde significant indien\
    \ de \nvoorwaarden van de omringende bodem van de velden voor de experimenten\
    \ veranderlijk was \n- van 5 mm/dag voor vaste bodem tot 22 mm/dag voor pas geploegde\
    \ grond en van 12 \nmm/dag voor verzadigde grond tot minder dan 1 mm/dag voor\
    \ onverzadigde grond. In Sta. \nMaria RIS varieerde de gemeten gemiddelde percolatie\
    \ snelheden in de 10 locaties van 1-6 \nmm/dag. De ontwerp waarde van 1,4 mm/dag\
    \ voor het systeem is waargenomen in vijf van de \n10 experiment locaties. De\
    \ gemiddelde percolatie waarden van ongeveer 6 mm/dag en 3-4 \nmm/dag werden verkregen\
    \ in respectievelijk een locatie en vier experiment locaties. \nDe resultaten\
    \ van de bodem textuur analyses toonden een aantal verschillen tussen de \ngrondsoort\
    \ in de locaties van de experimenten en die vermeld in de officiële \nbodemclassificatie\
    \ kaarten, die variëren van klei tot keileem in Balanac RIS en klei in Sta. \n\
    Maria RIS. Het meest opvallende verschil in Balanac RIS was de aanwezigheid van\
    \ zand in \ndrie experiment locaties. De percolatie snelheden verkregen op de\
    \ locaties met zand waren \nSamenvatting \n413 \n \n \n25-30 mm/dag, die veel\
    \ hoger zijn dan de 2 mm/dag die gewoonlijk zijn gebruikt in de \nontwerpen voor\
    \ zavel leemgronden en 4 mm/dag voor zavel bodems. Keileem en \nleemgronden zijn\
    \ ook gevonden in zes van de 10 experiment locaties in Sta. Maria RIS. Voor \n\
    de vier locaties met overwegend kleibodems, hadden twee gemeten percolatie snelheden\
    \ \nbinnen de algemene ontwerp waarde van 1,25 mm/dag voor kleigronden. Ondertussen,\
    \ had de \nmeerderheid van de locaties met keileem percolatie snelheden die bijna\
    \ twee keer zo groot \nwaren als de conventionele ontwerp waarden van 1,75 mm/dag\
    \ voor percolatie.  \nHoewel de relatieve snelheden van de percolatie van de bodem-\
    \ textuur indeling zijn \nwaargenomen, verschilden de werkelijke percolatie waarden\
    \ significant van de \novereenkomstige waarden uit de literatuur en ontwerprichtlijnen.\
    \ Andere factoren die de \npercolatie snelheid kunnen hebben beïnvloed waren de\
    \ relatieve hoogte van de experiment \nlocaties ten opzichte van de aangrenzende\
    \ velden, opwellen van ondiep grondwater en \nploegen dat de ploegzool losmaakt\
    \ of breekt. Daarom zouden ten minste per tertiaire \nverzorgingsgebied metingen\
    \ ter plaatse moeten worden gedaan.  \nDe resultaten van de studie suggereren\
    \ dat het potentieel voor het vergroten van de \nwerkelijke oppervlakte geïrrigeerd\
    \ gebied liggen in vergroting van watervoorziening of \nverhogen van de opslagcapaciteit\
    \ van de systemen, het gebruik van kunstwerken voor \ncontrole van de stroming\
    \ die geschikt zijn voor flexibele water verdeling schema's en \nstrategische\
    \ timing van irrigatie schema's over tertiaire gebieden aan te passen aan de \n\
    heersende hydrologische regimes. \nDe ervaringen in de drie steekproef NIS gaven\
    \ aan dat een meer systematische aanpak voor \nverbeteringen van irrigatiesysteem\
    \ zou moeten worden gevolgd. Deze aanpak zou \ndiagnostisch onderzoek van de fysieke\
    \ structuur, beheer, onderhoud en water levering van \nirrigatiesystemen moeten\
    \ omvatten; identificeren van beperkingen, mogelijkheden en opties \nvoor verbetering;\
    \ het vaststellen van voldoende water voor verbeteringsprojecten; \ninachtneming\
    \ van de aanvaardbaarheid van verbetering opties voor de boeren; ontwikkeling\
    \ \nvan een blauwdruk van moderniseringsplannen voor individuele systemen en het\
    \ tot stand \nbrengen van een strategisch registratie en evaluatie systeem (M&E).\
    \ Van de waarnemingen, \nanalyses, bevindingen en aanbevelingen zoals beschreven\
    \ in dit proefschrift wordt verwacht \ndat zij een solide basis voor dergelijke\
    \ activiteiten creëren. \n \n \n \nAnnex Q. About the author \n \nMona Liza Fortunado\

    \ \nImprovement of Irrigation Efficiency on Paddy Fields in the Lower \nMekong\
    \ Basin Project (IIEPF) \n(25 March 2008, Mekong River Commission Secretariat,\
    \ Vientiane, Lao PDR) \n \n1. \nBackground \n \nThe Improvement of Irrigation\
    \ Efficiency on Paddy Fields in the Lower Mekong Basin \nProject (IIEPF) is aimed\
    \ at improving the efficiency of irrigation through the introduction of \nguidelines\
    \ covering the technical, managerial and institutional aspects of irrigation schemes\
    \ \nand of the operations of the facilities. \n \nThe project is funded by the\
    \ Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) of Japan \nunder the\
    \ framework of the “Programme to Analyse and Evaluate Water and Ecosystems in\
    \ \nAsian Paddy Fields”. The project is implemented by the Mekong River Commission\
    \ \nSecretariat (MRCS) in close cooperation with the National Mekong Committees\
    \ (NMCs) and \ntheir relevant line agencies. \n \nThe first regional workshop\
    \ to finalise the project document and to discuss the outline of \nfuture project\
    \ activities was held in May, 2006 at the MRCS in Vientiane, the Lao PDR. \nImmediately\
    \ after this regional workshop, the MRCS conducted a Rapid Appraisal Process \n\
    (RAP) training workshop in July 2006 with technical assistance provided by the\
    \ FAO \nRegional office in Bangkok. These workshops were followed by the initial\
    \ scheme \nperformance appraisals at the four pilot sites. Once the baseline data\
    \ for these four pilot sites \nhad been set up, the country teams assisted by\
    \ the MRCS conducted intensive field \nobservations covering two crop seasons\
    \ (2006 to 2007). In parallel with these field \nobservations, the MRCS together\
    \ with the consultant from NIRE, Japan conducted two field \nsurveys and interviews\
    \ between the middle to the end of 2007. \n \nOn the completion of the field activities\
    \ including the analysis of the collected data, this \nsecond regional workshop\
    \ was held in order to share all the activities and their \noutputs/findings under\
    \ the IIEPF with member countries including field activities, the \nvarious publications\
    \ produced mainly by the MRCS and the guidelines being drafted by the \nNIRE consultant.\
    \ The second regional workshop also aimed to discuss the outline of the \ndraft\
    \ guidelines and asked opinions and comments of the member countries for further\
    \ \nimprovement. \n \nThe Workshop Agenda is given in Annex 1. \n2. \nOrganisation\
    \ \n \n2.1. Participants \n \nA total of 23 participants attended the Workshop.\
    \ These included five (5) participants each \nfrom Cambodia and Thailand, four\
    \ (4) from Lao PDR, two (2) participants from Viet Nam, \none (1) resource person\
    \ from NIRE, Japan, one (1) diplomat from the Embassy of Japan to \n2\n2 \n \n\
    the Lao PDR and five (5) professional and support staff from the MRCS. Two officials\
    \ from \nVNMC were forced to cancel their participation by conflict of the schedule\
    \ and sudden \naccident.   \n \nThe list of the participants is given in Annex\
    \ 2 \n \n2.2. Opening Remarks \n \nThe workshop began at 09.00 on Tuesday, 25\
    \ March 2008 in the MRC Conference Room, \nVientiane, the Lao PDR with an opening\
    \ address by Mr Do Manh Hung, the Director of the \nOperations Division and the\
    \ Officer-in-Charge of the Mekong River Commission \nSecretariat. This was followed\
    \ by an address by Mr Metoku Yuichi, Second Secretary of the \nEmbassy of Japan\
    \ to the Lao PDR. \n \nMr Hung expressed his appreciation for the support given\
    \ to the MRC by the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan\
    \ and for the significant technical support to \nimplementation from the FAO in\
    \ Bangkok.  He also acknowledged the work of the member \ncountries, NMCs and\
    \ the line agencies in terms of their contribution of fieldwork, and the \nanalysis\
    \ of the resulting data. He emphasised that irrigation development is expected\
    \ to play \na key role in the pro-poor development of agriculture which together\
    \ with hydropower are \nkey factors in the achievement of the MRC’s overall objective\
    \ “to support Member States for \nmore effective use of the Mekong’s water and\
    \ resources for poverty alleviation” as set out in \nthe Strategic Plan (2006-2010).\
    \ He pointed out that this project had been created in response \nto the need\
    \ to share the limited water resources efficiency between agriculture and the\
    \ other \nsectors. He concluded by asking for constructive and critical comments\
    \ to improve the final \ntechnical guidance document.  \n \nMr Metoku stated that\
    \ the Government of Japan was eager to support the development of the \nMekong\
    \ Region through both bi- and multi-lateral channels. This was illustrated by\
    \ the \n“Japan-Mekong Foreign Ministers Meeting” held in Tokyo earlier this year\
    \ in January. This \nmeeting identified many “candidate projects for the Cambodia-Lao\
    \ PDR-Viet Nam \nDevelopment Triangle”. He confirmed continuing support and funding\
    \ by the Japan-ASEAN \nIntegration Fund (JAIF). He also mentioned that the Ministry\
    \ of Agriculture, Forestry and \nFisheries of Japan is especially active in the\
    \ development of land and water resources for \nagriculture and informed the participants\
    \ that the third series of contributions focused on the \nuse of water for irrigation\
    \ purposes pledged by the MAFF Japan at the annual consultation \nmeeting in this\
    \ year since the Ministry recognizes the challenges still facing effective water\
    \ \nmanagement for irrigation.   \n \nThese speeches by Mr Do Manh Hung and Mr\
    \ Metoku Yuichi are given in Annex 3. \n \n3. \nPresentations and discussions\
    \ \n \n3.1.  Workshop Agenda \n \nThe AIFP Senior Advisor outlined the agenda\
    \ for the workshop; \n1. the morning session would be devoted to listening to\
    \ the presentations of the four \nMember countries detailing their observations\
    \ and findings; and \n3\n3 \n \n2. the afternoon session would begin with a presentation\
    \ of the concepts behind the \ntechnical guide, followed by a consultation of\
    \ how these should be applied to the \nfour schemes and would finish with input\
    \ from the Member countries. \n \nA questionnaire to evaluate the project concept\
    \ and design was distributed. The results of this \nquestionnaire are given in\
    \ Paragraph 6. \n \n3.2. Overview of IIEPF implementation and progress \n \nThe\
    \ AIFP Senior Advisor presented an overview of IIEPF implementation and progress.\
    \ He \nbegan by describing the funding arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture,\
    \ Forestry and \nFisheries of Japan provided approximately US$ 1 million for three\
    \ years corresponding to the \nJapanese fiscal years 2005 to 2007.  \n \nThe Senior\
    \ Advisor then reminded the participants of the project structure and emphasised\
    \ the \nimportance of the fieldwork. He presented the objectives; the overall\
    \ objective was to \ncontribute to an improvement of the efficiency of irrigation,\
    \ with immediate objectives of an \nappraisal of the scheme performance, an enhancement\
    \ of the capacity of the stakeholders and \nthe production of guidelines. Under\
    \ each immediate objective the planned activities were set \nas follow: \n \n\
    Performance Appraisal included: \n \nx Field (scheme) level data collection \n\
    x Water balance analysis \nx Scheme management appraisal \nx Rapid Appraisal Process\
    \ (RAP) \n \nCapacity Enhancement included: \n \nx Regular backstopping \nx A\
    \ RAP training workshop and an initial assessment \nx National workshops \n \n\
    Guidelines activities included: \n \nx A review of the information and data collected\
    \ \nx Field surveys and interviews \nx Consultations through workshops \n \nThe\
    \ participants were reminded that the last activity on this list would be conducted\
    \ in the \nafternoon session of this workshop.  \n \nIn terms of the plan and\
    \ progress there had been no significant delays apart from a delay in \nthe data\
    \ analysis and the production of the guidelines. The outputs achieved included\
    \ the \ncompletion of the initial assessments together with RAP training, and\
    \ the collection and \nanalysis of data in three countries during the 2006/07\
    \ dry season and the 2006/07 winter-\nspring crop in the tidal irrigation scheme\
    \ in Viet Nam. The Senior Advisor also listed the \nvarious publications issued\
    \ and the outputs currently in hand. This workshop would be the \n4\n4 \n \nfirst\
    \ opportunity to discuss the guidelines and that due to both the time and budget\
    \ restraints \nset by the completion date of June 2008, would be the only opportunity.\
    \ The Senior Advisor \nasked for active participation and comments including those\
    \ on a suitable title. In answer to a \nquestion from a member from Cambodia,\
    \ he replied that his personal view was that perhaps \n“Guidelines” was too strong\
    \ a title since the final product should not be seen as rules or \nregulations\
    \ but rather as a presentation of the technical aspects together with suggestions.\
    \ \nThe member then went on to comment that the guidelines had already proved\
    \ very useful \nand he saw no problem with the name. He was thanked and informed\
    \ that this would form \npart of the afternoon’s discussion. The Senior Advisor\
    \ then introduced the first of the \nmember country presenters.  \n \nThe overview\
    \ is outlined in Annex 4. \n \n3.3. Field observations and analysis by the country\
    \ teams \n \nRepresentatives from the four Member countries presented their field\
    \ observations and \nanalyses. Each presentation included details of the location,\
    \ the size, a brief description of \nthe irrigation scheme and its management,\
    \ and the methods used in collecting the field data.  \n \nLong Hai Irrigation\
    \ Area, Gocong Irrigation Project, Viet Nam \n \nA member of the Viet Nam team\
    \ gave the first presentation since their scheme, the Long Hai \nIrrigation area,\
    \ Gocong Irrigation Project in the Mekong Delta, was the only example of a \n\
    tidal irrigation scheme. The key function of the project is aimed at irrigation,\
    \ drainage and \nsalinity prevention. The analysis showed that irrigation efficiency\
    \ was higher in the winter-\nspring crop but lower in the summer-autumn crop.\
    \ Average productivity through three crop \nseasons accounts for 0.78kg per one\
    \ cubic meter of water diverted into the command area. \nEach family earned 86%\
    \ of their annual income from an average plot of 0.58 ha.  \n \nHuay Luang O &\
    \ M Project, Udon Thani, Thailand \n \nThe second presentation was on the Huay\
    \ Luang O & M Project in Udon Thani in Thailand. \nThis gravity irrigation project\
    \ covers some 13,917.9 ha and provides water for both domestic \nand industrial\
    \ consumption. The reservoir with 118.8 MCM (Million Cubic Meters) of \nstorage\
    \ capacity provides 4.2 MCM for industry and 22.6 MCM for domestic use. However\
    \ \nintensive field observation was carried out at the area under the left main\
    \ canal, which \nprovides irrigation for 7,912 ha in the wet season and 2,988\
    \ ha in the dry season. Although \npaddy is the main production in the region,\
    \ non-paddy crops grown in the dry season \naccounted for more than 20% of the\
    \ total area. There was a strong recommendation that the \nMRCS should provide\
    \ equipment, and should not only fund but also provide training for the \ndevelopment\
    \ of human resources.  \n \nKamping Puoy Scheme, Battambang Province, Cambodia\
    \ \n \nThe third presentation was on the gravity scheme of Kamping Puoy in Battambang\
    \ Province \nin Cambodia where rice is grown in both the wet and dry seasons.\
    \ The water management is \nthrough a water allocation plan agreed upon by Farmer\
    \ Water User Committees. Although \nthe team presented many field observation\
    \ results it was pointed out that some of the data \nmay not be absolutely reliable\
    \ since problems had been encountered thus some data was \neither not recorded\
    \ or not included. There was a request that the MRCS should allow for one \n5\n\
    5 \n \nmore year of research so that there would be more data for analysis and\
    \ some information \ngaps could be filled in. However the members of the team\
    \ had learnt a great deal and had \ngained much experience in conducting measurements\
    \ in terms of the efficiency of irrigation \nwater use and, on the operation and\
    \ management of irrigation systems. \n \nNam Houm Irrigation Project, Vientiane\
    \ Capital, the Lao PDR \n \nThe last country to present their findings was the\
    \ Lao PDR. The Nam Houm Irrigation \nProject, a gravity scheme which has the objective\
    \ of generating household income for \nfamilies and of supporting and promoting\
    \ the industrialisation of agriculture through the \nprovision of irrigation services.\
    \ The water is supplied solely for agricultural use and not for \ndomestic or\
    \ any other uses. From the field observations it was concluded that the low \n\
    efficiency resulted from the poor facilities giving rise to water loss and drainage\
    \ spill. The \nloss along canal and irrigation structures was estimated at 30%\
    \ of total supply. Problems of \nwater shortage are not adequately addressed by\
    \ the system of water allocation since there is \nno feedback mechanism. The higher\
    \ efficiency observed in the wet season (78.17%) results \nfrom the reduced demand\
    \ then, while the higher productivity in the dry season (US$ 0.11/m3 \nof water\
    \ consumption) is due to the higher prices of paddy and non-paddy products and\
    \ their \nproduction. In order to increase both the efficiency of water use and\
    \ water productivity trials \nof better management practices need to be implemented.\
    \ \n \nAll these presentations are given in full in Annex 5. Full text of country\
    \ reports from NMCS \nare also placed in the CD. \n \n3.4. Summary of the technical\
    \ backstopping work under IIEPF in 2006/07 dry-season \ncultivation  \n \nThe\
    \ morning session closed with the AIFP Programme Officer presenting a summary\
    \ of the \ntechnical backstopping work under IIEPF in the 2006/07 dry-season cultivation.\
    \ The AIFP \nProgramme Officer first apologised for the fact that this summary\
    \ covered only the dry \nseason cultivation since he had just received the wet\
    \ season data and needed time to complete \nthe analysis. He began with an overview\
    \ of agriculture and irrigation in the Lower Mekong \nBasin, pointing out that\
    \ the ever increasing population in the region makes an ever increasing \ndemand\
    \ on agriculture for food. Most agriculture in the region still depends on the\
    \ rainfall \nbetween the months of April to November. However a significant gap\
    \ between rainfall and \nthe water demand by crops can be observed at the end\
    \ of the rainy season (November) \nespecially in northeast Thailand. He re-iterated\
    \ the IIEPF Project objectives and described \ntheir expected impact. He then\
    \ presented the results of the year long field observations for \nthree gravity\
    \ schemes followed by those from the tidal irrigation scheme. He concluded that\
    \ \nhigh efficiencies were due to the water balance approach and the outstanding\
    \ performance at \nthe pilot sites. Moreover the high productivity was observed\
    \ in schemes where there were \nmultiple agricultural activities. He concluded\
    \ with the comment that a similar practical \napproach was expected to be applied\
    \ to irrigation systems throughout the Lower Mekong \nBasin. \n \nThis presentation\
    \ is made available in Annex 6. \n \n \n \n \n6\n6 \n \n3.5. Key concepts of the\
    \ Technical Guide \n \nMr Horikawa Naoki, the consultant from NIRE, Japan first\
    \ presented the key concepts of the \nguidelines for the efficient use of water\
    \ in irrigation. He began by saying that three indicators \nhad been chosen, namely;\
    \ reliability, flexibility and equity, and that these indicators were \nreflected\
    \ in the chapters of the draft outline, the overall purpose of which is to describe\
    \ the \noptions in the improvements of the efficiencies of irrigation systems\
    \ in the Mekong River \nBasin. The guidelines are focused on the management phase\
    \ of a project and since most of \nthe irrigation schemes in the Mekong Basin\
    \ are open channel they focus on such schemes. \nMr Horikawa explained the guidelines\
    \ contained seven chapters dealing with (1) Water \nAllocation; (2) Water Distribution;\
    \ (3) Canal Operations; (4) Management of Waters in \nTertiary Canals; (5) Distribution;\
    \ (6) Improvement of Physical Structures and (7) Technical \nand Management Aspects.\
    \ He explained how these chapters reflected the three indicators. \nMr Horikawa\
    \ then gave further details; explaining and commenting on each chapter. He \n\
    emphasised that decisions were often quite difficult to take since there were\
    \ always many \noptions, and that often there were both disadvantages and advantages.\
    \  \n \nHis presentation and outline are in Annex 7. \n \n3.6. Application to\
    \ the pilot sites (case study) \n \nMr Horikawa Naoki, the consultant from NIRE,\
    \ Japan, then went on to demonstrate how \nthese draft guidelines could be applied\
    \ to the pilot sites. He had made two visits to each site \nand since full details\
    \ and descriptions of the sites had already been presented he would not \nrepeat\
    \ these.  \n \nNam Houm Irrigation Project, Vientiane Capital, the Lao PDR \n\
    \ \nFirst Mr Horikawa commented on the Nam Houm Scheme where there was supplementary\
    \ \nirrigation in the wet season. This water supply did not reflect the situation\
    \ in the paddy \nfields. Overall the Nam Houm Project had mastered water allocation,\
    \ and had reached an \nalmost constant level of water distribution satisfying\
    \ the first two indicators of reliability and \nflexibility. Their next step should\
    \ be a consideration of the aspects of equity addressing; dry \nseason rotation\
    \ of the irrigation from tertiary canals, a flexible irrigation supply and the\
    \ \noptimum operations of the reservoir to facilitate an increase of the crop\
    \ intensity.  \n \nHuay Luang O & M Project, Udon Thani, Thailand \n \nNext Mr\
    \ Horikawa considered the Huay Luang O & M Project where irrigation efficiency\
    \ is \nhigher in the wet season than in the dry, and the water distribution to\
    \ the four zones is \ncontrolled well. In relation to the chapters and indicators\
    \ of the guidelines this site’s next \nsteps should be to consider water management\
    \ in the tertiary canals focusing on; low \nmeasurements at turnouts, feedback\
    \ to intake to ensure flexibility, the assignment of dry \nseason crop areas and\
    \ the strengthening of the tertiary level of the Water User Groups. \n \nKamping\
    \ Puoy Scheme, Battambang Province, Cambodia \n \nThe Kamping Puoy Scheme, Battambang\
    \ Province was the next site for Mr Horikawa’s \nattention. In this site water\
    \ is drawn from a nearby river and there are plans to extend the \ncanal to provide\
    \ for an additional irrigated area. In terms of their irrigation plan the consultant\
    \ \n7\n7 \n \nfelt there was not enough information for the wet season. There\
    \ was room for improvement. \nHowever he acknowledged the difficulties associated\
    \ with small staff numbers. The next \nsteps should be; monitoring of the reservoirs,\
    \ measurements of the flow rates at turnouts to \nthe tertiary canals, the training\
    \ of the leader of the Water User Groups at the tertiary canal \nlevel and the\
    \ optimum operation of the reservoir. \n \n \nLong Hai Irrigation Area, Gocong\
    \ Irrigation Project, Viet Nam \n \nThe final site for comments was that of the\
    \ Long Hai Irrigation Area, Gocong Irrigation \nProject. Because of the uniqueness\
    \ of tidal irrigation, the water management of this scheme \nrelies heavily on\
    \ natural phenomena and this limits opportunities for improvement. However \n\
    the consultant presented some recommendations in that the next steps for this\
    \ scheme should \nbe at the institutional level, namely; quality control to reduce\
    \ flush water and an analysis of \nthe water balance. \n \nPresentation for this\
    \ session is also in Annex 7. \n \n3.7. Feedback from the Member Countries \n\
    \ \nMember countries were then invited to make comments. The AIFP Programme Officer\
    \ was \nthe facilitator and began by asking the Senior Advisor to present the\
    \ key issues to be \ndiscussed. These included clarification by questions and\
    \ answers, discussion on an \nappropriate title for the guidelines and the next\
    \ process to be undertaken.  \n \nThis presentation is in Annex 8.       \n \n\
    The first question for clarification came from the Cambodian team who asked about\
    \ the \nseasonal irrigation plan – how could they make a plan to cover the wet\
    \ and the dry seasons? \nIn the dry season water is taken from the reservoir.\
    \ Mr Horikawa’s response was that there \nwas no need for a wet season plan. \
    \ \n \nA member from Thailand then enquired about the next step which had been\
    \ recommended \nand asked for a further explanation of what ‘feedback to intake’\
    \ meant. The response was \nthat there should be a more flexible water management\
    \ first in each zone and then between \nthe zones. \n \nNext came another comment\
    \ from the Cambodian team regarding the next step of \nmonitoring the water level\
    \ in the reservoir (currently monitoring is done at the gate), and the \nquestion\
    \ of how can leakage between the gate and the paddy fields be controlled. Mr \n\
    Horikawa replied that since it is intended to extend the beneficiary area by 2,000\
    \ ha the \nproject should know how many hectares can be irrigated, and so it is\
    \ necessary to know how \nmuch water there is in the reservoir and what the water\
    \ volume in the rivers is. These \nmeasurements are necessary to ensure future\
    \ sustainability.  \n \nA member from Thailand asked how was it possible to deal\
    \ with water shortages resulting \nfrom concentration of planted paddy plots as\
    \ suggested by the consultant. Mr Horikawa \nexplained that the concentration\
    \ in the dry season of each year should be to places agreed \nupon by the water\
    \ user groups, but that the places of concentration could be rotated each \nyear.\
    \ The Senior Advisor once again stressed that the need to consider the basic concept\
    \ of \n8\n8 \n \nthe guidelines. What are guidelines? Are they rules or are they\
    \ simply for reference? Mr \nHorikawa then reminded the participants that in each\
    \ country there are different social \naspects so it is impossible to generalise\
    \ for all countries. He asked that participants should \nremember that the guidelines\
    \ are not the final answer applicable everywhere. \n \nAnother suggestion was\
    \ that the guidelines should contain a section on the maintenance of \nthe systems.\
    \ Mr Horikawa agreed that maintenance was important and said that this would \n\
    be considered. \n \nA member from Cambodia asked what exactly was meant by ‘monitoring\
    \ of the reservoir’ \nand could the consultant please elaborate on this. Mr Horikawa\
    \ gave a more practical \nexplanation and agreed that reservoir monitoring was\
    \ difficult, however measurements could \nbe handled by the leaders of the water\
    \ user groups. He described the current situation which \nwas control by the community\
    \ leader who had to do so by trial-and-error with visual \nchecking. If flow measurements\
    \ could be introduced then this would make his job easier. Mr \nHorikawa continued\
    \ by saying that training was very important especially for control in the \n\
    tertiary canals since the people involved are not trained irrigation engineers.\
    \ And in terms of \nthe optimum management of the reservoir this crucial issue\
    \ had already been covered. A \nfurther comment from the Cambodian team was that\
    \ they were still unclear in how to monitor \nthe reservoir. Mr Horikawa explained\
    \ this could be achieved by measuring the differences in \nwater levels, by calculating\
    \ the discharge into the main canal and the water diverted from \nother areas\
    \ to the project area. Clearer references between the case study and relevant\
    \ parts of \nguidelines will be prepared by the consultant later. \n \nA member\
    \ from Viet Nam then referred Mr Horikawa to his suggested next step of quality\
    \ \ncontrol to reduce the flush water. Mr Horikawa replied that in the wet season\
    \ water is drained \nto maintain the water quality so maybe quality control is\
    \ not so important at that time, \nhowever during the dry season there is not\
    \ enough water so the water quality is degraded. It \nmay not be necessary to\
    \ reduce the flush water but his suggestion should be retained if \nproduction\
    \ was to be improved. \n \nThe Senior Advisor then intervened to say that enough\
    \ time had now been spent on the case \nstudy and perhaps the members could give\
    \ their feedback on the guidelines.  \n \nA member from the Lao team commented\
    \ that the guidelines were very good and would be of \ngreat help in the Nam Houm\
    \ Project where they would be distributed and used to improve the \nknowledge\
    \ of the local staff.  \n \nThe team from Thailand queried Item 5.2 – the Restriction\
    \ of Land Use which they felt may \ngive rise to problems particularly with land\
    \ use changes. This may be difficult to achieve. \nThey acknowledged the result\
    \ could be a low efficiency in irrigation but it also involved \nother issues\
    \ for example like those connected with salinity intrusion where paddy fields\
    \ and \nsea water fish ponds were in close proximity. These issues could lead\
    \ to disputes between \nfarmers. They suggested that there could perhaps be a\
    \ different wording. The consultant took \nnote and will respond to this comment\
    \ by adding a supplementary explanation when \nfinalising the guidelines. \n \n\
    A member of the Lao team referred to Item 6 – the Improvement of Physical Structures.\
    \ He \npointed out that in the Lao PDR there were no automatic gates (Item 6.5)\
    \ and that funds \nwould be needed for training in remote monitoring and control\
    \ systems. The Senior Advisor \n9\n9 \n \nonce again stressed that following the\
    \ guidelines was not compulsory. They are intended to \nsimply give countries\
    \ ideas and suggestions, which may be realised within the longer term. \n \nA\
    \ member from Cambodia commented that Item 4 –Water Management in the Tertiary\
    \ \nCanals was too limiting and should be expanded to include both the main and\
    \ secondary \ncanals. The consultant responded that Item 1 to 3 covered both main/secondary\
    \ and tertiary \ncanal management and Item 4 included special considerations for\
    \ tertiary canal in a separate \nchapter. This structure will be clearly shown\
    \ in the next version. \n \nThe Senior Advisor thanked all the members for their\
    \ contributions and asked for their \ncomments on the term ‘guidelines’. Did they\
    \ think that it was too strong and was it \nmisleading? He asked them to remember\
    \ that it deals mostly with technical issues and \nprovides hints for water management\
    \ for irrigation engineers. It does not intend to lay down \nrules. A member from\
    \ Cambodia replied they had no objections but asked for alternatives. \nThe Senior\
    \ Advisor responded with some possibilities that he had in mind such as; Technical\
    \ \nGuidance, Best Practices or Water Management Principles. He then concluded\
    \ that since \nthere seemed to be no strong objections perhaps the MRCS could\
    \ be allowed to decide. He \nwent on to say that since time and budget restraints\
    \ made it unlikely that there would be the \nopportunity for another workshop\
    \ further clarification would be through e-mail. Some \nconsultation meetings\
    \ were possible. \n \n3.8. Wrap-up of the workshop discussion \n \nThe Senior\
    \ Advisor began by apologising for the necessity for a very quick wrap-up because\
    \ \ntime was running out. He thanked everybody for their active participation\
    \ and the various \nvaluable comments particularly those on the possibility of\
    \ the inclusion of a chapter on \nmaintenance, and their comments on the issues\
    \ of water shortages and changes in land use. \nHe assured everyone that their\
    \ comments would be incorporated in the final draft. There \nwould also be further\
    \ discussions on a suitable title and the next step would be decided. In \nthis\
    \ connection he again emphasised that further support and cooperation by member\
    \ \ncountries is still required. \n \nAll the member country delegates agreed\
    \ that the MRCS could decide on the further \nprocesses towards finalisation of\
    \ the guidelines, including the title and style appropriate for \nthe final clarification.\
    \ In general the member countries also showed their satisfaction with the \nprogress\
    \ and achievement of the IIEPF implementation up till now and supported the next\
    \ \nsteps toward completion of the IIEPF proposed by the MRCS at this workshop.\
    \ A Thai \ndelegate added his appreciation for the IIEFP which was one of the\
    \ successful MRC projects \nunder AIFP. \n \n4. \nClosing Remarks \n \nMr Hung,\
    \ the Director of the Operations Division and the Officer-in-Charge of the MRCS\
    \ \nbegan his closing remarks with an apology for not having been able to attend\
    \ the whole \nworkshop. Although there had not been a huge amount of comments\
    \ he understood that the \nmembers needed time to carefully read and digest the\
    \ contents of the guidelines. He \nencouraged further consultations amongst team\
    \ members and after this to send their \nsuggestions. He understood that the time\
    \ for this workshop was limited. Mr Hung thanked all \nmembers for their active\
    \ participation. \n10\n10 \n \n \nThe workshop finished at 17.00 on Tuesday 25\
    \ March 2008. \n \n5. \nSocial activity \n \nA dinner to honour the participants\
    \ was hosted by the MRCS in the evening of 25 March, \n2008, at the Fu Man Lou\
    \ Chinese restaurant in Vientiane. This gave the workshop \nparticipants the opportunity\
    \ for informal discussions and allowed them to congratulate each \nother on their\
    \ hard work and active involvement during the implementation of the project. \n\
    \ \n6. \nQuestionnaire for project evaluation \n \nAn evaluation of the IIEFP\
    \ project was conducted at the request of the MAFF, Japan through \ntheir own\
    \ questionnaire format. It was suggested to the member countries that they should\
    \ \ngive at least two replies from each country. However the Lao PDR and Thailand\
    \ voluntarily \nreplied to more than the number requested.   \n \nIn general,\
    \ the evaluation revealed positive support for the IIEPF project. The majority\
    \ \nsupported the idea of an extension of the implementation period and an expansion\
    \ of the \npilot sites. Supporting activities to share findings and disseminate\
    \ the project outputs such as \ntraining were also suggested. Another common suggestion\
    \ was the challenge of the need for \nstructural improvement although it had been\
    \ clearly explained at the first regional workshop \nthat this approach was outside\
    \ the focus of the IIEPF, mainly because of budgetary \nconstraints. \n \nA Cambodian\
    \ delegate greatly appreciated the IIEPF as a unique trial. \n \nThe Lao delegates\
    \ repeated that at the development stage, the engineers’ skills and other \ncapacities\
    \ of the individual countries should be taken into consideration, although this\
    \ point \nwas clarified during the workshop discussion. \n \nAs the Thai team\
    \ is now conducting follow-up activities in training their own staff and \ncarrying\
    \ out further data collection, they made a strong request to be able to keep the\
    \ current \nmeter provided. \n \nA Viet Nam delegate suggested that the guidelines\
    \ should go through the MRC clearance \nprocess before dissemination. \n \nThe\
    \ questionnaire and summary of responses are attached as Annex 9. \n \n  \nANNEXES\n\

    \ Efficiency on \nPaddy Fields in the Lower Mekong Basin Project \n25 March 2008\
    \ \nMRC Secretariat, Vientiane, Lao PDR \n \nMr. Metoku, Second Secretary, Embassy\
    \ of Japan, \nRepresentatives from the member countries, \nDistinguished participants,\
    \ \nLadies and Gentlemen, \n \nOn be half of the Mekong River Commission Secretariat,\
    \ I would like to extend a warm \nwelcome to all of you to the Second Regional\
    \ Workshop on Improvement of Irrigation \nEfficiency on Paddy Fields in the Lower\
    \ Mekong Basin Project (IIEPF).  This project is \nsupported by the Ministry of\
    \ Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan. \n \nOn this occasion, I would like\
    \ to express our high appreciation on the close cooperation \nand continuous support\
    \ from the Ministry to MRC in general and the Agriculture \nIrrigation and Forestry\
    \ Programme (AIFP) in particular. \n \nUnder the current MRC strategic plan (2006-2010)\
    \ we have set our overall objective “to \nsupport Member States for more effective\
    \ use of Mekong’s water and related resources \nfor poverty alleviation” and set\
    \ four strategic goals in order to achieve it.  One of those \nis “to promote\
    \ and support pro-poor development.”  To realise this pro-poor \ndevelopment in\
    \ this region, hydropower and agriculture, especially irrigation \ndevelopment\
    \ are expected to play a key role.  In this line, newly started BDP phase 2 \n\
    also puts big emphasis to enhancement of those two sectors. \n \nAgriculture is\
    \ just one of the many water users but with more than 80 percent of water \nwithdrawal\
    \ in the Lower Mekong countries.  Therefore agriculture is sometimes \naccused\
    \ that it is primarily responsible for potential or substantial water dispute\
    \ with \nother sectors.  In response to increasing demand from other sectors,\
    \ agriculture is \nexpected more effort to share limited water resources for equitable\
    \ access to others.  \nResponding to this concern, the MRC Secretariat designed\
    \ a project focusing on \nimprovement of irrigation efficiency. \n \nFinancial\
    \ support from the MAFF Japan has realized this IIEPF project, but for project\
    \ \nimplementation, I would also appreciate significant technical support from\
    \ FAO \nheadquarters and regional office in Bangkok.  They have provided in-kind\
    \ contribution \nthrough project designing and scheme performance appraisal. \n\
    \ \nMy appreciation would also go to member countries, NMCs and line agencies,\
    \ which \nhave assisted the Secretariat to conduct fieldwork, provided valuable\
    \ information \nincluding field data and its analysis.  Without your active involvement,\
    \ the Secretariat \n18\n \n18\nalone could have never implemented the project\
    \ smoothly.  I would again appreciate \nyour active involvement. \n \nWith all\
    \ above support by three parties, in these three years, the IIEPF project has\
    \ \ncarried out intensive field observation and, based on collected information,\
    \ prepared a \ndraft technical guidance for better water management.  Today’s\
    \ workshop aims to share \nthe project outputs, which include observation and\
    \ analysis by member countries and a \nguidance drafted by the consultant team.\
    \ \n \nDue to delay of some activities, the technical guidance we could provide\
    \ today is only \nthe first version of the draft and it would need your constructive\
    \ and critical comments \nfor more improvement.  However because of time and budget\
    \ limitation, we may not \nhave another occasion to meet together to discuss its\
    \ next version.  Therefore I would \nhighly appreciate your idea/opinions/comments\
    \ for further improvement today.  Your \nideas for any improvement proposed today\
    \ will be appropriately incorporated through \nthe finalization process, which\
    \ the Secretariat together with the consultant continues to \nwork on.  We would\
    \ promise to share the finalized document with all of you once \ncompleted. I\
    \ believe that with your active participation our workshop will be successful.\
    \    \n \nThank you very much for your kind attention  \n \n \n \n19\n \n19\n\

    \ from the MRC member countries, \nLadies and Gentlemen, \n \nIt is my honour\
    \ to share time with you today at the second regional workshop of the \nIIEPF\
    \ project, which has been funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and\
    \ \nFisheries Japan since 2005.  On be half of the Government of Japan, I would\
    \ like to \ndeliver a few remarks on this occasion. \n \nAs OIC Mr. Hung also\
    \ mentioned in his opening remarks, the Japanese Government is \nkeen to support\
    \ the development of the Mekong region through both bi-lateral and \nmulti-lateral\
    \ channels.  One visible example of Japan’s recent initiative is “Japan-\nMekong\
    \ Foreign Ministers' Meeting” held in January this year in Tokyo.  Through this\
    \ \nmeeting, we have identified numerous “candidate projects for the Cambodia-Lao\
    \ PDR-\nViet Nam development triangle” and confirmed stable cooperation between\
    \ Japan and \nthree countries by a memorandum signed by ministers.  Identified\
    \ projects are to be \nimmediately funded by the Japan- ASEAN Integration Fund\
    \ (JAIF) once feasibility is \nconfirmed. \n \nAs a list of the candidate projects\
    \ includes transportation, agriculture & community \ndevelopment, hydropower,\
    \ health care & water supply, and education, the Japanese \ngovernment has acknowledged\
    \ pro-poor development is still one of the key challenges \nin this region.  In\
    \ this line, our government keeps steady support in agricultural \ndevelopment\
    \ in association with the MAFF, JICA and other governmental bodies. \n \nThe MAFF\
    \ is especially active in land and water resources development in agriculture.\
    \  \nIt has started to provide trust fund to the MRC since 1998 and by now it\
    \ has kept stable \ncontribution year by year.  Its third series of contribution\
    \ focuses on irrigation water use, \nwhich is the current project – IIEPF.  The\
    \ MAFF still understands effective water \nmanagement for irrigation which requires\
    \ further challenges in the region, it has \npledged continuous support to the\
    \ MRC with similar theme and budget size since 2008 \nat the annual consultation\
    \ meeting this year.  I would share this pleasant information \nwith you on this\
    \ occasion. \n \nComing back to the IIEPF project, I would say that water is fundamental\
    \ asset for \nagricultural production, however with growing demand by population\
    \ and industry in \nthe world and also in this region, it is facing competition\
    \ with other sectors or even \nsometimes among different crops.  In order to contribute\
    \ solving this situation, the \n20\n \n20\nIIEPF project has started three years\
    \ before aiming to provide technical guidance for \nmore efficient irrigation\
    \ water use, if I correctly understood. \n \nThe project has come to conclude\
    \ its activity to end up its designed project term.  I \nwould expect today that\
    \ the Secretariat well organizes this workshop and provides \nopportunity to share\
    \ collected information/data/knowledge/findings from the project \nactivities\
    \ with all the participants and to collect feedback putting into the project final\
    \ \noutputs.  I wish this workshop may provide significant contribution to the\
    \ project \nthrough your active participation. \n \nThank you for your attention.\

    \ and discusion\nKey findings\nThe results of field observation data analysis\
    \ \nÀ 100% of irrigation area has relied on the water from the canal \nsystem;\n\
    À There was an average of 47 m length of the canal per ha of the \ncultivated\
    \ area or 35 m length per ha in comparison to the \noverall natural area; \nÀ\
    \ The elevation of the rice crop area in the project area ranges \nfrom 0.75 to\
    \ 1.35 m+MSL, the most common area has \nelevation ranges from 0.95 to 1.15 m+MSL\
    \ (73.3%). \nTherefore, improvement of water management in the project \narea\
    \ should be taken into account this common area;\nÀ Rice is the most common crop\
    \ in the project area as it is \naccounted for more than 98.6% of the total cultivated\
    \ area \nduring three crops in 2007;\nÀ An average area for each family is 0.58\
    \ ha, and an average of \n86% of the income for the families is from the rice\
    \ cultivation;\nKey findings\nResults of surveyed crop data analysis\nÀ W-S rice\
    \ seeds in December accounted for 75% and in November 25%;\nÀ S-A rice seeds in\
    \ May accounted for 93.7%;and in June 6.3%;\nÀ W-S rice seeds in Aug accounted\
    \ for 41.3% and in September 59.7%;\nÀ The average crop length is 95 days for\
    \ W-S and S-A and about 93 days for A-\nW crop. \nÀ Highest rice yield production\
    \ is in W-S (4.93 ton/ha), the lowest yield \nproduction is in S-A (4.14 ton/ha);\n\
    À An average of seeds is 190 kg/ha for W–S, 174 kg/ha for S-A and 188 kg/ha \n\
    for A-W;\nÀ The VD20 and 3536 is considered as the dominated rice varieties of\
    \ the LHIP \nit is accounted for more than 50% of the rice cultivated area;\n\
    À Average of benefit from rice cultivation is 566 USD/ha/crop, the highest \n\
    benefit is 624 USD/ha come from A-W rice, \nÀ Average of total expenditure for\
    \ irrigation, pesticide and fertilizer is about 475 \nUSD/ha/crop;\nÀ The net\
    \ income per person is about 3.52 MVND/per or $219/person.\nÀ Farmers implimented\
    \ an average of 17 irrigated times, 6 fertilized times and 5 \nused times for\
    \ pesticides during W-S, and an average of 9 irrigated times, 4-5 \nfertilized\
    \ times and 4-5 used times for pesticides during S-A and A-W.\nKey findings\n\
    Results of monitored data analyses:\nÀ The average of CWR was 461 mm/ha/crop,\
    \ the highest CWR was \n497.0 mm/ha for W-S rice crop;\nÀ The average of CWR-Pe\
    \ was 315 mm/ha/crop, the lowest value \nwas 206 mm/ha for S-A rice crop;\nÀ The\
    \ average of IWR was 580 mm/ha/crop and the highest IWR \nwas 835 mm/ha for W-S\
    \ rice crop;\nÀ Farmer used an average of 7,799 m3/ha of water in W-S, 4,489.8\
    \ \nm3/ha in S-A and 4,448.8 m3/ha in A-W; \nÀ Total irrigation water diverted\
    \ to the system over the year 2007 in \ngravity condition was 12,172 thousands\
    \ m3 it was approximated \nequal to the TIWR of the system (12,000 thousand m3);\
    \ \n31 \n32\nKey findings\nResults of monitored data analyses:\nÀ Overall CAE\
    \ at the field level in 2007 was about 56.6%, the \nhighest CAE at the field level\
    \ was 61.5% in W-S;\nÀ Overall CAE at the system level in 2007 was about 54.5%,\
    \ the \nhighest CAE at the system level was 90.9% in W-S, the lowest \nCAE at\
    \ the system level was 30.3% in A-W;\nÀ The POW at system level in 2007 was 0.78\
    \ kg/m3 and the POW \nat the field level was 0.81 kg/m3;\nÀ Pumping is main mean\
    \ of irrigation for all rice crop in the LHIA, \nthere was only 2.5 % of the cultivated\
    \ area could get gravity \nirrigation condition for a total of 2.5 months over\
    \ the year; \nRecomendation\nÀ Some farmers took water more than two to three\
    \ times as \nneeded in comparison with the calculated crop water \nrequirement,\
    \ therefore to improve irrigation efficiency of \nthe system the basic experience\
    \ introduced to farmers may \nbe useful;\nÀ The irrigation expend is not counted\
    \ much in comparison \nwith the total expend,  therefore to extend the benefit\
    \ from \nrice cultivation to the farmers the IPM may need to \nintroduce;\nÀ This\
    \ is considered as the initial study for IIEPF for coastal \nzone in the Mekong\
    \ delta, therefore it is recommended that \na similar study could make for the\
    \ other areas in the \nMekong delta. \nTHANK YOU\nFOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION\n32\

    facilities irrigation system,\n\x99\nSecondary canal, tertiary canal and all related\
    \ structures are responsible \nby the FWUC, but main canal and main structure\
    \ are responsible by the \nPDWRAM or MOWRAM\n\x99\nAll the paddy fields in the\
    \ scheme shall have sufficient water for crop \nproduction, \n\x99\nUpper members\
    \ should allow water flow to the lower part.\n\x99\nAll committees shall have\
    \ a water allocation plan,\n\x99\nThe water allocation shall follow according\
    \ to the water allocation plan \nand also refer to the meeting,\n\x99\nThe water\
    \ utilization shall follow to the irrigation condition,\n\x99\nIf the land is\
    \ not smoothly, higher and far from the water source, this \nland has a first\
    \ priority for irrigation,\n\x99\nWhen the gate open and water flow to the paddy\
    \ field, all members \nshould wait and see until water sufficient in the field\
    \ and also look at the \nlosing of water through the dike,\n\x99\nThe members\
    \ do not have a right to open the water without permission \nfrom the committee\n\
    \x99 Total actual irrigated area:  dry season is 1452.5 ha and  \nwet season is\
    \ 2,518.37ha,\n\x99 The rainfall from February-December 2007 was 1310 \nmm,\n\x99\
    \ The average of CWR: Dry 6.87 mm/day, Wet 5.11 \nmm/day,\n\x99 The average of\
    \ percolation: Dry 2.61 mm/day; Wet \n1.71 mm/day,\n\x99 The total of land preparation\
    \ was 193.4 mm,\n\x99 The total SWR: Dry 16.12 MCM ; Wet 30.15\nAnalysis Results\
    \ and Major Finding\n45\n46\n\x99\nThe volume of water diverted to the system:\
    \ Dry  23.50 MCM;  \nWet 29.59 MCM,\n\x99\nThe volume of water delivered by system:\
    \ Dry 13.85 MCM;  \nWet 14.61 MCM,\n\x99\nConveyance efficiency: Dry  72.54% ;\
    \  Wet   84.15 %,\n\x99\nOverall project command area efficiency: Dry 72.38% ;\
    \   \nWet  86.28%,\n\x99\nThe average yield: Dry 0.371Kg/m²;  Wet 0.33 Kg/m²,\n\
    \x99\nThe water productivities: Dry 0.023 kg/m³; Wet 0.28Kg/m³.\nRecommendation\
    \ and Conclusion\n\x99 It is not expected that the data from the field observation\
    \ is \nperfect. Many troubles happened when we took the data such as \ncrab broke\
    \ the levee or dike is made a hole, water overflow into\nthe tank, there are too\
    \ much rain etc... Therefore, in the process \nof calculation, we cancel some\
    \ data or we do not take it.\n\x99 Based on the above research, we propose and\
    \ request that the \nMRC should add one or 2 year more research in order to have\
    \ \nmore data for analysis and fill some gaps that we face in the \nprevious study.\n\
    \x99From this research, we learnt and received a lot of data \nand experiences\
    \ of how to conduct water use efficiency \nfor irrigation and also this data are\
    \ very useful for the \noperation and management of irrigation system.\n\x99 In\
    \ the future, the Royal Government of Cambodia \n(MOWRAM) must strongly continuous\
    \ this research \nactivity from MRC and take  consideration on the \ncollection\
    \ of data and information related to the water \nuse in the irrigation systems\
    \ because it is very useful for \nirrigation water use efficiency, preparing water\
    \ use \nplanning, and also for operation and maintenance of \nirrigation system.\n\

    \ oriented water control is control in which  manager of irrigation canal have\
    \ \ninitiative. In open channel farmers use water within the amount which is intake\
    \ or \nconveyed. The amount of water diverted into canal have no relation with\
    \ the water \ndemand witch cause on farm fiscally. The water manager decide the\
    \ amount to divert \nor distribute by their own judgment .\nThe most simple method\
    \ to supply water is to distribute fixed discharge to each \nbranch canal . In\
    \ this method it may create water which go through in valid . To \ndecrease ineffective\
    \ water the water manager must estimate water demand correctly \n. It is difficult\
    \ to estimate water demand . In Japan there are three method to estimate \nwater\
    \ demand practically . As special case , the water manager operate to irrigate\

    \ irrigation water use \nOutline\n1. Water allocation \n1.1 Seasonal Irrigation\
    \ plan \n Seasonal irrigation plan determines crop, crop area, irrigation period\
    \ and \nirrigation water delivery for the coming irrigation season to ensure the\
    \ reliable \nwater supply, based on careful studies of water resources, water\
    \ requirement, and \nother related factors. Present and future water resources\
    \ are allocated into \nirrigation use and other uses in the plan. \n1.2 Procedure\
    \ of planning \nSeasonal irrigation plan should be determined earlier enough before\
    \ irrigation \nseason starts. Water users such as farmers are involved to decision\
    \ making \nprocess of this plan. Procedure of planning is informed stakeholders\
    \ in advance.  \nFirst related factors are investigated and draft of irrigation\
    \ plan is made by \nirrigation managers. The draft becomes the irrigation plan\
    \ after agreement of the \nmeeting which reflects water users will.    \n1.3 Investigations\
    \ \nPresent available water volumes such as reservoir storage are measured and\
    \ \nhistorical meteorological and water use data are collected to estimate available\
    \ \nwater.  Farmers and land situation are also surveyed. It is necessary to know\
    \ water \nusers will about water allocation.\n1.4 Estimation available water and\
    \ irrigation water demand \nAvailable water is estimated by present available\
    \ water, expected water resources \nin the next irrigation season, water use for\
    \ other purpose such as municipal water \nand water volume which should be remained\
    \ at the end of next irrigation season. \nIrrigation water demand are estimated\
    \ by crop water requirement and effective \nrainfall.\n1.5 Calculation of the\
    \ seasonal irrigation plan \nThe seasonal irrigation plan is calculated after\
    \ comparing estimated available \nwater and irrigation water demand calculated\
    \ by a  temporal plan.  When the \nformer is less than the latter at any period\
    \ of next irrigation season, a temporal \nplan must be revised as for cultivated\
    \ crop, irrigated area, crop establishment, The \nstaring date of irrigation.\
    \ Once irrigation plan become feasible, irrigation area, \nirrigation period,\
    \ cultivated crop and there are, irrigation water are determined.        \n1.6\
    \ Optimal reservoir operation \nWhen reservoirs are large enough to keep water\
    \ storage beyond one irrigation \nseason, estimation of reservoir storage change\
    \ is estimated for a longer period.    \n1.7 Allocation of irrigated area \n62\n\
    62\nWhen available water is not enough to irrigated whole irrigable area for crops\
    \ \ndesired by farmers, irrigated area or cultivated crops is limited. Such a\
    \  limitation \nshould be owed by related farmers equally.  It is desirable to\
    \ concentrate the \nirrigated area in order to reduce non-productive consumption.\
    \ \n1.8 Area water level control \nWater can be distributed evenly if irrigation\
    \ project area is very flat and canals \nhave enough capacity. Target water levels\
    \ are decided  in these irrigation projects \nat some points and in some periods\
    \ instead of canal flow rate. Target water level \ndepends on the location of\
    \ irrigation project. Intrude flood water, area water \nconsumption are estimated\
    \ for the next irrigation season. \n1.9 Announcement \nThe seasonal irrigation\
    \ plan is informed to water users to allow them to prepare \nfor the next irrigation\
    \ season through organizations or mass media. \n2. Water distribution \n2.1 Irrigation\
    \ scheduling \nWater supply is determined at a certain period, reflecting water\
    \ demand change, \nclimate or other related factors. Water scheduling determined\
    \ the water supply at \nany canal level. \n2.2 Determination of irrigation scheduling\
    \  \nWater scheduling are decided by monitoring, field survey or ordering. \n\
    2.3 Interval \nIt is desirable to establish daily irrigation scheduling to increase\
    \ irrigation \nefficiencies. It should be examined at lease twice a month.   \n\
    2.4 Monitoring and Procedure \nRainfall, water supply, and river flows to reservoirs,\
    \ at intake points and at \ndrainage canals are measured. Standing water depth\
    \ of field, crop stage and actual \ncrop area are useful for irrigation scheduling.\
    \ When ordering system are adapted, \nwater users requests are gathered.\n2.5\
    \ Continuous water supply and intermitted water supply \nIn selection water supply\
    \ method disadvantage and advantage are compared. \nGenerally intermitted (on-off\
    \ ) irrigation reduce water loss at tertiary canals and \ncontinuous water supply\
    \ are adapted in the main canal. \n2.6 Food introduction \nIf there is available\
    \ water, water is taken into canal system above water demand in \nthe irrigation\
    \ project which suffer from water shortage, which may be stored \npaddy fields,\
    \ canals or ponds. \n2.7 Reservoir operation \n63\n63\nWhen reservoir storage\
    \ go lower than planed level in the irrigation season, water \nsupply may be reduced.\
    \ \n3 Canal operations \n3.1 Canal operation and spill \nCanal system is operated\
    \ in order to deliver water to the field with reducing spill \nfrom main or secondary\
    \ canals \n3.2 Operation of turnout works \nIt is desirable to operate turnout\
    \ works to control flow rate for gravity irrigation \nsystem. But operation type\
    \ of turnout works depends on measurement system. \nWhen flow rates are not measured\
    \ water level control or mixed control are \nadapted.\n3.3 Operation of cross\
    \ regulator \nCross regulators are operated in upstream control or downstream\
    \ control. It \ndepends on the physical and social situations.\n3.4 Communication\
    \ \nOperators should to communicated to reduce spill from main and secondary canal\
    \ \n4. Water management of the tertiary canal \n4.1 Water users association \n\
    Water users association acts a important role to reduce excess water intake at\
    \ \ntertiary canal level. Water users upstream apt to take much water than needed,\
    \ \nwhich results in increasing water demand at the turnout works to tertiary\
    \ canals. \nMutual monitoring or rules among water users in the tertiary canal\
    \ is useful to \nreduce such actions.   \n4.2 Special treatment \nThe authorized\
    \ one water managers operations of turnouts from tertiary canal to \nindividual\
    \ farmers farm plots decrease water loss which generated by each water \nusers\
    \ operations. Since this operation deprive water users of their own wager \nmanagement,\
    \ the water managers operation would be limited in severe water \nshortage period.\n\
    4.3 Rotation between tertiary \nInequity on water delivery is serious when water\
    \ supply is not enough to the canal. \nOn-off irrigation supply is one method\
    \ to reduce the inequity on water delivery. \nWhen water users association dose\
    \ not function well, rotation between tertiary \ncanals is recommended to reduce\
    \ inequity. \n4.4 Plot to plot irrigation \nSometimes there are some conflicts\
    \ between water users in plot to plot irrigation. \nArrangement of water manager\
    \ or leader of village can resolve these conflicts. It \n64\n64\nis important\
    \ for water users to recognize the irrigation flow route to corporate \neach other.\n\
    5. Institution \n5.1 Water right system \nWater right system is important to resolve\
    \ conflicts between upstream and down \nstream water users at a tributary. \n\
    5.2 Restriction of land use \nDistributed irrigated are results in reduction of\
    \ irrigation efficiencies. Restriction \nof land use may prevent the generation\
    \ of distributed irrigated area. \n5.3 Water quality protection rule \nWater is\
    \ circulated within tidal irrigation area, which cause high irrigation \nefficiencies\
    \ and degradation of water quality. Sometimes water in internal canals \nis drained\
    \ to keep water quality, which volume should be diverted to the area. \nWater\
    \ quality control can reduce the additional water demand. \n5.4 Re-plotting system\
    \ in land consolidation \nRe-plotting system is useful to facilitate the construction\
    \ of tertiary canals. \n6. Improvement of physical structures \n6.1 Regulation\
    \ reservoir \nRegulation reservoirs in the canal system reduce the gap between\
    \ water demand \nand water supply which is caused traveling time of irrigation\
    \ flow or delay of \ninformation. The maximum volume of regulating reservoir is\
    \ determined by the \nphysical structures of canal or river system and water demand\
    \ fluctuations. \n6.2 Cross regulator \nThere are manual gates, automatic gates\
    \ and weirs as cross regulator. The type of \ngate is determined after examining\
    \ functions, operation easiness and total costs.\n6.3 Canal system \nConstruction\
    \ of main canals or secondary canals without direct turnouts leads to \nless water\
    \ level fluctuations, which facilitate canal system operation. \n6.4 Tertiary\
    \ canal \nConstruction of  a tertiary canal enable to attain earlier water delivery\
    \  than plot to \nplot irrigation system. On the other hand, spill point from\
    \ farm plots may increase. \nThe reduction of traveling time increase irrigation\
    \ efficiencies and increase of \n65\n65\nspill points in number may decrease irrigation\
    \ efficiencies with poor water \nmanagement. Construction of tertiary canals should\
    \ be carefully examined. \n6.5 Remote monitoring and remote control system \n\
    Introduction of remote monitoring and control system reduce irrigation loss \n\
    through quick response to the change of water situation in a project.\n6.6 Automated\
    \ gate \nAutomated gate may increase water level fluctuation in poor manual gate\
    \ \nmanagements at the same hydraulics system. It is desirable to introduce \n\
    automated gate with improving manual gate operations.  \n7. Managerial and technical\
    \ aspects \n7.1 Monitoring \nReal time monitoring is useful to recognized water\
    \ demand or supply changes and \nrespond to them immediately. Long record is also\
    \ necessary for creating operation \nrules.\n7.2 Water requirement \nConcept of\
    \ water requirement estimation is same used for seasonal irrigation plan \nand\
    \ irrigation scheduling. When the same was used for irrigation project planning,\
    \ \nrelated factors, such as irrigation area, irrigation efficiencies etc. should\
    \ be revised. \n7.3 Organization \nParticipatory irrigation management is generally\
    \ contributes irrigation efficiency \nimprovement. But since some objective of\
    \ PIM activities is not to improve canal \noperation, irrigation efficiency may\
    \ be temporary decreased without appropriate \nmeasures. \n67\nWater management\

    \ before we never doing.  My request is that MRC \nshould add one or 2 more research\
    \ in order to collect \ndata from the field and fill up some gap that missing\
    \ in \nthe previous time.\nAfter making the guideline, MRC should monitor and\
    \ \napply to each country.  Ex: workshop or training….\nCambodia\nMinistry/Government\n\

    \ at least 5 \nyears research or study period.\nThe project should also study\
    \ on soil structure that is \nalso impact on water efficiency.  Moreover the project\
    \ \nshould analyse on the comparison of the cost of wet and \ndry season yield.\n\

    Technical official\n2\n4\n4\n3\n3 The working team is willing and has intention\
    \ to \ndisseminate knowledge gaining from the project.\nUnfortunately, the important\
    \ equipment like velocity \ninstrument and etc are requested to return to MRC\
    \ \nimmediately.  Thai budget allocated is quite limited and \nis not set to first\
    \ priority to proved such instruments.\nHow will knowledge be disseminated and\
    \ demonstrated \nproperly?\nTo improve irrigation efficiencies needs both structural\
    \ \nand non-structural method.  The project emphasised to \nimprove irrigation\
    \ efficiencies using non-structural \nmethod.  However trying to operate hydraulics\
    \ structure \nwithout cooperation with farmers, and others may not \nreach the\
    \ goal.  In addition, some hydraulic structures at \npilot area are mul-function\
    \ or improper working which \nabsolutely affect to irrigation efficiency.\n1.\
    \  To disseminate knowledge concerning participatory \nirrigation water management\
    \ is very important therefore \nthe project should support or contribute to training,\
    \ \nseminar and etc.\n2.  Some necessary instruments should provide to the \n\
    project in order to expand the area and try to improve \nirrigation efficiencies.\n\
    for 1.\nSustainable development needs the participation of \nstakeholders.  It\
    \ is not only to do the irrigation efficiency \nexperiment, collect data, etc,\
    \ but also awareness raising \nconcerning water as economic goods and vulnerable\

     \n \n6 | P a g e  \n \n1. Background \n \nIdeas behind this activity \n \nExpansion \
    \ of  irrigation  is  considered  as  one  of  the  important  development  opportunities \
    \ for  the  Lower \nMekong Basin (LMB). Nevertheless, irrigation is notorious for tail‐ender problems, incomplete network, users’ \n\
    low satisfaction with water delivery, low rate of fee collection, poor maintenance, and early deterioration, on \n\
    the other hand. It is important to make sure irrigation projects can address these issues. Solutions have been \n\
    debated on both engineering and sociological measures such as system improvement and modernisation and \n\
    participation of water users at all stages of irrigation development. Smaller scale projects and groundwater \n\
    use are also discussed as alternatives of large scale canal construction. As irrigation projects deal with natural \n\
    settings and rural societies that are different from place to place, it is obvious that a panacea is not available.  \n\
     \nLike  other  infrastructure  projects,  irrigation  projects  require  the \
    \ hardwork  of  knowledgeable,  skilled,  and \nexperienced engineers together with supporting resources and environments. Irrigation projects are often \n\
    handled by the public sector with limited involvement of engineering firms. The capacity of engineers in the \n\
    line agency and supporting environments are the key for success in these cases. \n\
     \nIn the course of developing the five‐year programme from 2011 to 2015 of the Agriculture and Irrigation \n\
    Programme  (AIP)  of  Mekong  River  Commission,  it  was  agreed  that,  “sound \
    \ feasibility  assessment  and \ncoordination across the basin realised in the irrigated agriculture” would be one of the programme’s outputs. \n\
    To deliver the aforementioned output, AIP tried to assess the needs and impacts of technical harmonisation \n\
    in irrigation planning, designing, quality controlling and performance evaluation. This document is the record \n\
    of  AIP’s  attempts  at  technical  harmonisation  in  irrigation.  Technical \
    \ harmonisation  in  this  activity  means \nensuring soundness in knowledge, skills, and practices in the course of irrigation development.    \n\
     \nAbout the workshop series \n \nThis project had several aims: profiling engineering practices and supporting environments in each country; \n\
    analysis  of  capacity  needs;  and  offering  networking  and  learning  opportunities \
    \ for  young  engineers.  An \nadditional  expectation  was  to  improve  transparency \
    \ and  nurture  mutual  trust  in  irrigation  development \nprojects  amongst \
    \ Member  Countries  (MCs).  Facilitation  of  both  technical  and  financial \
    \ support  from \ndevelopment partners into the irrigation sector is also expected through the improved transparency on the \n\
    technical capacity and process in the sector. The project was organised as a workshop series for Technical \n\
    Harmonisation in Irrigation to which three young engineers and one senior engineer, as their mentor, from \n\
    irrigation line agencies were invited. Four workshops were organised in different countries to exchange the \n\
    information  on  their  work  environments;  engineering  standards,  protocols \
    \ and  practices;  education  and \ncapacity building activities and academic work. \n\
     \nParticipants were assigned to write reports on the aforementioned topics and they made presentations on \n\
    the reports at the workshops. During the workshops, field visits to typical irrigation schemes in each country \n\
    were also organised. The four workshops were held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Luang Prabang, Lao PDR; \n\
    Kanchamaburi, Thailand; and Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.  \n \nAbout this document\
    \ \nThis  document  compiles  the  country  reports  with  a  synopsis  of  the \
    \ proceedings  of  the  workshop  series. \nChapter two contains a brief synopsis of the proceedings of the four workshops including recommendations \n\
    for follow‐up actions. Chapter three contains an overview of irrigation agencies and the irrigation project \n\
    7 | P a g e  \n \nprocess  of  the  four  countries.  This  part  was  written \
    \ by  either  AIP  staff,  based  on  interviews,  or  country \nparticipants \
    \ with  editing  by  the  AIP  staff.  Chapter  four  contains  a  kind  of  matrix \
    \ analysis  of  technical \nstandards and protocols as a way of comprehending the huge volume of standards and guidelines concisely. \n\
    The matrix was filled by the workshop participants based on given guidance. A more detailed analysis would \n\
    be necessary to understand precisely the depth of technical protocols in each plan/design target.   \n\
     \nChapter five covers college education curricula in the area of irrigation engineering and professional training \n\
    after joining the line agency. This part is a collection of reports submitted by the country teams.Chapter six is \n\
    also  composed  of  country  reports.  Though  this  part  should  discuss  historical \
    \ evolvement  of  academic \nresearch topics in each country, the Cambodian and Lao reports have limited coverage due to very limited \n\
    research  activities.  Chapter  seven  contains  discussions  on  the  follow‐up \
    \ direction  towards  establishing \nbalanced technical capacity basis in irrigation sector agencies of the four Member Countries (MCs) of the \n\
    MRC.  \n \n2. Synopsis of the proceedings \n \nItaru Minami \n \n1st workshop\
    \  \n \nThe  First  Workshop  for  Technical  Harmonisation  for  Irrigation \
    \ was  held  in  Phnom  Penh  on  12  and  13 \nDecember  2012  with  the  participation \
    \ of  20  Member  Country  staff,  a  guest  speaker,  and  AIP  and  the \nInformation \
    \ and  Knowledge  Management  Programme  staff  of  the  MRC.  From  Member  Countries, \
    \ three \nyoung professionals and a senior mentor plus National Mekong Committee representative participated in the \n\
    workshop.  Dr  Hiroyuki  Taruyawas  was  invited  as  the  guest  speaker  from \
    \ the  National  Institute  of  Rural \nEngineering (NIRE) of Japan. The participants’ list is attached in the Annex. \n\
     \nThe objective of the workshop was to improve the capacity of irrigation departments and their technical staff \n\
    members  through  a  participatory  exercise  of  profiling  own  engineering \
    \ practices  both  in  terms  of  formal \nstandards and customary rules of thumb.  Better understanding of rationales in technical rules/standards was \n\
    also expected.   \n \nAfter the opening and self‐introduction, Mr Itaru Minami, Technical Advisor to AIP, explained the objective \n\
    and general work plan of the activity: to gather for sharing knowledge and networking, profile engineering \n\
    standards,  practices  and  topics,  and  visit  irrigation  projects  in  neighbouring \
    \ countries  as  a  participatory \nexercise.   \n \nNext  came  Dr  Taruya’s \
    \ keynote  speech  about  technical  harmonisation  in  canal  systems  focusing \
    \ on  the \ndiagnosis process of canal system performance. He discussed different hydraulic features, control methods, \n\
    and rules of control of water controlling facilities and their impacts on canal function and performance.  \n\
    Following the keynote, participants from the four countries were regrouped into three international groups \n\
    and exchanged information on their organisations, working environment, rules, and practices in accordance \n\
    with given questions. The lists of questions are attached in Annex, and the answers are compiled in the next \n\
    chapter.  Participants were requested to complete the questionnaire by the 2nd workshop. \n\
     \n \n8 | P a g e  \n \n2nd workshop  \n \nA three‐day workshop including a one‐day field trip took place in Luang Prabang from 5 to 7 March 2013. The \n\
    same groups were invited from the Member Countries although Cambodia replaced the whole group.  One \n\
    guest  speaker  from  the  Cambodian  Agricultural  Value  Chain  (CAVAC)  project \
    \ of  AusAID  and  NIRE,  Japan, \njoined  the  workshop.  In  this  workshop, \
    \ participants  exchanged  information  on  the  situation  of  technical \ncodes, manuals, and guidelines of each country; learnt about the CAVAC project and transitional hydraulic \n\
    experiments  in  open  channel  systems;  and  visited  a  nearby  small  scale \
    \ irrigation  project  in  a  beautiful \nmountainous setting.   \n \nOn the 1st day, the AIP team presented the analysis of engineering protocols of Thailand and Viet Nam. In the \n\
    group  discussion,  participants  discussed  water  productivity  measurement \
    \ and  drainage  calculation,  risk \nmanagement in pipelines, stability of weirs, standards for testing, etc., flow measurement experience and \n\
    mechanical stability of channel banks. \n \nDr  Taruya  lectured  about  transitional \
    \ hydraulics,  its  absence  in  design  manuals,  potential  damages  to  be \n\
    caused by hydraulic transition, and posed a question on the phenomenon that made scours just below a \n\
    division  culvert  by  showing  movies  of  several  hydraulic  transitions. \
    \   Responding  to  Dr  Taruya’s  question, \nparticipants questioned about the protection design and discussed the importance of drop structures.   \n\
    Viet Nam and Thailand also presented the overview of technical protocols in irrigation planning, legal and \n\
    institutional systems related to irrigation projects, feasibility study systems, farmers’ participation process, \n\
    EIA institutions, classification of project types, land acquisition rules, etc.      \n\
     \nOn day two, Mentors’ comments on the role of institutions and individuals related to the use of standards \n\
    and manuals in irrigation planning started the day and were followed by presentations from Thailand and \n\
    Viet Nam on practice and issues of design and construction management. The issue of earth and lined canal \n\
    bank failures and the use of design software were introduced, too. Following a short lecture on open channel \n\
    hydraulics, country presentations were made by Viet Nam and Thailand on design protocols for pipelines and \n\
    diversion  structures,  technical  protocols  and  examples  of  pipelines  projects. \
    \ The  examples  included  a \ncompensation pipeline irrigation project, in which a pump and pipeline system was introduced to irrigate \n\
    upland fields. The project was relocated from a reservoir site in the lowland.   \n\
     \nMr. Oung Ponnaka of CAVAC presented the system of CAVAC project and strict technical guidelines of AusAID \n\
    and an overview of technical protocols in irrigation project in Lao PDR followed.      \n\
    The afternoon started with group discussions and reporting on the difficulties in design, implementation and \n\
    operations based on the findings from country presentations. Topics included difficulty in evaluation of staff \n\
    performance, difficulty of identification of technical failures and solutions, public participation process, lack \n\
    of  legal  framework,  compensation  for  land  owners,  disagreement  between \
    \ plans  and  real  topography, \nconfliction over water in the operation stage, water shortage, limitation of budgets, etc.  \n\
    To close the workshop, a panel discussion amongst Mentors was held.  To the question on desired roles and \n\
    capacities of irrigation engineers in the public sector, Mentors gave the following suggestions: \n\
    • \nto give reasons/rationales for engineering decisions and actions, \n• \nto \
    \ be  compliant  with  rules  and  regulations  related  to  land  acquisition, \
    \ EIA,  and  water  resources \nassessment and other existing technical protocols, \n\
    • \nto assess foreign and proposed technical codes,    \n• \nto facilitate public relations and stakeholder participation, \n\
    • \nto digest complex problems and organise information,   \n• \nto offer technical solutions,  \n\
    9 | P a g e  \n \n• \nto share technical information with the international community, and \n\
    • \nto be a best professional at least in some technical subject.   \n \nThe second question was the direction of technical codes, standards, and manuals in the era of technical \n\
    outsourcing, proliferation of commercial software, and globalization. Views presented by Mentors were as \n\
    follows: \n• \nthe key is continuous research, case studies, field application tests of new and foreign technical codes \n\
    and the feedback process. \n• \nkeeping in mind the purpose of better safety and economic efficiency, technical standards must develop \n\
    further. \n• \nbeing aware of new technical options, which can be mostly developed by the private sector, we have to \n\
    learn and test their value in terms of life cycle benefit and costs.     \n \n\
    Dr  Taruya  also  commented  about  the  universality  of  the  natural  science \
    \ and  hoped progress  in  technical \nstandards in irrigation engineering towards universal arts.   \n\
     \nDay Three: Field Visit \n \nParticipants visited a small‐scale gravity canal system that draws water from a weir on a perennial stream \n\
    near Luang Prabang. They were welcomed by the committee members of the water user group (WUG) at a \n\
    meeting  facility  in  Munkhai  village.    After  a  question  and  answer  session \
    \ on  the  WUG  institution  and \noperations, the workshop proceeded to a weir built in a rapid stream and walked along an earth canal built \n\
    along the mountain slope.  The participants were assigned with writing an overview of college education and \n\
    professional training in the area of irrigation engineering.  \n \n3rd workshop\
    \ \n \nA  three‐day  workshop  including  extensive  field  trips  took  place \
    \ in  the  Kanchanaburi  Province  of  Thailand \nfrom 18 to 20 June 2013 with 20 Member Country representatives and two guest speakers from NIRE of \n\
    Japan  and  JICA  Cambodia.  Three  participants  from  Cambodia  supported  by \
    \ JICA  also  joined  this  time.  \nParticipants learnt about irrigation in the Province and surrounding areas from the Regional Irrigation Office \n\
    13 of Royal Irrigation Department; exchanged information on  relevant college education and professional \n\
    training programmes available in  each  country; tackled with basic technical \
    \ exercises for a brush‐up; and \nvisited many irrigation structures, an innovative agricultural project and a water user group in the area.  The \n\
    workshop started with presentations from Thailand on water resources systems in the Mae Klong River basin, \n\
    national electric grid systems, and the RID’s Regional Irrigation Office 13 and its development and operations \n\
    and maintenance projects.  \n \nThe country presentations on college education and professional training are contained in Chapter Five. \n\
    The field visit included Mae Klong Dam, which was a multi‐purpose barrage, several headworks including a \n\
    pump  station,  division  gates  including  simple  sluices  and  constant  head \
    \ orifice  gates,  and  extensive  lined \nirrigation canal systems. Participants also met a water user organisation and interviewed the members on \n\
    their institutions and operations and exchanged views on farming.   \nOn  the \
    \ next  day,  the  whole  workshop  moved  to  Srinagarind  Dam,  a  multi‐purpose \
    \ rock‐filled  dam. \nParticipants received detailed explanation on the pump/generator systems in the dam. After visiting the dam \n\
    facilities, the workshop continued in the meeting facility in the lake side to complete technical exercises. The \n\
    technical exercise included 1) a basin water budgeting exercise with free tank model optimiser software, 2) \n\
    slope  stability  assessment  by  demonstration  software:  Slope  2000,  and \
    \ 3)  an  exercise  to  determine  bulb \n10 | P a g e  \n \nopening for target water distribution in a piped network system with Excel based software. At the end of the \n\
    workshop,  participants  were  assigned  to  write  a  report  on  the  historic \
    \ evolvement  of  academic  research \ntopics in select areas such as hydrology, hydraulics and soil mechanics.   \n\
     \n4th workshop \n \nA two‐day workshop including a field trip to the Go Cong Project in the Mekong Delta was held in Ho Chi \n\
    Minh  City,  Viet  Nam  from  17  to  18  March  2014  with  the  same  young \
    \ engineers  from  the  four  Member \nCountries. The keynote presentation was given by Dr Nguyen Nghia Hung of the Southern Institute of Water \n\
    Resources  Research  about  the  historical  development  and  emerging  issues \
    \ of  irrigation  systems  in  the \nMekong  Delta.  Dr  Hung  explained  about \
    \ the  extensive  channel  and  dike  network  systems,  relationship \nbetween the dike height and crop choice, costs and benefit of maintaining the system, and such system risks \n\
    as  upstream  development  and  alteration  of  hydrology,  sea  water  intrusion, \
    \ sedimentation  and  nutrition \ncontrol, etc. The keynote was followed by AIP’s short presentation on the scope and purpose of the activity \n\
    and another presentation on the agricultural land use in the Mekong Delta by the Sub‐national Institute of \n\
    Agricultural Planning. \n \nThe  rest  of  the  first day  was  spent  for  country \
    \ reports  on  the  evolvement of  research  topics  in the area \nrelevant to irrigation engineering. The Cambodian team introduced an application of distributional hydrologic \n\
    model, studies on the hydrological implications of Angkor temples, study on the sources of different types of \n\
    soils, GIS/GPS application to identify land owners, etc.   \n \nThe Thai team reviewed fifty studies of national irrigation institutes covering the last twenty years.  Topics in \n\
    hydraulics included studies on flow arrival time in open channels, studies on hydraulics of control structures \n\
    with  physical  modelling,  and  studies  on  sand  flushing  by  fluidisation. \
    \ Topics  on  soil  mechanics  included \nchanges  in  CBR  values  in  relation \
    \ with  soil  moisture  and  relationship  between  the  cohesion  and  sheer \n\
    resistance  values  gained  via  direct  sheer  tests  and  tri‐axial  compression \
    \ tests.  Topics  on  construction \nmanagement also covered interesting research work on soil mechanics: treatment of sandy soil, dispersive \n\
    soil, expansive soil, and lateritic soil as a construction material by mixing additives and chemicals.     \n\
    Topics  on  concrete  structures  covered  studies  on  the  impact  of  additives \
    \ and  substitutes  such  as  steel \nfurnace slug and fly ash on the concrete qualities.  Research work in the area of hydrology included statistic \n\
    studies on precipitation and floods, run‐off analyses, as well as application of stochastic models to simulate \n\
    weather events. Prototype developments of wicket gate and flow‐driven pump, studies on the impact of to \n\
    algae propagation on water quality, studies on Bentonite application to farm soil were also introduced. \n\
    The Thai team also reported on the results of the questionnaire survey and discussion of researchers about \n\
    research priorities and directions.   \n \nThe  Lao  team  presented  the  historic \
    \ review  of  the  change  in  engineering  practices  including  the  use  of \n\
    standards, mathematical methods, and software.  According to the Lao team, academic research is not done \n\
    in the relevant areas. The irrigation science research centre opened in 2013 focusing on irrigation efficiency, \n\
    system cost comparison, pump cost reduction, etc. \n \nThe Viet Nam team described that research topics in hydrology from 1990 to 2000 were focused on crop \n\
    choices  for  the  given  meteo‐hydrological  conditions,  which  shifted  to \
    \ studies  on  the  impact  of  irrigation \nsystem construction on the meteo‐hydrological conditions after 2000 and towards climate change impacts \n\
    after  2005.  About  the  construction  and  infrastructure  management,  the \
    \ topics  evolved  around  the \nmodernisation of irrigation systems applying SCADA, GIS, and dynamic hydraulic models. Recent topics centre \n\
    on  climate  change  impact  assessment  and  policy  recommendation  with  regard \
    \ to  the  land  use  and \n11 | P a g e  \n \nmanagement  of  Cuu  Long  Delta \
    \ systems.  On  the  area  of  hydraulics,  the  history  of  hydraulic  model \n\
    development  and  its  application  in  the  Red‐Thai  Binh  river  system  was \
    \ presented.  The  hydro‐dynamic \nmodelling started from one dimensional VRSAP model and shifted to MIKE in 1993, then to HEC since 2010.  \n\
    The programme language also changed from Fortran to DOS and to Visual Basic.  Though the latest model has \n\
    capacity  to  simulate  not  only  flow  but  also  water  quality  and  sediment \
    \ transport,  updating  river  bed \ntopography data is the constraint.  \n \n\
    Topics on soil mechanics included land slide susceptivity assessment based on Bayesian probability models, \n\
    identification  of  active  depth  of  soil  consolidation  and  relationship \
    \ between  soil  strength  and  load  and \nconsolidation  time,  examination \
    \ of  the  effectiveness  of  slope  reinforcement  methods  and  materials, \n\
    application of slope stability software. Design of self‐compacting concrete with local materials such as fine \n\
    sand  and  design  of  roller  compacted  concrete  were  introduced  as  the \
    \ focal  issues  related  to  concrete \nstructure.   \n \nFeedback on the workshop\
    \ series \n \nAfter the four workshops, participants commented by and large positively on the value of the activity.  Their \n\
    feedback comments were the following: \n• \nThe programme strengthened capacity of technical officials and was good to exchange experience.  \n\
    • \nThis activity made Member Countries closer and contributed to the mood for increased cooperation. \n\
    • \nThe irrigation sector should work together having development needs and pressing issues like climate \n\
    change and utilisation of the single source of water. \n• \nKnowledge on irrigation modernisation makes officials aware of research needs. \n\
    • \nField visits in other countries and learning structures in details and various types of irrigation schemes \n\
    were especially useful. \n• \nMany research documents from Thailand and Viet Nam are useful for Lao PDR to improve the knowledge \n\
    and skills. \n• \nIt was good to learn from mentors with experience. \n• \nIt is good to have a network of the participants and participants would like to keep in touch. \n\
     \nThere were also suggestions on follow‐up actions that follow. \n• \nCase studies can be learnt together in the future. \n\
    • \nMore practical technical training on new software and tools is expected.   \n\
    • \nWater resources management strategy can be exchanged. \n• \nVisits to outside the LMB such as Japan can be interesting. \n\
    • \nLet’s choose three prototype to visits from each country together with software study and discussion on \n\
    lessons on specific cases towards joint monitoring of water use and irrigation operations  \n\
    • \nMore activities to exchange experience each other are desired. Similar programme is expected in the \n\
    future again. \n \n \n \n12 | P a g e  \n \n3. Irrigation agencies: overview \n\
    \ \nThis chapter aims at providing an overview of the public irrigation sector in each Member Country based on \n\
    the answers given by the workshop participants to a questionnaire. Some countries gave detailed \n\
    information on each of the questions, but the answers of other countries were quite succinct.  Therefore, \n\
    only the common overview and key differences are discussed below. More detailed information may be \n\
    found in the general profiles in Annex, which contain information based on the notes submitted by each \n\
    country.   \n \nThe following nine items and sub questions under each item are inquired to the country teams.  \n\
    1.  Situations of higher education \n2.  Career path of irrigation engineers \n\
    3.  Relationship with relevant disciplines/technical fields  \n4.  Budget and accounting systems \n\
    5.  General protocols of irrigation projects \n6.  Procedures for water resources management \n\
    7.  Participation and cost sharing \n8.  Design codes and manuals  \n9.  Irrigation design/planning  \n\
     \n1.  Situations of higher education in the area of irrigation engineering \n\
    The situation of scientific training in the relevant subjects and the process and institutions for professional \n\
    skills development are among most apparent disparities between the Member Countries. All four countries \n\
    claim to have institution(s) that teach college level curriculum on irrigation engineering, but the Irrigation \n\
    College of Lao PDR may not reach the level, and ITC of Cambodia barely fulfils it. Irrigation Agencies in three \n\
    countries also offer some training to staff engineers, but information was not given from Lao PDR. \n\
    In terms of the width and quality, staff training in Royal Irrigation Department (RID) of Thailand seems to be \n\
    the best, and Ministry of Water Resource and Meteorology (MOWRAM) of Cambodia follows. Both Thailand \n\
    and Viet Nam have a professional association. Cambodia also has one, but government engineers usually do \n\
    not participate. Thailand also requires license to practice engineering skills as profession, but other country \n\
    do not.  \n \n2.  Career path of irrigation engineers in the government \nEntrance and admission systems are similar. All countries conduct written exam on the knowledge on civil \n\
    and agricultural engineering and interview. But the only RID of Thailand and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural \n\
    Development (MARD) of Viet Nam seem to have established systematic career paths based on professional \n\
    skills, experiences and performance as well as transparent process for promotion. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, \n\
    transfers between the Ministry headquarters and provincial offices are also rare.     \n\
     \n3.  Relationship with relevant disciplines/technical fields  \nThailand and Viet Nam have in‐house specialists in all the relevant disciplines. Cambodia’s MOWRAM \n\
    implements irrigation projects forming Project Management Unit/Office collecting necessary staff from its \n\
    departments and other Ministries such as MAFF. Lao PDR’s Department of Irrigation (DOI) of the Ministry of \n\
    Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) seeks agronomists and agricultural economists in other departments under \n\
    MAF offering incentives. DOI also relies hydrological work such as water resources assessment on Ministry of \n\
    Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) due to the recent reform of government agencies.       \n\
      \n \n13 | P a g e  \n \n4.  Budget and accounting systems for irrigation projects \n\
    Annual budget is around US$6‐8 million in Lao PDR, $100 million in Vietnam, $250 million in Cambodia and \n\
    $1700 million in Thailand. Most of the Cambodia’s budget is foreign finance and that of Thailand comes from \n\
    national treasury.  The budget of Thailand includes those for RID, Department of Water Resources (DWR) and \n\
    Department of Groundwater Resources (DGR).  In all countries, annual budget is allocated from general \n\
    account.   \n \n5.  General protocols of irrigation projects \nThailand and Lao PDR have a specific law on the irrigation project process. Procedures of irrigation projects \n\
    are also legalized in Viet Nam.  In Cambodia, sub decrees that define concrete rules with regard to water \n\
    resources management is under the approval process. Matters related irrigation project process such as roles \n\
    and authorities of Farmer Water User Communities (FWUC) are included in one of the sub decrees. In general, \n\
    the project process starts from local authority that collects people’s need and submits a petition to upper \n\
    authorities. The screening process in the Ministry headquarters include benefit cost analysis and economic \n\
    rate of return as well as various levels of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a general practice.  \n\
    However, threshold condition that triggers these processes is different. For example, EIA is required for large \n\
    scale projects, but the definition of large scale is different. Benefit cost analysis is not required in Cambodia \n\
    for the projects financed by grant aid or national treasury budget.  \n \n6. \
    \ Procedures for water resources management \nAll countries have the water resources law.  In Thailand, there is no single law that stipulates principles or \n\
    processes to establish water right. It is widely believed in the agriculture sector that law secures water users’ \n\
    right to maintain water diversion from rivers once they have established weirs and canals, but it is not clear in \n\
    the Water and Water Resources Law and its sub‐decree. Fishermen’s right is defined in Lao PDR, Thailand and \n\
    Vietnam. In Cambodia, it is resolved in the resettlement unit, in which various conflicts between government \n\
    and locals are handled. Minimum water level is measured as the 10% probability water level in dry seasons in \n\
    Lao PDR and Thailand. The level depends on the design standards in Viet Nam.   \n\
     \n7.  Participation and cost sharing \nParticipation of water user associations has become a norm in all four countries. Participation and public \n\
    consultation is required in all stages of project cycle in Thailand. It is still in a pilot stage in Cambodia as \n\
    already seen in 5.  Cost sharing schemes are different in each country.  Sharing of construction cost between \n\
    farmers and the government is tried only in a few pilot schemes in medium and large scale irrigation projects \n\
    in Thailand.  For operations and maintenance, there is a once‐and‐for‐all gift of 5000 Baht (approx. $150) \n\
    from the government to each WUA after major rehabilitation, but farmers have to manage the scheme under \n\
    their control after that. In the currently discussed sub decree, cost for operations and maintenance will be \n\
    transferred from the Government to FWUC in five years gradually reducing the share of the Government. In \n\
    Lao PDR, electricity fee, O&M fee and Irrigation Fund are collected by WUA.  On the other hand, the \n\
    government determines the appropriate fee level and provides necessary services in Viet Nam.   \n\
     \n8.  Design codes and manuals \nThere are many technical references related to survey, design, electricity, hydraulics, etc. in each country. \n\
    Items common in civil structures, architecture, electricity, quality standards and testing methods of common \n\
    materials, etc. are covered by design codes and legalized standards. Structures specific to irrigation are \n\
    generally handled by design standards and manuals of irrigation agency. Therefore, their mode of \n\
    institutionalization is rather vague in Viet Nam. In Thailand, they are organized into either Work Manual or \n\
    Detailed Design Standards written in Thai language. However, Lao PDR only specifies which foreign standards \n\
    to refer to or customary refers to a set of major reference materials.  Cambodia is in the same condition.  \n\
    14 | P a g e  \n \n   \n9.  Irrigation design/planning  \nDetailed practices in planning and design work such as how to keep records, mode of communication \n\
    between designer and construction manager and who verifies the design etc. were inquired, but only \n\
    Thailand and Viet Nam responded. Difference between the two countries is found in the note keeping and \n\
    design verification. While engineers of two or more ranks verify design work in Thailand, the process is \n\
    simpler in Viet Nam relying more on consultants. On the other hand, notes on the reason for parameter \n\
    choice etc. are usually kept in Viet Nam, while Thailand does not practice note keeping.   \n\
     \n4. Technical code systems: rapid assessment \n \nThis section covers the result of a rough analysis of technical rules, manuals, and guidelines of the irrigation \n\
    sector  in  each  country.    In  the  following  sections,  “rules”  refer  to \
    \ directions  to  the  relevant  government \nengineers. Some of the rules need step‐by‐step instructions to allow readers to practice.  Such documents are \n\
    called “manuals.”  Other instructions can only be given advisory methods or steps either because of their \n\
    temporary nature, existence of options, or solely qualitative nature.  Such documents are called “guidelines” \n\
    in the following sections. \n \nThe  aforementioned  documents  related  to  irrigation \
    \ planning,  design,  construction  management,  and \noperations and maintenance are reviewed based on the answers given to three templates that contain 3 \n\
    major areas, 16 planning/design targets with 81 milestones (or sub‐process).  The three templates covers (1) \n\
    irrigation  system  planning,  (2)  hydraulic  design  and  construction  management \
    \ of  earth/lined  canals,  (3) \npipeline  and  diversion  hydraulics  and  dynamics, \
    \ respectively.    Workshop  participants  were  requested  to \nanswer the following questions consulting relevant documents:  \n\
     \nwhether  each  of  the  specified  sub‐process  (milestones)  is  covered \
    \ by  rules  (or  technical  code), \nmanual, guidelines or the combination of them \n\
     \nif  so,  which  is  the  major  content:  natural  laws  and  mathematical \
    \ models,  tables/figures/charts \nderived  from  simplified  theory,  empirical \
    \ law,  figures  and  tables  derived  from  rule  of  the  thumb, \nqualitative instructions \n\
     \nif the contents are empirical laws or rule of thumb, are they supported by local data? \n\
    Please see Annex for the original templates and answers submitted by Member Countries.  The templates \n\
    were given to the participants of the first workshop.    \n \nCambodia \n \nTechnical \
    \ protocols  were  roughly  assessed  by  the  country  team  comprised  of  the \
    \ Irrigated  Agriculture \nDepartment staff based on aforementioned common tabulated templates. The results can be summarised as \n\
    follows:  \n \nFor the majority of project planning steps, both rules and manuals are given. \n\
     \nThe same for the detailed design process of open channel system structures. \n\
     \nPipelines, pumps, and headwork design process reply more on guidelines and advisory documents.   \n\
     \nMany of hydrological, physiological, and mechanical planning/design steps are consulted with local \n\
    data and information. \n \nConstruction management and quality control processes are instructed by both rules and manuals. \n\
    15 | P a g e  \n \n \nMajority  of  the  contents  of  the  technical  rules \
    \ and  manuals  are  accompanied  with  necessary \nillustration and concrete instructions. \n\
     \nThe issues that are not covered are drainage design and river flow maintenance for fishery and the \n\
    environment. \nThough  these  are  a  good  sign  of  balanced  and  well  organised \
    \ technical  code  systems,  some  of  the \nplanning/design steps are not supported by, and would benefit from, local data that follow below: \n\
     \nAssessment of available water resources in terms of local rainfall and river flow data   \n\
     \nCost estimate, system lifecycle assessment, and economic cost benefit analysis \n\
     \nStability assessment of embankment \nThese are rather important elements of the engineering work that rely heavily on empirical knowledge and \n\
    local data. It is highly desirable to accumulate local data on hydrology, economics, and soil mechanics and \n\
    reflect them onto the contents of technical  codes and guidelines. System life cycle can be identified only \n\
    through  stock  taking  and  the  analysis  of  past  records.  However,  there \
    \ are  also  alternative  approaches. \nRainfall may be simulated from Global Climate Model and its downscaled regional climate model. River flow \n\
    is  also  simulated  from  hydrological  models.  Data  on  soil  physics  may \
    \ be  imported  from  neighbouring \ncountries after taxonomic studies. In one way or another, the Cambodian technical code system has big a \n\
    space for sand sophistication. Also awaited are systematic organisation and institutionalisation of relevant \n\
    codes, manual, and guidelines and their integration with training activities.      \n\

    \ \n16 | P a g e  \n \nLao PDR \n \nThe tabulated reports submitted by national participants show the following characteristics in the technical \n\
    protocols in the project cycle of irrigation developments in Lao PDR: \n \nAbout 85% of the \
    \ 81 steps/sub processes being asked are covered by manuals or both rules and \n\
    manuals,  which  can  be  interpreted  as  concrete  instructions  are  given \
    \ in  most  circumstances \nthroughout the planning, design, and construction processes. \n\
     \nInformal guidelines and the combination of rule and guidelines are found only for 12%, and hydraulic \n\
    design of pipeline systems and most of the mechanical design processes of channel bank belong to \n\
    this category.  \n \nThe  only  two  items  that  have  no  rule/manual/guidelines \
    \ are  about  fish  passage  design  and  non‐\nuniform flow calculation in open channels.   \n\
     \nThe majority of the contents are only tables/figures/charts without being supported by illustration or \n\
    step‐by‐step instructions. \n \nAmong the sub‐processes that lack local data are evapotranspiration (ET) and percolation, irrigation \n\
    efficiencies, and data related to soil mechanics for channel bank design. \n \n\
    From these findings, the technical institution for irrigation engineering in Lao PDR seems to have space for \n\
    improvement that includes the followings: \n \nMore support to readers/ practitioners by providing more background explanation and illustrations, \n\
     \nBroader coverage in such contents as non‐uniform flow calculation in open channels with a shape of \n\
    guidelines, and \n \nData on local soil characteristics. \n \n17 | P a g e  \n\
     \n \nFigure 2 Planning targets and type of technical protocols: Lao PDR \n \n\
    In terms of the contents of the manuals and guidelines, table/figures/charts have the majority share of 55%.  \n\
    Consequently, qualitative instructions are limited (20%).  However, some of the items that are described as \n\
    qualitative instruction had better involved quantitative rules.  Determination of target drought for planning, \n\
    and dimension and quality control are among them.  Lack of illustrations is another noticeable characteristic \n\
    of  the  technical  protocols  in  Lao  PDR.  This  sounds  rather  strange  given \
    \ most  processes  are  covered  by \nmanuals, which should involve concrete and complete instructions.   \n\
      \nAs  noted  in  the  submitted  form,  USBR  standards  are  adopted  in  hydraulic \
    \ design  of  diversion  structures. \nEmpirical laws are adopted in official manuals only for cost estimates and life cycle assessment.  Rules of \n\
    thumbs are adopted only for the placement of control bulbs, buffer facilities, and monitoring/safety system \n\
    design in pipeline systems. \n \nMost processes related to open channel systems are supported by local data.  Though pipelines and pump \n\
    design do not involve many parameters that have to be supported by local data, no process is supported by \n\
    local data. Well‐established parameters may also be replaced by progress of engineering, which is made in \n\
    the field.  It is better to maintain up to date references.   \nSome of the sub‐processes or milestones related to planning, design, and construction management are not \n\
    supported  by  local  data.    Items  like  ET  and  percolation,  irrigation \
    \ efficiencies,  and  data  related  to  soil \nmechanics for channel bank design need to be determined based on local data though sheer planning and \n\
    design can be done based on figures given by FAO and USBR.   \n18 | P a g e  \n\
     \n \nOut of the 45 planning/designing steps either ruled by figures, tables, and/or charts, only 17 steps are given \n\
    their application limits or alternative methods.  Similarly, one empirical law out of 3 and no rule of thumb are \n\
    given application limits or alternatives. \n \nIllustrations and step‐by‐step type of instruction are given only for route selection, selection of conveyance \n\
    structures, and system layout process in the irrigation system planning. As manual is the dominant form of \n\
    technical protocol, readers need to follow  given instructions exactly.   In \
    \ that sense, it would be certainly \nbetter to have more illustrations and step‐by‐step instructions in those documents. \
    \ \n \nThailand \n \nThe tabulated reports submitted by national participants show the following characteristics in the technical \n\
    protocols in the project cycle of irrigation developments in Thailand: \n Engineers are provided with plural forms/levels of technical documents in most steps of the project \n\
    cycle  in  open  channel  type  irrigation  development  in  Thailand.    When \
    \ rules  are  applied  for  one \nprocess, manuals and/or guidelines always support the rule.  \n\
     Planning and design processes for pipeline systems, pump facilities, and headworks are covered less \n\
    by rules/codes or official manuals, but more by un‐binding guidelines. \n There are only two items that are supported by no rule/manual/guideline among the 81 milestones \n\
    prepared by the authors.   \n Contents of the technical documents are in many cases either figures/charts and tables or qualitative \n\
    instructions. \n Only qualitative instruction is given for construction management. \n\
     About half of all milestones are supported by local data, and only 20 items are not supported by local \n\
    data among the instruction made of empirical laws or table/charts.   \n Local data support more of planning and hydraulic design process and less of mechanical design and \n\
    construction management processes. \nFrom these findings, the technical institution for irrigation engineering looks like well developed in Thailand \n\
    at least for open channel systems.  Some issues that may need attention include:  \n\
     \nAppropriateness of using tables and charts in some of the sub‐process,  \n\
     \nPossibility to replace qualitative instructions by methods that brings quantitative answers, especially \n\
    for construction management \n \nLack of local data that support mechanical design and construction management, and \n\
     \nLack of technical instructions for the identification process of existing water users in the planning \n\
    process and drainage design. \n \nAs being described briefly, most of the project cycles are covered by plural official technical documents in \n\
    Thailand.  Therefore, it is difficult to characterise respective document forms by their contents due to the \n\
    method taken in this study.  One characteristic issue is that qualitative instruction and table/figures/charts \n\
    are the major contents.   Some of the sub‐processes/milestones that need quantitative targets are listed as \n\
    qualitative instructions.  Examples are the determination of water requirement for nursery and preparation, \n\
    design discharge of drainage channels, requirements in earth‐fill quality, and dimension and quality controls \n\
    for construction management work.  Their reasons and appropriateness should be clarified. Some of the sub‐\n\
    processes/milestones  that  are  described  as  consisting  of  tables/figures/charts \
    \ may  also  need  to  discuss \nwhether it is the most appropriate mode to define the technical protocol. For example, stability analysis of \n\
    19 | P a g e  \n \nthe canal bank is a rather complicated process that requires both soil characteristics data and a mathematical \n\
    model.  This item is not supported by local data either (pls refer to the next section).   \n\
     \n \n \nFigure 3Planning targets and type of technical protocols: Thailand \n\
    \ \nAmong  the  51  sub‐processes  that  are  characterised  as  empirical  law \
    \ or  table/figure/chart,  31  items  are \nsupported by local data.  As being shown in the following table, most of the 20 items look like no need to be \n\
    supported by local data except a few. “Stability analysis of the bank” and “examination of hydraulic stability \n\
    in transient conditions” may be the exceptions. If the standard methods in these processes are not supported \n\
    by  local  soil  data  and  water  distribution  practice,  it  can  be  a  priority \
    \ technical  theme  in  open  channel \nirrigation engineering. \nAmong  the \
    \ 51  sub‐processes  that  are  characterised  as  empirical  law  or  table/figure/chart, \
    \ 44  items  are \ndefined with their application limits or alternative methods.  The remaining seven items are not relevant to \n\
    the limitation of application.    \nAbout 90% of all sub‐processes are supported by both step‐by‐step instruction and visual aids.  However, \n\
    there  are  some  complicated  engineering  processes  that  may  benefit  from \
    \ adding  illustration  and  more \ndetailed instruction.  \n \nViet Nam \n \n\
    From a rough overview of the tabulated report from the country, technical protocols in irrigation project \n\
    cycle in Viet Nam can be summarised as follows: \n Initial  project  conceptualisation \
    \ and  paper  location  process  are  basically  instructed  by  guidelines \n\
    without being strictly given rules.  \n20 | P a g e  \n \n Surveys and processes for drawing general plans have rules. \n\
     Manual is given for hydraulic design and pipe/pump design. \n General procedural rules or qualitative instructions with technical guidelines are given for mechanical \n\
    design of open channel structures. \n Rules are given for construction management and record management. \n\
    The aforementioned system sounds rational and well organised.   \nBy looking into the contents of each of the rules and manuals, some may look arguable.  For example, rules \n\
    for  construction  management  are  described  as  qualitative  instructions. \
    \   This  was  corrected  during  the \nworkshop discussion as incomplete information because the qualitative principles given by law are actually \n\
    supplemented by ordinances by line agencies which involve quantitative quality management rules.  Other \n\
    items are mostly defined by either empirical laws based on local data or tables/charts which are mostly not \n\
    supported  by  local  data.    The  latter  items  need  a  closer  look  depending \
    \ on  the  individual  item.  \nDetermination process of irrigation demand (A3) and system planning (A4) are governed by natural laws and \n\
    not supported by local data.  This might also need some discussion because water consumption in paddy \n\
    irrigation is not simply theorised. \n \n \n \nFigure 4 Planning steps and type\
    \ of technical protocols: Viet Nam \n \nEither natural laws or empirical  laws \
    \ are the major  subjects of rules and guidelines.  On  the other hand, \nmanuals \
    \ seem  to  be  made  mostly  of  tables  and  charts,  which  should  certainly \
    \ be  taken  from  past \nexperiments  and  observation.  The  items  prescribed \
    \ with  tables/charts  are  relevant  to  hydraulic  design, \nmechanical design of pipelines and pump selection.  This sounds rather rational given that pipe and pumps \n\
    are manufactured materials.  Rules of thumbs are found only in guidelines for hydraulic design of pipelines on \n\
    three areas: buffer and maintenance facility design, choice and placing of control bulbs, design of monitoring \n\
    and safety system.  This is also conventional.   \n \n21 | P a g e  \n \nIt is highly desirable to support empirical laws with locally collected data for parameters.   Tables and charts \n\
    should also be made of locally tested data if they contain parameters relevant to natural materials.  Among \n\
    the  list  of  the  items  that  have  no  local  data,  those  for  determining \
    \ irrigation  demand,  cost  estimates, \nstructure  life  cycle,  and  quality \
    \ and  quality  control  of  fill  (soil)  materials  may  need  discussion  on \
    \ their \nappropriateness. \n \nEmpirical laws and tables/charts basically have applicable value ranges and conditions.  Three empirical laws, \n\
    three rules of thumb, and 27 tables/charts are listed as having no limit for application; however, particularly \n\
    problematic items are not found among them. Illustrations are mostly found in planning and channel design.  \n\
    Step‐by‐step instruction is available only in half of planning and design targets. \n\
     \nUnfortunately, the comparison of four country scores did not give much of definite assessment. One clear \n\
    indication was the advancement of technical rules and institutions in Thailand, because most of the project \n\
    cycles are covered by plural official technical documents. Contradicting claim is heard about the situation of \n\
    technical documents in Cambodia. That the instructions given by those documents are actually followed may \n\
    be more important than if they have been published as official documents.    \n\
     \n \n22 | P a g e  \n \n5. Capacity building activities \nScope of the chapter\
    \ \nThe  irrigation  sector  has  been  centered  on  infrastructure  development \
    \ by  government  agencies.  Proper \nplanning and management of infrastructure projects require knowledge and skills of engineering as well as \n\
    those  of  policy  science.    Because  numerous  smallholders  are  the  target \
    \ beneficiaries  and  usually  large \nexpanse of land is involved, irrigation projects typically require leading roles of government agencies in all \n\
    stages of planning, implementation, and operations/maintenance. Therefore, capacity of relevant agencies, \n\
    irrigation agency inter alia, is among the keys for success.  \n \nIrrigation agencies are typically composed mostly of civil and agricultural engineers, or supposed to be so.  \n\
    Planning  of  irrigation  schemes  must  be  supported  by  rationales  in  geology, \
    \ soil  science,  meteorology, \nhydrology, agronomy, and economics as well as by local communities and politics. For detailed design and \n\
    construction, hydraulics, mechanics and sometimes electrics also become important. Many of the roles of \n\
    officials require good understanding of the underlying science as well as skills to integrate the broad range of \n\
    relevant information. Training in a relevant engineering department in college or polytechnic is indispensable, \n\
    and formal and informal training after joining the agency is also important to nurture the needed capacity. \n\
     \nIn this chapter, country reports on college education and staff training in the area of irrigation engineering \n\
    were  summarized  with  comparative  assessment.  As  a  participatory  exercise \
    \ to  exchange  information  and \nlearn from each other, an overview report per country was written by country teams who participated in this \n\
    activity under the advice and supervision of a senior official.  The purpose of this exercise was to compare the \n\
    levels  and  width  of  training  so  that  priority  areas  and  directions \
    \ can  be  clarified  in  engineering  capacity \nbuilding. Following are the general guidelines given to the country teams. \n\
     \nThe report should cover an overview of college curricula (of a chosen college or university) and government \n\
    training programs related to the following topics: \n1.  meteo‐hydrology;  \n\
    2.  soil, plant and water relationship; \n3.  irrigation system planning;  \n\
    4.  socio‐economic survey and evaluation related to irrigation projects; \n5. \
    \ open channel hydraulics;  \n6.  soil and concrete mechanics;  \n7.  water control structure design;  \n\
    8.  construction management; \n9.  pipeline hydraulics;  \n10. pump, headworks, and control system design; and  \n\
    11. construction management, operations, and maintenance of pipeline, pump, and headwork facilities \n\
     \nThe  report  describe  each  of  the  relevant  mandatory  subjects  in  the \
    \ undergraduate  course  of  one  of  the \ndomestic  colleges/universities  that \
    \ are  recognized  to  have  courses  of  irrigation  engineering.    The  report \n\
    contains (1) the name of the college/university; and (2) the subject name, (3) concrete skills and knowledge \n\
    to be gained after completion, (4) teaching methods (such as conventional lecture, substantial laboratory \n\
    work,  substantial  computer  exercise,  substantial  fieldwork),  and  (5)  software \

    foreign aid program. \n \nSummary of findings \nLevels and width of professional education was one clear disparity among member countries. Cambodian \n\
    team listed only one institute to be the college that has curricula for irrigation engineers. Lao PDR has one \n\
    college and one department in another university. Viet Nam reports three and Thailand claims eight of which \n\
    the oldest has almost 100 years of history. Though the number is small for Viet Nam, 15 universities and 11 \n\
    colleges have education programs on water resources subjects in Viet Nam. The number and curricula of \n\
    relevant college departments are clear indicators of capacity development.  \n\
     \nThough actual contents of education in those colleges and universities were not clear from the reports, mere \n\
    curricula suggest big difference in quality among them. The best curriculum among reported was clearly the \n\
    bachelor of engineering program in civil engineering – irrigation of Kasetsart University of Thailand. It has \n\
    balance in subject areas such as material science, fluid dynamics, and structural analysis together with classes \n\
    for  such  basic  engineering  skills  as  engineering  drawing  and  surveying. \
    \ The  curriculum  contains  separate \ncourses  for  desk  studies  of  different \
    \ levels  starting  from  an  introductory  course  toward  more  advanced \n\
    courses.  It also covers laboratory work, design workshops, and more applied subjects of system design for \n\
    each of major engineering subjects. For example, there are courses on “fluid mechanics”, “laboratory for fluid \n\
    mechanics”,  “design  of  canal  and  conveyance  structures”,  and  “design \
    \ of  pipe  and  pressurized  irrigation \nsystems”. Another stream starts from “materials science for engineers” and advances through “concrete and \n\
    engineering  material”,  “mechanics  of  materials  II”,  “reinforced  concrete \
    \ design”,  “soil  mechanics”,  “soil \nmechanics  laboratory”,  “foundation \
    \ design”,  and  “design  of  small  dams  and  water  control  structures.” \
    \ In \nsuch ways, students can gradually deepen the understanding of relevant sciences and attain the capacity to \n\
    mobilize the knowledge to design simple structures, as well as wisdoms necessary for building more complex \n\
    systems.  These  are  in  line  with  the  education  that  colleges  and  universities \
    \ of  three  to  four  years  are \nexpected to offer.  \n \nThe  curriculum \
    \ sounds  fine‐tuned  for  traditional  areas  of  knowledge  and  skills  required \
    \ for  irrigation \nengineers, which must have suited for Thailand. More courses are available for irrigation students in relevant \n\
    curricula such as civil engineering – water resources engineering, which contains groundwater engineering, \n\
    land resources management, etc. However, the roles and skills required for irrigation and irrigation engineers \n\
    may shift under a different set of technology and socio‐economic conditions. It is not clear from this activity if \n\
    interdisciplinary subjects with such areas as agronomy, crop science, meteorology, remote sensing, and micro \n\
    economics are included in the curriculum.  \n \nAs being introduced earlier, three institutes in Viet Nam are recognized to have the range of courses typically \n\
    needed for irrigation engineering. Water Resources University always stays among varying lists of universities \n\
    that were reported for different subject areas. The comprehensive shape of relevant college education in Viet \n\
    Nam  was  not  clear  from  the  country  report  though  curriculum  on  hydrology \
    \ looks  quite  extensive  and \nadvanced. Like the curriculum of Kasetsart University, the hydrology curriculum contains introductory and \n\
    more advanced theory, mathematical modeling, as well as specific application subjects. Other subject areas \n\
    such  as  pipeline  hydraulics  also  involve  desk  studies  as  well  as  computer \
    \ modeling.  Unlike  the  case  of \nKasetsart University, the main scope of the curricula for irrigation engineering in Water Resources University \n\
    24 | P a g e  \n \nmay be water management in general, and it may be oriented more toward agricultural development in the \n\
    case of University of Agriculture.  \n \nUnfortunately, no other country seems to offer these levels of education. Curricula of two institutes in Lao \n\
    PDR  are  not  explained  in  the  report,  but  photos  and  equipment  list \
    \ suggests  sub‐college  level  quality  in \neducation.   \n \nThe Rural Engineering Department of Institute of Technology is the only college level education institute in \n\
    Cambodia.  Though  its  curriculum  looks  covering  all  the  relevant  subject \
    \ areas,  it  does  not  show  clear \nstructures or study paths to gain the necessary depth of understanding in each subject. Some of the courses \n\
    such as plumbing and topography are certainly not up to college level subjects. On the other hand, there are \n\
    also  subject  areas  that  have  two  to  three  levels  of  advancement.  For \
    \ example,  there  is  a  course  of \n“introduction of hydrological model” after “general hydrology.” Though it may sound a bit short cut, essential \n\
    knowledge behind models may be covered if program is structured efficiently. In the case of material science, \n\
    “strength of materials” and “soil mechanics” lead to “earth dam construction”, which is the simplest type of \n\
    dam. Another short cut is found in several “construction” courses: reinforced concrete construction, bridge \n\
    construction,  wood  construction,  and  steel  construction.  The  foundation \
    \ of  the  skills  to  design  these \nstructures can be attained in  “strength of materials” and \
    \ “structural analysis” though real skills to design \nreinforced  concrete  cannot \
    \ be  attained  without  an  additional  class.  In  other  words,  this  curriculum \
    \ is \ndesigned with an expectation of fully benefiting from recent computer software. Anther characteristics of ITC \n\
    curriculum is its coverage of such practical skills as work security and quotation and market, as well as new \n\
    technologies such as auto computer aid designing. It also covers such interdisciplinary subjects as renewable \n\
    energy and environment. Above all, this curriculum can be described as the most efficient and pragmatic \n\
    among others if it fully benefits from latest computer aids. This may suggest the direction of college curricula \n\
    for irrigation engineers. In any case, it certainly involves the risks of shallow understanding and over reliance \n\
    on computer aids, and the knowledge level to be gained from the ITC curriculum is still lower than earlier \n\
    examples.     \n \nFormal and informal training in professional carrier is as important as college education.  Difference in staff \n\
    training between Thailand and other countries suggests big potential needs for systematic staff training in \n\
    other countries. In RID of Thailand, staff engineers receive certified training courses on important and specific \n\
    engineering skills such as SCADA application and telemetering in irrigation management, calculation of crop \n\
    water requirement and water delivery scheduling, soil property evaluation, and advanced hydraulic structure \n\
    design.   \n \nComparing to this program, staff training in Vietnam looks more ad hoc and less technical. Regular training \n\
    includes  a  course  on  valuation  and  economic  estimation  in  construction \
    \ and  courses  on  operations, \nmaintenance and management of irrigation schemes, which cover topics on irrigation efficiency and farmer \n\
    participation as well as field excursions.    \n \nMOWRAM of Cambodia has an extensive training program in its Technical Service Center with a long term \n\
    support of JICA. The program contains following regular short courses: \n \n\
    Courses on subject matters include meteo‐hydrology and crop water requirement, run‐off analysis, \n\
    and hydraulic design of canal structures.  \n \nCourses  on  tools  application \
    \ include  application  of  remote  sensing  and  GIS  for  basin/irrigation \n\
    planning and irrigation design and drawing by Auto Cad. \n \nOther practical subject courses cover cost estimation of canal works, construction management and \n\
    supervision, and farmer participation. \n25 | P a g e  \n \nThough  the  above \
    \ list  looks  like  a  balanced  set  of  essential‐skill  courses,  the  combined \
    \ effect  with  the \nseemingly short‐cut curricula of college education may end up with shallow understanding, little confidence, \n\
    or  poor  applicability  to  complex  situations.  Lack  of  institutionalization \
    \ of  the  knowledge  taught  in  TSC  is \nanother issue.  No technical sub decree or standard supports the content of TSC training courses. No training \n\
    course text is published as formal guidelines.  \n \nNo information was available about staff training from the country report of Lao PDR. Thangone Irrigation \n\
    College seems to work as an institute for continued education for low class technical staff in the Department \n\
    of Irrigation.  \n \nStaff  training  that  shows  how  to  integrate  learned \
    \ science  into  project  planning,  design,  and  quality \ncontrolling  certainly \
    \ needs  attention  and  support.  On  the  other  hand,  good  foundation  of \
    \ underlying \nscientific knowledge is the premise for professional training. Findings in this chapter suggest that irrigation \n\
    engineers  in  Lao  PDR  need  better  opportunities  in  college  level  education. \
    \ Because  Lao  people  have  an \nadvantage in communication with Thai people, harmonization in college course contents between colleges in \n\
    Thailand and Lao PDR may improve the quality of education and clarify the areas that need improvement. \n\
    Cambodia may need close evaluation of the technical capability of ITC graduates or TSC course takers as well \n\
    as feedback of the evaluation result into training programs. Harmonization is also expected between formal \n\
    protocols and contents of training.  \n \nFor Viet Nam, information was not enough to make clear suggestions; however, the risk of fragmentation of \n\
    relevant  subject  areas  is  suspected  because  college  departments  that \
    \ cover  core  subjects  of  irrigation \nengineering are diverse in their scope. This can be solved if a good team work of staff is established. For \n\
    Thailand, college education has established a high standard. However, expected roles and skills of irrigation \n\
    professionals may always be changing.  There can be space for reforming, and education programs in ITC in \n\
    Cambodia  and  other  colleges  in  Viet  Nam  may  offer  a  good  model  at \
    \ least  in  particular  subjects.    Staff \ntraining may be easier to reform. Strategic development is important in staff training curricula given changing \n\
    roles of staff engineers and emerging technologies. Cambodia’s focus on GIS and remote sensing technology \n\
    has a good reason. MCs may pay more attention on hydrogeological training to fulfill IWRM mandates, too.  \n\
     \n6. Research and development \nScope of the chapter \nLike any other areas, the science and technology that forms irrigation engineering progresses year by year. \n\
    The progress contributes to work efficiency as well as quality of jobs. For example, IT and satellite data may \n\
    dramatically improve the ways of resource management and development planning. As depletion of natural \n\
    resources  also  accelerates  where  effective  management  is  absent,  research \
    \ work  in  such  areas  becomes \nmore important than ever. Needs for local or regional research work also exist in the area of construction \n\
    technology. Utilization of the natural materials special to the region and solutions of geotechnical problems \n\
    are among such subjects. Social science is certainly another area that requires local and regional research \n\
    work because many of key social capitals in rural areas are quite original to ethnic groups and geographic \n\
    spaces.  \n \nIn this chapter, country reports about the historical evolvement and recent topics of relevant research work \n\
    are summarized with comparative assessment. As already described in earlier chapters, an overview report \n\
    per country was written by country teams who participated in this activity under the advice and supervision \n\
    26 | P a g e  \n \nof a senior technical official. The main purpose of this exercise was to exchange information on research \n\
    findings  that  may  also  benefit  the  agriculture  and  irrigation  professionals \
    \ in  neighboring  countries.  As  a \nparticipatory exercise, capacity building of participants was also expected in the process.  \n\
     \nThe assignment was to review the topics of research works by public research centers and universities in the \n\
    area of civil and environmental engineering and biological system engineering related to irrigation projects.  \n\
    The  former  includes  hydrology,  hydraulics,  soil  mechanics,  concrete  structure, \
    \ remote  sensing  and \ninformation system application, and construction and infrastructure system management. The latter includes \n\
    research  work  on  field  level  irrigation  and  drainage  systems.    This \
    \ assignment  was  conducted  through \ninterviews with key faculties/figures in each research areas.  Following are the general guidelines given to the \n\
    country teams. \n \nA  report  (3000‐9000  words  in  A4  single  line  with \
    \ font  size  11)  that  describes  the  overview  of  historical \nevolvement of \
    \ major  research  topics  in  approximately  last  20  years  followed  by discussion \
    \ about priority \nneeds in research and engineering capacity in the present age.  The report should cover six of the following \n\
    eight topics: \n1.  Hydrology \n2.  Hydraulics \n3.  Soil mechanics \n4.  Concrete structure \n\
    5.  Pump and pipeline systems \n6.  Remote sensing and information system application \n\
    7.  Construction and infrastructure system management \n8.  On‐farm soil and water management  \n\
     \nThe report on the historical overview should be written based primarily on interviews to key researchers in \n\
    the aforementioned areas preferably supported by an analysis of article titles in relevant journals.  Precise \n\
    and in‐depth analysis is expected for (1) research trends and topics, (2) needs behind the research trend, (3) \n\
    major  arguments  and  findings/achievements,  (4)  resulting  or  expected  impacts \
    \ on  engineering  practices.  \nStrict  chronological  precision  is  not  required \
    \ for  individual  events  unless  they  can  be  clearly  determined, \nthough it is advised to indicate their approximate year ranges.   \n\
    Summary of findings \nExchange of information on research activities in each country has revealed that only Thailand and Viet Nam \n\
    are conducting notable research activities in the concerned areas, or at least Cambodian team and Lao team \n\
    did not have access to relevant information and research communities.  \n \nThe \
    \ content  of  the  Lao  country  report  was  compilation  of  key  technical \
    \ references  in  the  planning  and \nimplementation  of  irrigation  projects. \
    \ Most  of  them  come  from  guidelines  developed  by  either  US  Army \nCorps of Engineers or US Bureau of Reclamation with no national input. The Cambodian report introduces \n\
    several studies in the area of hydrology and remote sensing. Though sufficient references are not provided \n\
    about  the  former,  the  latter  includes  land  cover  monitoring  and  land use \
    \ analysis,  soil  type  analysis,  and \ncropland monitoring. Beside these sporadic applications of new tools, no research work to develop original \n\
    knowledge was reported.  \n \nNational researchers in Cambodia and Lao PDR may mostly take part in research projects financed by foreign \n\
    institutes  and  not  engage  themselves  in  long  term  and  self‐directed \
    \ studies  due  to  the  lack  of  national \nfinancial  commitment  in  research \
    \ work.  Many  quasi  academic  forums  are  organized,  but  continuous \n27 | P\
    \ a g e  \n \ncompilation of the research findings and a comprehensive portal for such resources are absent. Subjects of \n\
    these forums do not cover issues pertinent to engineering practices. Low rank engineers in irrigation agencies \n\
    have no customs to seek scientific advice from research communities on the technical issues they encounter. \n\
    Civil and agricultural engineering is supposed to be close to applied research because of its broad subjects \n\
    and divers natural objects it encounters in the construction site. But there seems to be a gap in between in \n\
    the two countries. Lao PDR has just established a research institute dedicated to irrigation engineering and \n\
    Cambodia has yet to have one. Though CARDI conducts research work on plant water management and other \n\
    topics  relevant  to  irrigation,  no  information  was  given.  Because  important \
    \ knowledge  on  the  choice  of \nparameter values and local rules of thumbs are only kept inside the memory of experienced engineers and \n\
    not scientifically examined, establishing the irrigation research institute must be a good step to change the \n\
    situation.   \n \nThailand  shared  substantial  information  on  their  research \
    \ work,  which  contains  findings  that  can  benefit \nneighboring nations. Research themes in hydrology include the development of frequency analysis software \n\
    that  determines  the  most  suitable  distribution  function  from  given  hydro \
    \ meteorological  data  and  the \ndevelopment of an original automatic rain gauge made of affordable materials. In the process of the former \n\
    research, researchers identified Long Pearson Type III distribution function as the best to simulate discharge \n\
    in Chao Phraya River. In the area of pumps, development of flow‐driven coil/spiral pump was introduced. In \n\
    the area of hydraulics, development of wicket gates and studies on its utilities for multi purposes, a study on \n\
    the  pier  shape  that  minimizes  downstream  turbulence  in  steep  rivers, \
    \ a  study  on  travel  time  of  positive \nsurges in open channels and validation of HEC‐RAS model developed by US Army Corps of Engineers, and a \n\
    study on the effectiveness of step pools to trap sediments through physical model experiments. The research \n\
    topics  in  the  area  of  concrete  include  (1)  a  comparative  analysis  of \
    \ the  values  of  compressive  strength \nbetween  in‐situ  concrete  samples \
    \ and  cured  concrete  in  laboratory  and  studies  on  (2)  the  possibility \
    \ of \nreplacing  coarse  aggregates  by  steel  furnace  slag,  (3)  use  of \
    \ “superplasticizer”  to  improve  the  concrete \nworkability, and (4) conditions that allow increased use of fly ash.  Topics in the research area of soil and \n\
    water management are the effectiveness of soil reclamation materials and water management techniques \n\
    for  reducing  soil  acidity  as  well  as  drought  resistance  properties  of \
    \ local  soils  such  as  field  capacity, \npermanent wilting point, and deep percolation rate. On soil mechanics, a study on the relationship between \n\
    soaked CBR value and unsoaked CBR, similarly between the values of cohesion and angle of shear resistance \n\
    obtained from direct shear tests and triaxial compression tests, research for the utilization of expansive soil \n\
    and dispersive soil as construction material, a study to improve soil fertility of sandy soil, etc. are introduced. \n\
    From the area of material science, use of old tire mixed with asphalt for canal lining and box made of para \n\
    rubber for broad crest weirs were introduced. The report also introduces studies for improving water quality. \n\
    Use of floating plants to reduce nutrients and suspended solid, application of aluminum sulfate and hydrated \n\
    lime to earth bank to reduce water turbidity and use of PAC and liquid alum to improve water quality against \n\
    algal bloom are among the topics. Finally, some more research projects are reported under construction and \n\
    infrastructure system management.  Physical model experiments of flow in the Golok River estuary and Kwae \n\
    Noi River, sediment flushing techniques at weirs, filter material design that prevents piping, causes of canal \n\
    bank failure are the research themes introduced under this category.  \n \nThailand also organized an extensive discussion on the national research policy and strategy, research priority \n\
    and future research trends inviting researchers in the relevant subjects. For details of both aforementioned \n\
    research topics and contents of the discussion, please refer to the country report in Annex.   \n\
        \nThe team from Viet Nam presents interesting insights on the historical evolvement of research themes in Viet \n\
    Nam. On hydrology and meteorology topics, the country report discusses that agricultural intensification of \n\
    increased multi cropping triggered studies on moisture balance and other meteorological parameters in the \n\
    28 | P a g e  \n \nturn of the century. Also, impacts of the construction of irrigation infrastructure on the local hydrology for \n\
    both surface and ground water are listed as a major theme. Then, impacts of climate change on hydrological \n\
    regimes and agriculture comes in more recent times.  For each of these topics, the country report provides a \n\
    summary  of  notable  research  work.  Under  the  category  of  construction \
    \ and  infrastructure  management, \nresearch  titles  relevant  to  irrigation \
    \ system  modernization,  case  studies  on  the  measures  to  improve \nirrigation system operations and GIS application to the irrigation O&M are introduced. Discussions on the use \n\
    of SCADA, GIS and a hydro‐dynamic model in irrigation management in terms of software and discussions on \n\
    different type of sluice gates are described about hardware. In the area of hydraulics, historic evolvement of \n\
    hydrodynamic models is described in the context of such national issues as salinity intrusion, sedimentation \n\
    and nutrition balance, sedimentation and river morphology, flood control, development of dike and control \n\
    structures.  VRSAP,  SAL  and  VRSAP‐SAL,  MIKE,  HEC,  and  ISIS  are  the  discussed \
    \ models.  Also,  benefits  of \nflexible mesh in the latest modeling software are discussed as the recent topic. Under the remote sensing \n\
    and information system application, missions and functions of the first satellite of Viet Nam launched in May \n\
    2013  are  briefly  introduced.  The  scopes  of  remote  sensing  application \
    \ include  shore  erosion,  landslides, \nsedimentation, land cover, rice production, etc. In Viet Nam, a lot of studies have been conducted on the \n\
    mechanics of local soils and mixture of them with additives. Laterite breccia, soft clay, acid sulphate, sandy \n\
    clay,  and  flooded  soil  are  the  soil  types  found  in  the  research  titles. \
    \ Shear  strength,  deformation \ncharacteristics,  pore  water  pressure  under \
    \ consolidation,  permeability  are  among  the  topics.  Also  very \ninteresting is topical research work under this category: (1) landslide susceptibility mapping using Bayesian \n\
    conditional probability model and (2) determination of active consolidation depth. The list of research titles \n\
    related  to  concrete  structure  covers  various  themes,  too.  Analysis  of \
    \ the  agents  that  cause  concrete \ndeterioration in the Mekong Delta, the suitable mix ratio between natural sand and ground stone, range of \n\
    water‐reducing concrete admixture to decrease corrosion of reinforced concrete, changes of concrete quality \n\
    of hydraulic structures in an acid environment, use of saline sand for making concrete are among the themes. \n\
    Among the topical research title is a study on the use of fine sand to produce self‐compacting concrete.  \n\
     \nAs being summarized above, Thailand and Vietnam have extensively accumulated the knowledge useful in \n\
    the  whole  region  and  not  available  elsewhere  in  various  topics.  It \
    \ must  be  fully  utilized  by  not  only  the \ngovernment of Cambodia and Lao PDR but also Development Partners and private sectors that are engaged \n\
    in the irrigation sector of this region.  \n7. Follow up directions \n \nExchange visits, discussions in English, and group assignments were the major activities in this project.  It was \n\
    clear that most participants had difficulty in exchanging technical ideas in English though they should have \n\
    been  good  given  the  scope  of  the  activity.    They  also  had  trouble \
    \ in  writing;  however,  some  young \nparticipants  improved  their  communication \
    \ skills  dramatically  in  the  course  of  four  workshops.  Mere \nparticipation in workshops would have never made the change, but an incentive to learn English must have \n\
    facilitated  their  learning.    The  assignment  reports  also  cover  extensive \
    \ contents  despite  their  trouble  in \nwriting  English.  Most  participants \
    \ also  valued  exchange  visits  to  different  type  of  irrigation  schemes. \n\
    Geographical setting and three dimensional features of structures and schemes are better understood by \n\
    seeing on the site. Actual visits are always important to understand irrigation systems, their rationales and \n\
    local issues. This activity had a certain value such as networking and discovery of regional knowledge and \n\
    resources  especially  in  Thailand  and  Vietnam  as  well  as  limitation  in \
    \ achievement  in  the  depth  and \npreciseness of compiled information especially from Cambodia and Lao PDR. \n\
     \n29 | P a g e  \n \nLevels and width of professional education was one clear disparity among member countries.  The number \n\
    and curricula of relevant college departments are clear indicators of capacity development.  Good foundation \n\
    of underlying scientific knowledge is the premise for professional training. Findings in this project suggest \n\
    that irrigation engineers in Lao PDR need better opportunities in college level education. Because Lao people \n\
    have an advantage in communication with Thai people, harmonization in college course contents between \n\
    colleges  in  Thailand  and  Lao  PDR  may  improve  the  quality  of  education \
    \ and  clarify  the  areas  that  need \nimprovement. Formal and informal training in the professional career is as important as college education. \n\
    Difference in staff training between Thailand and other countries suggests big potential needs for systematic \n\
    staff training in other countries. An experience of practical technical exercise at one workshop also supported \n\
    this view. Most young participants showed little confidence in applying their engineering knowledge for the \n\
    given practical problems. Staff training that shows how to integrate learned science into project planning, \n\
    design, and quality controlling certainly needs more attention and support.  Also, strategic development is \n\
    important  in  staff  training  curricula  given  changing  roles  of  staff \
    \ engineers  and  emerging  technologies. \nCambdia’s focus on GIS and remote sensing technology has a good reason. MCs may pay more attention on \n\
    hydrogeological training to fulfill IWRM mandates. \n \nThe balance and stratification of technical rules, standards, manuals, and guidelines suggest different levels \n\
    of their development though contents are not documented in detail in this document.  Thailand again shows \n\
    well balanced development in technical protocols. Vietnam seems to have extensive protocols though they \n\
    may  still  be  in  an  informal  status.    This  may  come  from  different \
    \ demands  in  the  quality  of  engineering \nprotocols in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.  Mekong Delta is a very complicated single large system where \n\
    standards to apply for many simple systems may not be demanded.  Technical standards in Lao PDR seem to \n\
    have yet to reach a holistic state, though simple and managerial protocols seem to have been adopted in \n\
    essential areas. Foreign technical rules and guidelines are taken without adjustment in Lao PDR. Important \n\
    knowledge on the choice of parameter values and local rules of thumbs are only kept inside the memory of \n\
    experienced  engineers  and  not  scientifically  examined  or  formally  compiled \
    \ into  institutional  knowledge. \nCambodia also needs systematization of standards and guidelines incorporating feedback from the field or \n\
    actual projects. While most of irrigation developments are handled by Project Management Offices or Units \n\
    in MOWRAM, they directly report to the Minister without sharing technical lessons with line departments \n\
    and other Projects.  \n \nExchange of information on research activities in each country has revealed that only Thailand and Viet Nam \n\
    are conducting notable research activities in the concerned areas. Lao PDR has just established a research \n\
    institute and Cambodia has yet to have one. On the other hand, there are many research findings in Thailand \n\
    and Viet Nam that can benefit other two nations.  Studies on dispersive and expansive soils in Thailand and \n\
    fine sand in Viet Nam are good examples of sought after knowledge on how to use the materials common in \n\
    the  region  safely  and  effectively.  There  are  also  many  studies  on  suitable \
    \ parameter  values  for  the \napplication of empirical models to the region. It becomes clear that such knowledge has to be transferred \n\
    unilaterally from more developed two nations to the other two at least for now. Establishing a database of \n\
    such research work and translation service of papers written in local language can be a useful initiative. It \n\
    also  becomes  evident  that  such  knowledge  transfer  can  be  effective  only \
    \ when  Lao  PDR  and  Cambodia \nestablish a process to reflect such regional knowledge onto rules and guidelines and a channel to disseminate \n\
    them to staff members.  \n     \nThese  findings  show  the  need  for  balancing \
    \ the  technical  capacity  bases  among  MC  irrigation  agencies \ntogether with limited benefit to assemble officials from all four countries. Limited communication skills in \n\
    exchanging technical views and knowledge are one thing, but more important issue is that levels and areas of \n\
    interests are highly different among countries.  In terms of the research activities, two countries have nothing \n\
    30 | P a g e  \n \nto  share.  It  seems  difficult  to  organize  events  in \
    \ which  participants  from  all  four  countries  can  benefit. \nBilateral training and capacity building events would be more effective than holding common events under \n\
    the  MRC’s  framework.  Acting  as  a  liaison  to  introduce  bilateral  training \
    \ activities  to  MCs  can  be  a  more \nsuitable role for MRC.  On the other hand, certain knowledge in Thailand and Viet Nam is useful to share. A \n\
    desired  way  is  collaboration  with  Thailand  International  Development  Cooperation \
    \ Agency  (TICA)  or  an \narrangement  of  triangular  collaboration  involving \
    \ either  of  these  two  countries  to  transfer  knowledge  to \nCambodia  and \
    \ Lao  PDR.    MRC  can,  on  the  other  hand,  contribute  by  holding  policy \
    \ dialogues  to  lay \ngroundwork  to  improve  technical  protocols  and  institutions \
    \ disclosing  the  aforementioned  capacity  gaps \nbetween the two groups.  \n\
     \nAs Lao PDR has just established a research center focusing on irrigation engineering, activities to support the \n\
    center especially via linking to similar institutes in Thailand and Viet Nam are another opportunity. According \n\
    to the information on the irrigation research center shared in the fourth workshop, initial research focus are \n\
    on  irrigation  efficiency,  system  cost  comparison,  pump  cost  reduction, \
    \ etc.  Though  these  areas  sound \nfocusing on economic issues, total costs rely on risks and depreciation factors, which may be determined only \n\
    by  extensive  engineering  analyses.  To  analyze  and  prioritize  interlinks \
    \ between  the  seemingly  economics \nfocused mission and the expanse of engineering knowledge gaps is not an easy task. MRC can advise on the \n\
    research priorities and assist developing five to ten year road map by setting an international advisory group.  \n\
    Such a process will lead to institutionalization of local rules of thumbs and nationalization of foreign technical \n\
    standards, too. Because Cambodia has not established such an institute, either ITC or TSC can participate in \n\
    the activities as an observer.   \n \nAnother way to follow up this activity is to support participants’ voluntary efforts to exchange experiences \n\
    and topics.  The four workshops have developed a regional network of young engineers. Some also proved \n\
    the  capacity  to  write  and  present  substantial  technical  reports.  Because professional \
    \ associations  are  not \nactive  in  the  sector,  MRC  may  give  advice  to \
    \ and  financially  assist  a  regional  association  of  irrigation \nengineers and such voluntary activities as exchange visits with thematically focused knowledge exchanges. \n\
    Current internet connection must avail such an association with practically no cost, if the participants are \n\
    willing to organize it. The subsidy scheme may cover 80% of the DSA and travel costs, for example. Support \n\
    for  international  communication  and  leadership  from  young  generations \
    \ will  foster  strong  mutual \nunderstanding in the long term.     \n \nExpansion of irrigated areas is an important development opportunity for MRC. Because irrigation usually \n\
    associates diversion of river water, proper engineering practices in irrigation are an important building block \n\
    in  the  basin  water  resources  management.  It  is  generally  known  that \
    \ the  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement process must be established in each of major sector agencies though IWRM calls for integration \n\
    of sectors. Improved and reliable planning and design practices in the irrigation sector are a key for effective \n\
    IWRM.  This project attempted to initiate the process to seek technical harmony in the irrigation sector by \n\
    making young engineers to analyze and compare their own engineering practices and protocols. This can be \n\
    followed by more focused dialogues either in the policy level or among leaders in research institutes. The \n\
    contents  of  this  report  offer  good  materials  to  review  the  current \
    \ situations  of  technical  harmony  and \navailable opportunities for international cooperation in the sector.     \n\

    Cambodia \n \n1. Situation of higher education in the area of irrigation engineering \n\
     \na.  Colleges and Universities \nThe Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) is the major institute on engineering in Cambodia. ITC was \n\
    founded in 1964 supported by the former Soviet Union. It also received extensive support from France in \n\
    1980’s. The Rural Engineering Department (former Hydraulic faculty) covers the areas relevant to irrigation.  \n\
    However, no university level courses are available in hydrology, irrigation engineering or meteorology \n\
    according to MOWRAM1. \n \nb.  Technical certificate systems and professional license \n\
    There is no requirement for individuals to practice civil and agricultural engineering work. Legal persons who \n\
    would like to participate in public bidding of engineering consulting work are required to acquire a license \n\
    presenting the number of staff engineers who graduate from the relevant fields.  \n\
    Within the government, engineers who worked five years in the design and drawing jobs are given technical \n\
    certificates. \n \nd.  Research institutes  \nITC has a laboratory on soil (soil physics) and concrete testing facilities and MOWRAM also has a similar \n\
    laboratory. However, research activities are only carried out by students for their BSc degrees. The \n\
    Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) is involved in research activities on rice \n\
    and irrigation to a limited extent though its research field centres on agronomic topics.  MOWRAM has a plan \n\
    to establish a research institute in near future, but there is no research institute dedicated to the topics in the \n\
    area of irrigation engineering.  \n \ne.  Professional associations and academic societies  \n\
    There is a registered professional association of civil engineers mostly for those who work in the private \n\
    sector.  It is not common for government staff in the engineering field to become members. \n\
     \n2. Career path of irrigation engineers in the government \n \na.  Admission process to the irrigation agency: \n\
    The government periodically organises competitive entry examinations to recruit knowledge workers who \n\
    completed college or higher education.  The entry examination comprises a written test and interview.  The \n\
    written tests are prepared jointly by the Ministry of Education Youth and Sport, Department of Civil Services, \n\
    Anti‐Corruption Unit, and the line ministries.  \n \nb.  Required degree to apply for the irrigation agency: \n\
    Applicants to be a government irrigation engineer must hold a college degree or higher in a subject relevant \n\
    to irrigation. \n \n                                                            \n\

    MOWRAM and PDOWRAM staff.  The contents of the TSC training courses are detailed in Chapter 5.  Besides \n\
    the TSC training, overseas studies offered by foreign countries are also major training opportunities.  \n\
     \nd.  Typical career path:  \nOrdinary managerial strata inside the MOWRAM start from officials, Vice Chief of Office, Head of Office, \n\
    Deputy Director, and Director. There is no regular transfer or expected promotion cycle.  Transfer from one \n\
    section to another and between the headquarters (MOWRAM) and provincial offices (PDOWRAM) can be \n\
    made on requests and specific circumstances.  \n \ne.  Requirements for specific roles and positions: \n\
    There is no specific position that requires special requirements though positions of higher ranks are usually \n\
    filled by those who have suitable disciplines and experiences.   \n \nf. \nRoles of academic communities and research institutes:  \n\
    University faculties are involved in preparation in entry examinations and TSC training.  They also play \n\
    advisory roles in policy‐making in regard to technical issues and project evaluation process. \n\
     \ng.  Pilot schemes and new technology application:  \nAs new major development projects mostly rely on foreign financing, most of the projects are, so to speak, \n\
    pilot schemes. Irrigation projects in Cambodia are mainly construction or rehabilitation of reservoir and canal \n\
    systems, but also underway are other types such as sea dyke construction to prevent salt water intrusion.  \n\
    Transfer of management responsibility to Farmer Water User Communities (FWUC) also started on a pilot \n\

    Law on Water Resources Management and its sub‐decrees, which have not been approved at the time of \n\
    drafting this report, define some of the irrigation project process such as the regulation of the use of \n\
    reservoir catchments, procedure for getting access to the reservoir water, resettlement of residence, and \n\
    issues related to FWUC such as establishment process, organisation, and authority. \n\
     \nb.  General flow of project approval and initiation including the internal, academic, and 3rd party evaluation \n\
    and review process \n \nc.  Required cost benefit ratios and rules for cost benefit analysis:  \n\
    Irrigation project proposals need to have 1.0 or higher cost‐benefit‐ratio and an internal rate of return of \n\
    higher than 12% for the approval. They depend on donor requirements. Grant projects and government \n\
    funded projects do not require CBR ratio or IRR. \n \nd.  ToR of government offices in planning, construction, and O&M: \n\
    The Department of Planning and International Cooperation is the general planning body of MOWRAM.  Its \n\
    mandates include the following: \n \nTo manage data and statistics  \n \nTo formulate development plans and programmes \n\
     \nTo prepare collaboration program and agreements \n \nTo monitor the project implementation \n\
     \nFor planning and designing individual irrigation projects, the Department of Engineering assumes the \n\
    following tasks:  \n \nTo study and construct structures related to water resources. \n\
     \nTo manage instruments and heavy equipment for designing and construction. \n\
     \nTo study relevant technologies and set standards for design and construction. \n\
     \nHowever, irrigation projects financed by foreign financiers are usually handled by Project Management \n\
    Units/Offices, which directly report to the Minister.  \n \nThe Department of Irrigated Agriculture, Department of Engineering, and Department of Farmer Water User \n\
    Community operate, maintain and rehabilitate existing irrigation schemes with the following mandates: \n\

     \nExtension service staff and other relevant staff from MAFF also participate in the PMO/PMU depending on \n\
    the project implementation plan. \n \n \n6. Procedures for water resources management\
    \ \na.  Legal framework for water rights: \nThe Law on Water Resource Management was enacted in 2007. The water law stipulates the water rights \n\
    framework. \n \nb.  Process of new water resources development: \n PDOWRAM and MOWRAM staff develop project planning based on desk survey, field visits and consultation \n\
    with local authorities and representative residents.    \n \nc.  Fishermen’s right in rivers and natural water bodies: \n\
    The Fisheries Law (2006) and Community‐Fisheries Sub Decree provide a basis for addressing management \n\
    issues in inland fisheries. Disputes over fishermen’s right are resolved in the resettlement unit, in which \n\
    various conflicts between government and locals are handled. \n \nd.  Requirement for minimum/environmental flow: \n\
    There is no requirement. \n \ne.  Rules for environmental impact assessment: \n\
    The rules apply for all project stages of irrigation projects in most cases due to financier’s request. By law, \n\
    projects over 5,000 ha need a full environmental impact assessment. \n \n \n7.\
    \ Participation and cost sharing \n \na.  Participation of farmers in the planning process:  \n\
    Representative farmers and local authorities are usually consulted in the field reconnaissance process to \n\
    collect historical hydrological data and determine scheme layout.    \n \nb. \
    \ Roles of water user organisations in investment and system operations: \nMOWRAM/PDOWRAM is responsible for operations of main infrastructures (water sources, reservoir, main \n\
    canal/dyke and head works...) and the Farmer Water User Community(FWUC) is responsible for operations of \n\
    secondary infrastructures (secondary canal, tertiary canal, and its head works...) \n\
     \n \n \n36 | P a g e  \n \nc.  Cost sharing framework  \nAccording to the circular No. 1 dated 11 Jan 1999, the Cambodian Government gave MOWRAM the following \n\
    duties: \n \nMonitoring and evaluation of efficient use of irrigation schemes, \n\
     \nRehabilitation and maintenance of the irrigation schemes to deliver water up for farming.  \n\
     \nPreparation of a statute of Farmer Water User Community (FWUC) and set up FWUC institution. \n\
    The circular also gave instruction to the Ministry of Economy and Finance to collaborate with MOWRAM for \n\
    preparing the budget to make FWUC functioning from the beginning year to its autonomous functioning. The \n\
    support budget is as follows: \n‐ \nYear 1: Government in charge of 80% and FWUC in charge of 20%  \n\
    ‐ \nYear 2: Government in charge of 60% and FWUC in charge of 40% \n‐ \nYear 3: Government in charge of 40% and FWUC in charge of 60% \n\
    ‐ \nYear 4: Government in charge of 20% and FWUC in charge of 80% \n‐ \nYear 5: Government in charge of 0% and FWUC in charge of 100% \n\
     \nd.  Legal status of water user organisations, their qualification and regulations applied to them:   \n\
    The FWUC is supposed to be established and registered when new irrigation infrastructure is completed. It \n\
    has an authority over its members in terms of irrigation water management, maintenance of transferred \n\
    infrastructures and fee collection.  \n \ne.  Protocols for land acquisition and compensation in irrigation projects: \n\
    Disputes over land, resettlement, and compensation are handled by resettlement unit. There is no clear rule \n\
    and standard for compensation for land acquisition.      \n \n \n8. Design codes\
    \ and manuals \n \nAbout the planning/design codes, manual and their coverage are briefly discussed in the next chapter. There \n\
    is no systematic national coding system in the irrigation sector. Most irrigation projects are implemented \n\
    with foreign financing, which come with feasibility study and detailed design being done by foreign standards.  \n\
    There is Design Manual for Small and Medium Scale Irrigation System Planning, developed by MOWRAM and \n\
    a consultant financed by ADB, but it is not institutionalised as an official manual.    \n\
     \nLao PDR \n1. Situation of higher education in the area of irrigation engineering \n\
    Thatthong University and Tha Ngon Irrigation College have curricula for irrigation engineering. The irrigation \n\
    college is established under the Ministry of Agriculture to be the preparatory institute for those who enter its \n\
    department of irrigation. The irrigation college can be said as under development.       \n\
    There  is  no  technical  certificate  system  other  than  college  degrees. \
    \ There  is  no  association  for  practicing \nengineers nor academic society. One research institute dedicated to irrigation engineering was established in \n\
    2013. \n \n2. Career path of irrigation engineers in the government \na. Admission process to the irrigation agency: \n\
    Candidates of government irrigation engineer must submit related documents to the personnel division to \n\
    get the examination via both interview and writing. \n \n37 | P a g e  \n \nb.\
    \ Required degree to apply for the irrigation agency \nAll the candidates to become the government irrigation engineer must have at least a diploma of engineering \n\
    and a CV. \n \nc. Staff training  \nThere are two types:  \ni. Training overseas should get the permission from the head of agency \n\
    ii. Local training organised by human resource development office or department and human resources \n\
    office will select the right person to participate.  \n \nd. Typical career path  \n\
    The irrigation engineers in the Department of Irrigation in MAFF and Provinces are appointed separately by \n\
    the Minister and provincial governors. Though they form a single professional network, the staff members in \n\
    two groups do not regularly transfer in between.   \n \ne. Roles of academic communities and research institutes \n\
    Academic communities take part in the following roles of the government. \n \n\
    To promote the new  innovation technology \n \nAdvisory role \n \nRelevant to certification \n\
     \nTo setup pilot sites \n \n3. Relationship with relevant disciplines/technical fields  \n\
    In the latest demarcation between DOI/MAF and MONRE, water resources assessment becomes the role of \n\
    MONRE. In addition, agronomists and agricultural economists are sought from other departments offering \n\
    incentive payment. \n \n4. Budget and accounting systems for irrigation projects \n\
     \na. Amount of national budget for irrigation sector and its trends \nAnnual budget is around six to eight million US dollars per year and the budget is in an increasing trend. \n\
     \nb. Budgeting system (general and special accounts and their coverage) in the irrigation agency \n\
    District level officials calculate necessary budget, which is compiled by provincial\
    \ irrigation departments and \nsubmitted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The cabinet approves budget allocation.   \n\
     \nc. Yearly budget management rules and multiple budget management protocols \n\
    Operation  and  maintenance  plan,  irrigation  rehabilitation  plan,  flood \
    \ emergency  plan, and  water \nmanagement, development and executive plan give the framework for budgeting. \n\
     \n5. General protocols of irrigation projects \n \na. Laws/decrees that directly define the irrigation project process and its summary \n\
    The Law on Irrigation was promulgated in 2013. The law consists of 9 chapters and 79 articles. The objective \n\
    of the law is to provide the framework for irrigation development and management in Lao PDR. The major \n\
    features  of  the  law  include  the  process  for  irrigation  development  planning \
    \ and  irrigation  scheme \nmanagement with community participation. The water user group is recognised under the law and granted \n\
    38 | P a g e  \n \nspecific  rights  for  managing  irrigation  schemes.  The \
    \ sub‐decree  will  also  be  enacted  to  present  specific \nirrigation processes. \n\
     \nb. General  flow  of  project  approval  and  initiation  including  the  internal, \
    \ academic,  and  3rd  party \nevaluation and review process \nIn general, projects start from the local authorities who collect the needs of the people in the village and then \n\
    submit that through the upper authorities to the central government for screening and prioritisation.   \n\
     \nc. Required cost benefit ratios and rules for cost benefit analysis  \nIn any project, the cost benefit ratio must be higher than 1.0 and the economic rate of return must be higher \n\
    than 12%. \n \nd. ToR of government offices in planning, construction, and O&M \n\
    To define the scope of work for development projects that cover the people’s needs. \n\
    To implement planning, study, survey, design, construction as well as operations and maintenance in a good \n\
    way. \n \ne. Jobs to be contracted out in irrigation projects \nThe following work can be contracted out: \n\
     Study, survey and design work \n Construction supervision work \n Construction work  \n\
     \nf. Organisation of irrigation agencies and their scope of work in law  \nThe Department of Irrigation plays a key role in irrigated agriculture development. It consists of four divisions, \n\
    one centre, and one technical assembly, whose names are as follows:  \n \nAdministrative and Organization Division  \n\
     \nPlanning Division \n \nIrrigation and Drainage Development Division  \n\
    \ \nOperation and Maintenance Division  \n \nStudy, Survey and Design Center \n\
     \nIrrigation Scientific and Technical Assembly  \nThe role and responsibility of the Department of Irrigation is mainly irrigation infrastructure development \n\
    and management because agriculture extension is implemented by other departments.  \n\
    g. Collaboration with extension services and agricultural economists \nIn the irrigation construction projects, a strategy committee and a working group are formed at both national \n\
    and  provincial  levels  involving  relevant  authorities.  In  the  strategy \
    \ committee,  policy‐makers  in  relevant \nsectors  and  local  government  authorities \
    \ are  involved.  The  technical  working  group  comprises  staff  from \nprovincial technical divisions such as: irrigation service, agriculture extension service, agriculture planning, \n\
    domestic  trade,  electricity,  environment,  and  land  planning,  as  well \
    \ as  relevant  major  civil  society \nrepresentatives such as agro‐industry and credit cooperative representatives. \n\
     \n6. Procedures for water resources management \na. Legal framework for water rights \n\
    It is widely believed in the agriculture sector that law secures water users’ right to maintain water diversion \n\
    from rivers once they have established weirs and canals but it is not clear in the Water and Water Resources \n\
    Law and its sub‐decree. The Law mainly focuses on the protection of water resources and watershed, and \n\
    39 | P a g e  \n \nwater  resource  planning  and  prevention  of  water  pollution, \
    \ and  water  resource  classification.  Very  little \ndirection  is  given \
    \ to  administrative  agencies.  The  Law  includes  vague  provisions  for  the \
    \ establishment  of \nwater use permits, but does not provide clear work definitions for implementation agencies, the responsible \n\
    agency for the registration of rights and conflict resolution.  \n \nb. Fishermen’s rights in rivers and natural water bodies \n\
    Fishermen’s rights are defined in law. \n \nc. Rules for environmental impact assessment \n\
    Environmental Impact Assessment is applied for large scale irrigation projects. \n\
     \n7. Participation and cost sharing \na. Participation of farmers in the planning process \n\
    Farmers have roles in rehabilitation, water supply planning, agriculture production planning, etc. \n\
     \nb. Roles of water user organisations in irrigation investment and system operations and its legal basis \n\
    WUAS’s management shall cover ancillary facility, e.g. lateral canal, field ditches and field irrigation, drainage \n\
    system, tractor ploughing paths, etc. \n \nc. Cost sharing framework between water users and the government \n\
    WUAs are operated based on irrigation fees to cover electricity/energy cost, remuneration to elected officials \n\
    and the cost of simple maintenance and rehabilitation work. Rehabilitation work beyond a threshold value is \n\
    undertaken by the government. \n \nd. Legal status of water user organisations, their qualification and regulations applied to them \n\
    Water  Use  Associations  (WUA)  are  organisations  established  according  to \
    \ the  irrigation  water  users’  will.  \nProjects’ beneficiaries are supposed to participate in setting‐up the organisations. WUAs have a corporate \n\
    status  once  they  had  been  registered  with  the  local  authorities.  Any \
    \ farmer  who  owns  an  irrigation  field \nwould be a member of the organisation. One representative of the WUA be elected from villagers through \n\
    democratic elections, and three to four executive members (including one president and two to three vice \n\
    presidents) be elected in the WUA congress. Afterward, several water users’ groups are established within \n\
    the irrigation scope, and one representative in each group is elected as the water release staff responsible for \n\
    supplying  water  to  the  farmland  of  the  group.  The  responsibility  of \
    \ the  WUA  is  to  perform  unified \nmanagement of operation and maintenance works and to perform unified distribution for irrigation water \n\
    supply, water users would directly participate in the management of water supply.  \n\
     \ne. Protocols for land acquisition and compensation in irrigation projects \n\
    The resettlement unit is in charge of land acquisition. \n \nf. Ownership of the land and structures of irrigation systems  \n\
    Irrigation systems of 50‐500 ha belong to the WUA. Those 100‐500 ha are managed together by the WUA \n\
    (planning) and the government (rehabilitation work). Irrigation schemes of 500 ha onwards belong to the \n\
    government authority.  \n \n8. Design codes and manuals \na. Official planning/design codes and their coverage \n\
    Yes, there are many: \n- \nSurvey and design code \n40 | P a g e  \n \n- \nConstruction code \n\
    - \nAgricultural economic code \n- \nElectricity code \n- \nMechanism code \n\
    - \nHydraulic code \n \nb. Official planning/design manual \nThere are many including the following: \n\
     Standard for design headwork (dam, weir, pump, gate and other.) \n Standard for design canal and its structures \n\
     Standard for material quality \n \nc. Other information \nThe  language  used \
    \ in  the  code/manual  is  English.  All  the  relevant  regulations  are  listed \
    \ in  the  rules  and \nmanuals. \n \n9. Irrigation design/planning in general \n\
    d. General goal of irrigation development \nThe Irrigated Agriculture National Action Plan has defined several priority investment projects, which are the \n\
    major water users subjected to these rules and procedures. \n \nThailand \n1.\
    \ Situations of higher education in the area of irrigation engineering \na.  Colleges and Universities \n\
    The situation of college departments that produce irrigation engineers is clearly different amongst Member \n\
    Countries.  Thailand has the most amongst the four countries. Kasetsart University, Asian Institute of \n\
    Technology, Chulalongorn University, Irricollege, Mahanakhorn Universtiy and Tammasart University have \n\
    curricula for irrigation engineers. \n \nb.  Technical certificate systems and professional license \n\
    Besides college degrees, Thailand has a systematic certificate system on shorter courses and specific subject \n\
    diploma.  The Council of Engineers has the following power and duties:  \n(1) to issue license to applicants for the Controlled Engineering Profession;  \n\
    (2) to suspend or revoke the license;  \n(3) to certify the degree, diploma or certificate required for practicing the Controlled Engineering \n\
    Profession; The above‐mentioned universities confer the second type of certificate. The Thai Council of \n\
    Engineers and Irrigation Development Institute provide civil and irrigation engineering curricula. \n\
    Engineering in Thailand is a profession that requires licenses to practice.  The engineer license in Thailand has \n\
    several levels and categories.  Like the American system, an engineering graduate can acquire the “Associate \n\
    Engineer” license by passing the corresponding comprehensive exam, and proceed to higher levels (i.e., \n\
    Professional Engineer and Senior Professional Engineer) later by submitting engineering work of a required \n\
    duration plus taking a written exam or interview.  There is also a lower level license, Corporate Engineer level \n\
    license, for those who have college diplomas.  This license cannot be upgraded.  If private firms seek \n\
    engineering work contracts from the government, they must acquire a License for Juristic Person. \n\
     \nc.  Research institutes  \n41 | P a g e  \n \nThe Royal Irrigation Department of Thailand has an Irrigation Development Institute to conduct education \n\
    and  training  activities,  research  and  consultancy  work  related  to  irrigation, \
    \ as  well  as  broader  water \nresources engineering and management topics including floods, droughts and landslide disaster management.  \n\
    Relevant  research  work  is  commissioned  also  by  the  Department  of  Water \
    \ Resources  of  the  Ministry  of \nNatural  Resources  and  Environment.   \
    \ Five  national  centres  under  the  National  Science  and  Technology \nDevelopment Agency are also listed as the research institutes that conduct relevant research work.  \n\
     \nd.  Professional associations and academic societies  \nAs Engineering is a licensed profession in Thailand, the Council of Engineers plays the roles of the governing \n\
    organisation as well as networking society for engineers.  Besides the Council of Engineers, the Thai \n\
    Hydrologist Association is organised as an independent professional society.    \n\
     \n2. Career path of irrigation engineers in the government \na.  Admission process to the irrigation agency \n\
    The admission process to the Thai Government involves two examinations.  First, applicants have to pass the \n\
    civil service commission exam (CSCE), which is administered by the Office of the Civil Service Commission \n\
    (OCSC) affiliated with the Office of the Prime Minister. Individual organisations usually require additional \n\
    qualifications and taking their own competitive exams. Freshmen/women also have to gain satisfactory \n\
    accreditation in the Aptitude Test/Work‐Sample Test of usually three months to confirm the employment.  \n\
    The competitive examination by the Royal Irrigation Department involves both an interview and a writing test. \n\
     \nb.  Required degree to apply for the irrigation agency \nIn Thailand, both bachelor’s or higher university degree and an engineering license are the prerequisites to \n\
    apply for a government position as an irrigation engineer.  Holders of degrees of civil engineering, irrigation \n\
    engineering, agricultural engineering etc. that are certified by the OCSC as a qualified degree are accepted as \n\
    applicants.  About the professional license, applicants must have at least an Associate Engineer License. \n\
     \nc.  Staff training  \nThe Royal Irrigation Department offers various training courses and certificates to its staff engineers via the \n\
    Irrigation Development Institute (IDI).  The technical certificates issued by the IDI are used as one of the \n\
    qualifications for promotion to higher positions. The IDI training courses include the following:  \n\
     \nparticipatory   integrated   water   resources project management \n \nagricultural water productivity assessment \n\
     \ndigital discharge measurement  \n \nMIKE FLOOD integration for flood analysis \n\
     \nMIKE BASIN model for water resources management \n \nMIKE 21 HD flow model for 2‐dimension flow simulation \n\
     \nknowledge about natural resources for irrigation. \n \n  Besides the IDI training courses, the RID staff can apply for various scholarships offered both by national and \n\
    foreign institutes mostly through the Office of Civil Service Commission (OCSC).  Those who take such a \n\
    scholarship may leave his/her department during the study term on condition that they return to the office \n\
    immediately after the completion of the study term. \n \nd.  Typical career path  \n\
    In Thailand, government positions are divided into two categories: Knowledge Worker Positions (KWPs) and \n\
    General Positions (GP). Irrigation Engineer is classified as one of 146 KWPs.  For the Irrigation Engineers, \n\
    42 | P a g e  \n \nthere are four main duties: operations, planning, cooperation, and service.  Their career paths typically go \n\
    along with one of such major tasks as planning, design, and construction management.  \n\
    They step up through five levels, namely practitioner level (K1), professional level (K2), senior professional \n\
    level (K3), expert level (K4) and advisory level (K5). Expert (K4) and Advisory (K5) levels are also assigned for \n\
    management roles. Usually, expert and director positions are filled by K4 levels, whereas advisory level (K5) is \n\
    responsible for advisory tasks to the Department such as being Chief Engineer or Executive Advisor. \n\
    On the other hand, the General Positions in the RID are associated with the duties of irrigation technicians. \n\
    They have four levels: operational Level (O1), experienced level (O2), senior level (O3), highly skilled level \n\
    (O4). \n \ne.  Requirements for specific roles and positions \nAll the positions in government organisations are divided into two categories: KWP and GP.  The KWP \n\
    positions are filled by Irrigation Engineers, who must have bachelors or higher degrees of qualified curriculum, \n\
    as well as a professional license.  The GPs are filled by certificate holders of vocational education or other \n\
    qualification in the fields of irrigation technician, civil technician, surveyor, etc. that the corresponding \n\
    department certifies as suitable and OCSC certified as qualified.  There is no additional prerequisite attached \n\
    to particular positions.  The technical certificates issued by the Irrigation Development Institute are used as \n\
    one of the qualifications for promotion to higher positions.  \n \nf. \nRoles of academic communities and research institutes  \n\
    The IDI takes lead in the application of new technology, research and development in the area of civil and \n\
    irrigation engineering as well as agriculture. Roles of academic communities other than IDI such as university \n\
    researchers are not clear.  \n \ng.  Pilot schemes and new technology application  \n\
    There is a lot of research work being done in the field relevant to irrigation.  Whether or not the RID \n\
    implements or finances pilot schemes and new technologies is not clear.      \n\
     \n3. Relationship with relevant disciplines/technical fields \nThe Royal Irrigation Department has in‐house specialists in all relevant technical fields to cover irrigation \n\
    project planning; survey and design irrigation system; construction cost estimation; improvement and \n\
    maintenance of irrigation system, dam, weir, and other irrigation infrastructures; and water management for \n\
    irrigation systems. Therefore, the RID usually handles technical work without seeking support from other \n\
    government sections or academic societies. Specific technical responsibilities are assigned to staff members \n\
    based on their potential, experience and the level of responsibility in accordance with RID policies. \n\
    Following are the expert positions currently filled by the senior level staff: \n\
     \nCivil Engineering (Design, Project Planning, Irrigation Engineering Material) \n\
     \nHydrology \n \nIrrigation Engineering (General, Water Management) \n \n\
    Irrigation Engineering (Water Management) \n \nMechanical Engineering \n \n\
    Mechanical Engineering (Research and Development) \n \nResearch and Development (General, Hydraulic Engineering) \n\
     \nSurvey Engineering (Survey) \n \nInformation Technology \n \nElectronic Communication Engineering (Project Planning) \n\
     \nElectrical Engineering (Project Planning) \n43 | P a g e  \n \n \nEnvironmental Impact \n\
     \nEconomic Analysis for Water Resource Development Project \n \nPlanning and Design \n\
     \nSurvey and Photogrammetry \n \nGeological Engineering (Supervisory) \n \n\
    The expert positions of sub‐senior level are the followings: \n \nArchitecture, Expert on Earth Dam Construction \n\
     \nConcrete Dam Construction \n \nDam Foundation \n \nDesign \n \nWater Turbine \n\
     \nDespite the aforementioned technical capacity, the RID also contracts out its planning, design, and \n\
    construction management work to the private sector especially for medium and large scale irrigation projects. \n\
     \n4. Budget and accounting systems for irrigation projects \na.  National sector budget and its trends \n\
    The national budget to the irrigation sector was US$1714 million in 2012 in Thailand. Figure shows the sector \n\
    budget of the past 10 years (the fiscal years 2003‐2012). It shows a trend of steady increase except the fiscal \n\
    year 2010, in which the fiscal budget allocation was only US$ 965 million. \n\
    The national budget for the irrigation sector is calculated as the sum of the total annual budgets for water \n\
    resources development, including irrigation project development, construction and management.  The Royal \n\
    Irrigation Department (RID), the Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the Department of \n\
    Groundwater Resources (DGR) are the responsible departments.  Amongst the three, the RID receives the \n\
    highest fiscal budget (about 87%), while DWR and DGR receive 10% and 3% respectively. Its categorical \n\
    shares for personnel, operation, investments, subsidies, and other expenses are 35%, 14%, 44%, 5% and 2%, \n\
    respectively in average. \n \n \n \n \n \n44 | P a g e  \n \nb.  Foreign grant and loans  \n\
    Thailand received about US$ 41 million of foreign grants to the irrigation sector in the fiscal year 2012, which \n\
    accounted for around 4% of the national sector budget.  This amount decreased from US$ 102 million in the \n\
    fiscal year 2003, which was about 11% of the national irrigation sector budget. Thailand also receives loans \n\
    from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The \n\
    highest amount was around US$10 million in 2003 for the Pasak irrigation development project, which \n\
    continued until 2005. Other donors to the irrigation sector in Thailand are the MRC and the Netherlands. \n\
     \nc.  Budgeting system  \nIn Thailand, only a general yearly fiscal budget account applies to the irrigation sector budget.  There is no \n\
    special arrangement to make fiscal commitment to multiple year projects or to engage in multiple year \n\
    contracts.  All government organizations estimate their yearly expenses (personnel, operations, investment, \n\
    subsidies and other expenses) according to the national policy and submit to the Bureau of Budget (BB) to \n\
    propose a bill of yearly Fiscal Expenses Budget Act. \n \nd.  Maintenance and rehabilitation budgets and asset management planning  \n\
    In Thailand, the national budget for the irrigation sector is classified into the following four output categories \n\
    and their sub‐categories. \n1 \nIrrigation water management \n1) Water supply and drainage system management \n\
    2) Irrigation system maintenance \n3) Irrigation system improvement \n2 \nWater resources and extension of irrigation command area \n\
    1) Construction project management for extension of irrigation command area \n\
    2) Construction project management for water resources and irrigation system for community \n\
    3 \nPromoting His Majesty the King's  project \n1) Promoting water resources \n\
    2) Promoting the development \n4 \nFlood protection and flood mitigation \n \n\
    In the fiscal year 2013, the “irrigation water management” accounts for the biggest share of 39%.  As its sub‐\n\
    category titles show, this is for management, maintenance and improvement of existing irrigation systems.  \n\
    “Water resources and extension of irrigation command area” accounts for 35%. Since there was a devastating \n\
    flood crisis in 2011, 23% of the 2013 sector budget was allocated to “flood protection and flood mitigation.” \n\
     \n5. General protocols of irrigation projects \na.  Laws/decrees that define irrigation project process  \n\
    There are two laws that specify irrigation project processes.   \n1) The People Irrigation Act, B.E. 2482 (AD1939) \n\
    This law is enacted to control and manage “people irrigation.” Its objectives include the preservation of \n\
    the rights and benefits of people. This law defines the meaning of irrigation, people irrigation, contractual \n\
    irrigation, irrigation area, accessory for irrigation and official. This law describes regulations for private \n\
    irrigation, people irrigation and contractual irrigation; including the power, authorities and duties of \n\
    government officials to control them, as well as penalties against violation of the Act. \n\
    2) The State Irrigation Act, B.E. 2485 (AD1942) \nThis law promotes and controls all irrigation works constructed by the government. The government \n\
    irrigation works may cover procurement of water for retention, preservation, control, supply, drainage or \n\
    45 | P a g e  \n \nallocation in various purposes; namely agriculture, energy, public utilities, industry, including prevention \n\
    of damages to be caused by water, as well as navigation within irrigation areas.     \n\
     \nIn addition to the aforementioned laws, the following laws are highly relevant to irrigation project processes.    \n\
     \nThe Field Dykes and Ditches Act, B.E. 2505 (AD1962)  \n \nThe Land Consolidation for Agriculture Act (Volume 2), B.E. 2534 (AD1991) \n\
     \nThe Agricultural Land Reform Act, B.E. 2518 (AD1975) \n \nThe Land Development Act, B.E. 2551 (AD2008)  \n\
     \nThe Agricultural Land Act, B.E. 2534 (AD1991) \n \nThe Ratchaphatsadu Land Act, B.E. 2518 (AD1975. Regulations for the acquisition of land in all \n\
    government projects and regulations for the transfer of land to government assets) \n\
     \nThe Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act, B.E. 2535 (AD1992) \n\
     \nThe National Park Act, B.E. 2504(AD1961),  \n \nThe National Reserved Forest Act, B.E. 2507 (AD1964)  \n\
     \nThe Forest Act, B.E. 2484 (AD1941) \n \nThe Artesian Water Act (No.3), B.E. 2546 (AD2003) \n\
     \nThe Land Excavation and Land Filling Act, B.E. 2543 (AD2000) \n \nThe Cooperatives Act, B.E. 2542 (AD1999)  \n\
     \nRoyal decree on Farmers Group, B.E. 2547 (AD2004)  \n \nb.  General flow of project approval and evaluation process \n\
    The general flow of an irrigation project in Thailand comprises of four main processes: project approval, \n\
    irrigation land/area acquisition, irrigation project construction, and delivery‐reception of the constructed \n\
    system. Initiation of new irrigation projects can be either a top‐down process through strategic planning of \n\
    future land use or a bottom‐up process responding to people’s request. In either case, all procedures shall \n\
    have public participation (customers, stakeholders, and farmers involved in the irrigation and water \n\
    resources development project). \nPublic hearings are held on rights with regard to the access to information on government activities related \n\
    to their livelihood, on the effects of irrigation project construction to their livelihood for both positive and \n\
    negative impacts, and on rights to receive compensations for those impacts. The needs of public participation \n\
    are stipulated in the Regulations of the Office of the Prime Minister on Hearings B.E. 2548 (2005) and the \n\
    Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, B.E. 2549 (2006), Part 10 “Right to Information and Complaints” and \n\
    Article 57.   \n \nIrrigation agencies apply the Suppliers Inputs Process Outputs Customers model to take accounts of people’s \n\
    needs and expectations into consideration providing chances for people to express their opinions.  \n\
    1) Project approval \nGeneral flow of project approval is categorized into three types according to project size.  Small scale \n\
    projects are approved by a preliminary project study, request for land use permission, public participation \n\
    process, and engineering arrangements. Medium and large scale projects need a feasibility study, an \n\
    environmental assessment, request for land use permission, public participation process, migration \n\
    arrangements (if any), and engineering arrangements. There are three levels of feasibility study: \n\
    reconnaissance study (RS), pre‐feasibility study and feasibility study (FS). RS is for initial feasibility \n\
    consideration. If RS shows feasibility, a geotechnical survey will be performed. FS has more details than RS \n\
    as it includes detailed benefit‐cost analysis, environmental assessment, social impact assessment (SIA), \n\
    and health impact assessment. Medium scale irrigation projects may proceed to the detailed design and \n\
    construction procedures without FS. Environmental assessment is also comprised of three stages: \n\
    46 | P a g e  \n \nEnvironmental Checklist, Initial Environment Examination, and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). \n\
    Once feasibility study(ies) completes, master plan will be prepared for project approval.  The project \n\
    master plan involves construction plan, budget plan, workforce plan, machinery plan and resource plan. \n\
    Relevant laws are referred to in this process as guidelines.   \n2) Land acquisition and project delivery \n\
    Land acquisition is made based on regular concession as well as expropriation procedures stipulated in \n\
    laws.    \nBefore construction starts, the water user group and its training process for irrigation system operations \n\
    and maintenance are established under the regulation by The Cooperatives Act, B.E. 2542 (1999) and the \n\
    royal decree on Farmers Group, B.E. 2547 (2004).The constructed irrigation system is transferred to other \n\
    organisations such as Local Administration. The operations and maintenance of tertiary systems, including \n\
    irrigation businesses, are usually handled by water use groups. \n \nc.  Rules for cost benefit analysis \n\
    The project approval process in Thailand involves a project worthy decision analysis, in which costs and \n\
    benefits of the irrigation project are valued into the monetary term.  There are three criteria commonly used \n\
    for decision, namely Economic Internal Rate of Return, Net Present Value and Benefit‐Cost Ratio. Ordinary \n\
    decision criteria are the followings: \n \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) > appointed Discount Rate (Loan Interest Rates) \n\
     \nNet Present Value (NPV)>0, and  \n \nBenefit‐Cost Ratio (B/C)>=1. \nBesides the ordinary cost‐benefit analysis, non‐market values are taken into consideration. Greenhouse gas \n\
    emission, livelihood changes, stress and anxiety, improvement in transportation and education are among \n\
    the items to be considered. \n \nd.  Jobs to be contracted out  \nIn Thailand, planning, design and construction control jobs can be outsourced besides construction work in \n\
    the case of complex construction projects that require advanced engineering techniques and technical \n\
    expertise. Only juristic persons are hired as the consultant.  Engineering work are contracted out usually only \n\
    for large and medium scale irrigation projects. Three executive committees are organised for the supervision \n\
    of the outsourcing process: namely, Executive committee for consultant employment (selection/agreement), \n\
    Executive committee for academic consultant supervision, and Executive committee for approval and \n\
    disbursement. \n \ne.Scope of work of irrigation agency \nThree departments implement irrigation projects in Thailand. Their scopes of work in law are as follows: \n\
    1) Royal Irrigation Department (RID)  \nAccording to the Royal Decree Organizing the Royal Irrigation Department, Ministry of Agriculture and \n\
    Cooperatives, B.E. 2554(2011),the duties and responsibilities of the RID include the followings:  \n\
     \nImplementation of activities aimed at achieving, collecting, storing, controlling, distributing, draining \n\
    or allocating water for agricultural, energy, household consumption or industrial purposes according \n\
    to the People Irrigation Act, the State Irrigation Act (No.5), the Field Dykes and Ditches Act, and other \n\
    related laws. \n \nImplementation of activities related to prevention of damages from water; safety of dams and \n\
    appurtenant structures; safety of navigation in command areas and other related activities that are \n\
    specified in the annual plan. \n47 | P a g e  \n \n \nImplementation of land consolidation for agriculture according to the Agricultural Land Consolidation \n\
    Act. \n \nImplementation of other activities designated by laws or properly assigned by Cabinet or Minister. \n\
    2) Water Resources Department \nThe Water Resources Department, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, was established by \n\
    the Act to amend ministry, sub‐ministry and department B.E. 2545 (2002). Its duties include followings: \n\
     \nTo implement and make policies, plans, and measures related to water resources. \n\
     \nExecutive management, development, conservation, and rehabilitation of water resources including \n\
    the control, supervision, coordination, follow‐up, evaluation and settlement of water resources \n\
    issues. \n \nTo develop academic knowledge and to stipulate standards as well as to transfer water resources \n\
    technology for both whole system and watershed levels. \n3) Department of Groundwater \n\
    The Department of Groundwater, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, was also established \n\
    by the Act to amend ministry, sub‐ministry and department B.E. 2545(2002). Its mission and duties \n\
    relevant to irrigation development are as follows: \n \nDevelop and manage groundwater resources to their full potential so as to promote the growth of \n\
    the nation development in a sustainable manner. \n \nDevelop equitable groundwater allocation systems for stakeholders from all regions and sectors. \n\
     \nf. \nInternal organisations  \n1)  Project planning \nIn the RID of Thailand, Project Management Office under the Deputy Director General for Engineering is \n\
    responsible for project planning in both medium scale and large scale water development projects. The \n\
    PMO draws preliminary project layout, which involves a study on general socio‐economic contexts, \n\
    economic analysis, engineering plans, public participation reports and an environment impact study. \n\
    2) Construction \nThe Office of Large Scale Water Resources Management, the Office of Medium Scale Water Resources \n\
    Management and Operation, Divisions for Construction Project 1‐17 under the Deputy Director General \n\
    for Construction perform their functions in the project construction.  \n3) System operations and management \n\
    The Office of Water Management and Hydrology, the Regional Irrigation Office 1‐17 and the Office of \n\
    Central Land Consolidation are responsible for system operations and management. These offices are \n\
    under the Deputy Director General for Operation and Management.  \nEach irrigation project (provincial irrigation projects and operation and maintenance projects being \n\
    implemented by Regional Irrigation Offices) has the following organisations: \n\
     \nAdministration support branch; \n \nEngineering branch: responsible for engineering work planning, control budgets; \n\
     \nWater management and irrigation project improvement branch: responsible for irrigation allocation \n\
    planning for various purposes and drainage; \n \nMechanic branch: responsible for controlling and maintenance of machinery, communication tools, \n\
    gate and gear motor and electrical tools within irrigation area; \n \nOperation and maintenance branch: responsible for controlling irrigation supply within irrigation area. \n\
     \ng.  Project cycle time and project cycle management   \nOperations and maintenance works are coordinated among internal divisions and other government offices, \n\
    as well as farmers and water user associations in accordance with the Master Plan (construction plan, budget \n\
    48 | P a g e  \n \nplan, workforce plan, machinery plan and resource plan) and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). \n\
    Though the budgeting is done yearly basis, MTEF is used for expenditure planning in advance for 3‐5 years \n\
    under the strategic development plan of each government organisation. This process enables flexibility in \n\
    budgets requests, budget use, and prioritisation of work. \n \nh.  Collaboration with extension services and agricultural economists \n\
    The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) and the Department of Agriculture (DOA) of the Ministry of \n\
    Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) are responsible for agricultural extension services in Thailand. \n\
    The Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) of MOAC is responsible for agricultural policy consideration and \n\
    strategic planning.  The DAE, DOA and OAE work closely. \nRegarding the collaboration between the irrigation sector and extension services, extension services are not \n\
    involved in the planning and design stage of irrigation projects. They focus on post construction follow‐up \n\
    activities of on‐farm level.  \n \ni. \nInformation sharing in the project cycle \n\
    Planners and designers, designers and construction supervisors, and among designers do routinely exchange \n\
    knowledge and information, contact each other for follow‐up, and advise and collaborate in Thailand.  \n\
    Typical communication process among the planner, designer, and construction supervisor in the engineering \n\
    process are described as follows:  \n \nIn the beginning, the expected construction supervisor contacts the planner to share information on the \n\
    project objectives, location, topography, weather data, etc. to facilitate the feasibility study.  \n\
     \nOnce the project is judged as feasible, the construction supervisor submits the feasibility report to the \n\
    designer.  \n \nThe designer performs field investigation, layout, design, and provide construction drawing together with \n\
    the followings: \no Confirmation of appropriate land acquisition process; \no\
    \ Invitation of farmers to discussion about the project, design, land devoting, land compensation \n\
    etc. accompanying the construction supervisor; and \no Consultation with geologists for investigating foundation conditions.  \n\
     \nThe designer submits construction drawings to the construction supervisor.  \n\
     \nOnce the construction processes have in‐field problems, the construction supervisor contacts the \n\
    designer/senior experts/advisory experts in Office of Engineering and Architecture Design for field visits \n\
    and revising construction drawings. \n \n6. Procedures for water resources management \n\
    a.  Legal framework for water rights \nLegal titles for the abstraction of water from water courses, lakes and other expanses of surface waters, and \n\
    for the extraction of groundwater are granted based on various principles and laws.  Some countries have an \n\
    independent law to establish water rights and others do not.  Some water rights are based on land ownership \n\
    or possession. Use‐based rights are another major type.  The use‐based water rights rely on whether the \n\
    water user has legal access to the water source.  This use‐right is typically based on prior use.  Such rights are \n\
    granted only for actual and beneficial use and usually not tradable. The administration process to grant water \n\
    rights varies depending on the aforementioned principles as well as pertinent laws.   \n\
     \nIn Thailand, there is no single law that stipulates principles or processes to establish water rights at the time \n\
    of writing this report. The office in charge of each water resources development project administrates the \n\
    planning and coordinating process in compliance with pertinent laws. As the National Water Resources Act is \n\
    49 | P a g e  \n \nbeing drafted, such a situation may change soon. The draft covers who is responsible for issues resulting from \n\
    water balance and who has the authority for water resources management, follow‐up, evaluation and \n\
    development, water user organisations, watershed boundary, compensation for water crisis and disasters \n\
    associated with water management, water licensing, water resources and rights in water resources, water \n\
    resources policy, planning, control and allocation, penalty for violation of the Act, etc.    \n\
     \nb.  Process of new water resources development \nWater resources developments in Thailand are planned in two tiers: basin planning and project planning.  \n\
    Basin planning aims at problem identification, objective and target setting, and identification of measures to \n\
    be applied for solving problems. Basin planning can be composed of desk study, preliminary study and \n\
    comprehensive study. The followings are the eight steps of the basin planning: \n\
    1) Data collection  \n2) Integration planning \n3) Problem identification \n4)\
    \ Introduction of methods for solving problems and seeking an appropriate project \n\
    5) Environment study \n6) Project selection \n7) Operation plan (priority setting) \n\
    8) Report writing \nProject planning has various purposes: clarification of engineering feasibility, investment worthiness, \n\
    environment effects, etc. Project planning can be composed of a reconnaissance study, pre‐feasibility study \n\
    and feasibility study.  \n1) Study of the needs \n2) Specification of project location \n\
    3) Diagnostic check of general quality of watershed \n4) Calculation of agriculture, industry and domestic water demands \n\
    5) Hydrological assessment \n6) Defining of project type \n7) Preliminary project design and system layout \n\
    8) Estimation of investment costs  \n9) Construction plan \n10) Merits assessment of the project \n\
    11) Environmental and ecological impact assessment \n12) Analysis of investment worthiness \n\
    13) Report writing \nAll planning and studies are conducted in a sequential work flow. \n\
     \nc.  Fishermen’s right in rivers and natural water bodies \nFisheries are taken into account in the participation process in the project planning and design.  In Thailand, \n\
    fishermen are registered and permission for being engaged in fishing as well as licenses for using fishing \n\
    implements are granted in accordance with Thai Fisheries Act, B.E. 2490 (1947). This act and the Act \n\
    Governing the Right to Fish in Thai Waters B.E. 2482 (1939) governs and regulate the fishery sector. \n\
     \nd.  Requirement for minimum/environmental flow \nBecause no water flow may be observed during dry seasons in the natural condition, there is no clear concept \n\
    of minimum or environmental flow in the legal system in Thailand. The Enhancement and Conservation of \n\
    National Environmental Quality Act B.E. 2535 (1992), however, demand the minimum and maximum levels of \n\
    50 | P a g e  \n \nacceptable concentration of substances in the environment. This may be referred to for discussions on \n\
    environmental flow.   \n \ne.  Rules for environmental impact assessment \n1)\
    \ Environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nEnvironmental impact assessment shall be performed for both pre‐feasibility study (PS) and feasibility study \n\
    (FS) as a reconnaissance study (RS) is not necessary. The study process takes around 15 months. Reports are \n\
    submitted to the Office of the National Environment Board. FS requires not only EIA but also social impact \n\
    assessment (SIA) and health impact assessment (HIA). For a project that has a value of more than 1,000 \n\
    million Thai baht (about US$33 million at an exchange rate of 30.5 Thai baht/US$), a strategic environmental \n\
    assessment (SEA) is required. \nThe types of irrigation projects that should perform EIA (TYPE 1) \n\
    a. The large scale project (storage capacity higher than 100 million m3, watershed area is larger than 15 \n\
    square kilometres, and the irrigated area is larger than 12,800 hectares). \n\
    b. Dams, reservoirs and irrigations having construction budgets greater than 200 million Thai baht \n\
    (~US$6.6 million at an exchange rate of 30.5 Thai baht/US$). \nc. All water resources development projects in the watershed class 1B, in the important national \n\
    watersheds as well as in watershed class 1A. \n2) Initial Environmental Examination (IEE)  \n\
    IEE means an initial assessment of project using basic information of secondary data (e.g. country map, \n\
    military map, project location, project characteristics) and data from the field survey. Its study process takes \n\
    around 8 months. \nThe types of projects that should perform IEE (TYPE 2) \na.\
    \ Retention dam, reservoir and irrigation having construction budgets greater than US$1.6 million but \n\
    less than US$6.6 million (at an exchange rate of 30.5 Thai baht/US$) or having a construction \n\
    duration of more than one year. \nb. Construction project (e.g. convey pipe, road, high‐voltage electricity wire) that passes national \n\
    parks/national reserved forests. \nc. Irrigation weir projects. \n3) Environmental Checklist  \n\
    The Environmental Checklist is a report of environmental information. Its study process takes around 4 \n\
    months. The report shall be submitted to the Royal Forest Department, which is responsible for consideration. \n\
     \nf. \nOther regulations applied to river works \nNo other regulation applies. \n\
     \n \n7. Participation and cost sharing \na.  Participation of farmers in the planning process \n\
    In Thailand, regulations of the Office of the Prime Minister on Hearings B.E. 2548 (2005) provide an \n\
    opportunity for the public to participate in the planning and decision of all government projects. Please also \n\
    refer to General protocols of irrigation projects.   \nAnother driver for farmers’ participation in water supply planning and management is the quality oriented \n\
    strategic approach for increasing water‐use efficiency.  The Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) is \n\
    applied for farmers/water users who are the targets of irrigation water management. This approach plays \n\
    important roles for involving farmers in decision‐making of irrigation water allocation planning and \n\
    management, as well as irrigation operations, construction, and maintenance. It also involves cooperation \n\
    51 | P a g e  \n \nbetween irrigation agency and the local administrations, namely Provincial Administration and Sub‐District \n\
    Administration Organization, according to the government’s power decentralisation policy.   \n\
     \nb.  Roles of water user organisations in construction and system operations \n\
    1) Investment/project initiation process \nWater user organisations (WUO) have no role in the project initiation process in Thailand. WUO are \n\
    established in accordance with relevant laws only after a project plan is approved. Once the WUO is \n\
    established, the government provides training. WUOs are involved in decision‐making in the construction \n\
    process onwards. People’s participation in the planning process is secured in accordance with the Regulations \n\
    of the Office of the Prime Minister on Hearings B.E. 2548, as described in earlier sections.   \n\
    2) Operations and maintenance activities \nMajor activities of WUO are water allocation operations, system maintenance, and organisational \n\
    management: \na. Water allocation operations and system maintenance \n \nCooperation with irrigation officials in planning water operations for a season of water supply. \n\
     \nWater demand survey and reporting the survey results to irrigation officials. \n\
     \nOrganisation of Water User Congress to inform the members about water allocation plan for the \n\
    season and the outcomes of WUO activities. \n \nMeeting with water user groups of each ditch to make them perform rotation water schemes. \n\
     \nFacilitation of cooperation among water users to maintain ditch and irrigation infrastructures in a \n\
    good condition. \n \nMobilisation of members to work for the improvement of structures to supply water to the \n\
    secondary canals and ditches and to improve drainage. \nb. Organisational management \n\
     \nTo draft disciplinary regulations of WUO. \n \nTo contract with members and control WUO operations in accordance with the contract in an \n\
    equitable manner. \n \nTo maintain the member directory. \n \nTo organise elections of ditch chiefs, canal heads, and committee members for each of their duty \n\
    term. \n \nTo establish funds to expend on water operations and system maintenance \n\
     \nTo evaluate the operation works of WUO annually and for each water‐supply season. \n\
     \nPublic relations activities and reporting on the financial status and WUO outputs to the members. \n\
    c. Other activities \n \nTo preserve the environment avoiding pollution and maintain natural water sources. \n\
     \nTo organise such activities for public benefits such as cleaning of important places and public \n\
    canal excavation. \n \nTo promote and develop agricultural services for the members. \n\
     \nTo market the agricultural produce of members for appropriate prices. \n\
    \ \nTo organise cultural events and self‐help activities for strengthening the membership. \n\
     \nc.  Cost sharing framework  \nCost sharing between farmers and the government is tried only in a few pilot schemes in medium and large \n\
    scale irrigation projects.  In the pilot scheme, the irrigation agency has an irrigation management agreement \n\
    with farmers, by which farmers have to bear about 20‐50% of total on‐farm construction costs or assigning \n\
    the duty and function of irrigation water supply and infrastructure maintenance of on‐farm, sub‐lateral \n\
    (tertiary canal), and lateral (secondary canal) levels to WUO in accordance with the appointed targets. In \n\
    52 | P a g e  \n \nother words, cost sharing can be done either by money or in‐kind. For the pipeline irrigation projects with \n\
    pumping systems, farmers are also responsible for bearing about 20‐50% of the electricity cost. These cost \n\
    sharing schemes are also supported by Agricultural Sector Program Loan, which is organised by Cooperative \n\
    Promotion Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. \n \nd.  Legal status of water user organisations and relevant regulations \n\
    For system operations and legal basis of water user organisations (WUO), WUO are defined as Juristic Person \n\
    and Non‐Juristic Person as follows: \n \nNon‐Juristic Person \n(1) Water Users Group (WUG): this group has a controlled area covered by one farm turnout or one ditch \n\
    (tertiary level). Its structure comprises of one chief (may have a number of assistants as needs) and water \n\
    user members. A controlled area of one group is less than 160 hectares. \n(2) Integrated Water Users Group (IWUG): this group has a controlled area covered by main canal, lateral or \n\
    sub‐laterals (secondary level) or one irrigated zone or whole irrigated command area. Its structure comprises \n\
    of many water users groups that are using water from the same water source/canal. The management \n\
    system is ratified committees of water resource, main canal, lateral/sub‐laterals, irrigated zone, and ditch \n\
    levels. The controlled area of one group is less than 3,200 hectares. \n \nJuristic Person \n\
    (1) Water Users Association (WUA): the WUO registered under the Ministry of the Interior in accordance with \n\
    the Civil and Commercial Code 1992 Books I Title II Chapter II Part II section 78‐109 “Associate”. WUA has the \n\
    same boundary and structure of organisation management as IWUG and has non‐beneficiary purposes \n\
    (emphasised on irrigating water management). \n(2) Water Users Co‐operative (WUC): the WUO registered under the Cooperatives Promotion Department \n\
    applying the Cooperatives Act, B.E 2542 (1999). WUC has irrigation water management as the main purpose. \n\
    It also does business, whose benefit can be shared.  Its boundary and structure of organisation management \n\
    are the same as IWUG. \n \nThe WUO registered under regulation of the Cooperatives Act, B.E 2542 and the Royal Decree on Farmers \n\
    Group B.E. 2547 has the following organisations: \n \nGeneral assembly/delegated assembly \n\
     \nPresident and vice president \n \nExecutive committees  \n \nAudit commission \n\
     \nSecretariat \n \nBoard of consultant and promotion \nThe assembly is held at least once a year for the election of the president and executive committee members, \n\
    discussion on policies and regulations, reporting, approval of budgets and work plans.  The delegated \n\
    assembly may replace the general assembly if the number of member is more than 100. The President \n\
    represents the WUO and chairs executive committees.  The executive committees are composed of seven \n\
    positions that include chiefs, turn‐out keeper, planning‐planting, accounting, unit service.  The duty term of \n\
    the executive committee members are four years. Under the executive committees, chiefs of water use \n\
    management, chiefs of irrigation zone, chiefs of canal and chiefs of basic group take charge or lead daily \n\
    operations. \n \n \n53 | P a g e  \n \ne.  Protocols for land acquisition and compensation \n\
    For medium and large scale irrigation projects, there are protocols for land acquisition and compensation in \n\
    irrigation projects. For small scale irrigation project, farmers donate their land for water resources \n\
    development. \nFor here, small scale irrigation project is defined as follows: \n\
     \nIrrigated area is less than 320 hectares for weir type project and irrigation system development as \n\
    well as water network development project. \n \nWatershed area is smaller than 320 ha; runoff at 25 years of return period is less than 15 m3/s for the \n\
    regulator/drainage dam. \n \nStorage capacity ranges 0.5‐2 Mm3 for the Kaem Ling Project. \n\
     \nConstruction plan is less than 1 year. \nThere are four protocols for land acquisition and compensation in irrigation projects. \n\
    (1) Acquisition of land with documents of right \nThe acquisition and compensation process of private land with title deed and utilisation certificate is as \n\
    follows: \n \nan announcement of project construction \n \nInformation sharing with the Bureau of Land Law (BLL) \n\
     \nsatellite image processing \n \npublic participation \n \nland survey and boundary marking \n\
     \nreception of claims from right holders \n \ncadastral survey \n \nland title mapping and making land owner check list \n\
     \ndetermination of compensation rates in accordance with the Act on Expropriation of Immovable \n\
    Property, B.E. 2530  \n \ninvestigation by the land right‐acquisition/land ownership branch.  \n\
     \napproval of land compensation rates \n \ntransfer of land ownership in accordance with the Ratchaphatsadu Land Act, B.E. 2518. \n\
     \n(2) Expropriation  \nWhen the aforementioned process fails, the Royal Decree on Expropriation (announce in the Royal Gazette) \n\
    is applied for the investigation of the land compensation rates as follows: \n\
     \nThe RID informs the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives to pass the Royal Decree on \n\
    Expropriation draft to the Secretariat of the Cabinet for approval and present it to His Majesty the \n\
    King for signature. \n \nLand owner is called for making a land sales and purchase agreement contract \n\
     \nIf land owner does not agree, he can appeal to the Deputy Minister within 60 days after receiving the \n\
    notice of payment. \n \nThe Deputy Minister reconsiders the contract and inform land owner within 60 days \n\
     \nIf Deputy Minister does not reconsider or land owner does not agree with Deputy Minister’s decision, \n\
    he can appeal to the Administrative Court.  \n \nFinal decision is made by the Administrative Court. \n\
     \n(3) Acquisition of land without document of right \nThe procedures are similar to the ordinary case.  To give all stakeholders to make claims, the name list of land \n\
    owners who have the right to receive compensation is published. The protocol is based on the resolution of \n\
    the Cabinet on July, 11th B.E. 2532 (1989). \n54 | P a g e  \n \n \n(4) Relocation and special compensation \n\
    In such cases as relocation of residents is necessary due to reservoir construction, the Government allocates \n\
    new land for emigrants to compensate the affected people due to the water resources development. \n\
    However, if land owners do not agree for relocation, special compensation will be made.  Other process is \n\
    similar to (1) and (3). \n \nf. \nOwnership of irrigation systems  \nAll irrigation structures and the ground including the preserved land for maintenance become government \n\
    assets being acquired through the protocols for land acquisition and compensation. Though they will be \n\
    controlled and managed by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID), some of them will be transferred to the \n\
    Department of Local Administration in accordance with the Ratchaphatsadu Land Act, B.E. 2518 (1975). \n\
     \n8. Design codes and manuals \na.  Official planning/design codes and their coverage \n\
    For the design code in official planning/engineering works, the Engineering Institute of Thailand (EIT) \n\
    standards are used. EIT standards collect information about acceptable standards of practice applicable to \n\
    the design of all buildings, design guidelines, design specification and codes to be followed, details, criteria \n\
    for construction, calculation and structural analysis, standards for testing of materials (i.e. American Standard \n\
    Testing Manual, ASTM). In designing concrete structures, there are three methods being used in Thailand, \n\
    namely Working Stress Design (WSD), Strength Design (SD) and Post‐tensioning design. All methods follow \n\
    the America Concrete Institute (ACI) codes, which is a technical and educational society dedicated to \n\
    improving the design, construction, maintenance and repair of concrete structures. Moreover, EIT standards \n\
    provide the standards for design, control, installations, damage prevention, regulation and its \n\
    implementation that cover the contexts of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, construction, \n\
    water resources engineering and environment and other fields related to engineering works. In Thailand, \n\
    there are own construction materials and products. For controlling the quality of production, Thai Industrial \n\
    Standard (TIS), which is controlled by Thai Industrial Standards Institute (TISI) of Ministry of Industry, is \n\
    responsible as various standards for testing are practiced (e.g. ASTM; Japanese Institute of Standards, JIS; \n\
    ACI; E.I.T. standard). All standards shall be announced in Acts and ministerial regulations for legal regulations. \n\
    In irrigation and water resources development fields, standards and guidelines by the United States Bureau \n\
    of Reclamation (USBR) and United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) are also used for planning, design \n\
    and construction. \n \nb.  Official planning/design manual \nThere are official planning and design manuals written in Thai language. All manuals describe the procedural \n\
    work flow, too. Those manuals are prepared for professional design control in accordance with Thai legal \n\
    standards and international standards, criteria for design development and review procedures (e.g. \n\
    investigation structure after construction for both workability and failure). The manuals explain about legal \n\
    protocol sequence and their application for different kinds of planning, design, construction, operations and \n\
    management work. Examples of official planning and design manuals are given as follows: \n\
     \n‐ \nWork Manual for Project Planning. \n‐ \nWork Manual for Operation and Water management. \n\
    ‐ \nWork Manual for Design Procedures of Headwork and Appurtenant Structures. \n\

    ‐ \nStandard for design headwork (dam, weir, pump, gate and other.) \n‐ \nStandard for design canal and its structures \n\
    ‐ \nStandard for material quality \n \nc.  Language used in the code/manual \n\
    The official manuals and design manuals are written in Thai language except the variables and equations, \n\
    which are referenced by English terminologies.  \n \nd.  Information on relevant regulations   \n\
    The work manuals provide guidelines to refer to and procedures and regulations to follow for engineers, civil \n\
    work technician and relevant staffs. The manuals are expected to minimise all design mistakes as well as to \n\
    show the sequence of standard work. The work manuals usually contain the following sections: \n\
     \nPurpose  \n \nScope \n \nDefinition and Technical Terms \n \nResponsibilities \n\
     \nWork Flow \n \nStep Procedure \nThe Step Procedure section contains methods, explanations, as well as short description of relevant \n\
    theoretical knowledge needs. \n \ne.  Time and incentives to read through the manuals \n\
    Staff engineers hold Controlled Engineering Profession license certified by Thai Council of Engineers by taking \n\
    the necessary exam. In addition, government organisations offer trainings for engineering staff occasionally, \n\
    in short courses (3‐5 days) and long courses (around 1 month) so that staff have the capacity to practice and \n\
    read through the whole contents of planning/design manuals. They also receive training certificates, which \n\
    may work as an incentive to study for the training records that are referred to in the consideration of position \n\
    promotion or work assignments.    \n \n56 | P a g e  \n \nf. \nIssues or steps that are not followed \n\
    Staff engineers usually follow the rules and procedures. There is no prominent issue that requires different \n\
    practices. There are cases, however, that complicated problems require more sophisticated methods than \n\
    those given in the manual which offers only general basic planning and design operations.   \n\
     \n9. Irrigation design/planning in general \na.  General goal of irrigation developments \n\
    Goals of water management in Thailand are focused on irrigation development, an increasing efficiency of \n\
    water management for whole system (watershed) in order to mitigate water scarcity and flood severity. This \n\
    includes an extension of irrigated command area expansion at around 33,000 hectares of land area per \n\
    annum as the first goal taking into consideration to promote the food security coupled with the promotion of \n\
    good environment quality through irrigation development. The goals also involve an increasing ability of \n\
    adaptation against the effects of climate change and disaster issue at nation, area, and commodity levels.  \n\
     \nb.  Customs to make a reference note in the design work \nThere is no such a custom for engineers who work based on manuals that describe the procedures for data \n\
    collection, methodology for field observation, analysis method of data and information, parameters needed \n\
    for analysis (engineering, social, economic and environment dimensions), including standard criteria and law \n\
    to be used for the evaluation and measurement of economics of the irrigation project, safe and stability of its \n\
    structure. These also include charts and tables for analysis and judgment in both planning and designing. \n\
     \nc.  Verification of design works   \nIn the planning and designing procedures, design engineers (civil engineer/irrigation engineer) collect data \n\
    and information for design, including planning project report, feasibility report/preliminary study report, \n\
    topography survey report, etc. All data will be used for project layout, design, analysis, construction drawing, \n\
    as well as for writing a design calculation report, which shall be verified by civil engineers of professional and \n\
    senior professional levels for the first correction. After the first correction is accepted the work will be passed \n\
    for scrutiny by a civil engineer of expert level before being presented to the Director of Office of Engineering \n\
    and Architecture Design, the director of project management, and other relevant positions being involved in \n\
    the design process. The Deputy Director‐General gives final approval for the use of construction drawing in \n\
    the construction process. In planning process, an approval of reports usually ends at the director of project \n\
    management before being submitted to the Director of Office of Engineering and Architecture Design for the \n\
    use in the design process and project approval. \nThe procedures for the verification of design works are as follows: \n\

    Internal coordination within RID is practiced to create Master Plan and Medium Terms Expenditure \n\
    Framework.  \n \nf. \nDesign adjustment based on actual data or experiences \n\
    Design codes in Thailand contain sets of default parameter values (e.g. concrete strength, steel strength and \n\
    materials’ properties) to be used for designing. However, actual data from in‐situ and laboratory tests may be \n\
    substantially different. To design with more likely parameter values, the data obtained by in‐situ and \n\
    laboratory tests in the regions that have similar general or specific properties and environments can be \n\
    applied. All design engineers revise their design whenever the actual data obtained by in‐situ and laboratory \n\
    tests is not consistent with the values used in the design process to avoid structure malfunction and failure. \n\
     \ng.  Feedback mechanism to rehabilitation projects and design codes \nInfrastructure improvements and maintenance works are investigated every year after completion. Pre‐\n\
    investigation for improvement, repair and rehabilitation are usually a responsibility of operation and \n\
    maintenance projects.  In practice, joint investigation by both designers and operation and maintenance \n\
    projects commonly takes place for smooth work. The initial criteria for maintenance of the irrigation project \n\
    are as follows: \n1) Either the damage is severe or the frequency of the damage and malfunction is high. \n\
    2) The structure is more than 15 years old, it cannot work in accordance with the purposes and \n\
    demands, andit requires high maintenance costs. \n3) There is a need for improving irrigation efficiency either because the current efficiency is lower than \n\
    the designed efficiency value or because the current socio‐economic conditions require improved \n\
    irrigation efficiency. \n4) There is a potential to develop water resources by improving the efficiency of existing irrigation \n\
    systems.  \nIn addition, economic and social costs shall be taken into consideration for improvement and rehabilitation. \n\
    There are also procedures for checking if the workability and performance of the structure in question is in \n\
    accordance with those specified in the design code. This includes the monitoring, investigation and \n\
    calibration of the discharge coefficients of irrigation infrastructures to check and adjust the designed \n\
    discharge.  \n \n58 | P a g e  \n \nViet Nam \n1. Situation of higher education\
    \ in the area of irrigation engineering \na.  Colleges and Universities \nThe situation of college departments that produce irrigation engineers is clearly different among member \n\
    countries.  In Viet Nam, the Civil Faculty, Water Resource Faculty, and Irrigation Faculty of Ho Chi Minh City \n\

    Chapter I: Overview of college/university curricula \n \nIntroduction \n \nCambodia\
    \ is dominated by distinct tropical monsoon divided into two seasons and most\
    \ of the territory is \ncontrolled by the Mekong River Basin. Cambodia has a potential\
    \ of land and water resources. Most parts of \nCambodia’s economy relies on the\
    \ agriculture sector and 80% of Cambodian people are mainly working in this \n\
    sector. So, being aware of the significant role of agriculture in poverty reduction,\
    \ the Royal Government of \nCambodia integrates agriculture to be one of the priorities\
    \ in the government’s Rectangular Strategy. But, \nagriculture is still limited\
    \ due mainly to lack of quality standard, finance, crop diversification, market’s\
    \ \ninformation; especially the level of technical education and training for\
    \ planning and irrigation is not enough to \nincrease the agricultural production.\
    \  \nBased on the above-mentioned reasons, the University, \nTechnical Institute,\
    \ Research Institutes and many agricultural \nSchools have been established by\
    \ the Royal Government of \nCambodia (RGC) to support the agriculture field. Currently,\
    \ \nthere are one agricultural university called Royal University of \nAgriculture\
    \ (RUA-www.rua.edu.kh) and many National \nAgricultural Schools located nationwide,\
    \ such as Preak Leap \nNational School of Agriculture (www.pnsa.edu.kh). \nRoyal\
    \ University of Agriculture \n \nPreak Leap National School of Agriculture \n\
    \ \nhttp://www.itc.edu.kh\nFurthermore, the Institute of Technology of \nCambodia\
    \ (ITC) is the most famous institute of \nengineering in the country. The ITC\
    \ is a \nCambodian Higher Education Institution which \nwas founded in 1964 and\
    \ supported by cooperation \nbetween Cambodia and the former Soviet Union. \n\
    One faculty among others was called hydraulics \nthat \nhad \neducated \nhundreds\
    \ \nof \nHydraulic \nEngineers who work for the government, NGOs \nand private\
    \ sectors, as a specialist of water \nresources.   \n84 | P a g e  \n \n \nNew\
    \ building at ITC \nIn 1993, the RGC and French governments agreed to renovate\
    \ and update the education standards of the ITC \nwith a perspective to improve\
    \ performance of the administration and financial services along with the \neducational\
    \ system of the institution and the human resources development.  \n \nMore than\
    \ 10,000 executive members have \ngraduated from the ITC. They are currently \n\
    working intensely on the economic and social \ninfrastructure development of Cambodia.\
    \ In the \ncurrent context of globalisation and fast \ntransformations of new\
    \ technologies, the ITC’s \nmain concerns are to play an efficient role in \n\
    Cambodian society and to be at the cutting \nedge \nof \ndevelopment \nto \nimprove\
    \ \nour \neducational system. \n \nThere are 6 departments at ITC: Dpt. of Food\
    \ Tech. & Chemical Engineering., Dpt. of Civil Engineering \n&Architectural (+Ms),\
    \ Dpt. of Electrical & Energy Engineering, Dpt. of Information & Communication,\
    \ Dpt. \nof Rural Engineering (+Master pro.), and Dpt. of Geo-resources & Geotechnical\
    \ Engineering.  \nThe Rural Engineering Department replaced the Hydraulics Faculty\
    \ with support of French Cooperation. And \nsome courses in the curriculum were\

    \ \n \n \n1.2 Soil, Plant and Water Relationship and Irrigation System planning\
    \ \nOverview of the subject \nPlants grow on soil that provide them water and\
    \ nutrients. They absorb water from soil mainly through roots \nand use only 1\
    \ to 1.5% of the volume of water absorbed for building their vegetative structure\
    \ and performing \nvarious physiological and biochemical activities. The rest\
    \ of the water absorbed is lost through transpiration. A \ncloser relationship,\
    \ therefore, exists between soil, water and plant that should be clearly understood\
    \ to decide \nupon the time and depth of irrigation and to make the most efficient\
    \ use of irrigation water. \nTo produce agriculture effectively, irrigation engineers\
    \ need to know how to control the sufficient amount of \nwater. For instance,\
    \ soil and plants will be dry and wilt if they lack water. Thus, it is necessary\
    \ to irrigate them. \nIn terms of water demands, Department of Rural Engineering\
    \ of ITC also provides a course of Irrigation and Water \nmanagement as well as\
    \ irrigation system planning. The main content of this course subject are the\

    \ \nOverview of the subject \nThe flow of water in an open channel is called free\
    \ surface, takes place under the action of gravity forces and is \ncharacterised\
    \ by a mandatory presence of a free surface current, usually air under pressure\
    \ atmospheric. The free flow of \nwater is a lot more complicated than the flow\
    \ over because the presence of a free surface causes changes in the following\
    \ \nsection the length of liquid flow when obstacle meaningful phenomenon. Current\
    \ free surface can be permanent, non-\npermanent, uniform and non-uniform. Wholes\
    \ channels can be subdivided into two categories: natural and artificial \nchannel:\

    \ program on agricultural irrigation \n \nIntroduction \n \nAs mentioned above,\
    \ the agriculture sector is a vital contribution to  Cambodia’s GDP. To increase\
    \ agricultural \nproduction, water resources management and irrigation system\
    \ planning play a very important role to execute \nwater policy. Therefore, the\
    \ RGC formulated a new necessary institution, Ministry of Water Resources and\
    \ \nMeteorology in the second mandate. The conveyance capacity of irrigation systems\
    \ was expected to increase \nfrom 3.32% to 4% annually in agriculture 5 year (1998-2003)\
    \ plan, and irrigation system for agriculture was \nplanned to increase up to\
    \ 374,603.00ha. With the framework of evolving policy context, the General \n\
    Department of Irrigation, Meteorology and Hydrology has upgraded the capacity\
    \ to become a Ministry of \nWater Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) based on\
    \ proclamation NS/RKM/0699108, dated June 23rd, \n1999. \n Views of MOWRAM Building\
    \ \nBesides the high education level, the governmental training programme plays\
    \ a very significant role in \nagricultural irrigation and water resources management\
    \ in Cambodia. Therefore, a training centre called the \nTechnical Service Center\
    \ (TSC) for irrigation and meteorology was established by Royal Government of\
    \ \nCambodia’s sub decree on December 2006 under the MOWRAM’s umbrella. The TSC’s\
    \ duty is to strengthen \nthe capacity of MOWRAM (central & provincial levels)\
    \ and to recruit new staff.   \n101 | P a g e  \n \n \nTRAINING PROGRAMME \nMOWRAM/TSC\

    \     Introduction \nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) is classified\
    \ as one of the least developed countries \n(LDC) in South East Asia with an estimated\
    \ GDP per capita of US$841 in 2012. Its economic \ndevelopment largely depends\
    \ on rural development. Agriculture is the most important sector for the \neconomic\
    \ development, contributing to around half of GDP and employing approximately\
    \ 80% of the \nlabor force. \nThe Agriculture and Forestry Sector has always been\
    \ the key sector in the national economic \nstructure since the declaration of\
    \ independence and the founding of the Lao People’s Democratic \nRepublic in 1975.\
    \  After the adoption of the New Economic Mechanism and the open-door policy in\
    \ \n1986, economic growth rates of Lao PDR were stronger throughout the nineties,\
    \ despite the Asian \nfinancial crisis. Growth since the start of the new millennium\
    \ has been steady in a stable macro-\neconomic climate. The Lao PDR has become\
    \ an active partner in the Association of South East Asian \nNations (ASEAN) and\
    \ other regional cooperation initiatives. \nTo achieve the foundations of Lao\
    \ PDR’s national development goal, certain strategies have been laid \nduring\
    \ the past 30 years of peace and development in the country:  \n• Moving consistently\
    \ towards a market-oriented economy; \n• Building-up the needed infrastructure\
    \ throughout the country; and \n• Improving the well-being of the people through\
    \ greater food security, extension of social services \nand environmental conservation,\
    \ while enhancing the spiritual and cultural life of the Lao multi-\nethnic population.\
    \ \nThe National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) is the strategic\
    \ framework aiming at \ntackling poverty and achieving the government’s goal of\
    \ graduating from the least developed country \nstatus by 2020. The NGPES has\
    \ a dual objective: (1) to enhance growth and development, and (2) to \nreduce\
    \ poverty, with a particular focus on poverty alleviation in 47 poorest districts\
    \ (Improving \nLivelihood in the Upland of Lao PDR). \nTo achieve these objectives,\
    \ the agriculture and forestry sector is essential as it supports the \neconomic,\
    \ social and cultural basis for more than 80% of the population and accounts for\
    \ more than \none-half of the GDP. These facts make the sector one of the key\
    \ components of the NGPES. \nTo support the agricultural development process,\
    \ the Government of Lao PDR has given high priority \nto agriculture and forestry\
    \ research. This can be seen through the establishment of the National \nAgricultural\
    \ and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI) in 1999. NAFRI continuously received\
    \ strong \nsupport from international organisations and has, in a relatively short\
    \ period, established itself as the \nkey national organisation in agricultural\
    \ research with a number of notable achievements in the \ngeneration and dissemination\
    \ of new technologies and in agricultural and farming systems research \n(Ministry\

    \ Lao PDR is a complex issue and can be viewed from many perspectives. For the\
    \ Lao \nmulti-ethnic culture, poverty has a particular meaning, as it refers to\
    \ those families that have been \nstricken by misfortune and/or are the least\
    \ well-off in a given community.  \nMost of the poor are living in the upland,\
    \ mountainous and hilly areas. The uplands present a \ndifferent set of problems\
    \ due to their remoteness, inaccessibility, endemic rural poverty, poor credit\
    \ \nand capital accessibility, and other factors. These include all problems of\
    \ transforming and shifting \ncultivation farming systems away from “low-input:\
    \ low-output” systems in order to stabilise \ncommunities, enhance productivity,\
    \ improve the socio-economic environment, and minimise the \ndegradation of the\
    \ natural resources base. With increasing population density in the upland areas,\
    \ the \npresent farming systems inevitably condemn upland rural people to continue\
    \ to live in poverty.  \nThere are at least six major types of constraints to\
    \ agricultural growth and development in the \nuplands: \n1. Lack of markets and\
    \ markets’ information flows  \n2. Inadequate access to transport and road links\
    \ \n3. Low incidence of rural savings and investment \n4. Absence of productivity\
    \ enhancing technology flows \n5. Slow implementation of formal land tenure arrangements\
    \ \n6. Insufficient community- based irrigation infrastructure needed to optimise\
    \ water resource \nproductivity within the agricultural sector. \nIrrigation is\
    \ one of the core subjects and has a long traditional history in water resource\
    \ engineering. \nIn order to achieve a good engineering design, designers need\
    \ to have concrete basic knowledge on \nwater and its related problems such as\
    \ meteo-hydrology, soil, plant and water relationships, irrigation \nsystem planning,\
    \ socio-economic evaluation, and the design of irrigation. \nThere are two academic\
    \ campuses that provide a course on irrigation engineering in Lao PDR: \n1. The\
    \ Water Resources Engineering Department (Established in 1981 by the Ministry\
    \ of Education, \nTourism and Sports); \n2. Thangone Irrigation College (Established\
    \ in 2000 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry). \n \n \n \n \n114 | P\

    \ \n \n \n2.1.1 Background \nThe Water Resources Engineering Department (WRED)\
    \ was established in 1981. It is a department \nunder the Faculty of Engineering,\
    \ National University of Laos, Ministry of Education and located in \nTadthong\
    \ Campus. WRED is the only educational institution offering higher diplomas and\
    \ Bachelor \ndegrees in Irrigation and Management. Many graduates from WRED are\
    \ recruited in the Irrigation \nDivision of the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry\
    \ Services Office and the District Agriculture and \nForestry Services Office.\
    \ They work closely with farmers on irrigation farming activities. WRED \nruns\
    \ both a 5-year Bachelor’s Degree programme and 4 year higher Diploma courses.\
    \ The main \nactivity at WRED is to provide students with educational services\
    \ such as lectures, and hands-on \nexperience in laboratories in order to produce\
    \ qualified students. Tadthong campus is situated in the \nvast area of 24.4 ha\
    \ on Route 13 North, 15 Km west from Vientiane Capital. It has been an excellent\
    \ \nplace in terms of providing practical classes to students and training courses\
    \ to locals. \n2.1.2 Objectives \n To produce high qualified human resources\
    \ in irrigation engineering and water resources \nmanagement in the region.  \n\

    case of Thailand \n \n \n1. Overview of college/universities curricula \nAs described in an earlier section, an academic provision associated with irrigation engineering plays \n\
    an important role in providing irrigation knowledge as well as a technical design. There are seven universities \n\
    and  one  college  in  Thailand  having  potential  to  offer  bachelor’s,  master’s \
    \ and  doctoral  programmes  in \nirrigation, namely Kasetsart University, Asian Institute of Technology, University of Chulalongkorn, KhonKaen \n\
    University,  Mahanakhorn  University,  Thammasart  University,  King  Mongkut’s \
    \ University  of  Technology \nThonburi and Irrigation College.  \n \nTechnical certificate systems in civil and irrigation engineering are simply categorised into two main \n\
    certificates.  One  is  a  bachelor’s  degree  certificate,  which  can  be  acquired \
    \ from  the  universities  and  the \ncolleges in Thailand as it provides subjective and selective courses of 4 years to complete the degree. The rest \n\
    is a certificate that aims to provide more knowledge in civil and irrigation techniques, civil engineering work \n\
    on operation and management, water resources engineering and management in the areas of civil, water \n\
    resources, agriculture and irrigation; this certificate is set up as a short course, which period varies between \n\
    3‐5 days and up to one month. To obtain the first certificate, the student who has completed his/her high \n\
    school education needs to undergo the admission’s system or entrance system provided by the Ministry of \n\
    Education. The curricula to obtain the first certificate is fixed, but the second type of certificate system is \n\
    different  depending  on  the  policy  of  each  academic/institute.  To  obtain \
    \ the  second  type  of  certificate, \nstudents can attend above‐mentioned universities. The Thai Council of Engineers and Irrigation Development \n\
    Institute provide civil and irrigation engineering curricula. Both certificate systems also have credits and fee \n\
    charges. \n \nAs also mentioned in the section “Career Path of Irrigation Engineers in the Government” (Section 2, \n\
    the 1st assignment), study courses in the engineering programme shall be certified by The Office of the Higher \n\
    Education  Commission.  Furthermore,  to  work  as  an  irrigation  engineer \
    \ in  the  career  path  of \ngovernment/company, the study course shall also be certified by the Office of the Civil Service Commission \n\
    (OCSC) affiliated with the Office of the Prime Minister and Thai Council of Engineers. This causes the study \n\
    course on engineering program of all universities is similar.  \n \n \nWe  will \
    \ use  the  bachelor  of  engineering  programme  in  civil  irrigation  (updated \
    \ 2013)  offered  by \nKasetsart University as an example. Since various relevant mandatory subjects more than 40 subjects are \n\

    \ \n \n147 | P a g e  \n \n1. Introduction \nIrrigation is one of the most important\
    \ subjects with a long traditional history in water resource \nengineering. In\
    \ order to make a good design, engineers need to have concrete basic knowledge\
    \ about water and \nits related problems. Meteo-hydrology, soil plant and water\
    \ relationship, irrigation system planning, socio-\neconomical evaluation, and\
    \ design of irrigation works are usually the subjects that have to be taught in\
    \ many \nuniversities all over the world. In principle, these are the many steps\
    \ of an irrigation planning project (eg. \nfigure 1). \n \nFigure 1. Steps for\
    \ an irrigation planning project \nFirstly, with knowledge of meteo-hydrology,\
    \ water resource engineers can improve their ability in terms \nof water quantity\
    \ and quality, its change in time and space. Furthermore, they study ways to exploit,\
    \ use and \ndevelop water resources sustainably. Besides understanding of meteo-hydrology,\
    \ engineers can also assess \nrisks and damages which originate from water. These\
    \ factors are inputs from water resources engineers in \nirrigation project planning.\
    \ \n \nSecondly, after determining available water resources in each region, engineers\
    \ need to accurately \ndetermine the water requirements of the economic sectors\
    \ such as agriculture, industry, and tourism.  \n \nNext, the system of irrigation\
    \ works is planned and designed in the project. The tasks of this system are to\
    \ \nadapt the water needs while still ensuring to develop water resources sustainably.\
    \ Finally, economic \ncalculation and environment impact assessment on each project\
    \ are the important elements to determine the \nfeasibility of the irrigation\
    \ project. In summary, basic knowledge of water resources is necessary for water\
    \ \nengineers and the universities are responsible for teaching this. \n \nTo\
    \ meet the needs of human resources for the field of water resources planning,\
    \ many universities are assigned \nwith the education of water engineers. Currently,\
    \ there are about 15 universities and 11 colleges that have the \nfunction of\
    \ training human resources in the area of water resources in Vietnam. Every year,\
    \ thousands of \nstudents graduate from these universities and are recruited to\
    \ work at the agencies of water resources. Their \ntraining quality is quite good\
    \ and the number of good students accounts for 30% of the total of graduated \n\
    students. Some universities have achieved high results in education and are evaluated\
    \ as the best ones in Viet \n148 | P a g e  \n \nNam, such as the University of\
    \ Technology in Ho Chi Minh City, Water Resources University, Can Tho \nUniversity,\
    \ and University of Agriculture. However, these universities have still many drawbacks\
    \ in education \nquality. Most universities mainly focus on teaching theories,\
    \ but have little consideration for practices and \nupdating new technologies.\
    \ As a result, it takes junior engineers usually 3-5 years to be able to work\
    \ \nindependently. In order to reduce these constrains and improve employee’s\
    \ professional skills, the Government \nallows universities and other agencies\
    \ to organise technical training classes for their employees. Governmental \n\
    training programmes usually focus on technical skills such as new geodesic methods,\
    \ modern technology, and \nnew calculation methods. These training programmes\
    \ may be organised regularly or casually.  \n \nFigure 2. Dissemination of knowledge\
    \ in water resource \nIn summary, to work effectively, water resources engineers\
    \ in Viet Nam need to attend training courses at \nuniversities and updated training\
    \ from government agencies. This report will show an overview of the training\
    \ \ncontents for some necessary topics of water resources engineers. The report\
    \ consists of three main parts, which \ngive a general overview and training content\
    \ of the topics in universities and training courses. Although each \nuniversity\
    \ often uses its own curriculum for their students, the information reported here\

    1.2. Soil, plant and water relationship \n1.2.1. Overview of the universities\
    \ \nFor a long time, Vietnamese farmers have recognised the importance of the\
    \ relationship among soil, water \nand plants. Of them, water is considered the\
    \ most important factor because it is necessary for the growing of \nsoil and\
    \ plants. Soil needs water to maintain microorganisms, and preserve the fertility\
    \ and porosity of soil, \nwhilst plants are able to live and grow due to water.\
    \  In fact, water accounts for more than 70% of the total \nweight of plants.\
    \ Also, water can balance the temperature and humidity in the soil and the air\
    \ near the ground. \nTo produce agriculture effectively (i.e. plants grow with\
    \ a high yield), engineers in water resources and \nagriculture need to know how\
    \ to control the sufficient amount of water. For instance, soil and plants will\
    \ be \ndry and withy if they lack water, and thus, it is necessary to irrigate\
    \ them. When water is in excess, it will \ncause the inundation of soil and plants,\
    \ and so drainage is necessary in this case. To determine the exact \n154 | P\
    \ a g e  \n \nschedule of irrigation and drainage for crops and soil, the engineers\
    \ need to understand about the relationship \nbetween soil, water and crops. This\
    \ is the reason why the relationship between soil -water- plant is often \nincluded\
    \ in the programme curricula of the universities which have courses about agriculture\
    \ and water \nresources such as Can Tho University, University of Agriculture,\
    \ University of Agriculture and Forestry, \nWater Resources University \nMost\
    \ curricula such as irrigation systems (Dr. Le Anh Tuan, Can Tho University),\
    \ design of irrigation \nsystems (University of Civil Engineering), planning and\
    \ design of irrigation systems (Water Resources \nUniversity) often have one chapter\
    \ to introduce about the relationship between land, water and crops. In detail,\
    \ \nthey include the contents about the influence of water on crops, the role\
    \ of water for land, water balance \nprinciple. In this report, the textbook of\
    \ irrigation systems at the Can Tho University is selected to represent \nthese\
    \ contents. \n1.2.2. Main contents of the textbook \nIrrigation and Drainage Systems\
    \ is one of the leading courses for students in irrigation and agriculture, \n\
    and even environment and rural development. This course is designed with two credits,\
    \ which are equivalent to \n30 lectures. The main contents of this textbook are\
    \ divided into six chapters: \n- \nChapter 1: Introduction on the course and the\
    \ basic concepts of irrigation - drainage \n- \nChapter 2: The relationship between\
    \ soil-water and plants \n- \nChapter 3: Crop water requirements \n- \nChapter\
    \ 4: Irrigation system \n- \nChapter 5: Drainage works \n- \nChapter 6: Management\
    \ of irrigation and drainage systems. \nThe assignments of the course will help\
    \ students to use empirical formula and application in lectures. In \nlectures,\
    \ teachers will suggest questions to discuss in a class or group. Also, students\
    \ can watch short films \nabout technology of irrigation - drainage. In addition,\
    \ students can have field trips to study the operation of \nirrigation systems.\
    \ \n \n \nFigure 5. Practice model for land, soil and water study \nThe general\
    \ objective of the course \"irrigation-drainage systems\" is to provide background\
    \ knowledge for \ncalculating crop water requirements. Therefore, students will\
    \ be prepared with the basic knowledge of \nirrigation and drainage, including:\
    \ \n- \nRelationship between soil, water, and plants; \n- \nIdentification of\
    \ the kinds of water resources and water quality; \n155 | P a g e  \n \n- \nCalculation\
    \ of the evaporation from plants \n- \nDetermination of crop water requirements\
    \ depending on the growth stages. \n- \nMethods and techniques of irrigation and\
    \ drainage. \n- \nMethods of irrigation management to obtain the highly technical\
    \ and economic efficiency. \nAfter completing this course, students can gain the\
    \ general understanding of irrigation and drainage. They \nwill know about the\
    \ complex relationship between soil-water -plant, which is the key to calculate\
    \ water \nrequirements for agriculture in design, construction and operation of\
    \ irrigation-drainage systems. On the other \nhand, an effective irrigation-drainage\
    \ system is necessary to stably develop crops, limiting the influence of the \n\
    erratic weather and natural conditions related to water, soil and plants. However,\
    \ to reach this goal, students \nshould have the broad knowledge and understanding\
    \ of both technical and economic, and social issues from \npractical experiences.\
    \ \n1.2.3. Government training programmes \nThe relationship between soils, water\
    \ and plants is a basic knowledge and is often the main course in the \nuniversities\
    \ as mentioned in 2.2.1. Thus, there is few training about this issue in Viet\
    \ Nam. \n \n1.3.Irrigation system planning \n1.3.1. Overview of the universities\
    \ \nIrrigation system planning is one of the most significant courses for water\
    \ resources engineers. It provides \nthe knowledge for suggestion, layout and\
    \ calculation of irrigation systems. This course is generally included \ninto\
    \ the study plan of civil engineering in the University of Technology, University\
    \ of Transportation, and \nwater resources engineering in the Water Resources\
    \ University. \nThe Water Resources University was established in 1959 for all\
    \ fields of Water Resources Engineering. \nThe Faculty of Water Resources Engineering\
    \ was originated from the Faculty of Irrigation and Drainage in \n1966. Until\
    \ today, this faculty has educated more than 6,000 engineers, hundreds of maters\
    \ and doctors. The \nstudents graduated from the faculty have successfully worked\
    \ in many fields relating to water resources \nengineering. As a result, many\
    \ of these students have become leaders and managers in local and governmental\
    \ \norganisations. Currently, the annual number of full-time students enrolling\
    \ into this faculty is 500.  \nTable 2. Some main courses of water resources engineering\

    \ \n- \n \nSoftware That Models the Hydraulic and Water Quality Behavior of Water\
    \ Distribution Piping Systems \n3.1.3.1. Description \nEPANET is a software that\
    \ models water distribution piping systems. EPANET is a public domain \nsoftware\
    \ that may be freely copied and distributed. It is a Windows 95/98/NT/XP programme.\
    \ EPANET \nperforms extended period simulation of the water movement and quality\
    \ behaviour within pressurised pipe \nnetworks. \nPipe networks consist of pipes,\
    \ nodes (junctions), pumps, valves, and storage tanks or reservoirs. \nEPANET\
    \ tracks: \n- The flow of water in each pipe, \n- The pressure at each node, \n\
    - The height of the water in each tank, and \n- The type of chemical concentration\
    \ throughout the network during a simulation period, \n- Water age, \n- Source,\
    \ and \n- Tracing. \n3.1.3.2. Capabilities \nEPANET's Windows user interface provides\
    \ a visual network editor that simplifies the process of \nbuilding piping network\
    \ models and editing their properties and data. EPANET provides an integrated\
    \ \ncomputer environment for editing input data. Various data reporting and visualisation\
    \ tools are used to assist in \ninterpreting the results of a network analysis.\

    Manning formula \n- Include minor head losses for bends, fittings, etc. \n- Model\
    \ constant or variable speed pumps \n- Compute pumping energy and cost \n- Model\
    \ various types of valves, including shutoff, check, pressure regulating, and\
    \ flow control \n- Account for any shape storage tanks (i.e., surface area can\
    \ vary with height) \n- Consider multiple demand categories at nodes, each with\
    \ its own pattern of time variation \n- Model pressure-dependent flow issuing\
    \ from sprinkler heads \n- Base system operation on simple tank level, timer controls\
    \ or complex rule-based controls \nIn addition, EPANET's water quality analyser\
    \ can: \n- Model the movement of a non-reactive tracer material through the network\
    \ over time \n- Model the movement and fate of a reactive material as it grows\
    \ (e.g., a disinfection by-product) or \ndecays (e.g., chlorine residual) over\
    \ time \n- Model the age of water throughout a network \n- Track the percent of\
    \ flow from a given node reaching all other nodes over time \n- Model reactions\
    \ both in the bulk flow and at the pipe wall \n- Allow growth or decay reactions\
    \ to proceed up to a limiting concentration \n- Employ global reaction rate coefficients\
    \ that can be modified on a pipe-by-pipe basis \n- Allow for time-varying concentration\
    \ or mass inputs at any location in the network \n- Model storage tanks as being\
    \ complete mix, plug flow, or two-compartment reactors \n3.1.3.3. Applications\

    \ \nThus, there is few training about this issue in Viet Nam. \n \n3.3. Construction\
    \ management, operations, of pipeline, pump, and headwork facilities \n3.3.1.\
    \ Overview \nMany irrigation projects in Viet Nam now have low efficiency. Therefore,\
    \ there is a need to find an \nappropriate management model to improve the efficiency\
    \ of the irrigation system. Decentralisation irrigation \noperators are assigned\
    \ from government irrigation management to agencies, organisations, local subordinates.\
    \ \nThe decentralisation of local government organisations is a basis for the\
    \ transfer of management \nresponsibilities for irrigation water cooperatives.\
    \ This is one of the requirements to ensure that the irrigation \nsystem to promote\
    \ efficiency and ensure service of agricultural production, livelihood and other\
    \ economic \nsectors, to respond to the requirements of industrialisation and\
    \ modernisation of agricultural production. \n179 | P a g e  \n \nThe decentralised\
    \ management of irrigation operators has advantages and promotes the role and\
    \ capacity \nof the beneficiaries to participate in management of irrigation works.\
    \ The following are some proposals for the \ndecentralisation of management to\
    \ improve the efficiency of management and exploitation of irrigation works: \
    \ \n- The decentralisation of management and exploitation of irrigation works\
    \ should be based on the \nsize and capacity of the facility, administrative boundaries\
    \ and the complexity in the management \nand threat level for downstream when\
    \ an incident occurs. \n- Division of management responsibilities should be clearly\
    \ defined between the exploitation of \ncompanies irrigation works with individuals,\
    \ organizations and management, particularly in the \noperation, protection and\
    \ maintenance to ensure work safety. \n- Decentralisation of irrigation management\
    \ to organisations should be associated with \nmanagement works. Beneficiaries\
    \ are responsible for payment of funds for management, \noperation and maintenance.\
    \ \n- For irrigation works by any level of management, the organization that directs\
    \ operation and \nmaintenance must be in accordance with procedures, rules and\
    \ requirements for irrigation of the \nirrigation system. \n3.3.2. Government\
    \ training programmes \nIn Viet Nam, the irrigation management company is responsible\
    \ for construction management, operation \nand maintenance of irrigation systems.\
    \ Training courses for managers are held annually. \nTo enhance the performance\
    \ of management units as well as operation of irrigation works, head works, \n\
    and main canals; development and use of cooperative organizations is the key,\
    \ which was the main content of \nthe discussion in the workshop \"Improving management\
    \ efficiency irrigation exploitation\" held by the \nIrrigation Department (MARD).\
    \ \nAccording to the report of the Irrigation Department (MARD), in 2012 there\
    \ were 16,238 water using \ncooperatives operating in many different models. In\
    \ particular, the model accounts for a majority of the \naggregate service cooperatives,\
    \ which makes irrigation services. \n180 | P a g e  \n \n \nWorkshop: Improving\
    \ management efficiency irrigation exploitation \nAccording to the draft proposal\
    \ \"Improving the efficiency of the management and exploitation of \nirrigation\
    \ systems\", specific tasks of irrigation industry by 2020 are as follows: Increase\
    \ of efficiency of \nirrigation by 80%, 5% increase of the irrigated cultivated\
    \ area compared to the current, 10% reduction of \nenergy consumption in service,\
    \ and about 10% saving of irrigation water for crops on the same acreage. \n181 | P\

    \ \ninformation system application, on-farm soil and water management and pump\
    \ and pipeline systems.  \n \nIn Cambodia, there were many studies on the field\
    \ related to water resources, irrigation and drainage, \nagriculture for the development\
    \ of water resources and agricultural activities and projects. But unfortunately\
    \ \nthe documents of the studies or information are still limited. On the other\
    \ hand at the university level or \nresearch centre, there was also a lack of\
    \ research activities or documents. \n \nSo in these matters, we have the difficulty\
    \ of getting the information and documents of the researches or \nstudies to complete\
    \ our assignments on time. \n \nThe authors wish to thank MOWRAM, TSC for sharing\
    \ some of the information needed. We also thank Mr \nItaru Minami for his cooperation,\
    \ support and guidance that helped us to understand more about the context to\
    \ \ncomplete this report, and CNMC for its coordination. And the authors would\
    \ like to thank the Mekong River \nCommission for the establishment of this capacity\
    \ building programme. \n \n \n \n184 | P a g e  \n \nHydrology \nReview of history\
    \ \nToday, over 80 per cent of the population of Cambodia live in rural areas\
    \ and about 73 per cent depend on \nagriculture for their livelihoods. Agriculture\
    \ and Water Resources are the high priority sectors in the \nGovernment’s policy\
    \ and are strongly supported by the Government of Cambodia. In this regard, agriculture\
    \ \nand rural development have been considered as a sustainable growth source\
    \ for the Cambodian socio- \neconomy. In order to improve agricultural productivity,\
    \ the rehabilitation and development of irrigation \ninfrastructure is needed\
    \ and considered as priority, however, it is not depending on the irrigation system\
    \ alone. \nIt would be supported by other factors such as soil.  \n \nMeteo-Hydrology\
    \ is the science that studies the water in the nature and evolution of safe land\
    \ and soil in three \nstates: solid, liquid and gas. Therefore, hydrology is mainly\
    \ based on observation and measurement of the \nphenomenon of nature of which\
    \ human has virtually no control. \n \nCambodia is rich in water resources, especially\
    \ in the area along the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake. There \nis too much water\
    \ during the rainy season and lack of water during dry seasons. This matter causes\
    \ a lot of \nproblems for Cambodia in developing its activities on water and agriculture\
    \ sectors.  \n \nWith its water resources, in the past Cambodia used water for\
    \ the stability of monuments/temples and for \nagricultural activities (Angkor\
    \ temple, Baray reservoir and other systems). \nSome examples of research or study\
    \ are shown as follows: \n- Study report (2007), A distributed hydrological modelling\
    \ equipped with an ET sub-model for Prek Thnot \nRiver Watershed, Kompong Speu\
    \ province, Cambodia. \n- MRC (2005), The Overview of the hydrology of the Mekong\

    \ hydrological modelling equipped with an ET sub-model for Prek Thnot River Watershed,\
    \ \nKompong Speu province, Cambodia \n \n \nA. Research trend  \n- To upgrade\
    \ the watershed scale management for Prek Thnot watershed in terms of agriculture\
    \ \nimprovement and environmental protection. \nB. Research objective \n185 | P\
    \ a g e  \n \n- To establish a distributed system hydrologic model by combining\
    \ an existing distributed hydrologic model \nand an evapotranspiration (ET) sub-model.\
    \ \n- To establish a watershed model equipped with irrigation sub-model. \n- To\
    \ apply a watershed model for conducting irrigation planning and watershed-scale\
    \ water management \nplanning. \n \nC. Result of research \nA basic structure\
    \ of distributed hydrological modelling equipped with an ET sub-model was established,\
    \ which \ncan be applied to a watershed for the dry season. The model consists\
    \ of two layers and five sub-models \n(Evapotranspiration, Infiltration, Overland\
    \ flow, sub-surface lateral flow and channel flow). The model was \napplied in\
    \ Prek Thnot River watershed having distinct dry season with 500m x 500m grid\
    \ size. \nThe following conclusions were reached based on the model results:,\
    \  \n- A structure of a distributed hydrological model was established; the model\
    \ was successfully calibrated and \nvalidated. \n- The model’s ability to simulate\
    \ daily runoff at several gauging stations was indicated by high Model \nEfficiency\
    \ for Peam Kley and Ta Sal gauging stations. \n- This model provided a suitable\
    \ framework for next step: the establishment of irrigation sub-model. \n \nIn\
    \ order to model the effects of irrigation on the watershed water cycle, an irrigation\
    \ sub-model was \nestablished and added to the model. The following conclusions\
    \ were drawn: \n- The irrigation sub-model, which was able to simulate irrigation\
    \ water requirement, diversion water, field \nwater balance and total production,\
    \ was established. \n- The model was able to simulate the effects of the irrigation\
    \ scheme’s diversion, return flow on the river \nflow. \nThe completed model was\
    \ used to evaluate the impact of various changes in water use in the watershed.\
    \ The \nstudy concluded that: \n Prek Thnot River was most critical in water\
    \ resource availability. There was too much water during the \nrainy season and\
    \ lake of water during the dry season. In some years the rain came too late with\
    \ heavy flooding \nafterwards. \n Changing cropping schedule for rainy season\
    \ rice (medium and late rice) from 1st July to 1st August for \nmedium rice and\
    \ from 15th July to 15th August for late rice significantly reduces the irrigation\
    \ water deficit and \nconsequently the required storage, and increases the yield\
    \ of rice and its production. \n The possible use of the model to evaluate the\
    \ impact of various changes in water use in the watershed was \nconfirmed. \n\
     \nOverview of the hydrology of the Mekong Basin \n \n \nResearch objective \n\
    - To uncover and describe the key patterns and features of the Mekong Basin hydrology\
    \ and synthesise the \nresults in a way that provides some basic insights into\
    \ the regime of this fascinating river system. \n- To recognise the need for joint\
    \ cooperation and mutual consideration when planning and designing new \nwater\
    \ utilisation projects within a single trans-boundary river basin (as in the Mekong\
    \ Agreement of 1995). \n186 | P a g e  \n \n- To reduce detrimental downstream\
    \ effect from new upstream abstractions, from dam construction or inter-\ncatchment\
    \ water transfers. For example, at risk from any significant modification of the\
    \ mainstream flood \nregime would be Cambodia’s inland fishery, one of the world’s\
    \ largest and most diverse. \nThe Angkorian Hydraulic System, Siem Reap province,\
    \ Cambodia \n \nThe Khmer mastery of water engineering in ancient times is shown\
    \ in a range of Angkor’s hydraulic structures \nsuch as barays (constructed reservoirs),\
    \ moats, laterite weirs, bridges, ponds, canals and dykes. \nDue to the increasing\
    \ number of tourists every year and the rapidly growing population of the whole\
    \ region, \nthe demand for water is increasing dramatically, making water management\
    \ for the Siem Reap/Angkor area \nthe most critical issue for safeguarding the\
    \ monuments and for sustainable development. The challenge is to \nsatisfy the\
    \ needs of water for daily use while assuring the stability of Angkor temples\
    \ standing on the sand \nlayer and linked to the groundwater. \n \nAncient hydraulic system of Angkor \n\
    A. Research trend  \n- To analyse the flow from the upstream limit of the watershed\
    \ outlet from the Kulen plateau right through \nuntil the water spills in to the\
    \ Tonle Sap (Great  Lake) via three watersheds (The Pourk River in the West, \n\
    The Siem Reap River in the Center and the Roluos River in the East), \n- To rehabilitate\
    \ the ancient Angkorian hydraulic system in other to permit the restored cultural\
    \ landscape \nand general environment to recover their essential role of safeguarding\
    \ the monuments. \n \nB. Result of research \n187 | P a g e  \n \n- No inscription\
    \ from the Khmer Empire mentions either flood or drought in the Angkor region\
    \ and neither \ndo the Khmer people have a memory of disaster transferred from\
    \ one generation to another through \nlegends. \n- The challenge of water in the\
    \ hydraulic system around each temple is to secure water for daily use, while\
    \ \nassuring the stability of temple standing on the sand layer and linked to\
    \ the groundwater. \n- In 2004, the researcher team encountered drought in the\
    \ Angkor Wat moats and Srah Srang drying up and \nthis was followed by floods\
    \ in 2009, 2010 and 2011 (also this year 2013). \n- In 2012, the main part of\
    \ this system was rehabilitated, allowing Angkor and Siem Reap city to avoid \n\
    flooding during the rainy season of 2012. Without this work Siem Reap city would\
    \ have faced at least four \nsuccessive flood waves. The ancient Angkorian hydraulic\
    \ systemcan not only optimise water resource \nmanagement but also achieve flood\
    \ control. The era of Angkor’s prosperity, this imperial capital had \nefficient,\
    \ coherent and systematic hydraulic engineering. \n- In the present days, West\
    \ Baray (56 million m3), North Baray (5 million m3), Angkor Thommoat (nearly 2\
    \ \nmillion m3) and Angkor Wat moat (more than 1 million m3) can store more than\
    \ 65 million m3. During \nthe flood of 2012, they played a very important role\
    \ in absorbing water temporarily, facilitating flood \nmanagement. APSARA plans\
    \ to rehabilitate East Baray (more than 36 million m3) and Lolei Baray (10 \n\
    million m3)– which are now both completely dry – to gain a total storage of 111\
    \ million m3 and ensure \noverall water management and flood prevention as in\
    \ the era of Angkor. \n- An understanding of the Angkorian hydraulic system has\
    \ been able to authenticate many elements in the \nfield. Further work is required\
    \ to restore this system fully and ensure its continued maintenance. This \nprogramme\
    \ is a model of conservation/rehabilitation. Updating the Angkorian hydraulic\
    \ system appears to \nbe the most efficient and cost-effective way to contribute\
    \ to the development of the Angkor/Siem Reap \nregion in a sustainable way, and\
    \ to reduce poverty. \n \n               Phnom Kulen’s three watersheds: Pourk, Siem Reap and Roluos Rivers (L to R) \n\
     \nNo inscription from the Khmer Empire mentions either flood or drought in the\
    \ Angkor region, and neither do \nthe Khmer people have a memory of disaster transferred\
    \ from one generation to another through legends. It \nwould seem therefore that\
    \ these problems did not occur in the past, indicating that the water management\
    \ \nsystem in ancient times was capable of optimising water resources. But because\
    \ the ancient system had not \nfunctioned for such a long time, in 2004 we encountered\
    \ drought with the Angkor Wat moats and Srah Srang \ndrying up, and this was followed\
    \ by floods in 2009, 2010 and 2011. \n188 | P a g e  \n \nAn understanding of\
    \ the overall organisation of the Angkorian hydraulic system – rivers, barays,\
    \ moats, canals, \nponds and dykes – can be drawn from field identification of\
    \ water flow, highlighting channels and their \nconnections. Such field research\
    \ has revealed that the north-east section of the North Baray has dykes running\
    \ \neast–west and an ancient laterite bridge of multiple arc form on the Siem\
    \ Reap River, which could be used to \ncontrol the flow and discharge. Utilising\
    \ this distribution node, and the articulating channels, we managed to \ndistribute\
    \ water to the west (North Baray, West Baray and Stung River), to the east (Roluos\
    \ River) and to the \nsouth (moats of Angkor Thom and Angkor Wat and Siem Reap\
    \ River).  \nIn 2012, the main part of this system was rehabilitated, allowing\
    \ Angkor and Siem Reap city to avoid flooding \nduring the rainy season of 2012.\
    \ Without this work Siem Reap city would have faced at least four successive \n\
    flood waves. This result confirms that the ancient Angkorian hydraulic system\
    \ can not only optimise water \nresource management but also achieve flood control.\
    \ \n \nThe Hydraulic System of PreahVihear, Preah Vihear province, Cambodia \n\
    Preah Vihear was built directly on the rock layer, unlike the other Khmer temples\
    \ in the Angkor region or \nelsewhere on the plains which were built on the sand\
    \ layer, making them very sensitive to changes in the level \nof groundwater or\
    \ the degree of saturation of the sand. Nevertheless, the issue of water is still\
    \ a major \nchallenge for the management of this site, as it is indeed elsewhere\
    \ in the world. In this article we focus on the \nwater management system, including\
    \ water use and drainage. How did the Khmers in ancient times consider \nwater\
    \ in relation to heritage, and how did they manage it? Two main hydraulic systems\
    \ were established for \nthe site in ancient times, one on top of the hill (around\
    \ the temple), and the other at the foot of the hill (on the \nplain). \n \n \n\

    \ and drainage. How did the Khmers in ancient \ntimes consider water in relation\

    \ in climate and land use make imperative the development of integrated water\
    \ resources \nmanagement for the Preah Vihear Temple site, taking into consideration\
    \ some general recommendations: \no Meteorological stations should be installed\
    \ on the site. \no Surveys of discharge and inlet of all basins and barays should\
    \ be made in the rainy season. \no To ensure water sources to fill the barays,\
    \ it is necessary to protect the forest and reforest the whole \nregion. The forest\
    \ can play the role of not only restoring water sources for the region but also\
    \ \ncontribute to the sustainable development of ecotourism. \n189 | P a g e  \n\
     \n- This examination of the hydraulic system of Preah Vihear Temple shows that\
    \ the Khmer ancestors knew \nvery well the importance of water and how to manage\
    \ it. The basins and barays were designed neither for \nlandscaping and decorating\
    \ the temple, nor were for temple stabilisation as in Angkor or elsewhere on the\
    \ \nplain. They were built to ensure the daily needs of people living at the site\
    \ (managers and visitors) and can \nhopefully be restored to play such a role\
    \ once again in this World Heritage site that is starting to attract \nincreasing\
    \ numbers of visitors. \n \n \n \nPreahVihear Temple does not need water for stabilisation\
    \ or decoration, but for site management and visitors. \nAs this temple was built\
    \ on the highest point of the mountain, no spring or other water sources could\
    \ supply \nwater for daily use. \n \nTo solve this issue, six basins were built\
    \ to collect water during the rainy season, named following the \ndirection of\
    \ water flow from higher (south) to lower (north). All the basins have the same\
    \ typology: the lowest \npart is cut directly into the rock, the walls are constructed\
    \ from compacted soil, and the basins are lined with \nsandstone blocks to protect\
    \ them from soil erosion and also to help users to assess the water level in the\
    \ basin \nand to reach the surface at any point to take water for use. Vertical\
    \ infiltration can be considered as null \nbecause these basins were built directly\
    \ on the rock. Loss of water from the basin is mainly through horizontal \ninfiltration\
    \ because the walls have not been maintained for many years due to wars over the\
    \ centuries and the \ndrainage system has never been restored and/or maintained.\
    \ \nIn addition to \nmeeting the daily \nneed for water, these \nbasins serve\
    \ to reduce \nrunoff water from the \ntemple in order to \nprevent erosion \n\
    impacting on its \nstability. However, \ndue to the collapsed \ndrainage system,\
    \ the \nrunoff water flows \nuncontrollably, with \nthe result that some \nparts\
    \ of the temple \nhave already \ncollapsed, and other \nparts have tilted and\
    \ \nwill eventually also \nTypical  cross‐section  of  the  ancient  basins  of \n\

    \ \n \nSoil Mechanics \nUnderstanding variability in texture and acidity among\
    \ sandy soils in Cambodia \nThis research aims to understand variability in texture\
    \ and acidity among sandy soils from different parts of \nCambodia. The underlying\
    \ hypothesis is that parent materials have a strong influence on the key physical\
    \ and \nchemical properties of sandy soils in Cambodia. \n \nMaterials and methods \n\
    The research was conducted \nin 4 study areas: Coastal \nzone in Kampot District\
    \ of \nKampot Province; Tramkak \nDistrict of Takeo Province; \nPonhea Krek District\
    \ of \nKampong Cham Province; \nand \nKampong \nChhnang \nProvince (This figure).\
    \ Soil \nsamples were collected from \n8 sites in the study areas. \nTwo contrasting\
    \ sites in each \nstudy area were selected \nwith one at an upland location and\
    \ another in a low lying part of the area. At each site, a pit was excavated to\
    \ \n1.50 m depth. From the bottom of the pit, the soil was augured until reaching\
    \ approximately 2 m depth. Pits \nand cores were sectioned according to variation\
    \ of texture, colour, size and amount of stones. Approximately 1 \nkg soil was\
    \ collected from each layer at each site. Soil samples were air-dried and ground\
    \ to pass through a 2-\nmm sieve. \n \nConclusion \nVariations in particle size\
    \ distribution and acidity of sandy soils from different parts of Cambodia might\
    \ be \nrelated to the influence of different parent materials of these soils.\
    \ Proximity to granite and the coast was \nassociated with mostly coarse sand\
    \ fractions while sandstone and quartzite geologies were associated with an \n\
    abundance of fine sand. Clay contents were similar at most sites as they were\
    \ low in top layers and they \ngenerally increased at > 1 m depth. Soil pH values\
    \ were generally. \n \nRemote sensing (RS) and information system application\
    \ \nIntroduction \nIn Cambodia the satellite information, remote sensing and GIS\
    \ have become a useful and important tool in \nhydrology and to hydrologists in\
    \ the scientific study and management of water resources. Climate change and \n\
    greater demands on water resources require a more knowledgeable disposition of\
    \ arguably one of our most \nvital resources. As every hydrologist knows, water\
    \ is constantly in motion. Because water in its occurrence \nvaries spatially\
    \ and temporally throughout the hydrologic cycle, its study using GIS is especially\
    \ practical. GIS \nsystems previously were mostly static in their geospatial representation\
    \ of hydrologic features. Today, GIS \nplatforms have become increasingly dynamic,\
    \ narrowing the gap between historical data and current \nhydrologic reality.\
    \ \nThe elementary water cycle has inputs equal to outputs plus or minus change\
    \ in storage. Hydrologists make \nuse of a hydrologic budget when they study a\
    \ watershed. A watershed is a spatial area, and the occurrence of \nwater throughout\
    \ its space varies by time. In the hydrologic budget are inputs such as precipitation,\
    \ surface \ninflows, and groundwater inflows. Outputs are evapotranspiration,\
    \ infiltration, surface runoff, and \nsurface/ground water outflows. All of these\
    \ quantities, including storage, can be measured or estimated, and \n191 | P a\

    We perceive the surrounding world through our five senses. Some senses (touch\
    \ and taste) require contact of \nour sensing organs with the objects. However,\
    \ we acquire much information about our surrounding through the \nsenses of sight\
    \ and hearing which do not require close contact between the sensing organs and\
    \ the external \nobjects. In other words, we are performing Remote Sensing all\
    \ the time.  \n \n \nUsing Aster DEMS to produce IkonosOrthophotos \nIn many\
    \ areas of the world, it is difficult to obtain or create an accurate digital\
    \ elevation model (DEM). In \nother areas, obtaining an accurate DEM is prohibitively\
    \ expensive. Lack of an accurate or affordable DEM \nover certain areas of the\
    \ earth means that producing accurate orthophotos over these areas is difficult,\
    \ cost-\nineffective, or even impossible. ASTER, a sensor aboard NASA's Terra\
    \ satellite, provides low-priced Visual \nand Near-Infrared (VNIR), Thermal Infrared\
    \ (TIR), and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) data. The VNIR \nsegment of the data contains\
    \ stereo bands that can be used to produce DEMs. The DEMs derived from ASTER \n\
    data using control points extracted from IKONOS imagery are of sufficient accuracy\
    \ to allow the production \nof Reference Product (25m CE90) orthophotos from IKONOS\
    \ imagery anywhere in the world where ASTER \ndata is available. This paper outlines\
    \ the process for creating DEMs from ASTER data, including obtaining the \ndata,\
    \ necessary software, and an overview of the actual production steps. Included\
    \ are case study accuracy \nassessments in which DEMs produced from ASTER data\
    \ were used to orthorectify IKONOS imagery, and the \nresulting orthophotos compared\
    \ to those produced using DEMs of known accuracy derived from IKONOS \nstereo\
    \ data. \nASTER is a sensor aboard the Terra satellite, which was launched in\
    \ December of 1999. ASTER has two \ntelescopes, one nadir-looking and one back-looking,\
    \ which collect stereo data at 15-meter resolution. \nSpace Imaging’s IKONOS satellite\
    \ was launched in September of 1999. IKONOS is the world’s first \ncommercial\
    \ satellite to collect panchromatic imagery at 1-meter resolution and mult-spectral\
    \ imagery at 4-\nmeter resolution. \nTo achieve good accuracy using the PCI Ortho\
    \ Engine ASTER sensor model, accurate control points must be \npositioned at specific\
    \ locations on the ASTER imagery. As noted in previous studies, ASTER DEM accuracy\
    \ \nwill deteriorate in steeper terrain. However, in many instances, it is not\
    \ unreasonable to expect ASTER DEM \naccuracies to be comparable to USGS 1-arc\
    \ second DEM accuracies. \nGeographic information system (GIS) \nA geographic\
    \ information system (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate,\
    \ analyse, manage, \nand present all types of geographical data. The acronym GIS\
    \ is sometimes used for geographical information \nscience or geospatial information\
    \ studies to refer to the academic discipline or career of working with \ngeographic\
    \ information systems and is a large domain within the broader academic discipline\
    \ of Geo- \ninformatics. In the simplest terms, GIS is the merging of cartography,\
    \ statistical analysis, and computer science \ntechnology. \nApplication of remote\
    \ sensing and geographic information system \nIn recent years, the remote sensing\
    \ and geographic information system play the important role for some studies \n\
    and works. \nSome examples of study and work related to remote sensing and GIS\
    \ are shown as follow: \n- \nIn September 2011 and October 2013, Cambodia were\
    \ affected by natural disaster (serious flood) in flood \nplain areas around Tonle\
    \ Sap Lake and Mekong River, we \nused the COSMO-SkyMed and RADARSAT-2 to detect\

    \ Irrigation Sector Project of Cambodia (Punley Irrigation sub-project \nis located\
    \ in BanteayMeanchey province) 2006-\n2010, the engineers used some instruments\
    \ to \ndetect some works as follows: \n- \nUsing data from DGPS and topographical\
    \ map \nfor defining levees and location of canals layout, \nland ownership and\
    \ land parcel of farmers in \nirrigated command area and forming Farmer \nWater\
    \ User Groups (FWUC). \nCase Study Area at Prek Thnot (Lower Mekong \nRiver Basin)\
    \ \nAgriculture is the backbone of the Cambodian economy. In \norder to produce\
    \ food for an increasing population the land and \nwater resources have to be\
    \ used more sustainably. Soil and \nwater are the two main components of the agricultural\
    \ system \nand they are undergoing degradation in many aspects. Soils are \nbeing\
    \ degraded due to erosion, water logging, salinity etc. \nHence, knowledge about\
    \ the soils is important for any project \nplanning in order to satisfy the environmental\
    \ conditions. Soil \ndata is spatial in nature and they can be easily handled\
    \ and \nanalysed using GIS. Sharing and dissemination of information \nis easier\
    \ when the information is stored in digital form. Also \nthe data in GIS can be\
    \ analysed with other type of data to get \nthe desired information. \n Digital \
    \ Elevation  Model  (DEM)  analysis:  DEM plays a significant role in the grid-base\
    \ distributed \nhydrological model. The aim of DEM analysis was to delineate watershed\
    \ parameters. There are three kinds of \nDEM such as Contour Base Networks, Triagular\
    \ Irregular \nNetworks (TINs) and Regular Grid Networks (RGNs). The \nmost common\
    \ RGNs is the square grid due to their ease of \ncomputer implementation and computation\
    \ efficiency. In this \nstudy the RGNs were selected. By using digital contour\
    \ lines, \nwhich have 100m interval at the low land areas and 20m \ninterval at\
    \ mountainous area with scaling 1/100,000, land \nsurface was created by 3D Spatial\
    \ analysis TINs. The DEM \nwas done by converting TINs to grid by use ArcView\
    \ GIS 3.2 \nsoftware. After converting to grid, a 500m by 500m grid cell \nof\
    \ DEM was obtained. In ArcView, ANSWERS Extension \nwas used to process the DEM\
    \ and generate the hydrological \nparameters. \n \n Land  use  analysis:  Digital\
    \ land use data given by the  \nMinistry of Public Work and Transportation of\
    \ Cambodia \n193 | P a g e  \n \nwas used to analyse the vegetative types in the\
    \ watershed. The scale of this GIS land use data is 1/100,000. \nThere are seven\
    \ major land use classifications such as forest land, agricultural land, grass\
    \ land, shrub land, \nwater feature, barren land and built-up areas. These land-uses\
    \ were reclassified into two vegetative types. The \nfirst is a group of forest\
    \ and shrub and the second is a group of paddy field conditions including agricultural\
    \ \nland, grass land, barren land, water feature and built-up areas. This was\
    \ done so that they could be applied in \nEvapotranspiration (ET) sub-model. Codes\
    \ of these vegetative types were edited in the attribution by adding a \nnew field.\
    \ After coding them, the vector GIS coverage of land use codes was converted into\
    \ 500m grid using \nArcView GIS 3.2. The grid layer with land use codes was exported\
    \ to raster file so that land use code in the \ngrid cell can used in simulation\
    \ process. These data were not \nonly useful for ET sub-model but also for overland\
    \ flow over \nthe plan that is strongly affected by roughness coefficient. \n\
     Soil  type  analysis: The aim of the analysis was to convert \nGIS vector layer\
    \ of soil textures into grid. The digital soil type \nmap provided by the Ministry\
    \ of Agriculture, Forestry and \nFisheries was used to analyse in the study. The\
    \ soil investigation \ntest was funded by Japanese Society of Irrigation, Drainage\
    \ and \nReclamation Engineering. The soil investigation was conducted \non March\
    \ 2004 in dry season.  According to the results of soil \ninvestigation, the seven\
    \ soil types were converted into four soil \ntextures such as sandy loam, loam\
    \ and clay. The soil textures \nwere coded so that the GIS coverage of the soil\
    \ textures could be converted into grid. A grid cell was done \nwith 500m by 500m.\
    \ \n \n- \nCropland monitoring in area around Mekong River (including Tonle Sap):  \n\
    We used satellite land-use and land-cover datasets to guide us in determining\
    \ how much land was cropland. \nThese datasets sometimes misclassify large amounts\
    \ of land because they misinterpret the image data. For \nexample, flood plain\
    \ in the dry season looks a lot like low-intensity cropland, seasonally flooded\
    \ areas look \nlike water, and fallowed areas often resemble secondary forest\
    \ or bush. To avoid misclassification, we use \nthree different satellite datasets:\
    \ \n GLC2000  \n MODIS MCD12Q1 Land Cover 2008 L3 Global 500m and \n GlobCover\
    \ 2009. GLC2000 \nGLC2000 - the oldest of the three, but still reliable—has 1-kilometer\
    \ resolution, while MODIS Land \nCover data are at 500-meter resolution (we used\
    \ the 2008 version for land cover), and GlobCover 2009 is at \n300-meter resolution.\

     \n \nRelationship between on-farm water management and crop production \nThe\
    \ Royal Government of Cambodia has prioritised agriculture in all its major development\
    \ strategies, as the \nmain sector to alleviate poverty in the country. Rice is\
    \ the dominant crop in Cambodian agriculture and a rice-\nbased farming system\
    \ has existed in the country for more than 2,000 years. In order to increase the\
    \ rice yield, \nirrigation development has been seen as a key for rice development,\
    \ and investment in irrigation including \nimprovement in current irrigation system\
    \ and management, is among the top priorities of public investment in \nCambodia.\
    \ The share of public investment in the irrigation system over the government’s\
    \ total development \ninvestment has increased significantly in recent years.\
    \ \nTo support the above rice yield increased, the management and planning of\
    \ water distributing, it is convenient \nto fix the starting date of operations\
    \ (Main irrigation calendar: table 1).  This makes it easier for people in \n\
    charge of operating the scheme to plan and start preparations. \nTable 1 - The\

    (*) e.g. IR 66 \n \nIt is impossible to satisfy the contradicting requirements\
    \ of crops that are at a very different stage of maturity at \nthe end of the\
    \ season because some plots still require deep flooding while other crops where\
    \ the rice would be \nripe would require drainage and dry conditions for harvesting.\
    \  It is for this reason that the crops should be \nsynchronised as much as possible\
    \ and farmers should be made aware of this. \n \nStaggering of the starting date of crops \n\
    The plots will not be planted exactly at the same time but there will be a certain\
    \ staggering of the planting date.  \nIn practice often a spread of almost 2 months\
    \ can be observed. \nThe staggering of the starting date of rice crops is usually\
    \ determined by the farming system strategy of the \nfarmers.  Usually such considerations\
    \ as: ‘best plots first’, ‘closest plot to home first’, availability of labour\
    \ \nand ploughing capacity will determine how long it takes to establish the crop\
    \ on every plot of an area.  \nIrrespective of these factors, the minimum required\
    \ time for establishing a crop is set by the capacity of the \nirrigation system\
    \ to supply water during land preparation. \nIn order to flood the fields 200\
    \ to 300 mm is needed, for transplanting another 100 mm is needed.  \nThe system\
    \ is capable of delivering 2 l/s/ha, at 100% capacity. \nDuring land preparation/planting\
    \ it can be used at 120 % capacity and thus deliver:  \n2 l/s/ha x 120% x 86.400\
    \ s/day x 7 days/10 mm/m3 = 145 mm per week, rounded down to 140 mm. \nThus land\
    \ preparation and transplanting can’t proceed faster than (200…300 mm +100 mm)/140\
    \ mm/week = 3 \nweeks. \n197 | P a g e  \n \nFarmers customarily will plant their\
    \ traditional wet season rice varieties as soon as this is possible but will \n\
    often start a few weeks later if they cannot mobilise the resources to do this\
    \ earlier.  They will plant the \nphotosensitive varieties until the first week\
    \ of September. \nIt is however to be expected that farmers will try to get enough\
    \ water for land preparation on their field in the \nfirst two weeks of the irrigation\
    \ season and transplant during the third week or fourth week. \nTo manage water\
    \ more efficiently the Royal Government of Cambodia has announced in 1999 to the\
    \ relevant \ninstitutions a policy to set up the Farmer Water User Communities\
    \ (FWUC). This is a community self-help \napproach to ensure the sustainability\
    \ of dam systems; manage water for dry season cropping, and intensify \ncropping\
    \ and crop yield through effective water management.  \n \nThe main task of the\
    \ FWUC is to operate and maintain the system in order to provide the farmers with\
    \ water to \ngrow their rice crops especially for dry season rice.  In order to\
    \ achieve this, the FWUC will have to work with \nthe farmers, local authorities\

    \ in Northwest Irrigation Sector Project of Cambodia \n(Punley Irrigation sub-project\
    \ in BanteayMeanchey province): \nAs an easy way to manage the irrigation system\
    \ and irrigation requirement of each FWUC, in the case study of  \nPunley, reservoir\
    \ plays an important role in water storage for irrigating some crops at the late\
    \ of the wet season \nand especially for dry season crops. Upon the hydrological\
    \ calculation, the storage capacity of Punley reservoir \nis approximately estimated\
    \ as 3.1 MCM at the design Full Supply Water Level FSWL = 1.85m. The flooded \n\
    area is around 327ha. Graphic below illustrates the relationship between the storage\
    \ capacity and the water \nlevel in the reservoir. \n \nThe FWUC operator can\
    \ estimate the volume of water in the reservoir, he just observes the water elevation\
    \ on \na gauge at the wall of the spillway, then the operator can read a graphic\
    \ of reservoir routing curve (Water \nelevation = 1.85m it means the water storage\
    \ capacity = 3.1 million cubic meters. \nSystem Operator can estimate the flow\
    \ capacity of Head Regulators, Check Structures and Open Flume when \nthe gate\

    \ the field and to determine whether there is a need to \napply irrigation water\
    \ or to drain in the short-term is described \nbelow.  The method applies only\
    \ to rice. \nThe method consists of using a ‘reference station for in field \n\
    water management’ to determine the irrigation requirements \nweek by week as the\
    \ season progresses. It consists essentially of \nmeasuring and comparing water\
    \ levels respectively in an \ninfiltrometer, an evaporation pan and in the rice\
    \ field in which \nthey are installed, in combination with rainfall records obtained\
    \ \nfrom a rain gauge.  This allows determining the balance of \nevaporation and\
    \ rainfall, infiltration, and the combined leakage \nand ineffective rainfall.\
    \  Measurements can be made every few \ndays to weekly.  The measurements for\
    \ that reference station are \nthen considered valid for the whole area. The irrigation\
    \ \napplications to be given can be decided on basis of the measurements made\
    \ on station. In the initial phase of \nthe operation, it has to be verified that\
    \ the observation made at the station is really valid for the whole \nirrigation\
    \ area by finding the wettest and driest plot of each block. \nThe original method\
    \ is composed of determination of evapotranspiration, percolation and ineffective\
    \ rainfall of \na rice crop. A simplified version is used here in which the ineffective\
    \ rainfall is not determined but the water \nlevel in the field is used as a third\
    \ measurement. The water level in the field will reflect the combined effect of\
    \ \nlosses through leaking bunds and outlets and ineffective (drained) rain.  \n\

    12 September 2013 \n \n201 | P a g e  \n \n \n \n \n1. Background \n \nAgriculture\
    \ is the mainstay of the national economy. The productivity of the sector providing\
    \ three-\nfifth of output on which about 90% of the national population rely on,\
    \ is still low due to the lack of \nrural and agricultural infrastructure and\
    \ agricultural production technology. Most of the villagers in \nproject areas\
    \ suffer from poverty and continue to practice slash and burn shifting cultivation\
    \ with low \nyield. The Government Agricultural Sector Strategy focuses on achieving\
    \ self-sufficiency in food \nproduction, reducing the degradation of forests,\
    \ promoting crop diversification, proving rural \ninfrastructure following and\
    \ integrated area development approach and as part of area development, \nexpanding\
    \ irrigation development.  \n \nIrrigated agriculture is a sub-sector with a large\
    \ potential to contribute to the economic growth. The \ncountry’s opening to trade\
    \ over recent years introduced a new market demand for agricultural \ncommodities,\
    \ and has attracted investment interest in downstream agro-processing industries,\
    \ thus \noffering economic growth opportunities. Among the 13 measures of the\
    \ Ministry of Agriculture and \nForestry, the most directly related to irrigation\
    \ is “Irrigation and Prevention of Droughts and Floods”. \nIt includes “allocation\
    \ of irrigated areas in integrated agriculture development zones”, and \nimprovement\
    \ and expansion of reservoir systems which will also mitigate drought and floods;\
    \ \nmaintaining the irrigation pumps and promoting the use of economical energy\
    \ pumps.” MAF’s new \ndirection is to adopt a more holistic perspective of irrigation;\
    \ equal to “irrigated agriculture”, “rather \nthan as irrigation infrastructure\
    \ development.” \n \n2. Irrigation development \n \nIrrigation Development in\
    \ Lao PDR started a few hundred years ago in the northern part of the \ncountry.\
    \ There were a lot of traditional irrigation schemes in which the water level\
    \ was raised by \nsmall dams made of logs, earth and stones, thus enabling the\
    \ irrigation of about 30 ha, during the \nwet season.  \nIn 1960, with foreign\
    \ assistance, the improvement of irrigation accelerated. Small concrete dams and\
    \ \nwater distribution systems were built in several provinces. However, these\
    \ were inadequate to \nprovide both the necessary irrigation and water supply\
    \ for the villagers. But the major irrigation \ndevelopment began in 1987. The\
    \ department of irrigation now provides central planning and \ncoordination of\
    \ irrigation development throughout the country. It also offers advice to provincial\
    \ \nadministration on matters concerning irrigation services. The irrigation schemes\
    \ are classified in 3 \nscales such as: small-scale scheme, ranging from 1 to\
    \ 100 ha, medium scale scheme, from 101 to \n500 ha, and large scale scheme, above\
    \ 500 ha. There are many types of irrigation schemes: \ntraditional weirs, gabion\
    \ weirs, concrete weirs, sluice gate, reservoirs and pumping stations. \nIn 1996,\
    \ inundation and drought occurred, the government of Lao PDR made a decision to\
    \ \nrehabilitate the existing irrigation projects and to construct some new irrigation\
    \ projects to provide \nwater for agriculture. Pumping for irrigation is one of\
    \ several types of irrigation used. The irrigated \narea in the dry season increased\
    \ from 16,000 ha in 1996 to almost 200,000 ha in 2000, but since \n2000 to now\
    \ the area of irrigation increase has been quite low. \n \n3. Irrigation Technical\
    \ Review \n \nIn the field of irrigation engineering of Lao PDR, we have used\
    \ the following technical guidelines to \nconduct survey, design, and construction\

    \ to conduct each work. \n2. The Department of Irrigation has just established\
    \ the Irrigation Science Research Center in \n2013 and tries to research to improve\
    \ irrigation efficiency and related work. \n \n4.  Hydro-Meteorological studies\
    \ in irrigation engineering \n4.1 Historical development \nDuring 1980-1990, there\
    \ was a scientific team from Russia (Soviet Union) who studied meteorology \n\
    and hydrology, especially hydrological research for the development of agriculture\
    \ and irrigation. The \nobjectives of these studies were to find out the potential\
    \ of water resources for agriculture \ndevelopment in the whole country by using\
    \ the Sokolov method to calculate inflow. \nDuring 1990-2000, many methologies\
    \ changed when many irrigation engineers who were educated \nfrom many countries\
    \ such as Russia, Viet Nam, Japan, and Thailand brought different knowledge \n\
    and participated in developing technical processes especially in hydrology. \n\
    During 2000-2010, the methodology changed when the Mekong River Commission brought\
    \ new \ntechniques for hydrology anlalysis by using Modelling such as: HEC, SWAT,\
    \ IQQM, and ISIS. All of \nthese Models are useful for irrigation engineers. Many\
    \ people from provincial irrigation departments \nparticipated in training courses,\
    \ but  still sought experts in Irrigation Department. Nowadays many \nsenior engineers\
    \ in the Irrigation Survey and Design Centre and survey and design companies are\
    \ \nstill using manual methods to calculate and analyse hydrology. \nHydrological\
    \ and meteorological data collection and method for computation of rainfall and\
    \ \nrunoff. \n \n4.2  Run-off estimation (for drainage systems) \nThis shall be\
    \ calculated using collected data. However, if run-off data are unavailable, the\
    \ design \npeak flood can be estimated on the basis of various formulas. These\
    \ include Rational Formula, Unit \nHydrograph Method, Log Pearson Type III, Gumbel,\
    \ ASIA and other standard methods. As for \nauthor’s experience it is strongly\
    \ recommended to use the Sokolov Method. The Sokolov Method is \nan empirical\
    \ method composed of formulae calibrated to Lao PDR watershed conditions. \n203 | P\
    \ a g e  \n \nTopographic maps of the watershed shall be no smaller than 1:50,000.\
    \  Smaller scale maps shall not \nbe used because they will produce meaningless\
    \ results. Unit hydrographs can then be calculated. \nThe peak design flow shall\
    \ be the 25-year flood or more to the Maximum Probable Flood.  The \ncriteria\
    \ for selecting which value will be used in a particular system are: remoteness\
    \ of the system, \nthe resources available to inspect and maintain the system,\
    \ and the variability of annual rainfall.  \n \n4.3  Irrigation Water Requirement\
    \ \nRice cropping in each scheme is that of lowland rice culture and rice is grown\
    \ in flooded fields. The \nland is prepared for transplanting of the seedlings\
    \ in thoroughly wet, completely saturated conditions \nto obtain the muddy conditions\
    \ that favour good growth of the crop. \n \nThe critical period for irrigated\
    \ rice production generally occurs from land soaking through \ntransplanting,\
    \ which is the period of peak irrigation requirement. The required amount of water\
    \ at this \nperiod will depend on the following four factors: \n(a) \nWater for\
    \ saturation of the soil; usually the depth of the soil to be saturated will be\
    \ about 300 mm. \n(b) \nWater for establishing a water layer in the field, or\
    \ the standing water, for which the depth will \nbe about 50 mm. \n(c) \nWater\
    \ for percolation; this amount of water is an unavoidable water loss that depends\
    \ on the \npermeability of the soil layers and relative water levels in the field\
    \ and under the ground. The \nsoils in the Project area are considered to be medium\
    \ to light heavy. The maximum \npercolation of soil that is suitable for rice\
    \ should not exceed 2 mm/days. \n(d) \nWater for evapo-transpiration, which should\
    \ be about 6.63 mm/days. \n \nThe amount of water for items (a) and (b) is called\
    \ the depth of water required for field preparation, \nwhile the depth of water\
    \ required for items (c) and (d) is called the maintenance water, which usually\
    \ \nis also the depth of water requirement after transplanting the field. \n \n\
    Actually, during the land preparation period, the performances of land soaking,\
    \ plowing, harrowing, \naerobic decomposition of crop residue, pudding and transplanting\
    \ are individual, sequential activities \nwithin farms in the irrigation system.\
    \ From the point of view of system management for the whole \nservice area, these\
    \ activities will be systematically performed at the same time. They can be logically\
    \ \ndivided into three major activities: land soaking, land preparation and transplanting.\
    \ For this reason, \ncertain assumptions are made here for the purpose of estimating\
    \ water requirements during the land \npreparation period. These are: \n(a) \n\
    The water required for land soaking until saturation (dls) will be at 40 per cent\
    \ by volume of \nsoil to be saturated, or  dls \n=  0.4 x 300  = 120  mm. \n(b)\
    \ \nThe standing water requirement (dsw) is 50 mm. \n(c) \nThe water requirement\
    \ for evapo-transpiration (ETp) is 6.63 mm/day. \n(d) \nThe water percolation\
    \ loss (P) is 2 mm/day \n \nThus, the water requirement for field preparation\
    \ will be equal to \n \n \n \n \n \nDs = dls + dsw + P = 120 + 50 + 60 = 230 mm.\
    \ \n \nThe maintenance water requirement will be  \n \n \n \n \nDt = ETp + P \n\
    = 6.63 + 2 \n= 8.63 mm/day \n \nThe determination of the water requirement for\
    \ rice in dry season merits careful review, in particular \nthe assumptions on\
    \ deep percolation and the water need for land preparation and saturation being\
    \ \ndispersed over several months. The percolation rate is established with a\
    \ point test under a \ncondition completely different from the actual situation\
    \ under irrigation, leading to gross over \n204 | P a g e  \n \nestimation in\
    \ deep percolation. From general experience worldwide, the highest water requirement\
    \ in \nrice irrigation occurs during early growth season when most farmers are\
    \ preparing and saturating \ntheir fields. \n \nAdoption of percolation rate in\
    \ the dry season of 70 mm per month, which is about 50 percent higher \nthan the\
    \ wet season percolation rate, appears adequate under the circumstances. Also\
    \ the \nassumption that in January virtually the whole command area will require\
    \ the pudding requirement in \naddition to evapo-transpiration requirement will\
    \ give an instantaneous gross water requirement, \nassuming 65 per cent irrigation\
    \ efficiency, of about 2.2 litres per second per hectare. This peak water \nrequirement\
    \ is considered more than adequate for the medium to heavy soil prevailing in\
    \ the \nscheme. \n \nThe consultant will review the method of determination of\
    \ the crop water requirements such as data \ncollection of evaporation, wind speed,\
    \ sun shine, percolation etc. which relate to the method of \ncomputation.  It\
    \ is strongly recommended that the consultant uses the latest version of UN FAO\
    \ \nCROPWAT and comparison with above mentioned method to calculate crop water\
    \ requirements. \n \n4.4  Drainage Modulus \nDrainage canals are required to drain\
    \ excess water from irrigated fields and to dispose it to outside \nthe service\
    \ area. Drainage canals are also required to route the run-off from rainfall outside\
    \ the \nservice area either through or round the irrigated field with minimum\
    \ disruption to the farm activities. \n \nIn general, the drainage modulus to\
    \ be used is that of  5 year return period with allowance for on-\nfield storage.\
    \ In the project area of each scheme, most of the floods were caused by relatively\
    \ short \nand intense rainfalls that concentrated in 3 to 5 days. The design modulus\
    \ was then determined so \nas to drain the probable 3-day consecutive rainfall\
    \ on the irrigated field within 3 days \n \nAssumption and procedures taken in\
    \ determining the design modulus are as follows: \n(a) \n3-day consecutive rainfall\
    \ of 5-year return period shall be selected. \n(b) \nLosses due to evaporation\
    \ and percolation to be disregarded for safety reasons. \n(c) \nFor rice cultivation,\
    \ water is to be drained within 3 days; consequently the design modulus \nwill\
    \ be equal to 3-day consecutive rainfall divided by 3 days. (1 mm/day = 0.1157\

    \ \n6.1.1  General \n \nAfter dimensioning the structure so as to achieve the\
    \ hydraulic requirements, the structure will be \ndesigned to sustain the imposed\
    \ maximum dead, live and hydrostatic loads. Hydrodynamic, \nearthquake, wind and\
    \ temperature loads will be considered only in the design of the structures in\
    \ \nwhich these loads have significant effects. \n \nIn order to minimise leakage,\
    \ control of cracks in the concrete will be carried out for the structures \n\
    involved in water conveyance and distribution. \n \nConsideration will be given\
    \ to temporary loading conditions during the construction phase. Moreover \nthe\
    \ structural design will be carried out to ensure the stability and durability\
    \ of the structures. The \nmain factors to be taken into consideration during\
    \ this phase of the computations will be the \nfollowings: \n \nSafety against\
    \ piping (understructure seepage with piping effects) \n \nSafety against local\
    \ uplift pressure \n \nSafety against overall instability \n \nThe design will\
    \ be based on standard international engineering practices and generally the Design\
    \ \nStandard of the United States Department of Interior-Bureau of Reclamation\
    \ and ACI (American \nConcrete Institute) Standard. \n \n6.1.2  Loadings \nGeneral\
    \ information about the dead and live loads are given hereafter. \n \n2.4-3 Dead\
    \ loads \n \nThe specific weights of various materials will generally be taken\
    \ as follows: \n \n \n \n \nReinforced concrete \n2,400 \nkg/m3 \n \n \n \n \n\
    Water  \n1,000 \nkg/m3 \n \n \n \n \nDry soil \n1,600 \nkg/m3 \n \n \n \n \nCompacted\
    \ soil \n1,900 \nkg/m3 \n \n \n \n \nSaturated soil \n2,150 \nkg/m3 \n \n \n6.1.3\
    \ Live loads \n213 | P a g e  \n \nFor the canal structures, the gate operating\
    \ platforms will be designed for a live load of 300 kg/m2. \nFor the headwork\
    \ structure the operating platforms will be designed with the self-weight of related\
    \ \nelements and equipment specifically determined for the case under consideration.\
    \ \n \nWhere gates are used, the design will be carried out taking into consideration\
    \ the self-weight of \ngates, friction loads related to equipment. \n \n6.1.4\
    \ Vertical wall loads \nDesign for vertical walls placed against un-compacted\
    \ backfill. Load must include the maximum \ninternal water load in canal and this\
    \ load is reduced by active dry-earth backfill load. For vertical \nwalls placed\
    \ against compacted backfill the internal water-load can be neglected. If the\
    \ wall is not \nbackfilled, the design internal load of water is based on the\
    \ depth of water to the top of the wall. If \nthe backfill becomes saturated,\
    \ the additional load must be used for design. \n \n6.1.5 Sloped wall loads \n\
    Sloped walls are usually designed to be supported by the foundation on which they\
    \ are placed, \ncanals and related structures for determining the maximum loads\
    \ from both sides of the wall to be \nconsidered when determining how the walls\
    \ be supported. \n \n6.1.6 Allowable Stresses \nConcrete Strength \nThe standard\
    \ cylinder test age 28 days compressive strength of concrete for various types\
    \ of \nstructures is as follows: \n \n \n \n \na) Concrete strength for small\
    \ typical structures \n= \n140 \nkg/cm2 \n \n \n \n \nb) Concrete strength for\
    \ special structures \n \n = 175 \nkg/cm2 \n \n \n \n \nc) Concrete strength for\
    \ village bridges \n \n \n= \n210  \nkg/cm2 \n \nReinforcing Steel \nUltimate\
    \ tensile stress of reinforcing steel, conform to the requirement of International\
    \ Standard \ndesignations SR 24 (fy = 2,400 kg/cm2) for structural grade plain\
    \ round bar and designations SD30 \n(fy = 3,000 kg/cm2) for intermediate grade\
    \ deformed bar. \n \nThe structural grade plain round bars should be used with\
    \ an allowable tensile stress of 1,200 \nkg/cm2 or intermediate grade deformed\
    \ bars with an allowable tensile stress of 1,400 kg/cm2 will be \nused if essential\
    \ and will be noted in the drawings. \n \n \nSpacing Limit for Reinforcement \n\
    (1) \nThe minimum clear distance between parallel bar in a layer shall not be\
    \ less than nominal \ndiameter of bar, or 1_ nominal maximum size of coarse aggregate,\
    \ or less than 2.5 cm. Nominal \nmaximum size of coarse aggregate shall not be\
    \ larger than the narrowest dimension between sides \nof forms or the depth of\

    \ bars in upper layers shall be \nplaced directly above bars in the bottom layer\
    \ with clear distance between layers not less than 2.5 \ncm. \n(3) \nIn tied reinforced\
    \ compression members, clear distance between longitudinal bars shall not \nbe\
    \ less than 1.5 nominal diameters of bars, nor less than 1.5 nominal maximum size\

    \ use 8 \ncm clear covers; \n \nMinimum or Temperature Reinforcement \nExcept\
    \ for very small structures, the following criteria shall be used to determine\
    \ the minimum or \ntemperature reinforcement required in canal structures. The\
    \ percentages indicated are based on the \ngross cross-sectional area, not including\
    \ fillets, of the concrete to be reinforced. Where the thickness \nof the section\
    \ exceeds 40 cm, a thickness of 40 cm should be used in determining the temperature\
    \ \nor minimum reinforcement. \n \n(1)The minimum reinforcement for canal structures\
    \ shall be 12 mm at 30 cm in all exposed faces \nand where reinforcement is placed\
    \ in a single layer, and 12 mm at 45 cm in unexposed faces with \ntwo-layer reinforcement.\

    \ around structures, to prevent movement of \nstructures, and to make transitions\
    \ more rigid. Cut-offs are required at the ends of structure \ntransitions in\
    \ concrete-lined canals as well as in other lines or earth canals. Cut-off walls\
    \ should, in \ngeneral, have minimum dimensions related to depth of water shown\

    \ \n \nFor some small structures, 45 cm in depth of cut-off will be satisfactory.\
    \ In soils that are unusually \nsusceptible to piping, the cut-off should be extended\
    \ horizontally or vertically, or both, to provide \nadequate protection against\
    \ percolation. If minimum cut-off are specified, a note should be added \nrequiring\
    \ cut-off extension with un-reinforced concrete as directed. This will permit\
    \ deeper and wider \ncut-offs to be used where excavation discloses poor soils\
    \ without complicating reinforcement cutting \nand bending. \n \nThe vertical\
    \ reinforcement in the cut-off is usually the same as the longitudinal reinforcement\
    \ in the \ntransitional floor. If only one layer of reinforcement is used in a\
    \ cut-off, the vertical reinforcement \nshould be placed in the centre of the\
    \ cut-off wall. \n \nJoints in Structures \n \nCanal Structures \n \n Construction\
    \ and contraction joints will be used when necessary in concrete canal structures.\
    \ \nRubber water-stops with centre bulb should be placed across joints where it\
    \ is necessary to \nprevent water from passing through the joint. Plastic water-stops\
    \ may be used in lieu of \nrubber water-stops for low-head structures. Sponge\
    \ rubber elastic filler should be provided at \nthe joint if expansion is expected.\
    \ \n \nFillets \n \n Fillets are often used to provide increased strength or relieve\

    undeveloped and developing countries especially in Southeast Asia. Many interests are aimed at increasing \n\
    agriculture productivity and securing and increasing water resources potential. Because of its nature of being \n\
    applied for local and rural setting, the planning and implementation process of irrigation projects is variable \n\
    from place to place. The soundness and feasibility of an irrigation project must be assessed in terms of water \n\
    resources availability, soundness in hydraulics and dynamics, economic and agronomic rationality, readiness \n\
    for OM&M, its engineering properties as well as social and environment impacts. Such activities need rational \n\
    decision,  soundness  of  planning,  design,  construction  and  operations  managed \
    \ by  who  takes  care  of  the \nscheme.  Engineers  have  to  handle  broad \
    \ tasks  and  more  paper  works  for  new  design,  renovation,  and \nrehabilitation of irrigation project. Knowledge regards to the area of civil work, environmental engineering \n\
    and  biological  system  engineering  related  to  irrigation  projects  would \
    \ be  a  key  solid  foundation  in \nengineering knowledge for irrigation development.  \n\
     \nThe past and the current technical research describe the development of irrigation for each country. \n\
    Clarification of such information will identify the state of capacity and capacity gaps in each Member Country. \n\
    Review the historical evolvement in the area of civil and environmental engineering and biological system \n\
    related  to  irrigation  including  research  works  on  field  level  irrigation \
    \ and  drainage  system  is  essential \ninformation to learn priority research needs for irrigation engineering in different regions. It is expected that \n\
    capacity needs in both organisation and personnel can be identified and that rationales in technical practices \n\
    will be better understood through this document.   \n \nTo understand the circumstances of technical capacity building for irrigation engineers for the case of \n\

    \ \n \n \nHistorical  information  on  civil  and  environmental  engineering \
    \ and  biological  system  related  to  irrigation \nincluding  research  works \
    \ on  field  level  irrigation  and  drainage  system  is  valuable  information \
    \ for  learning  irrigation \ndevelopment timeline. This session covers the broad range of topics reflecting not only the wide areas of interests and \n\
    research experiences in the area of irrigation but also the problems associated with irrigation works. Research works \n\
    collected  from  different  researchers  provide  a  brief  historical  review \
    \ and  some  elementary  theoretical  review \nbackground that at least is an essential prerequisite for understanding the contribution of research. Research discussed \n\
    here provides worthwhile substantial information after tackling the serious problems by different groups of researchers. \n\
    For instance, efforts are emphasised on hydrology and meteorology, which aim at handling rainfall‐runoff estimation \n\
    and flood analysis. By coupling the advances in instrumentation and development in remote sensing, missing data and \n\
    time consumption in the process of rainfall information collection could be reduced. In the context of hydraulic, river \n\
    flow behaviour effects characteristic of river and some water environments and the study of river hydraulic provide \n\
    some specific important information of unexpected flow type for irrigation structure and irrigation systems. As proper \n\
    irrigation system should function with the right demand, study of flowing state of water in the canal and its relation to \n\
    flow arrival time provide worthy empirical information for operation of irrigation structures in the irrigation canal. Study \n\
    on concrete structure also provides useful research results to understand and to receive new alternative technologies \n\
    using other materials instead of traditional materials as it still yields acceptable concrete properties or better. The soil‐\n\
    plant relation is significant regarding yield development, in the context of on‐farm soil and water management, major \n\
    research on soil environments, viz. soil chemical properties and soil physical properties, that examines measures for soil \n\
    treatment  provides  significant  benefit  to  agricultural  productivity  development; \
    \ this  accounts  the  interesting \ncontribution of research on water regime experiments accompanied by by‐products incorporation to soil for crop yield \n\
    improvement. Soil mechanical properties play important roles in irrigation design and its construction; requirement and \n\
    improvement of soil to withstand different critical failure types are usually expected for civil and irrigation engineering \n\
    works. Research also provides useful information of soil engineering problems and some acceptable techniques used to \n\
    handle it. Moreover, some interests on the biology and environment context brought about unforeseen aqua lives that \n\
    affected water quality as water is demanded for irrigation and consumption. Nevertheless, some research on water \n\
    supply, wastewater and drainage, parks, recreation facilities, and public open spaces, which are characterised by field of \n\
    construction  and  infrastructure  system  management,  provides  past  lesson \
    \ about  planning  and  development  of  new \ninfrastructures in a cost‐effective manner, and in maintaining and operating mature infrastructures for sustainability. \n\
    The  desire  for  such  an  interchange  of  information  is  the  impetus  and \
    \ will  be  a  driving  force  for  many  such  future \nactivities for each member country in the Region.   \n\
     \nII. Historical evolvement and recent topics of research work related to irrigation\
    \ projects \n \n1. Hydrology \nHydrology is the first focus that shall be taken into consideration at the planning process during feasibility study. \n\
    Hydrology focuses on water balance for the study area; it also analyses the water movement (e.g. surface water, sub \n\
    surface,  interflow,  and  groundwater).  Usually  meteorological  data  is  needed \
    \ for  hydrological  analysis;  this  includes \nweather and rainfall data. An important outcome of analysed meteo‐hydrology information is river discharge/flood at \n\
    the outlet of watershed, which usually is set for irrigation headwork. The common method used for analysis is varied by \n\
    the data available for analysis. For example, regional formula, envelope curve, storm design, probable maximum flood, \n\
    probable maximum precipitation and unit hydrograph are applied for evolution of probability of discharge occurrence.    \n\
    Frequency analysis for return period plays important roles for water resources development and management \n\
    for both before and after project construction. It is required for the initial feasibility study of the construction project, \n\
    the design process until the water management process. For instance, it appears in an analysis of rainfall return period \n\
    of watershed area, analysis of maximum flood/flow in the river under different return period in order to process the \n\
    judgment  of  appropriate  irrigation  control  structures.  Regarding  these \
    \ merits,  HG  (2009)  developed  the  frequency \nanalysis  software  development \
    \ project;  the  research  purpose  is  emphasised  in  the  study  of  different \
    \ distribution \nfunctions for fitting curve of discharge time series data, namely Normal, Log‐Normal, Extreme Value Type I, and Log‐\n\
    Pearson  Type  III  distribution  functions.  The  Kolmogorov‐Smirnov  test  is \
    \ applied  for  goodness  of  fit  test  for  the \ndistribution functions; all distributions will not be acceptable unless each distribution function provides its error value \n\
    223 | P a g e  \n \nless than the Kolmogorov‐Smirnov critical value. The distribution which provides the minimum acceptable error value \n\
    will  be  ranked  as  the  most  fitting  distribution.  The  FORTRAN  interpreter \
    \ programme  was  applied  to  develop  the \nfrequency analysis software. The discharge and the maximum water level time series data from eight automatic gauging \n\
    stations of Chao Phraya River were used for the study of frequency analysis for a return period in the range 2‐1,000 \n\
    years. The researchers reported an impressive result that Log‐Pearson Type III distribution function shows the highest \n\
    performance. However, this is just the test as long sequence of time series data is still required for further study. \n\
    RDI  (2009a)  proposed  the  development  of  multiple  remote  sensing  of  hydraulic \
    \ and  hydrological  data  for \nirrigation  and  water  management.  This  research \
    \ is  the  part  of  technology  and  innovation  development  project  for \n\
    irrigation and water management. Rainfall amount is basic important required information for analysing water situation \n\
    of each area, which can indicate water ample, drought, and flood. A comprehensive water management plan required \n\
    this set of information for flood warning. As import of automatic rain gage from abroad is costly, whereas distribution of \n\
    rain gages in flood risky and agricultural areas is still deficient. This triggers a research to develop an automatic rain \n\
    gauge for using in Thailand itself as its main purposes are to develop an automatic syphoning rain gauge for using in the \n\
    irrigation  projects  of  Thailand  and  to  reduce  rain  gauge  import.  The \
    \ syphoning  rain  gauge  comprises  two  main \ncomponents,  namely  (1)  rainfall \
    \ interception  tank  as  well  as  tripod,  (2)  Data  recorder  and  transmission. \
    \ For  rainfall \ninterception tank, rainfall is received by cone, bore dia. 20 cm., which is connected to PVC cylinder, dia. 18 mm.x12 cm. \n\
    height. Nevertheless, there is a blast siphon, dia. 5 mm.x100 cm. long, for pumping water every 1 mm. of rainfall coming \n\
    to the cone. The data recorder and transmission applies solar cell to generate electricity from the solar energy and store \n\
    it to the battery. Every 1 mm. of rainfall will be converted to an electricity signal and numeric values (time and amount \n\
    of rainfall); data will be further recorded in the data logger, while this information will be transferred to a computer by \n\
    online via GPRS modem. This information will also be converted to rainfall intensity later for efficient use in hydrology \n\
    and hydraulic analysis,  flood  warning and  water management as well.  This \
    \ prototype has a merit that there are  no \nmoveable and wear parts, consequently, its useful life is long and its maintenance cost is low.  \n\
     \n2. Pump and pipeline systems \nAs energy shortage  becomes the critical issue in the \
    \ present,  water energy, which  is alternative renewable \nenergy, is an intelligent choice instead of fossil fuel. Because water can be converted from kinetic energy to potential \n\
    energy, a prototype stream‐flow‐driven water pump is thus developed to use the powerful kinetic energy of water for \n\
    lifting water to a pipeline system without other energy support. RDI (2009b) proposed the study on stream‐flow‐driven \n\
    water pump. This research aims to develop a prototype pump that uses water energy to drive pump for pumping water \n\
    without other external energy, especially fossil fuel. Water flow energy is utilised as the source power for pumping using \n\
    an idea of coil pump combined with a spiral pump. This pump operation is characterised by the rotation of two fin \n\
    wheels mounted at both sides of pontoons; both fin wheels are winded with rubber tube coils. During its operation, as \n\
    fin wheels are rotated with water flow and rubber tube coils mouth are rotated up to touch the air surface, air will enter \n\
    to the rubber tube coils followed by water as either of them are rotated down. This alternation will be processed by fin \n\
    wheel rotation as water will travel to the hollow axle, which is connected with fin wheels, by rubber tube coils, and flow \n\
    out from the open hole on the top of axle to the pipeline system. This prototype pump was tested in Ladpho canal, \n\
    Amphor Phra Pradaeng, Samutprakarn province, Thailand. The findings show pumping performance with its capacity 8‐\n\
    10 cubic meter per day as surface velocity of water underneath the pump is around 0.8‐1.0 m/s. \n\
     \n3. Hydraulics \nHydraulic engineering plays an important role in studying the static and dynamic behaviours of river flow or \n\
    flow in the irrigation system, including irrigation infrastructures. Discharge, velocity and water level are the main factors \n\
    that an engineer expects to simulate as close as the natural behaviour using theories and equations, which are derived \n\
    from natural law and empirical formula. For example, Saint‐Venant’s principle is useful for studying unsteady flow in the \n\
    river or canal system. A Manning and Bernoulli's principles are commonly used for studying both steady uniform flow \n\
    and non‐uniform flow in the irrigation system.   \nWater  is  a  natural  resource, \
    \ which  changes  by  environment  variation  as  water  demand  is  increasing \n\
    dramatically. Thus, there is the need of water management strategies to handle this situation. One of the strategies is \n\
    the development and improvement of control structure for efficient control water in the river. Wicket gate is somewhat \n\
    useful  for  study  and  application,  an  application  of  wicket  gates  is \
    \ for  control  discharge,  drainage  as  well  as  water \ndiversion. The special characteristic of wicket gate that differs from a general gate is capability to fold and rest at a gate \n\
    seat as there are no piers requirement between wicket gates; this enable water flow freely without any flow barrier in a \n\
    224 | P a g e  \n \nchannel. HG (2003) reported three purposes that expected to achieve the goals for this study, namely (1) application of \n\
    wicket gate as a diversion weir to increase river storage, whose crest can be adjustable, (2) application of wicket gate to \n\
    protect embankment from river flood by installation of wicket gates along the both sides of river embankment instead \n\
    of  using  sand  bag,  which  is  a  temporally  overflow  protection  structure. \
    \ Furthermore,  study  on  mechanism  of  gate \ncontrolling compared to a hydraulic system and a stand system is also performed. In fact, wicket gates are operated as a \n\
    mobile  dam,  usually  is  applied  in  USA,  it  is  therefore  needed  to  perform \
    \ laboratory  test  for  studying  its  hydraulic \nbehaviour using physical models. The test is categorised to different models, namely (1) the wicket gate model, which \n\
    will  be  installed  at  a  river  or  a  spillway,  (2)  the  wicket  gate  model, \
    \ which  will  be  installed  along  both  sides  of  the \nembankment. The findings show that wicket gate with the stand system shows higher performance installation at the \n\
    bridge and along the embankment (better control, easy maintenance and cheaper cost), whereas wicket gate with the \n\
    hydraulic system is suitable for installation in the river and river mouth or along the top of spillway crest because of \n\
    more  maintenance  requirement  and  high  cost.  There  are  several  benefits \
    \ of  wicket  gate,  which  are  summarised  as \nfollows; it is useful for flood protection; with its adjustable gate crest an increase of storage capacity in the river is \n\
    possible as the wicket gate can be adjusted to 0‐90 degree position. Moreover, it’s a prefabricated part that is easy for \n\
    installation  and repair and it can  save costs and construction  time. Overflow at the crest of \
    \ wicket gate provide an \naeration, which  may improve  water quality.  Nevertheless, wicket gate \
    \ can be folded down parallel to  the  river bed \nduring a flood and because there isn’t a pier structure, it doesn’t obstruct the river flow, and the sediment along the \n\
    river bed can be flushed. \nDifferent irrigation structures have different control gates, which are mounted on to piers. The long side of \n\
    piers is usually set in the parallel direction of the river flow; however there is still flow obstruction behaviour leading to a \n\
    vortex around the pier. If the pier is long and the pier slab slope is steep, there would be jump and cross wave at the \n\
    streamline  intersection.  These  directly  affect  the  pier  structure  because \
    \ of  down‐stream  turbulent  flow,  which \ngenerates impact force, erosion, and negative pressure leading to deterioration of the pier’s useful life. It is considered \n\
    that the magnitude of pier deterioration can be varied by pier shapes and by the slope of the river bed. Regarding this \n\
    issue, HG (2000a) did an experiment on an analysis of pier shape effects to the flow on steep slope. The purpose of this \n\
    study therefore is to emphasise the pier shape effects to flow on a  steep slope. Physical models with the change of \n\
    chute slopes to 1:0.72, 1:1.5, and 1:3 and different shapes of the pier were developed and categorised. Shapes of the \n\
    pier consist of upstream (U/S) and down‐stream (D/S) of pier heads with rectangular, half circle (Radius (R)=B/2 when B \n\
    is a pier width), R=1.5B, oval shape with R=3B, and sharp shape, respectively. The U/S of pier is oval shaped with R=B as \n\
    D/S  pier  shapes  are  rectangular,  and  the  rounded  head  piers  with  tail \
    \ length  5,  20,  25,  30  cm,  respectively.  As  the \nexpected outcome of an appropriate shape is to reduce unexpected effects of D/S as mentioned, the findings show that \n\
    an appropriate shape is the pier having U/S pier head with R=B as the D/S of pier is a rounded head with tail length of 30 \n\
    cm. \nIn general, water for agriculture is distributed from natural river or reservoir; the distance from water resources \n\
    varies from not far to very far (>100 km.). To uniformly distribute water supply to all agriculture farm plots, there must \n\
    be an irrigation system, irrigation control structure, irrigation measurement structure through a certain water supply \n\
    system rule. A irrigation system is usually divided into two main types, namely (1) an open cannel system and (2) a \n\
    closed conduit system (pipeline system). Usually, the open cannel system is much cheaper as compared to the close \n\
    conduit system. Researchers reported that the general problems in irrigation can be divided into: engineering and  non‐\n\
    engineering problems. Engineering problems can be numerically defined as follows: \n\
     \n1. Losses exceed the standard rate in an irrigation canal system and a distribution system (seepage losses, head loss \n\
    by check or other irrigation structures, friction loss by sediment or water weed, etc.). \n\
    2. Size of an irrigation canal is not enough, which usually changes after construction or use, for supplying water \n\
    corresponding to the irrigation demand. \n3. Agricultural areas along an irrigation canal don’t receive water by specific time and the right demand. For instance, \n\
    areas  at  the  upstream  of  a  canal  usually  receive  water  over  the  specified \
    \ time  and  demand  because  the \ndownstream areas often lack water. \n4. Water control structures, its monitoring as well as investigation schedule are not sufficient. \n\
    5. Water distribution is not sufficient. \n225 | P a g e  \n \n6. Data and information for consideration in water management decision and water supply scheduling and planning \n\
    is deficient.  \nAmong  non‐engineering  problems,  a  mass  problem  and  a \
    \ political  problem  cause  farmers  misunderstand \nirrigation  activities; \
    \ therefore,  water  control  operation  by  farmers  is  still  not  appropriate. \
    \ These  problems  attract \nresearchers to investigate irrigation efficiency and its performance as they hypothesise that there are many losses that \n\
    affect flow hydraulic of water in the canal. HG (1996) thus emphasised in‐situ investigation of irrigation canal and its \n\
    water control structures including the analysis of the effects of water weed and sedimentation in the canal in terms of \n\
    the velocity distribution of water, head loss, and effects to Manning’s n. The study is performed by collecting in‐situ \n\
    information (i.e. general physical characteristic of a canal, its bed level), measurement and calibration of discharge and \n\
    water level including calculation and analysis of flow in the canal using the present physical characteristic of a canal. \n\
    Generally,  adjusting  gate  of  irrigation  control  structure  considers  flowing \
    \ state  of  water  in  the  main  canal, \nnamely  water  level  and  discharge \
    \ requirement.  The  gate  adjustment  usually  will  be  processed  simultaneously. \n\
    Researchers  found  that  water  in  the  canal  usually  consumes  time  to \
    \ travel  to  each  irrigation  control  structure.  The \nproblem  is that diversion \
    \ of water  at the upstream  (U/S) control structure is  more than what  is required while \
    \ the \ndischarge  from  the  downstream  (D/S)  control  structure    is  lower \
    \ than  the  requirement  because  the  water  level  in \ndownstream has not reached the steady state. This happens because calculation of gate opening assumes steady flow \n\
    though real situation  of flow in the canal is unsteady. This implies that water requires time to travel to the D/S irrigation \n\
    control  structures;  the  adjustment  should  therefore  be  operated  after \
    \ water  flow  arrives  the  D/S  irrigation  control \nstructure. The question of what time to adjust gate is appropriate has been brought to light to researchers for studying \n\
    flow – arrival time of water considering unsteady flow in the irrigation canal. HG (1993a) worked on the experimental \n\
    test and determined the flow‐arrival time of water in the canal. The analysis of flow arrival time needs St. Venant’s \n\
    partial‐differential equations, viz. motion equation and continuity equation. To estimate flow‐arrival time of water, a \n\
    canal physical model was developed. Different discharge rates were specified and recording of water level data and \n\
    water velocity was performed for further analysis. Recorded data and information was used to analyse the relation of \n\
    flow‐arrival time, the differentiate discharge (Q), and the differentiate storage volume in the span that was specified. \n\
    This relation will then be applied further as a simple formula to estimate flow‐arrival time of water in the canal. \n\
    HEC‐RAS  is  a  computer  programme  that  was  developed  by  the  US  Army \
    \ Corps  of  Engineer.  It  is  a  1‐D \ndimensional  unsteady  flow  model. Its capability \
    \ is  characterised  by  the  ability to simulate flow in a single  river and \n\
    different river networks that are linked together, flow along irrigation control structures as well as flow over levee. This \n\
    computer  programme  is  accepted  for  worldwide  use;  however,  many  researchers \
    \ still  need  to  develop  their  own \napplication for a specific problem or to learn the unsteady flow theory. Instead of only applying the HEC‐RAS for river \n\
    modelling, HG (2007) was interested in the study of unsteady flow calculation in HEC‐RAS model. Their research purpose \n\
    thus expects to develop a computer programme for calculating unsteady flow in open channels as HEC‐RAS programme \n\
    was applied to study and validate the output (i.e. water surface profile) from the developed programme. The findings \n\
    have shown good results, which are consistent with the HEC‐RAS results. However, the developed programme still has \n\
    capability limitations, which handle only a single river with rectangular channel shape and no control structure in the \n\
    river can be modelled. \nFor land topography such as a mountain, its land slope is very steep; its top soil surface is usually eroded by \n\
    surface runoff during rainfall followed by flushing of its sediment and runoff with high velocity to a river and a river at \n\
    down‐stream leading to flood along both sides of the river embankment. Another issue is the poor potential to conserve \n\
    water in the river because its bed slope is steep. These situations damage agricultural areas and destroy the province’s \n\
    economy. Although, weir and reservoir construction in a river like this may retard a rapid flow to the downstream; soil \n\
    sediment from erosion effects usually is trapped in front of the upstream face of the weir and reservoir in the short‐\n\
    term. Therefore, there are the needs to study an amount of sediment, amount of runoff, and the appropriate pattern of \n\
    weir and reservoir.  \nOne possible concept is an idea of designing the step weir and reservoir as irrigation structure along the river. \n\
    The upstream structure could trap the sediment as the down‐stream structure responds to store the runoff form the \n\
    upstream  side.  This  fascinated  SSG  and  HG  (2005a)  to  contribute  their \
    \ research  study  on  formation  and  sediment \nmanagement process of step‐pool in mountain rivers. The case of Bang Saphan Basin, Prachuap Khiri Khan province, \n\
    Thailand that faces high erosion and flood every three years, is raised as a pilot case study. The main purposes of the \n\
    research are: (1) study of factor affecting top soil erosion, source of eroded sediment and silt (suspended load and bed \n\
    load), which is flushed into the river of the Bang Saphan basin, (2) to find an appropriate way to prevent and reduce the \n\
    226 | P a g e  \n \namount of sediment, which is trapped in the upstream face of the diversion weir and the reservoir in the river, (3) study \n\
    on suitable pattern of the diversion weir and the reservoir for efficient flushing of sediment in the river, and (4) to \n\
    increase the capital water in Bang Saphan by constructing diversion weir and reservoir.  \n\
    This research aims to get many benefits which can be defined as follows; (1) to become aware of resource and \n\
    be able to estimate the amount of annual sediment in the Bang Saphan Basin because this information is useful for \n\
    water  management  in  this  area,  (2)  an  information  of  appropriate  patterns \
    \ of  weir  and  reservoir  can  be  used  for \nevaluation of construction cost, maintenance cost, and economic return. The physical model of Bang Saphan Basin is \n\
    constructed and conducted in the laboratory; the study on the relationships of sediment samples from the pilot area to \n\
    the sediment was estimated by a Unified Soil Loss Equation (USLE).  \n \n4. Concrete structure \n\
    For all concrete construction, field engineer shall control a compressive strength of concrete to be higher than \n\
    the design value. As there shall be in‐situ collection of mixed concrete for the compressive strength test in a laboratory, \n\
    most of mixed concrete batches different from specified quality are rejected and demolished. These experiences are \n\
    complex, time consuming and generate construction costs. An injured party thus requested to compare in‐situ concrete \n\
    test  result  with  the  laboratory  test  results.  With  this  effort,  CMG \
    \ (2001)  carried  out  the  research  study  on  the \ncomparative  analysis \
    \ on  the  compressive  strength  of  the  in‐situ  drilled  concrete  cylinder \
    \ 3”diameter  x6”  height \nspecimens and the concrete with standard curing  in the laboratory test at 28 day moist curing.  \n\
    For the concrete with standard curing, the test was processed by first designing the strength of concrete mix at \n\
    28  day  moist  curing  to  140,  175,  210  and  280  ksc,  respectively  before \
    \ performing  compressive  strength  test  using \nstandard concrete cylinder dia. 6”x12” height. For the in‐situ concrete test, concrete was mixed with size 6”x6”x6” and \n\
    cured in the water for 14 days outside the shed. Core sampling of concrete was processed using drilling machine dia 3” \n\
    to obtain in‐situ core sample dia3”x6” height at 28, 60, 90,120,150, and 180 days moist curing.  The findings reveal that \n\
    the compressive strength of the in‐situ core samples have an increase trend as its average compressive strength values \n\
    for each day of moist curing are higher than  the concrete with standard curing (i.e. around 107%, 115%, 117%, 118%, \n\
    and 119%).  \n \nIn the present, concrete is popularly used for most construction and buildings as well as irrigation structures. \n\
    Concrete is a composite material composed of a mixture of cement (fine crushed limestone), coarse aggregate and river \n\
    sand. More than 65% of concrete is a coarse aggregate because around 50% is crushed stone. It is unavoidable to say \n\
    that  every  cubic  meter  of  concrete  comes  from  the  explosion  of  a  stone \
    \ mountain.  To  reduce  a  stone  mountain \ndemolition rate, the use of steel furnace slag is an interesting choice to decrease natural resources disruption. The steel \n\
    furnace slag is the by‐product of steel production using furnace process. It is estimated that steel furnace slag around \n\
    700,000 ton/year can be obtained from “Borwin” industrial estate, Chonburi province, Thailand. Since its use is still less \n\
    (i.e. it is digested to small particles for pond fill or small road), the amount of this by‐product is  increasing and leading to \n\
    environment problems because garbage land is limited. For the similar reason mentioned, fly ash, which is a by‐product \n\
    obtained by electricity production using coal burning, is also popularly applied as a concrete composition. These by‐\n\
    products are attracting researchers  to study its feasibility to  compensate the native coarse aggregate. \
    \ CMG  (2003a) \ntherefore contributed a research study of using steel furnace slag as coarse aggregate in fly ash concrete. The purposes \n\
    of the study thus are emphasised on a study of using steel furnace slag as coarse aggregate in concrete, and a study of \n\
    the long‐term effects of concrete curing time, its compressive strength, flexural strength, and also tensile strength of fly \n\
    ash concrete as steel furnace slag is used instead of coarse aggregate. For the study, laboratory test was arranged by \n\
    testing the compressive strength of concrete at 7, 28, 63, 91 and 126 days moist curing, the tensile strength was tested \n\
    at 28 days moist curing. Water cement (W/C) ratio of concrete is also varied by 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively as \n\
    slump was controlled in the range 5‐10 cm. The fly ash by‐product with the rate of 20% was applied instead of Portland \n\
    cement Type I.  \nThe findings reveal that the obtained steel furnace slag is a porous aggregate, which is constituted by aeration \n\
    during steel production; it also provides Calcium Oxide (CaO2) less than Portland cement, whereas Silica and Alumina \n\
    Oxide substances are similar to Portland cement as these substances are less than fly ash. With these reasons the steel \n\
    furnace slag thus is not suitable for use as a bonding agent. Based on the same W/C ratio, as compared to the concrete \n\
    mixed with coarse aggregate, the use of steel furnace slag instead of coarse aggregate reduces the compressive strength, \n\
    the flexural strength, and the tensile strength of concrete. However, all percentages of strength development at 28 days \n\
    moist curing of both are similar. The findings indicate that fly ash application contributes an increasing trend of curing \n\
    227 | P a g e  \n \ntime proportional to W/C increasing. Fly ash application increase pour ability (workability) and slump value of \
    \ fresh \nconcrete  while  it  can  continuously  develop  the  compressive  strength \
    \ of  concrete  in  the  long  term.  Moreover,  the \nproportion of the flexural strength and tensile strength to the compressive strength of both were similar.  \n\
    The researcher also summarised that the application of these products is feasible; there is a suggestion in the \n\
    report that concrete weight increase be taken into consideration. \nThe perfection of concrete structure shall be considered as dense and uniform mass thorough a structure; as its \n\
    skin  surface  shall  be  flat  and  smooth.  These  properties  are  commonly \
    \ affected  by  energy  of  concrete  vibrator, \nappropriate workability and concrete slump. For the slump of concrete point of view, there is no strict rule to specify its \n\
    value, usually, the slump value ranges 1 ½”‐2” for a buildings slab as 6”‐7” is for a beam and for a column. The past \n\
    experiences have shown that less energy of concrete vibration led to concrete segregation, which contributed to porous \n\
    inside structure and the reduction of  its strength;  these  could  be arisen especially in the irrigation structure \
    \ that is \ninundated. Its effect could be reduced by increasing of slump value. However, less slump value may be better than high \n\
    slump. For instance, during a construction work, there is some problem with poor quality of a ready concrete, whose \n\
    concrete slump value is rather less and workability is low; thus, that ready fresh concrete batch shall be left. To solve the \n\
    problem an application of admixture is therefore studied to define its optimal amount to increase the slump value of \n\
    fresh concrete having low slump (CMG, 2000).  \nThis research aims to study the amount of adding admixture, named as “Superplasticizer (Type F)”, to control \n\
    the  workability  of  fresh  concrete.  For  experimental  design  the  laboratory \
    \ test  was  performed  by  mixing  concrete \ncompressive strength at 28 days moist curing to 175, 210, and 280 ksc, respectively. In the research process, water to \n\
    cement ratio is varied by 0.75, 0.68, and 0.57, respectively. Crushed stone, maximum size of 3/4”, is used as coarse \n\
    aggregate. After concrete is mixed in the mixing machine 1‐1.5 hrs., and slump value ranges 0.5”‐4” (i.e. 0.5”, 1”, 1 ½”, \n\
    2”, 2 ½”, 3”, 3 ½” and 4”, respectively), the first slump value will be recorded as the second slump value will be recorded \n\
    after adding admixture. The findings reveal strong results of good significant relationships (=0.01?) among the first \n\
    slump, the second slump, and the amount of adding admixture.  \nA present concrete construction starts applying less amount of fly ash instead of Portland cement in order to \n\
    save cost of cement and to reduce waste, which is a product from power plant. An important concrete property that has \n\
    been used for construction controlling and designing of concrete structure is a compressive strength at a specified age. \n\
    Strength of concrete mixing with fly ash not only depends on the quality of fly ash but also an appropriate amount of fly \n\
    ash, a curing method, and a curing age. Strength of general concrete is based on hydration reaction of cement and \n\
    water,  whereas  concrete  mixed  with  fly  ash  is  a  combination  of  hydration \
    \ and  pozzolanic  reactions;  thepozzolanic \nreaction requires Silicon Oxide (SiO2) and Alumina Oxide (Al2O3) in fly ash and Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH2)) from the \n\
    products  of  hydration  reaction  and  water.  Hydration  reaction  is  fast \
    \ while  pozzolanic  reaction  is  slow.  Thus,  it  was \nhypothesized by CMG (2003b) that curing time of concrete mixing with fly ash could affect its compressive strength. \n\
    However, optimal curing time of the concrete is not clear. The research by CMG (2003b) is aimed to study the influence \n\
    of the age of curing on compressive strength of fly ash mortar. Fly ash for this research was obtained from Mae Moh \n\
    power plant, Lampang province, Thailand. The scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) is useful for observing the physical \n\
    properties of fly ash. For experimental design of this, research laboratory test was arranged by testing the compressive \n\
    strength of fly ash mortar cute size 5x5x5 cm. at 7, 14, 28, 63, 91 and 186 days moist curing, the compressive strength \n\
    was tested at 28 days moist curing. Water cement (W/C) ratio of concrete was designed to 0.55. The fly ash by‐product \n\
    with the rate of 0, 15, 30, 50, and 70% was applied instead of Portland cement Type I. Samples were cured in the water \n\
    at 3, 7, 14, 28, 182 days, and no curing (zero day).  \nThe  findings  reveal \
    \ that  keeping  of  curing  process  of  mortar  in  the  water  is  the  method \
    \ to  increase  its \ncompressive strength development. Mortar mixed with fly ash at 182‐day curing has higher strength by age; moreover, \n\
    mixing with lower fly ash amount promotes its higher strength as compared with mixing of higher fly ash amount at the \n\
    same test age. However, all mortar samples mixed with fly ash provide lower compressive strength as compared with \n\
    the control mortar (none fly ash mixing) for all test age. In the same fly ash amount point of view, longer curing age \n\
    shows higher compressive strength. It could be summarized that an increase of fly ash amount needs longer curing age \n\
    to develop compressive strength than the fly ash mortar that is cured in water all the time.  \n\
    In  Thailand,  severity  problem  due  to  concrete  structure  corrosion  by \
    \ sulfate‐affected  environment  causes \npremature degradation of concrete properties in a short‐time. This is the problem found most often in the concrete \n\
    structures that are constructed at seashore. Effects of application of fly ash to the concrete that is facing with sulfate \n\
    environment are still not been seriously studied.  CMG (2005) carried out the research and reported the study of sulfate \n\
    resistance  of  Portland  cement  Type  I  with  fly  ash,  Portland  cement \
    \ Type  I  and  Portland  cement  Type  V.  For  the \n228 | P a g e  \n \nexperimental design, laboratory test was performed by grouping concrete samples to two groups (i.e. soaking in normal \n\
    water and soaking in sulfate solution of 5% concentration). Sulfate solution of 5% concentration was simulated based on \n\
    natural concrete corrosion by sulfate. An application of fly ash at rate 30% and 15% instead of cement was specified. The \n\
    compressive strength was tested at 7, 28, 60, 120, 240, 300, 360 days moist curing. For the comparative analysis for all \n\
    Portland cement types, researchers point out the significant difference between the situation of soaking in the water \n\
    and the sulfate solution. With this assumption concrete is thus designed to have the compressive strength rate 250 and \n\
    400 ksc at 28‐day curing age; concrete is controlled with slump value range 2”‐4”, the mortar cute size 4” will be used to \n\
    test the compressive strength of samples.  \nThe  findings  show  interesting \
    \ results  for  Portland  cement  Type  V,  which  provides  the  highest  compressive \n\
    strength for the case of soaking with sulfate solution of 5% concentration. This value is similar to Portland cement Type I \n\
    with fly ash 30%, while Portland cement Type I with fly ash 15% shows lesser strength. Moreover, sulfate resistance of \n\
    Portland cement Type I with fly ash 30% is higher than Portland cement Type V, whereas Portland cement Type I with fly \n\
    ash 15% shows lower resistance than Portland cement Type I with no fly ash. However, it is to be noted that before \n\
    using fly ash, there is the need of study on optimal amount of fly ash. \n \n\
    5. On‐farm soil and water management \nSoil environment also plays a significant role in crop production. Soil acidity is the major problem affecting crop \n\
    yields in Nakorn Nayok province, Thailand. The past literature has shown that an application of lime together with better \n\
    drainage system is found to be applicable to reduce soil acidity, whereas application of lime two times per annum was \n\
    not a sustainable way. RDG (2011b) is interested in this technique as their research purposes are to experiment, follow‐\n\
    up, and evaluate the effectiveness of soil reclamation and water management technique for reducing soil acidity.  \n\
    For their study, in‐field experimental design was undertaken by dividing a plot. Effects of water management \n\
    were  investigated  in  a  main  plot;  a  ditch  was  excavated  around  the \
    \ plots  for  drainage.  Sub‐plot  was  prepared  for \nstudying the effects of soil reclamation materials such as manure, rice husk, and rice straw compost; all materials were \n\
    applied with the rate one tone per 0.16 hectare. The control plot is the plot with no application of soil reclamation \n\
    materials. The experiment period is two years. Test plot size of 16x30 m2 was also prepared for the first year and was \n\
    enlarged to 0.16 hectare in the second year. In the drainage system point of view, as compared to the plots that do not \n\
    have the drainage system, the findings reveal that the plots having drainage system shows a significant reduction in soil \n\
    acidity (pH is higher), whereas the amounts of Iron and Manganese are higher in the second year. In addition, there is a \n\
    reduction in Aluminum. In the application of soil reclamation materials point of view, there is no significant difference \n\
    on yields in the first year; the application of rice straw compost shows the highest yield around 3.2 tons/hectare. In the \n\
    second year, the plots having drainage system shows higher yields for all application of soil reclamation materials for \n\
    both control plot and the plots that don’t have drainage system. However, the interaction between drainage and soil \n\
    reclamation materials, which shows higher iron and manganese, should take into consideration the effects of its amount \n\
    to crop yield before providing the suggestion on soil improvement to farmers. \n\
    Historical droughts in Thailand were recorded from 1992‐2009. Their damage value was 0.25 billion US$ (rate at \n\
    30 Thai baht/US$) to agricultural area in 2005, the most severe year. The damage covers the context of extending of \n\
    agricultural area, its uncertain production cycle as well as an irrigation water management as the amount of water in \n\
    reservoir  is  limited.  Under  the  limited  water  resource  and  its  uncertainty, \
    \ soil  and  water  relationship  on  irrigation \nproject’s area is therefore needed to be studied.  \n\
    The research aims thus, to concentrate on the test and the collection of soil seepage, soil moisture available for crop, \n\
    soil  field  capacity  and  soil  permanent  wilting  points.  Its  expectation \
    \ is  based  on  the  use  of  this  information  for \ncalculation of crop water demand, time of water delivery for field crop and irrigated‐rice, especially for dry season. This \n\
    also expects to increase an efficiency of irrigation water management and to mitigate the critical drought issue affected \n\
    to agricultural production. The Chaojet Bang Yi Hon Operation Maintenance Project is selected for the study as one test \n\
    point is specified to cover an area of four km2 (RDG, 2011c). Laboratory analysis was done for defining soil texture, \n\
    moisture  retention,  saturation  percentage,  and  primary  dispersive  soil \
    \ using  emersion  crumb  test,  whereas,  deep \npercolation rate is performed in the field. Deep percolation rate is record at 0‐30, 0‐60, and 0‐90 cm. deep from ground \n\
    surface.  More  than  150  test  points  are  accounted  for  each  project, \
    \ which  depended  on  its  irrigated‐area  coverage. \nSimilar researches for different projects have also been carried out by RDG (2011d), RDG (2011e), RDG (2011f), RDG \n\
    (2011g), RDG (2011h) and RDG (2011i). \n \n6. Soil mechanics \n229 | P a g e  \n\
     \nIn the structural  design,  most important factors affecting shape, type and dimensions of civil and irrigation \n\
    infrastructures  would  be  soil  texture,  soil  type,  soil  physical  and \
    \ soil  engineering  properties  as  well  as  concrete \nproperties.  An  engineer \
    \ shall  be  careful  in  considering  the  use  of  those  factors  to  recheck \
    \ the  structure  and  soil \nfoundation safety and its stability. Usually, soil information shall be collected from in‐situ and engineers shall perform \n\
    testing its physical and engineering properties in disturb/undisturbed laboratory. For concrete properties, its strength, \n\
    optimal portion of a water‐cement ratio shall be testes in the laboratory. All tests shall be passed all acceptable standard \n\
    tests being used in the country (e.g. American Standard Testing of Materials, Thai Industry Standard, Japanese Institute \n\
    Standard). Soil science (e.g. soil chemical properties) and plant physiology play an important role in efficient irrigation. \n\
    The physiology of water in plants (water quality and water stress) and plant photosynthesis activity are the exciting \n\
    approaches to be researched because these affect water needs in both quantity and quality. Furthermore, these affect \n\
    the  method  of  irrigation  (e.g.  sprinkler,  border,  furrow,  water‐saving \
    \ method  under  deficiency  water  supply  after \nplanting scheme) associated with the selection of discharge for minimisation of deep percolation and tail water losses \n\
    according  to  soil  properties  as  plant  water  stress  is  also  minimized \
    \ observing  its  root  system,  stem  and  leaves.  To \nunderstand the physiological and molecular bases of plant water deficits is therefore of utmost importance to modulate \n\
    the appropriate balance between vegetative and reproductive development, to improve crop irrigation water use (Blum, \n\
    2009) as soil salinity and soil acidity directly affect plant growth. Salt in soil attracts water competing with plants; it \n\
    reduces plants' capability to extract water from saline water as this soil contents soluble salt (e.g. sodium, chloride and \n\
    borates) which may be toxic to crops. Acidity can also induce deficiencies of micronutrients. \n\
    An irrigation project such as a small reservoir or a large reservoir is constructed to restore and to distribute \n\
    water  to  water  users.  This  includes  a  small  pond  that  farmers  have \
    \ excavated  by  themselves/supported  by  Thai \ngovernment. Such  irrigation \
    \ projects have the same basic  selection of  soil  materials, which  are low permeability. In \n\
    some case, a problem on finding the required materials is a barrier causing the project cannot be operated perfectly. For \n\
    instance, the required materials source is very far from the construction site and poor soil moisture capacity is found in \n\
    the construction site (e.g., loamy soil). One of the solutions to solve the problems like this is the treatment of soil that \n\
    has poor moisture capacity using high cohesive clay or bentonite. SSG (2008a) contributed an improvement of loam soil \n\
    with  high  permeability  to  appropriate  strength  and  permeability  for  earth \
    \ dam  construction.  This  research  purpose \nfocuses on the use of bentonite for treating loamy soil. The findings show very interesting results: the optimum mixing \n\
    rate of 4% of bentonite can provide the treated soil with permeability of less than 10‐6 cm/s. While the permeability \n\
    goal is achieved, higher rates of bentonite mixing can also improve the treated soil cohesion and its strength, whereas \n\
    the  angle  of  internal  friction  is  reduced.  This  is  common  because  the \
    \ relationship  of  soil  cohesion  and  its  angle  of \ninternal friction is a trade‐off.      \n\
    Roads  require  an  acceptable  strength  to  withstand  dynamic  load  and  static \
    \ load  during  its  operation.  To \nevaluate the strength of soil for ways and roads,the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test for compacted soil and sub grade \n\
    is required. Higher CBR value indicates higher structural strength and lower consolidation. For a construction control, \n\
    usually, soak CBR is applied for testing a selected material that will be used to compact roads or ways. The unsoaked \n\
    CBR can also be applied for the test and can be used for the construction control. However, there is no comparative \n\
    analysis study about the test result between soaked CBR and unsoaked CBR under the same selected test materials. SEG \n\
    (2001) performed a study of relationship between soak and unsoak CBR of cohesive soil.  The research purpose thus \n\
    aims to study the relationship between soaked CBR test and unsoaked CBR test as cohesive soil compacted to 95% \n\
    maximum dry density is the material for study.  \nThe findings found some significant difference of the test. It shows that soaked CBR test provides CBR value \n\
    lower than unsoaked CBR test around 10‐30% because water affect to swelling of soil volume as there is a reduction in \n\
    soil bulk density leading to a reduction in soil strength.   \nVarious methods can be used to test soil engineering properties (i.e. soil cohesion (C) and angle of internal \n\
    friction ()) of clay (CL). Mostly, two methods have been applied, namely a triaxial test (consolidated undrained, CU) and \n\
    a direct shear test. The direct shear test is a quick test with low cost and acceptable reliability as the triaxial test requires \n\
    intensive laboratory analysis, which provides high precision, near realistic of natural condition, time consuming, and \n\
    expensive cost of test. The concept of the direct shear test is based on an allowance of horizontal failure plane for soil \n\
    sample, whereas freely failure plane like natural failure can be tested by the triaxial test. The question is that, Is the \n\
    direct shear test suitable in terms of cost and reliability?. SEG (1999) carried out a research on comparative study on \n\
    cohesion and angle of internal friction of soil group “CL” by triaxial test and direct shear test. The research has a purpose \n\
    to test the results of soil cohesion and angle of internal friction of soil as its results are compared to the triaxial test \n\
    results. Samples (80 samples each) of 2.5” dia.x 1” height are compacted to 95% maximum dry density at 2% optimum \n\
    230 | P a g e  \n \nmoisture content (O.M.C.) for the test. The finding reveals that direct shear test provides higher values of the interested \n\
    soil engineering properties. This confirms that design parameters provided by direct shear test receives lower safety as \n\
    compared with those given by tri‐axial test.   \nSimilar  research  is  also \
    \ conducted  by  SEG  (1995)  and  SEG  (2000);  their  report  is  based  on \
    \ the  study  of \nrelationship of CU test at the different sizes of samples. The CU test result information, usually is applied for dam design \n\
    and dam stability check. Size of the samples for this method is an important factor that influences the reliability and \n\
    precision  of  the  test.  Usually,  the  sample  size  is  a  cylinder  shape \
    \ with  1.5”  diameter;  however,  the  reliability  and \nprecision of the test is varied by an increase of sample size, time and cost of the test. For their research the sizes of CU‐\n\
    triaxial samples of 1.5” and 3” diameter with around 30 samples each were tested and compared.  \n\
    One of the problems in a construction process is an expansive soil. The expansive soil is characterised by the \n\
    specific behaviours: soil will expand/swell when receives moisture as it also shrinks when soil is dry. These behaviours \n\
    generate a void and hole in soil mass leading to structure failure near the area affected by expansive soil. By observation, \n\
    there are expansive soil problems along canal, dam, and abutment of concrete bridge. In general, expansive soil is 2:1 \n\
    type montmorillonite clay mineral, which is composed of two silica sheets and one alumina sheet inserts between silica \n\
    sheets.  Montmorillonite  crystals  may  have  2‐21  angstrom  spacing,  which \
    \ has  no  hydrogen  bond;  only  thin  bond  of \noxygen‐oxygen linkage links montmorillonite crystals together to make its structure more stable. If there is cation as \n\
    sodium  (Na+)  in  the  exchange  site,  high  expansion  of  soil  will  generate \
    \ high  pressure  leading  to  cracks  in  concrete \nadjacent to this soil. Moreover, slope failures and sudden collapses occur whenever this soil type receives moisture or \n\
    rain. These problems result in much more repair costs for maintenance of the premature structures affected by this soil \n\
    type. SSG (2003d) thus designed the research experiment to treat the properties of this soil type to be suitable for \n\
    construction. The research thus emphasises the use of chemicals and lignite fly ash, which obtained from power plant, is \n\
    considered for this purposes.  \nOn the soil science property point of view, dispersive soils, which are composed of montmorillonite and illite, \n\
    have clay with high exchangeable sodium (Na+) percentage more than 60%. Na+ can attract molecular of water and \n\
    generate thick water shell; this causes in clay particles dispersion in water and susceptibility to erosion when soil surface \n\
    touches rain or water. SSG (2003d) performed research study on the comparison of soil science and soil engineering \n\
    properties of lime treated soil and alum solution treated soil for dispersive soil improvement of earth dam construction. \n\
    There  are  different  ways  to  treat  this  soil  type.    However,  this  research \
    \ emphasises  on  the  use  of  alum  solution \n(Al2(SO4)3)  and  lime  (Ca(OH)2) \
    \ for  treatment.    The  effort  of  this  research  is  to  study  the  effects \
    \ of  using  both  alum \nsolution and lime for treatment of dispersive soil. The experiment was done using physical model by construction of \n\
    small  scale  earth  dam  models  having  watershed  area  4  m2  (i.e.  original \
    \ soil,  treated  with  alum  solution  0.35%,  and \ntreated with lime 3%).  \n\
    Five test methods for dispersive soil test (i.e. pinhole test, degree of dispersion by double hydrometer test, \n\
    dilution‐turbidity  ratio,  and  chemical  test)  were  applied  to  measure \
    \ the  degree  of  dispersion  after  appling  both \nmaterials to treat the soil. Other treated soil properties such as liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), plastic index (PI) and \n\
    maximum dry density were also tested. The findings of this research reveal that LL and PI range from high to low in the \n\
    order of lime treated‐soil, alum solution treated‐soil, and dispersive soil, respectively, whereas their order is in opposite \n\
    direction for PI and maximum dry density. The findings also provide valuable results for the merit use of lime treatment \n\
    over alum solution, which provides the lowest dam surface erosion around 48 kg/m2/year. Researchers also suggest that \n\
    providing top soil with glass cover, riprap, hand‐placed riprap together with lime treatment are also the appropriate \n\
    techniques for the reduction of soil surface erosion.   \nChumphon  province \
    \ has  a coverage  area  of  sand  around  26,834  hectares.  Sandy  soil  is \
    \ low  fertile  and  low \nmoisture capacity. Available moisture of this soil type for plants is also low. To improve soil properties and increase \n\
    fertility of soil for plantation, SSG (2003a) thus concentrated on the integrated use of paddy husk ash and clinoptilolite \n\
    to treat sandy soil. Experimental design of this research was done by varying the mix rate of 1:1 for paddy husk ash and \n\
    clinoptilolite. Its rates of 0, 1, 2, 4, 16, and 32% by mass, respectively were incorporated to two groups of sandy soils (i.e. \n\
    Lang Suan and Rayong soil groups). The amended sandy soil properties were also tested for percentage saturation, field \n\
    moisture  content,  available  moisture  content,  pH,  soil  electrical  conductivity \
    \ (EC),  orgnic  carbon,  cation‐exchange \ncapacity, exchangeable of cations (Na, Ca, Mg, K), useful phosphorus as well as carbon and nitrogen (C/N) ratio. For both \n\
    soil groups, the findings reveal that all tested properties have a slight increase by an increasing percentage of paddy \n\
    husk ash and clinoptilolite incorporation. EC of both is less than 2 dS/m. This means that there is low soil salinity. The \n\
    rates of paddy husk ash and clinoptilolite incorporation at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16% by mass, respectively of both soil types \n\
    were  designed  for  application  in  agricultural  field  experiments.  Mustard \
    \ green  (Brassica  juncea)  and  peanut \n231 | P a g e  \n \n(Arachishypogaea \
    \ L.)  variety  Thainan  9  were  planted  for  obtaining  relation  of  their \
    \ dry  mass  yield  production  and \nappropriate rate of amended soil.  \nThe \
    \ results  of  this  research  show  an  interesting  clinoptilolite  incorporation \
    \ rate  of  which  8%  provides  the \nhighest  dry  mass  yield  of  mustard \
    \ green  and  peanut  for  Rayong  soil  group,  whereas  Lang  Suan  soil  group \
    \ receives \noptimum rate at 4% for mustard green as optimum rate is 8% for peanut.  \n\
    The construction of water storages, such as retention dam or reservoir needs a proper soil texture with high \n\
    moisture capacity. Usually, impervious clay soil type is the most appropriate; however, the specified soil type may not \n\
    be available in the local area as the cost and investment value on the project construction is increased by the distance \n\
    from available material source. One problem found in the construction of water storages is the sand coverage, which is \n\
    high permeability, spreads over the construction area. This may be as thin layer as less than 1.0 m. or as thick as 4‐5 m. \n\
    Therefore, improvement of sand texture is required, and the use of soil‐amended bentonite (its property is like cement) \n\
    plays an important role for this problem. SSG (2004) performed experiment in laboratory and report their achievement. \n\
    For research, coarse sand and fine sand were used for this study by mixing bentonite with different rates, namely 2, 4, 6, \n\
    8%. For the findings, researchers reported the optimal rate of 4% bentonite mixing can reduce permeability for the both \n\
    sand types to be less than 10‐6 cm/s. \nCost‐effective management on the design and construction must be based on low cost and effective use for \n\
    real condition. One problem found is the over‐design of roads with low traffic, which comes from improper design. For \n\
    road design with low traffic, local materials should be considered as the first priority use for application and it can still \n\
    provide an acceptable CBR, which should be more than 80%, of road structure. SSG (2008b) carried out a research study \n\
    on the mechanical properties in strength, permeability and CBR of lateritic soil with cement for road construction. This \n\
    research mainly focuses on the use of a quantity of cement mixed with lateritic soil in the place of crushed aggregate for \n\
    base  layer  of  road.  Different  rates  of  cement  mixing  were  prepared \
    \ for  the  test  and  from  the  findings  researchers \nsuggest that a cement quantity of around 2% upwards can provide acceptable CBR and higher unconfined compressive \n\
    strength as permeability of the improved base layer decreases. \n \n7. Materials engineering and science \n\
    Thailand  is  one  of  the  world’s  top  rice  exporters.  Each  year,  more \
    \ than  7.5  million  tonnes  of  rice  husk  is \nproduced for no use. Burning the rice husk leads to waste pollution of so‐called “black rice husk ash.” This is found in \n\
    biopower  plants.  SSG  (2003b)  found  the  merit  of  black  rice  husk  ash \
    \ for  soil  stabilisation  because  hydrated  lime \n(Ca(OH))2 is also useful for this regime. This interested researchers in conducting a research on the appropriate rate of \n\
    mixing black rice husk ash and lime for dispersive soil improvement and stabilisation. Researchers reported its optimal \n\
    rates (black rice husk ash 10% and lime 4% with incubation around 4 day), which can reduce soil dispersion level to be \n\
    less than 15%. \nUsually,  the  earth  canal  is  the  soil‐based  irrigation \
    \ structure  (filled‐canal),  and  a  selective  soil  with  low \npermeability for canal compaction is preferred. However, to prevent earth canal failure by erosion, the earth canal with \n\
    concrete paving is popular. The protective pavement technique like this has several merits; however, this paved canal \n\
    would face a problem of leakage, external and internal erosion and soil settlement leading to the cracking of concrete \n\
    paving. For solving the problem,  SSG (2007) considered  the flexible  material (i.e. \
    \ old tires)  mixed with asphalts and \nnatural  materials  to  compensate  the \
    \ concrete  paving.  The  results  show  that  developed  properties  in  asphalts \
    \ with \ncrumb  rubber  in  irrigation  canal  and  community  farm  pond  provides \
    \ higher  shear  resistance  and  more  flexibility  as \ncompared to concrete paving. Researchers also reported that the quality of water in a canal paved with asphalt tire \n\
    mixture is not harmful by contaminant.   \nGenerally, the construction of weirs uses wood or materials that are easy to find and available in nature as \n\
    concrete material is costly. However, it is quite easy to get damages because of incorrect technical construction. One \n\
    choice is to use a soil‐contained rubber box, which is made of  such natural resources as Para rubber filled with soil, for \n\
    building  a  movable  Broad‐Crested  weir.  Thailand  is  an  agricultural  country \
    \ as  cultivation  of  rubber  trees  is  widely \npracticed for generating income for the country. SSG (2009) thus applied the Para rubber material for the construction \n\
    of  movable  broad‐crested  weir  or  small  dam,    made  by  soil‐contained \
    \ rubber  box  of  20x40x10  cm  in  size  and  wall \nthickness of 4 mm. It was applied at Thongphabhum district, Kanchanaburi province.  \n\
     \n8. Biology and environment \nWeeds  are  a  major  problem  in  water  resource \
    \ management.  The  rapid  growth  of  weeds  causes  shallow \nreservoir, reduction in the drainage capability of channel as well as water pollution. Therefore, there is a need to find \n\
    232 | P a g e  \n \nthe way to process weeds (e.g. productions of fertiliser, basketwork and fuel using weeds) to control and eliminate them. \n\
    WCG (2003) contributed an interesting report on the use of floating plant for the improvement of water quality. Their \n\
    research  expects  to  improve  water  quality  using  five  types  of  floating \
    \ plants,  namely  water  hyacinth,  water \nlettuce, floating  moss,  periwinkle \
    \ and  duckweed.  Such  floating  plants  are  useful  for  decreasing  organic \
    \ matter, \nabsorbing the suspended solid and adding  oxygen to the water.  \n\
    The findings show impressive results in terms of water quality improvement. The following are the rates of \n\
    “effective  treatment,”  which  are  the  percentage  of  the  treated  water \
    \ samples,  or  water  samples  that  show  the \nacceptable  water  quality \
    \ level  after  application  of  floating  plants.  The  results  show  that \
    \ floating  moss  presents    a \nmaximum  of  99.63%  of  effective  treatment \
    \ of  dissolved  oxygen  (DO)  (period  of  15  days).  Periwinkle  shows  a \
    \ great \nreduction  in  total dissolved solids (TDS)  by  26.82%  (period  of \
    \ 60  days).  Water  hyacinth  provides  84.93%  of  effective \ntreatment  for \
    \ ammonium  (NH4\n+)  (period  of  15  days).  Water  lettuce  and  duckweed \
    \ provide  the  maximum  effective \ntreatment of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) 73.49% and 73.18%, respectively. Periwinkle provides effective treatment of \n\
    total phosphorus (TP) up to 98.95% (period of 60 days).   \nWater  plays  an \
    \ important  role  for  human,  crops  and  animal  life.  Water  provides  food \
    \ e.g.  via  aquaculture. \nWater turbidity is a crisis issue to be taken into consideration for solving water quality problems. The problem of water \n\
    turbidity generates a big barrier for water management and for food safety. For instance, water turbidity obstructs sun \n\
    radiation  to  the  bottom  of  farm  ponds  so  that  the  amount  of  oxygen \
    \ emitted  by  the  Photosynthesis  process  of \nPhytoplankton in the water is reduced; this crucial event leads to Phytoplankton deaths and increasing of carbonic acid \n\
    in the water (pH is lower) as aquatic animals cannot survive; in many cases, the growing rate of aquatic animals slows \n\
    down causing its dry weight yield production reduction. This problem is found in the Northeast of Thailand, especially in \n\
    the  irrigation  water  resources  (farm  ponds)  in  Srakaew  Province.  Different \
    \ sources  of  water  turbidity  are  possible; \nhowever, there are convincing evidences that the major water turbidity problem comes from clay and silt sediment from \n\
    pond  slope  and  soil  surface  erosion  as  well  as  dispersive  soil.  Water \
    \ turbidity  value  is  usually  measured  in  “NTU” \n(Nephelmetric Turbidity Unit) SSG (2005) emphasised on the application of lime and water alum to the soil. It includes \n\
    the study of appropriate salt type and salt amount for the mitigation of water turbidity. Farm ponds in the agricultural \n\
    area of Srakaew Province are the problem project case study; these farm ponds have NTU in the range of 280‐1217 NTU.  \n\
    Their findings show that optimal amounts of aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2) to mix \n\
    with soil in farm ponds are 0.2‐0.3% and 1.8‐2.9%, respectively. For dispersive soil problem, dissolving of Al2(SO4)3 129 \n\
    ppm, Sodium Chloride (NaCl) 720 ppm, and Calcium chloride (CaCl2) 152 ppm can reduce water turbidity to be 20 NTU. \n\
    Researchers suggest that Al2(SO4)3 shows the highest performance for practical use in actual field. The clear water after \n\
    this  treatment  provides  the  water  quality  level  in  the  standard  level \
    \ for  consumption,  of  which  pH,  the  amount  of \nSulphate, and Alkalinity (CaCO3) values were <6.5, < 250 ppm, and > 100 ppm, respectively as others are not perfect. \n\
    A dam is built to store water for use. However, after the construction of dam, the number of problems on \n\
    water quality could be generated because the water prior to construction of the dam is in the condition of flow, whereas \n\
    after operation it becomes in a standing condition (storage period). This reduces oxygen in the water and leads to a \n\
    decrease of water quality especially in the dry season, in which concentrated bio mass in less water raises Biochemical \n\
    Oxygen Demand (BOD). The evaluation of water quality is then needed to be taken into consideration. Therefore, the \n\
    researcher  aims  is  to  study  water  quality  before‐after  finishing  the \
    \ construction  of  the  dam.  The  Klongtadan  Dam, \nNakhon  Nayok  province \
    \ is  the  case  study  (CG,  2005).  During  the  construction  time,  for  laboratory \
    \ analysis,  water \nsamples were collected to determine chemical qualities and spreading of inhabiting algae in the reservoir.  \n\
    The results show that the condition of water quality after construction of The Klongtadan Dam is good although \n\
    chemical and physical properties (BOD, Chlorophyll‐a, electrical conductivity (EC), pH and \
    \ turbidity)  including cation, \nanions and heavy metal are higher than before construction of the dam. For the analysis results of phytoplankton, there \n\
    are three divisions, five classes, nine orders, sixteen families, thirty‐one genus and thirty‐nine species. Nevertheless, \n\
    there is an increase in the number of phytoplankton species of around 20‐36 types. It is interesting to note that its \n\
    amount  is  estimated  as  729‐4,910  unit/liter  of  water  (the  number  of \
    \ cells/filaments/clusters),  and  the  algae \ndiversification ranges 2.55‐3.15.  \n\
    Pakpanang river mount, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, often faces seawater intrusion during the dry season \n\
    leading to soil salinity problem. The solution has been the construction of a water gate to prevent seawater and dilute \n\
    salinity of the affected area. Although the soil salinity problem is mitigated, this water gate causes the problem of water \n\
    quality degradation because of the standing water in lentic state when the gate is close. In this regard, the levels of \n\
    water quality around Pakpanang river mount are categorised in four major groups, namely (1) good fresh water, (2) \n\
    233 | P a g e  \n \ncoastal  seawater,  (3)  good  brackish  water,  and  (4) \
    \ bad  brackish  water.  Water  quality  level  is  both  suitable  and  not \n\
    suitable for crops and water animals. Understanding of the related parameters in accordance with these four major \n\
    groups of water quality is a useful task for water quality control and its management.  \n\
    CG  (2007)  therefore  contributed  a  research  study  on  biochemical  oxygen \
    \ demand  (BOD),  chemical  oxygen \ndemand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), alkaline (ALK), and nitrate levels for different mentioned water quality groups \n\
    around  Pakpanang  River.  Researchers  reported  the  valuable  information \
    \ of  level  and  rate  of  these  water  quality \nparameters,  which  are  in \
    \ accordance  with  the  behaviour  of  fisheries,  people  and  industrial  activity. \
    \ Moreover, \nresearchers summariwed that its main effect was the routing of runoff (fresh water) in the river to push the seawater \n\
    out of Pakpanang river mount. \nThe Lamkhanchu reservoir, Chaiyapoom province, serves as a water resource for an agricultural area of around \n\
    7,000 hectares and for domestic consumption. One problem is the spread of Algae‐bloom as its rotten/decayed carcass \n\
    lowers water quality causing stinking water and cannot be used for such purposes. Therefore, a study on the factors \n\
    influencing Algae‐bloom spreading and Algae‐bloom amount plays an important role in controlling and evaluating water \n\
    quality for not only the Lamkhanchu reservoir, but also other reservoirs having Algae‐bloom problems. WCG (2009a) \n\
    studied algae‐bloom and aquatic weed infestation problems for maintenance of the ecosystem in Lamkhanchu reservoir. \n\
    The  findings  of  this  research  reveal  111  types  and  74  varieties  of \
    \ Algae‐bloom,  the  largest  quantity  is \nMicrocystisaeruginosa and chroococcusminutus; increasing of NO2‐N and PO4‐P is significantly related to the spreading \n\
    of Algae‐bloom. Similar research on this effort can also be found by the study of WCG (2009b). \n\
    The  Bang  Pakong  River  is  an  important  economic  river  for  the  life \
    \ and  one  part  of  the  Eastern  Seaboard \nDevelopment Project, Thailand. The Bang Pakong diversion dam is constructed under this project; it is far from Bang \n\
    Pakong river mount, around 74 km. The Bang Pakong diversion dam was constructed in the shortcut channel located in \n\
    parallel direction with the Bang Pakong River; the drainage system from the upstream of the dam is controlled by two \n\
    river outlets of 1.0m dia. The objectives of building Bang Pakong diversion dam are prevention of seawater intrusion \n\
    into the Bang Pakong River and storing of water for use in dry season. However, after construction and operation of the \n\
    project, there is a water quality problem at the upstream and downstream of the diversion dam.  \n\
    With RID efforts, a regulating gate with 100 cms water drainage capacity was installed at the Bang Pakong \n\
    diversion dam in order to improve water quality. However, the report on the water quality improvement should be \n\
    evaluated to prevent water quality problems and to correct information about water quality of the Bang Pakong River \n\
    near the dam site. Therefore, CG (2009a) contributed a research study for this purpose. The research study is focused on \n\
    the  comparative  analysis  of  water  quality  (EC,  pH,  BOD,  DO,  Nitrate \
    \ Nitrogen  (NO3‐N),  Ammonia  nitrogen  (NH3‐N) \nCopper  (Cu),  Manganese  (Mn), \
    \ Zinc  (Zn),  Cadmium  (Cd),  lead  (Pb))  at  the  localized  area  surrounding \
    \ Bang  Pakong \ndiversion dam (both in shortcut channel and main river) for both before and after construction of the regulating gate. \n\
    The findings reveal that all water quality measures are in the acceptable range under each standard water quality level.  \n\
    Toxic algae‐bloom at Huai song Sai reservoir causes stinking water which cannot be used. There are different \n\
    ways  of  solving  this  water  quality  problem;  however,  CG  (2009b)  focused \
    \ on  the  use  of  chemical  and  integrated \ntreatment of the polyaluminium chloride (PAC) powder with liquid alum, which is \
    \ an efficient method.  The  findings \nreveal that this method can reduce waste water by toxic algae‐bloom.  Also, increase of hazardous metal   in the treated \n\
    water by the use of integrated lime with liquid alum was not found. Researchers also suggest that planting of floating \n\
    aquatic plant (e.g.  morning glory and water minosa) as well as breeding of herbivore fish (e.g.  Nile tilapia, Carp and \n\
    Giant Gourami) can also be effective in increasing water quality and reducing the spread of algae‐bloom.  \n\
    Water plays important roles as a resource for human, animal life and plants. It is used for growing of crops, \n\
    which is the beginning of the food chain leading to ecosystem diversification. However, the problem of water quality is \n\
    also a major problem that directly impacts on organisms and the environment. The aim of this research is to assess the \n\
    physical and chemical water quality of Kraseaw Water Operation and Maintenance Project by processing an analysis of \n\
    29  water  quality  indices  (SG,  2011).  The  results  show  that  water  quality \
    \ parameters  (pH,  EC,  DO,  BOD)  of  Kraseaw \nReservoir are 7.6, 246 µS/cm, 5.07 mg/L, and 2.35 mg/L, respectively. At Kraseaw’s irrigation canal, it is found that water \n\
    quality parameters (pH, EC, DO, BOD) are 7.6, 284 µS/cm, 4.64 mg/L, 2.62 mg/L, respectively. These parameters are \n\
    within the recommended limits except potassium and suspended solid values, which are higher than the standard limits.  \n\
    Researchers  reported  that  high  potassium  level  caused  by  the  influence \
    \ of  fertilisers  having  potassium \ncompounds as high suspended solid level caused by the soil erosion; moreover, soil erosion leaded to accumulation of \n\
    soil sediment, organic matter and inorganic matter to water, especially in the rainy season. \n\
     \n9. Construction and infrastructure system management \n234 | P a g e  \n \n\
    HG (1993b) published a report on the hydraulic model study of river entrance and near shore areas for Golok \n\
    river  mouth  improvement  project.  The  Golok  river  mouth  improvement  project \
    \ is  being  carried  out  in  cooperation \nbetween Thailand and Malaysia, aided by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) through \n\
    the snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Cooperation. The Royal Irrigation Department (RID), Thailand, and Royal \n\
    Irrigation and Drainage Department, Malaysia, have responsibility for this project. It is expected to improve the stability \n\
    of the Golok river mouth, in Narathivat province, Thailand in order to preserve the Thailand‐Malaysia boundary and \n\
    mitigate flood damage along both sides of the Golok river embankment; this is because the sea around the river mouth \n\
    is shallow and drainage is poor. The study is also expected to allow Thail and Malaysian vessels to fluently navigate \n\
    through their territorial waters. This project is divided into two phases; the first phase is a physical study of the Golok \n\
    river mouth, the second phrase is a detail design for construction bidding, which is processed in \
    \ Malaysia. The  first \nphase performed a study on analysis of hydraulic, hydrology, meteorology, environment, economic, and social effects \n\
    affected by the project as well as an analysis of the project’s economic return. The laboratory test was conducted in \n\
    Thailand.  \nConstruction of a breakwater model around the river mouth was conducted; its characteristic physical terrain \n\
    like the claws of a crab at the estuary is opened to allow water in the river to flow to sea. The breakwater model consists \n\
    of  a  left  side  breakwater  and  a  right  side  breakwater  of  the  Golok \
    \ River  as  an  equidistant line  because  a  Thailand‐\nMalaysia continental shelf boundary agreements is specified by Transit Point B. The right side breakwater extends from \n\
    Malaysia’s  seashore  as  the  left  side  breakwater  extends  from  Thailand \
    \ seashore  to  the  sea.  The  physical  model \nsimulates discharge flow in the Golok River 500‐2,000 m/s as sea wave (Hs) = 2.5 m. height and peak wave period (T) = \n\
    8.5 s is generated by wave generator.  \nThe research findings of the first phrase were submitted to the Thailand‐Malaysia Joint Steering Committee on \n\
    the Development of the Golok River; the results reveal three alternative choices that are appropriate in engineering, \n\
    economic and social contexts (i.e. the case of extending the right side breakwater from Malaysia seashore into the sea \n\
    at the sea bed level ‐2, ‐3, and ‐4 m.(M.S.L.), respectively). The first choice provides construction \
    \ cost around US$7 \nmillion with an economic return rate of 15%, however its engineering aspect is not good (may have sedimentation at the \n\
    river mouth, which is not good for maintenance in long term). The second choice provides construction costs of around \n\
    US$13 million with an economic return rate of 10% because its engineering aspect is good (wave run‐up is less, which \n\
    implies the sediment prevention in the future). The last choice provides construction costs of US$10 million with an \n\
    economic return rate of 12% because its engineering aspect is as good as the second choice. However, the Thailand \n\
    committee suggests that the last choice is appropriate. The findings also show that the appropriate choice characterised \n\
    by the right side breakwater extends from Malaysia’s seashore to the sea 800 m. as the left side breakwater extends \n\
    from Thailand seashore to the sea 350 m., river mouth width is around 200 m. Both breakwaters have its side slope \n\
    1:1.5, its crest level is 5 m. (M.S.L.) as its bottom is 3 m. deep into the seabed. \n\
    Sedimentation in the upstream side of weirs is a problem which affects irrigation water supply and irrigation \n\
    efficiency. For critical issue, the water supply cannot be operated because it prevents water from entering into a head \n\
    regulator as sand sediment enters in the canal and reduces the canal capacity. This issue leads to spending more amount \n\
    of the fiscal budget for excavation of sand sediment for each year. HG (2000b) contributed a very useful research study \n\
    on an improvement of overflow weir for sand flushing. The major objective of the improvement of the weir is to find the \n\
    method to disperse sand sediment in the water and let it flow past the weir’s crest applying fluidisation technique, \n\
    which usually is applied for flushing sand sediment along the river mouth. This technique aligns pipe along the upstream \n\
    face of weir and sand sediment will cover the pipe. Water will be supplied to the pipe with high pressure to disperse \n\
    sand sediment to suspend in the water during flushing process. The difficult task is to determine the best and practical \n\
    pipe alignment style. This research aims to improve the capability of sand sediment flushing in the upstream face of the \n\
    weir and to increase the potential of sand sediment flushing of the old sand sluice. The physical model was conducted in \n\
    a  laboratory  of  RID,  Thailand.  The  finding  reveals  the  appropriate  alignment \
    \ of  the  pipe,  that  is  the  pipe  alignment \nparallel to the river channel as the pipe’s tail is extended towards the tail head regulator gate.  \n\
    Since a flood disaster damaged all natural reefs, life and structures, the multipurpose Khwae Noi Dam, a royal‐\n\
    project in Pitsanulok Province, was therefore constructed to respond to this situation. Many of the old natural reefs, \n\
    which are useful for life  creation  along  Kwae  Noi  River, are damaged by floods (Kaeng \
    \ Jed‐kwae National Park). An \nartificial reef is therefore an interesting choice worth studying to recover the old natural reefs. An artificial reef is a \n\
    human‐made underwater structure; typically it is built to promote marine life in the area, to control erosion, and to \n\
    improve aquaculture. HG (2006) thus received responsibility for RID on this effort and performed the research study on \n\
    an artificial reef project, which is called “Kaeng Kao‐kwae”. The Kaeng Kao‐kwae is an artificial reef that is expected to \n\
    235 | P a g e  \n \nbe located in the Kwae Noi River at the downstream of the Khwae Noi Dam river outlet and divides the river channel \n\
    into nine channels. With this characteristic, there may be some risks for  tourists who swim and chances to deteriorate \n\
    the downstream river embankment and river bed. The research purposes are therefore emphasized on the design of \n\
    Kaeng Kao‐kwae physical model and study of its flow behaviour, depth and velocity of flow before real construction. \n\
    There are three physical models of Kaeng Kao‐kwae; the comparisons of the three models are based on the effects as \n\
    mentioned for both before and after construction. Researchers reported that the 3rd model was the most appropriate as \n\
    its construction cost of the real project was estimated around US$96,667 (at 30 Thai baht rate). The researchers suggest \n\
    that  during  performing  water  management  at  the  downstream  of  river  outlet, \
    \ authorised  staff  should  consider  the \noptimal discharge, the water level and the depth at Kaeng Kao‐kwae during tourist swimming and cruising time to avoid \n\
    dangers. \nDesign of  filter materials in an  irrigation  work  plays a significant role \
    \ in  preventing  structure failure due to \nseepage force and uplift pressure when upstream and downstream water levels of an irrigation structure are different. \n\
    In the present, three references are usually applied for the design, namely Tezaghi & Peck (1948), USBR (1963), and \n\
    Design of small dams (1987). These references are similar; however, which one is suitable for application is the matter \n\
    that a designer should be taken into consideration. CMG (2008) performed the research on filter materials design for \n\
    irrigation  work.  Since,  rule  and  condition  for  the  design  is  complicated, \
    \ this  research  aims  to  develop  a  computer \nprogramme for filter materials design applying these references in order to reduce time and mistakes in the design of \n\
    filter materials for irrigation work. The programme was developed in excel spreadsheet, which can illustrate graph and \n\
    curve. Data inputs are required for this programme, namely sieve analysis, hydrometer analysis, and Atterberge’s limit. \n\
    Canal  systems  are  typical  for  distribution  of  irrigation  water  to  agricultural \
    \ areas.  However,  the  past \nexperiences have shown that during its malfunction and damage (e.g. hole along canal bank due to erosion and using \n\
    dispersive soil for rolling compacted canal embankment, canal bank failure, and sedimentation in the canal, cracking of \n\
    concrete slab along canal side slope), continuous irrigation water supply cannot be stopped as repair and fixing of the \n\
    problems is expected as fast as possible. RDG (2011a) carried out a study of irrigation canal embankment maintenance. \n\
    This research aims to study the cause and pattern of the damage and the way to repair the irrigation canal embankment \n\
    that is damaged by water erosion. Damage is in the form of a hole along the embankment and shoulder of the irrigation \n\
    canal.  Laboratory  tests  of  replacing  the  hole  with  alternative  embankment \
    \ fill  materials  were  conducted  using  local \nmaterials. Another task of the research was the development of tools and implements for drilling and expanding the \n\
    hole.  \n \nIII. Discussion with honorary researchers on priority needs in research\
    \ and engineering capacity \nin the present age \n \n1. Research prioritisation based on the Thailand National Research Policy and Strategy \n\
    For the discussion of the present research priority needs with different researchers, researchers were invited \n\
    for expressing their valuable mass of thought, opinion, and experience about the research framework \
    \ of the Eighth \nNational  Research  Policy  and  Strategy  for  2012‐2016  (8th \
    \ NRPS).  As  the  8th  NRPS  sets  a  core  research  pathway,  its \nappropriateness, agreement, disagreement, additional research needs, importance, and priority assignment as well as \n\
    future research trend were discussed. \nBefore going to the discussion report, we would like to introduce information of the 8th NRPS (2012‐2016). The \n\
    Office  of  the  National  Research  Council  of  Thailand  (NRCT)  has  formulated \
    \ 8th  NRPS  (2012‐2016)  as  a  research \nimplementation guideline which emphasised an integrative research policy that comply with the direction of the current \n\
    Thai National Economic and Social Development Plan (TNESDP) while promoting academic excellence and achieving a \n\
    balanced  and  sustainable  national  development  through  participation  of \
    \ all  parties  (i.e.  government  sector,  private \nsector, people sector) in the country as a whole. Research projects are filtered and categorised by their significance and \n\
    necessity to the course of the national development based on the principles of the economic sufficiency philosophy and \n\
    on  the  country’s  projected  economic,  social  and  environmental  changes \
    \ and  risks.  There  is  an  expectation  that \ncollaboration between the central and regional research agencies will eventually lead to an establishment of research \n\
    and development networks, specialised research centres, and joint research personnel development. Furthermore, the \n\
    8th NRPS (2012‐2016) aims to create a unity and efficiency of research implementation under a systematic and constant \n\
    monitoring and evaluation process. It will also provide a policy basis that corresponds with the national research system \n\
    reform and the long‐term National Research Policy (2010‐2029).  \n236 | P a g\
    \ e  \n \nThere are five research strategies and thirteen research categories which are contained in the 8th NRPS (2012‐\n\
    2016). Some details of research strategies are as follows (NRCT, n.d.): \n‐ Research strategy 1:Development of social development potential and capability \n\
    The objective of this research strategy is to promote the body of knowledge that will provide a strong basis for \n\
    national security through social empowerment, development and advancement of the quality of life and happiness of \n\
    the Thai people.  \nThe emphasis is on research related to the development of educational quality, self‐directed learning, culture, \n\
    health and hygiene, quality of life, welfare for life security, good governance, social and regional empowerment and \n\
    protection, promotion of community potential through community participation as well as promotion of potentials of \n\
    youth, the disadvantaged, the disabled and the elderly, and promotion of national security. \n\
    ‐ Research strategy 2: Development of economic development potential and capability \n\
    The objective of this research strategy is to promote the body of knowledge that will provide a strong basis for \n\
    the  development  of  potential  and  capability  for  a  balanced  and  sustainable \
    \ economic  development  based  on  the \nphilosophy of economic sufficiency.  \n\
    The emphasis is on research related to the development of efficient agricultural production that includes value‐\n\
    added creation for agricultural, forest and fishery products, including researches on the development and management \n\
    of  local  knowledge  and  wisdom  to  provide  foundations  for  a  sustainable \
    \ development  of  community  economy  and \ncreative  economy,  other  focuses \
    \ are  on  researches  for  efficient  development  of  industrial  products \
    \ and  the  service \nindustry which includes tourism, energy development, logistics, information technology and communications. Also taken \n\
    into  consideration  for  this  research  strategy  are:  Thailand’s  competitive \
    \ edge  within  the  contexts  of  national  and \ninternational  changes,  relations \
    \ with  neighbouring  countries,  and  development  of  relevant  body  of  knowledge \
    \ to \nsupport transition into the ASEAN Economic Communities (AEC) on the basis of sufficiency economy philosophy and \n\
    development toward commercial and public utilisation of research findings. \n\
    ‐ Research strategy 3: Conservation, promotion, and development of natural resources and environmental capital \n\
    The objective of this research strategy is to promote the body of knowledge and database for efficient and \n\
    systematic  management  and  development  of  the  natural  resource  and  environmental \
    \ capitals  through  local  and \ncommunity participation.  \nThe emphasis is on research related to the management of natural resources and the environment, biodiversity, \n\
    conservation and sustainable utilisation of natural resources through people and society participation, development of \n\
    the body of knowledge on soil resources, mineral resources, water resources, forest resources, aquatic animal resources \n\
    as well as research on sustainable sharing of resource utilisation particularly through meaningful public participation, \n\
    research on post natural/disaster support and rehabilitation potentials at regional and local levels. \n\
    ‐ Research strategy 4: Development of innovation and research personnel potential and capability \n\
    The objective of this research strategy is to promote the country’s competitive edge and self‐reliance through \n\
    the utilisation of science, technology and other forms of knowledge on a balanced and sustainable basis. \n\
     The emphasis is on research related to the development of the body of knowledge and expansion of national \n\
    and public wisdom as well as the promotion of the country’s research potentials. \n\
    ‐ Research strategy 5: Reform of the national research system for the management of knowledge, research findings, \n\
    innovations,  inventions,  resources,  and  national  wisdom  towards  their \
    \ commercial  and  public  utilization  through \nsuitable strategies that will make them extensively available to the public and civil society \n\
    The objective of this research strategy is to develop the national research reform systems and mechanisms for \n\
    unity and efficiency of the country’s knowledge management.  \nThe  emphasis \
    \ is  on  research  related  to  the  increase  of  the  country’s  research \
    \ management  efficiency  and \nefficacy. \nNRCT has taken into consideration all five of the above research strategies together with the current crises and \n\
    essential research/knowledge needed for their  immediate  solutions and rapid national development. NRCT had \
    \ also \ndivided its research focuses into 13 categories as follows:  \n1 Application of sufficiency economy,  \n\

     \nAs  mentioned,  research  frameworks  are  filtered  and  categorised  by \
    \ their  significance  and  necessity  to  the \ncourse of the national development. Five major research strategies and thirteen research categories are systematically \n\
    categorised as it is expected that idealised holistic linkages among them will become true. Although such arrangements \n\
    may need to be done and expect to help the country’s development simultaneously, due to limitations of government \n\
    budget management/donor,  the level of problem needs to be prioritised. From such reasons, there may be various \n\
    opinions on priority needs and their importance that should be analyzed.  \nThe analysis was performed by interviewing researchers using designed questionnaires. Research priority needs \n\
    are analysed by consideration of the research contexts in the areas of civil engineer and environment, science, biology \n\
    engineering related to water management and irrigation for the case of Thailand. For analysis of priority needs, Analytic \n\
    Hierarchy Process was applied to obtain significant prioritisation.  \nPlease \
    \ be  noted  that  with  an  analysis  of  priority  needs  using  Analytic  Hierarchy \
    \ Process,  final  results  of \neigenvalues for different research topics are obtained. Higher eigenvalue provides better significant rank compared with \n\
    other research strategies. All eigenvalues are summed to be one; difference between two compared eigenvalues may \n\
    imply the difference of the degree of importance between them. \n \n1.1 Strategic research priority \n\
    As shown in Fig.1, research strategy five receives attention at the highest priority followed by research strategy \n\
    four, research strategy one, research strategy three, respectively as research strategy two receives the lowest priority \n\
    need. Why does strategy five receive the highest rank as compared with other strategies? This is because all researchers \n\
    firstly expect the research to contribute to development of country management. The strategy accounts for research \n\
    policy,  budgets  support  and  financial  aid  system,  fundamental  structure \
    \ of  research  work,  standard  of  research, \nresearch  measurement  and  evaluation \
    \ system.  Also,  the  researchers  expected  that  benefits  from  research \
    \ on \nknowledge management, innovation, and resources development in the country would be transferred to local society. \n\
    The public sector may increase the market value of research and extend the research for commercial purpose. Data \n\
    networking also plays an important role for utilization of primary and secondary data for researches that have related \n\
    process  and  need  data  aid  system  for  supporting  their  data  needs.  Research \
    \ on  database  development  for  country \nresearch management is therefore un‐missing topic to be taken into consideration for all management procedures of \n\
    country. In this case research on research network development is very important, it plays significant role in jointing \n\
    missing links of research value chain.  \n \n238 | P a g e  \n \nFigure 1 Eigenvalues for priority ranking under research strategies \n\
     \nResearch strategy four receives the second rank because its actual useful core is the extension of the research \n\
    and seriously applied to the public sector. Researchers pointed out that the research on the development of science, \n\
    technology, and innovation shall be seriously and rapidly promoted. Such areas as biotechnology, materials science, \n\
    information  and  communication  technology,  nanotechnology,  medical  science \
    \ and  public  health  are  among  this \ncategory.  Encouragement  of  research \
    \ need  on  “creative  economy3”  to  increase  value‐added  in  production  and \n\
    economic  sectors  shall  also  be  emphasized.  Researchers  also  expected \
    \ that  research  on  energy  (i.e.  clean, \nenvironmentally friendly and green technologies) shall be mobilized to compensate energy being rapidly burned without \n\
    efficient uses during this energy crisis era. Researchers suggested that research on capacity building of such people as \n\
    technology  user,  researcher,  director  and  manger,  etc.  shall  also  be \
    \ launched  in  parallel  with  the  development  of \ntechnology.  \nResearchers \
    \ provided  some  opinion  on  the  previous  two  strategies  that  their  significance \
    \ is  they  aim  to \nstrengthen  research  on  research  management  system \
    \ and  technologies.  The  emphasis  of  research  strategy  three \nencourages researches on conservation of natural resources and environment, forest rehabilitation and development of \n\
    biodiversity, efficient utilization of soil as well as its conservation and treatment. Researchers suggested that although \n\
    research  on  such  contexts  is  also  important;  resolving  these  research \
    \ problems  may  take  long  time  to  observe  its \nimprovement  and  achievement. \
    \ These  may  be  reasons  why  researchers  provided  lower  degree  of  importance \
    \ to \nstrategy three than strategy five and strategy four with less than half of eigenvalue. In short‐term, linkage between \n\
    strategy four  and strategy three may appear in the area todeal with natural disaster (e.g. flood, drought, Tsunami). \n\
    Research  are  needed  on  monitoring  and  warning  system,  disaster  occurrence \
    \ risk  by  climate  change  including \nrehabilitation processes of damaged structure and building. \n\
    Research strategy two receives the fourth priority. This is not strange because once the research on technology \n\
    and innovation are expected to be developed first as continuous research on the development of production efficiency \n\
    (e.g. local rice, crops and livestock productions and harvesting), packaging standard, management of irrigation water \n\
    and ground water, goods qualities and standard control as well as food safety should be launched by sequence. These \n\
    also includes research development on service and tourism systems, logistics, energy, communication and information \n\
    technology, as networking with neighbour countries are also expected.   \nThe dimension of research strategy one illustrates that improvement of society and people’s livelihood needs \n\
    capacity building processes. Society shall cover rural and urban sectors; however, rural sector is weighted with higher \n\
    importance.  This  is  because  self‐sufficiency  concept  is  applied  in  order \
    \ for  raising  talents,  skills  and  experiences  of \npeople  in  local  areas \
    \ as  well  as  transferring  of  knowledge  and  technology  to  them.  Moreover, \
    \ research  on  conflict \nresolution in the use of resources among sectors should be emphasised.   \n\
    Although  prioritisation  of  strategic  research  illustrates  obvious  difference \
    \ among  them,  the  degrees  of \nimportance assigned by researchers show that most of them receive high importance (i.e. importance weight score are \n\
    above 3.5). \n \n1.2 Prioritisation of research category \nFor research category point of view, we asked a question on whether we should follow the 8th NRPS or not. All \n\
    researchers  agreed to the pathway  of this research  strategic development. As mentioned earlier, there are thirteen \n\
    research categories that reflect the coverage of five strategies which have been provided. We requested the researchers \n\
    to evaluate the importance and priority of these research categories. As shown in Fig.2 and Table 1, water resources \n\
    management receives the first priority need followed by the reform of education paradigms and creative learning, the \n\
    reform of country research system, sustainable agriculture, environment management and the development of water \n\
    resource value. The researches on global warming and alternative energy and logistics system are in the same rank. The \n\
                                                                \n3Creative Economy Development Approaches under the National Economic and Social Development Plan: \n\
    Throughout the Eighth to the current (the Tenth) National Economic and Social Development Plans, attempts have been made to \n\
    support the value creation of goods and services based on knowledge and innovation to continuously increase gross output of \n\
    goods and services. In 2007, a study was conducted and initiatives were executed to create economic value from cultural capital, \n\
    utilizing  the  strengths  and  advantages  of  the  culture  through  economic \
    \ value  creation.  For  the  economic  sector,  the  Tenth \nDevelopment  Plan \
    \ focuses  on  adjusting  the  manufacturing  structure,  aiming  at  value  creation \
    \ of  goods  and  services  and \nsupporting connection between different fields of manufacturing. \n\
    239 | P a g e  \n \nresearches  on  self‐sufficiency  economics,  encouragement \
    \ of  self‐care,  disease  protection,  health  treatment  and \nregeneration, new technology and important technology for industry are agreed to consolidate into the same group of \n\
    priority  as  such  research  categories  are  out  rank  as  compared  to  public \
    \ security  and  good  corporate  governance. \nFurthermore, the group of researches on business administration in tourism management and aging society are ranked \n\
    at the last priority. \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Eigenvalues for priority ranking under research categories \n\

    understand  why  researchers  provided  three  or  higher  score  (i.e.  medium \
    \ and  up)  of  importance  to  each  research \ncategory, we made a request: “if the priority need score is three or higher please provide a brief reason why you think \n\
    that way.” The followings are some opinions of researchers: \n240 | P a g e  \n\
     \n \nIn the present, problems on natural resources and environment should receive most attention since it is in a \n\
    critical level. It was estimated that in the near future food shortage crisis may be arisen related to an increase \n\
    of world population. Water is a major factor affecting agricultural production. Therefore, paying attention to \n\
    research on increasing water source potential would be an essential task for solving food security problem; this \n\
    should  account  the  research  on  water  resource  management,  global  warming \
    \ and  alternative  energy, \nenvironment  management  and  the  development \
    \ of  water  resource  value,  new  technology  and  important \ntechnology for industry. \n\
     \nResearch on the development of capacity building of staff/researcher for serving human resource development \n\
    in Thai country. \n \nIt was expected that the research on the reform of education paradigms and creative learning will improve Thai \n\
    research level because it is a foundation of different fields of research.  \n\
     \nGlobal warming and alternative energy research will provide substantial knowledge on weather prediction and \n\
    choices of alternative energy technologies instead of fossil fuel energy.  \n\
     \nEncouragement of self‐care and disease protection will make citizen healthy. \n\
     \nFor self‐sufficiency economic, sustainable agriculture and logistic system points of view, because Thailand is \n\
    agriculture country; most people are poor, application of self‐sufficiency theory plays an important role in Thai \n\
    country development. This shall account the logistic system development in agriculture sector to reduce its cost \n\
    of transportation.  \n \nThe  research  on  encouragement  of  public  security \
    \ and  good  governance  would  lead  to  a  fair  society.  This \nshould account an encouragement of the research on the development of capacity building of staff/researcher \n\
    in  parallel  fashion.  In  this  regard,it  is  believed  that  Thailand  will \
    \ receive  actual  benefits  from  research \nperformed in the right sequence. \n\
     \nRegarding  the  Asean  Economics]  Community,  of  which  Thailand  is  a \
    \ member,  research  on  business \nadministration  in  tourism  management  should \
    \ be  encouraged  to  increase  potential  in  terms  of  restoration \nservice and tourism industry and communication. \n\
     \n, Thailand is stepping into an aging society with sharp increase of elderly rate which is estimated to be around \n\
    13  million  in  the  next  decade  while  the  present  number  of  elderly \
    \ population  is  around  nine  million. \nEncouragement  of  self‐care,  disease \
    \ protection,  health  treatment  and  regeneration  is  therefore  highly \n\
    important especially in the aging society.  \n \n1.3 Prioritization of research needs under challenging research groups \n\
    Five strategies and their ten research categories are systematically set up by NRCT as their priority needs have \n\
    already been assigned. Let’s narrow down from research needs under research categories level to research group level. \n\
    Challenging research groups were discussed by many researchers from the Irrigation Development Institute (IDI) and \n\
    researchers  from  different  organisations  who  are  concerned  with  irrigation \
    \ and  water  management.  However,  we \nhypothesised that its sequential needs may be different by the rule of problem concentration and budget allocation.  \n\
    Prioritisation of research needs under challenging research groups are shown in Fig.3 and Table 2.  \n\
    Public participation in water management was identified as the first rank research need. Including the first rank, \n\
    the  top‐ten  of  high  rank  provides  insight  for  holistic  research  needs \
    \ on  management  strategy  and  capacity  building \ncontexts. These can be classified into research topic categories on the authorised local association for self‐management \n\
    (i.e.  farmer),  public  participation  in  water  and  resources  management, \
    \ development  of  irrigation  and  technology, \nhydrology and river hydraulic for water management, as well as capacity building of people and organization who are \n\
    concerned with irrigation and water management.  \nConsidering the research group from the 8th rank to the 13th rank as the next rank after the priority needs \n\
    mentioned  before,  the  second  priority  goes  to  research  on  the  efficiency \
    \ and  performance  upgrade  by  efficient \nirrigation monitoring and maintenance scheme, extending and conservation of irrigated area potentials. Such efficiency \n\
    and performance upgrade need to consider the research on climate change and weed impacts on irrigation. Integrated \n\
    technology and alternative energy for irrigation are expected as free input to increase irrigation and water management \n\
    potentials.  \n241 | P a g e  \n \n \n \nFigure 3 Eigenvalues for priority ranking under research groups \n\

    water  is  also  reflecting  irrigation  efficiency  and  its  management  performance \
    \ upgrade.  This  is  most  likely  because \nirrigation projects that have more capital and water do not need research on irrigation water productivity development.  \n\
    For  overall figures, more than half of such research receive high  importance as the rest receives degree \
    \ of \nimportance in the range of medium to nearly high. To understand the reason why researchers provided importance \n\
    score three onwards (i.e. medium onwards) to each important research group, we asked “if the priority need score is \n\
    three onwards please provides brief reason why you think that.” The following are the opinions of the researchers: \n\
     \nPeople’s participation as WUA is an important process leading to the acceptance and achievement in water \n\
    executive management. Capacity building of authorised officers in organisations for understanding the present \n\
    working procedures plays an important role for an increase of organisation performance. Because achievement \n\
    of research in the area of the efficient and equitable water use strategy is still poor, intensive attention on this \n\
    research  shall  be  encouraged  with  high  priority.  This  should  account \
    \ the  research  on  performance  and \nefficiency evaluation of irrigation projects as well as the development of implements and technology for water \n\
    management. In addition, irrigation water should be controllable and manageable for both flood and drought. \n\
     \nThe research on the development of implements and technology for water management should be undertaken \n\
    by a researcher in parallel manner to overcome the changes in the present environment, social behaviour and \n\
    energy constraints.  \n \nThe research on the development of irrigated area potential will increase agricultural productions. \n\
     \nThe Research on the database development will lead to development of technology and accessibility of \n\
    information and knowledge. The database system will provide substantial valuable information for different \n\
    kinds of researches. \n \nResearch shall  be focused  on the development of an existing system in the maintenance and management \n\
    points of view. For examples, research groups on the sediment flushing along upstream of irrigation structure, \n\
    an  aquatic  weed  problem  in  irrigation  canal  and  river,  irrigation  infrastructure \
    \ and  appurtenance  structure \nmaintenance,  physical  model  study  of  hydraulic \
    \ and  hydrology  in  water  management  as  well  as  study  on \nstrategic model for protection and solving of conflict problem in water management.  \n\
     \nShortage  in  a  number  of  staffs  and  labor  would  become  obstacles \
    \ in  the  development  of  irrigation \nmanagement.  There  are  the  needs \
    \ of  capacity  building  of  personal  and  organisation  development  in  water \n\
    management,  transferring  of  technology  and  knowledge  to  farmers  by  public \
    \ participation  in  water \nmanagement strategy in the right direction.   \n\
     \nResearch on climate change impacts will increase capability in prediction of effects of global warming to find \n\
    appropriate mitigation strategy. \n \nResearch on the irrigation service fees will create involvement of farmer for efficient use of water, whilst this \n\
    may constitute the problem. Hence, the research on these regards should be emphasised.  \n\
     \n2. Challenging research related to irrigation and water management \nIn  irrigation \
    \ and  water  management,  there  are  many  research  attempts  to  develop \
    \ its  efficiency  through \ntechnologies and strategic management. However, by researchers’ opinions we have concluded on the challenging \n\
    research needs. Some suggestions provided by researchers as follows: \n \nFor reservoir operation rule curve point of view, various reservoirs in Thailand shall have an appropriate rule \n\
    curve  for  operation;  the  development  of  reservoir  operation  rule  curve \
    \ thus  is  required.  Probability‐based \noperation rule curve may be a simple method which can be practical for use and easy to understand for training \n\
    users in irrigation supply and maintenance project. The perfect reservoir operation rule curve shall carefully \n\
    consider water uses in different sectors as well as accounting of losses and inflow. \n\
     \nThere is the challenging research related on the study of physical hydrologic watershed characteristics affecting \n\
    the change of reservoir storage. An evaluation processes can be modeled using field survey data of reservoir \n\
    sediment volume and its sediment rate. The model would reflect the capital water of each reservoir. The simple \n\
    backward stepwise multiple linear regression can be applied which incorporates various independent variables \n\
    that comprise of  inflow entry to reservoir,  rainfall amount  at the upstream \
    \ of reservoir,  watershed area of \nreservoir,  reservoir  capacity,  water \
    \ surface  area  chart  of  reservoir,  watershed  level  differentiate  rate, \n\
    compactness  coefficient,  river‐bend  curvature.  The  expected  finding  will \
    \ provide  the  realistic  last  updated \nstorage of an existing reservoir which indicates the capital water of Thailand reservoir projects. The method \n\
    243 | P a g e  \n \nmay be efficient and may provide cost saving for rapid estimation of capital water in reservoir. Moreover, it \n\
    also saves time consuming for further field survey and for virtual simulation of water situation of reservoir for \n\
    irrigation water management.  \n \nThere are challenging research studies on the drainage of river at the river mouth that has high influence of \n\
    very  complex  river  tidal  water  phenomenon.  The  flow  characteristic  at \
    \ this  location  is  all‐time  unsteady \ncondition.  There  is  irreducible \
    \ of  complexity  for  launching  research  operation  in  terms  of  field  survey \
    \ and \nmeasurement of field data along the river. If collected data is not enough, physical model and mathematical \n\
    model calibration acceptance will then be poor (i.e. low quality). Hence, continuous data correction shall be \n\
    performed to cover all cycles of tidal water. Water management shall also consider tidal water phenomena as \n\
    well.  \n \nThe study of pattern of irrigation control structure and systems which shall have capability to function as flood \n\
    mitigation during rainy season and a water diversion structure to store water an increase water level which has \n\
    high  enough  effective  head  for  releasing  water  to  an  irrigated  area. \
    \ There  is  some  specific  importance  of \nirrigation  system  in  terms  of \
    \ capability  to  function  as  irrigation  canal  and  intercept  drainage  canal; \
    \ these \nsystems can provide efficient operation to decrease side flow in flood zone by bypassing its flow direction and \n\
    release to the drainage area.  \n \nThe research study on the patterns of dike system and structure which can potentially mitigate flood problems \n\
    in detention basins especially in the areas of Khong‐Chi‐Mun watershed. This shall account the alternatives of \n\
    flood  mitigation  in  the  Lower‐Mun  river  basin.  These  challenges  shall \
    \ consider  an  application  of  precise \nhydraulic modelling for analysis of unsteady flow in the river network.  \n\
     \nThe  research  area  on  physical  model  study  is  very  useful  and  it \
    \ challenges  researchers  to  apply  their  wide \nknowledge on the analysis of irrigation structural shape and appurtenances (i.e. head regulator, diversion weir, \n\
    spillway, concrete dam and embankment dam), erosion effects at upstream and down‐stream end of irrigation \n\
    structure,  effects  of  water  surface  level  at  the  up‐stream  and  down‐stream \
    \ end  of  irrigation  structure, \nsedimentation and sediment flushing in front of diversion weir. There are major research interests on the study \n\
    of physical model of spillway of Kwai Noi Bamrung Daen Dam, spillway of Pasak Chonlasit Dam, Nong Saleak \n\
    Weir,  Khlong  Lad  Pho  Flood  Alleviating  Regulator  and  a  crooked  channel \
    \ in  Chao  Phraya  River.  A  crooked \nchannel in Khlong Lad Pho is the most challenging research that interviewees have ever performed because it is \n\
    a distorted physical model which is hard for analysis as compared to undistorted model. The distorted physical \n\
    model is characterized by asymmetric in horizontal axis and vertical axis due to the reduction scale of  the \n\
    crooked  channel  in  Khlong  Lad  Pho  around  18  km  to  15‐20  m  by  estimation. \
    \   Moreover,  interviewees  are \ninterested  in  the  research  about  head \
    \ regulator  operation  which  is  influenced  by  tidal  water  effects. \nInterviewees suggested that controlling of Khlong Lad Pho Flood Alleviating Regulator shall consider tidal water \n\
    effect  of  water  surface  level  at  upstream  and  down‐stream  end  of  regulator \
    \ as  well  as  vessel  navigation \npathways and erosion effects at the downstream of Khlong Lad Pho at junction point of Khlong Lad Pho and \n\
    Chao Phraya River. \n \nTackle on of the problem of aquatic weeds in irrigation system. There are different methods to tackle aqua \n\
    weeds; however, each method has its limitation. For instance, chemical control scheme of aquatic weeds may \n\
    impact water quality by contamination of chemical residue, elimination of aquatic weeds using human power is \n\
    still not efficient, and development of large aquatic weed harvester may not serve all area especially in narrow \n\
    canal and is not worth. Development of aquatic weeds needs different research fields in the areas of biology, \n\
    mechanical engineering and hydraulic. \n \nResearch  on  Robogate  and  canal \
    \ automation  system.  Since  the  behaviour  of  flow  and  canal  operation \
    \ is \ncomplex, there are many canal perturbations leading to imprecision on gate operation in the irrigation canal. \n\
    Because  flow  in  the  irrigation  canal  is  unsteady  condition,  it  therefore \
    \ requires  the  arriving  time  for \napproaching to the gate as appearance in the change of water level in the irrigation canal during different gate \n\
    operation  leading  imprecision  of  discharge  control.  Such  perturbations \
    \ shall  be  accounted  in  Robogate  and \ncanal  automation  system  as  it \
    \ challenges  researcher  to  apply  systematic  knowledge  on  electronics, \n\
    mechatronics, hydraulics and stochastics in irrigation canal. \n \nFor the needs of irrigation management point of view, there is a need to address the prospect of research on \n\
    Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)in resolving the current water crisis to achieve a sustainable \n\
    development. Conducting of research on water conflicts between upstream farmer and down‐stream farmer \n\
    244 | P a g e  \n \nshould be launched, whilst technical involvement aspects between them shall be characterized by compromise \n\
    solution among conflicting organisations/personals. The conflicts can be found both fresh water and agriculture \n\
    water sources which appear in natural and international levels. Water conflicts arise for many reasons, namely \n\
    territorial disputes as well as fighting for resources and privacy strategy advantages.  \n\
     \nResearch  should  be  emphasized  on  water  management.  The  water  management \
    \ plays  important  role  for \ndifferent activities in country, namely consumption agriculture and industry. The results of water management \n\
    study  have  capability  to  mitigate  damage  level  due  to  flood  devastator, \
    \ drought  crisis  whose  occurrences \nappear  with  higher  frequency  rate \
    \ per  annum.  Present  research  related  to  irrigation  and  water  resources \n\
    engineering shall have the capability to tackle with water management for both normal and critical situations. \n\
    In addition, it shall be considered in different water shed levels, project level, and on‐farm level. \n\
     \nAuthorised staffs/researchers who concern Thailand research development shall concentrate on the researches \n\
    that evolve the methodologies of soil, water, plants followed by analyses of agriculture soil, soil engineering, \n\
    concrete structure and science and engineering materials, water use, hydrology and hydraulic in irrigation by \n\
    sequence.  \n \nIn  some  case  solving  of  water  crisis  may  need  to  divert \
    \ water  to  the  area  that  is  indicated  as  a  potential \ndetention water zone; the research on this regard shall account the benefits and losses of assets and traditional \n\
    social livelihood of people in the affected area for an appropriate compensation.  \n\
     \nFor  methodology  in  hydrology,  there  should  be  the  research  works \
    \ on  weather  data  missing  and  data \ncorrection analysis. Towards the state‐of‐the‐art of weather generator science, this is a very useful procedure \n\
    before  performing  Sequential  research  operations  in  the  contexts  of  flood \
    \ frequency  and  climate  change \nimpact on irrigation and uncertainty in climate data.  \n\
     \nConflicts among various water use sectors shall be launched based on water balance budgets to observe actual \n\
    water need, sink water, Blue/Green/Grey available water and its recycle, water quality and losses couple with \n\
    economic assessment.  \n \nFor soil‐plant relationships, importance of soil losses can effect crop growth and yield production. Soil losses \n\
    cause  low  soil  fertility  as  soil  water  losses  through  percolation  and \
    \ seepage  losses  leads  to  soil  moisture \ndeficiency and crop moisture stress. The study on reduction of percolation and seepage losses of farm pond in \n\
    on‐farm irrigation system using Bentonite products is an example research that should be studied in depth for \n\
    its practical application. Furthermore, the development of soil moisture measurement instrument, automatic \n\
    water supply system for crop is needed to perform a research operation. The key importance of automatic \n\
    water supply system is set points which control start and stop processes of automatic water supply system. In \n\
    addition, measuring system for water qualities monitoring which includes data transferring using remote GPRS \n\
    and web application fascinates researchers to achieve its development because it can save costs for monitoring \n\
    and investigation of water quality at different points in the same time. \n \n\
    \ “Right recycling of wastes or by-product from power plants can reduce environment\
    \ issues.” There should be an \nactivation of researchers’ inspiration in the\
    \ research on compensatory materials science. Research on the \napplication of\
    \ fly ash for construction and steel furnace slag for concrete mixing are examples.\
    \  \n \nMore expectation on the development of testing tools, quality and qualification\
    \ measure tools for engineering \nmaterials instead of import expensive tools\
    \ from abroad is required because there may have been some limitation \nin irrigation\
    \ works. \n \nIn irrigation water supply water quality has high influence to crop yield potential, research on solving of water \n\
    turbidity  problem  caused  by  dispersive  soil  is  one  example.  Dispersive \
    \ soil  characteristic  causes  permanent \nturbidity with no sedimentation. Mostly, this problem appears in Northeast Thailand. It rather highly affects \n\
    farm ponds which farmers utilize it for storing water for serving as supplementary irrigation to their farm plots. \n\
    This problem needs different knowledge in soil structure, dispersive soil behaviour, and water quality test. The \n\
    challenge is the finding of efficient method for permanent treatment of water turbidity without contamination \n\
    effects  as  a  proper  method  shall  not  affect  the aquatic  live  in  water \
    \ source  that  being  treated  and  human \nconsumption. \n \nFailure in irrigation canal structure leads to inefficient irrigation water management as uplift pressure at the \n\
    bottom  of  irrigation  structures  and  side  pressure  at  the  side  wall \
    \ are  the  issues  losing  irrigation  structure \nstability, research on mechanical uplift pressure meter for irrigation works shall be developed. Uplift pressure is \n\
    the pressure  below structure. Normally, it is determined by hydrostatic pressure. The uplift pressure meter \n\
    245 | P a g e  \n \nshall have capability for real time measurement. Its data is very useful for application in side slope stability \n\
    analysis of canal/retaining wall structures. \n \n3. Problems facing, obstacles and overlooked parameters in research works \n\
    Various problems facing, obstacles and overlooked parameters in research works may be found in research \n\
    operation. Experiences of researches are enumerated as follows: \n \nIn meteorology and hydrology analysis, an identified problem is the shortage of runoff time series data over \n\
    expectation. This may be because of the limitation of budget and the deterioration or prematurity of runoff \n\
    measuring station. New generation researchers shall consider the effective method for estimation of missing \n\
    data; otherwise, careful selection of data uses and research focus on the problem area having completed data \n\
    should be an alternative strategy that all researchers shall plan. \n \nIn some research project, modern measurement instruments which are imported from abroad may have some \n\
    limitations for operation. Development of simple tools by researchers themselves can provide more workable \n\
    and more reliable. The discussion to researcher who has high experiences in the use of implements imported \n\
    from abroad would be practical sense to receive the precise information about its limitation and idea for new \n\
    alternative tools development.  \n \nResearch shall be a simple technology and is practical for further application by users/other researchers who \n\
    can improve and correct problems of using technology themselves. This will allow easy extension of further \n\
    research  from  the  past  research  need  and  its  recommendation.  Expectation \
    \ of  research  finding  shall  be \npracticable in real situation; some barriers shall be predicted in advance to avoid research operation stuck. \n\
    Research shall be clearly described through theory and literature as the formation of interdisciplinary research \n\
    team by efficient colleagues is very important. \n \nPoor  budgets  support \
    \ and  development  of  an  idea  for  a  research  are  major  problems  which \
    \ have  been \nidentified as critical issues that researcher shall be planned.  \n\
     \nResearcher shall read the past literatures related to problem which he/she is focusing on; researchers shall \n\
    know and understand the motivation and driving force to do research for each problem. Hypothesis behind the \n\
    solution is essential to prove that logic thinking and proved results are reasonable and acceptable. \n\
     \nFor  flood  and  surface  flow  analysis,  one  of  the  factors  affecting \
    \ flow  behaviour  is  appropriate  roughness \ncoefficient  (Manning’s  coefficient) \
    \ of  channels  in  flood  plain  area.  The  difficult  task  is  calibration \
    \ for  this \ncoefficient as various factors shall be assigned for its validation (e.g. water surface level). An appropriate cross \n\
    sectional  distance  should  be  identified  to  cover  flood  plain  area  (e.g. \
    \ at  intersection  point  of  river,  abrupt \nchange of channel shape, inflection point of river).  \n\
     \nThe previous researches had been performed for particular field area and experience of researcher expertise. \n\
    Its  usefulness  and  objectives  are  therefore  focused  on  a  narrow  goal \
    \ as  global  issues  are  still  not  solved \nsimultaneously especially in the research contexts on irrigation and water management in different levels. In \n\
    worst  case,  it  may  damage  other  objectives  which  are  overlooked.    Hence, \
    \ the  new  generation  researches \nshould cover multi‐dimensional objectives (i.e. engineering constraint, agricultural benefits, economic worth, \n\
    social acceptance and environment conservation) which shall be in accordance with the real situation, whilst \n\
    they shall be acceptable and practicable for application.   \n \nPhysical  model \
    \ is  appropriate  for  particular  points  of  interest  such  as  irrigation \
    \ headwork,  diversion  weir, \ndrainage dam, barrage, and head regulator. This model is not proper to study or model the large system like \n\
    river  modelling,  watershed  model,  and  water  management  model  due  to \
    \ scaling  effects  (i.e.  distorted  and \nundistorted  model).  Boundary  of \
    \ physical  model  such  as  selection  of  area  modelling  shall  cover  the \
    \ results \nexpectation. Modelling of parameters and different kinds of factors in the model shall be similar to an actual \n\
    topography (prototype). For instance, Manning’s n, flow velocity, water level, and discharge. Selection of model \n\
    scale is very important. If it is too small, analysis will be impacted by scale effect problem, if it is too large \n\
    discharge control will  be difficult. Factors influencing  the  model precision such as bridge and barrier \
    \ in the \nactual canal shall be included in the physical model. Data for construction of physical model, calibration and \n\
    validation processes shall be updated by present field survey instead of using previous data or secondary data.  \n\
     \nThe last, some important statements provided by the interviewees to remind the new generation researchers \n\
    are as follows: \n \n246 | P a g e  \n \na) Researcher shall bear in mind that the calibration and validation process plays important role in the \n\
    study of physical model.  \nb) Researcher should consider reliability of the research using physical model coupled with mathematical \n\
    model. \nc) Researcher shall build self‐confidence related to his/her experiment result if setting up of research \n\
    operation is in the right way, and  does  not believe  experimental results information from internet \n\
    without proving its reliability and precision.     \nd) For  the  problem  in \
    \ completeness  of  data  and  its  reliability  points  of  view,  the  major \
    \ problem  in \nresearch operation is unable to collect field data which controls an environment and characteristic of \n\
    problem (e.g. heavy rain and flood). Moreover, uncertainty of data and information play a significant \n\
    role  in  research  results.  Therefore  uncertainty  shall  be  considered  in \
    \ the  research  operation  and \nanalysis. \ne) Paid attention to consistency of experiments in laboratory and real field condition should be made. \n\
    Engineers  should  be  careful  in  application  of  experiment  results  because \
    \ the  conditions  of  the \nexperiment  in  laboratory  and  the  real  field \
    \ condition  are  different,  the  results  of  both  are  also \ndifference. Short time experiment for an analysis of only short‐term effects should be avoid as long‐\n\
    term experiment shall be also performed because in the long‐term, real condition may yield worst \n\
    results. Moreover, repeating of experiments by increasing of replications would increase reliability of \n\
    research results. \nf) \nFor field survey and field experiment, problem is a working without providing an understanding and \n\
    knowledge to farmers before entering to the affected area especially in the public areas (e.g. temple, \n\
    school);  this point  of view  is very important because experiment  needs  complete field \
    \ survey  data \nwhich usually shall require the corporation of farmers in the local area. \n\
    g) Teamwork  is  the  major  problem  affecting  research  quality.  Missing \
    \ plan  with  overload  works/time \ndelay/research barriers could generate much more mistakes and poor quality of the research due to \n\
    its  launching  process  in  rush,  whereas  many  important  factors  are  left \
    \ behind  or  have  not  been \nidentified yet. \n \n4. Opinions on the national research policy and strategy \n\
     \n \nWe put the question by the statement of “In your opinion, do the present research need to be in accordance \n\
    with the Thai National Research Policy and Strategy? If yes why do you agree? If not what direction should the present \n\
    research  be  focused?”  to  the  researchers.  This  aims  at  to  understand \
    \ whether  there  may  have  some  conflicts  or \nincompleteness on the Thai NRPS or not, what is the appropriate direction of the present researches, and what research \n\
    should  be  focused  on  in  addition  to  the  research  that  have  been  specified \
    \ in  the  Thai  NRPS.  We  have  concluded \nresearcher opinions as follows; \n\
    For  Thai  research,  all  researchers  agree  that  following  the  Thai  NRPS \
    \ direction  researcher  would  receive \nsupport on fund, implements, and attention in the application of the research results. There is the fact that all research \n\
    needs and strategies are filtered by demand of problem solving. Data of information for each research finding would be \n\
    useful for linkage of information for continuing other researches as global problem of country will be slightly relaxed in a \n\
    sustainable manner. \nIn the past, different previous researches lack of continuity, whilst they are not a holistic research. Because \n\
    researchers often focus on their own idealisation to overcome problems as continuation of research framework from \n\
    the past research lesson is left behind. Based on the Thai NRPS, the continuing of research from the past research works \n\
    would provide substantial information, overlooked factors, missed process that should be avoid, and recommendation. \n\
    Furthermore, by a holistic research concept, linkage of continuous research development according to the Thai NRPS \n\
    would become more practical to tackle problems for Thailand in a real sustainable manner.  \n\
     \n5. Inurgent present research needs \n \n \nAs  described  in  the  previous \
    \ sections,  all  researches  agree  that  present  research  direction  should \
    \ be  in \naccordance with the Thai NRPS for several reasons. However, what research really need to be studied to resolve the \n\
    urgent  problems  is  still  the  question.  We  then  put  some  questions  on \
    \ “With  your  opinion,  is  there  any  challenging \nresearch you thing that it should be emphasised in rush? Are there the needs to do researches/technologies competing \n\
    247 | P a g e  \n \nwith  other  countries?”  to  extract  valuable  crystallized \
    \ opinions  from  expertise  researchers.  The  conclusion  on  this \nregards is as follows: \n\
     \n \nResearch challenge on water management for both normal and crisis situation.These shall be launched in rush \n\
    due  to  multiplicative  increasing  rate  of  damage  by  flood  and  drought \
    \ in  the  present  as  these  situation \ngenerates much more economic drop, peoples’ livelihood decay and lost assets. \n\
     \nThe  research  study  on  logistic  system,  because  Thailand  outranks \
    \ surrounding  countries  in  agricultural \nproduction  and  basic  business \
    \ administration  on  tourism.  Development  of  the  research  on  such  activities \n\
    should be encouraged in rush if Thailand needs to be a central Asian network. \n\
     \nThere are different intensive works of the research on global warming issues, engagement of science center \n\
    network to focus on global warming, communication with environmental protection, sustainable development \n\
    of water resources, nanotechnology in science, impacts of climate change, and biotechnology for serve as an \n\
    alternative energy. \n \nThe research on database development and data linkage, the research on development of irrigation area \n\
    potential, the research on the development of irrigation water user association, the research on climate change \n\
    impacts on irrigation, the research on the development of communication in the transfer of irrigation learning. \n\
     \nResearch  expectation  on  disaster,  risk  of  crop  failure  and  an  increase \
    \ of  agricultural  productivity  and  the \ndecrease of capital investment in agriculture production process in order to compete with other country in the \n\
    global agricultural market. \n \nTo compete with neighbor country there are the needs of researches, namely (1) development of irrigation \n\
    area  potential  using  less  area  as  its  expectation  is  an  increasing \
    \ of  crop  productivity,  (2)  an  increasing  of \nirrigation  efficiency  using \
    \ less  water  as  irrigation  area  potential  can  be  increased,  (3)  a  development \
    \ of \neconomic crops. \n \nResearch  being  concerned  with  operations,  administration \
    \ and  management.  Fair  management  of  water \ndistribution model is the idealised and is expected to cope with the conflicting problem in the use of water and \n\
    withdrawal  of  water  from  water  source  forest  in  watershed.  There  is \
    \ the  need  of  tools  or  implements \ndevelopment  which should  be  capable to \
    \ handle pubic water  management in an  equitable and sustainable \nmanner. \n\
     \nFocus  on  research  work  related  to  an  increase  of  irrigation  water \
    \ use  efficiency  as  well  as  an  appropriate \nstrategy in water supply. Water supply strategy should support irrigated area instead of traditional strategy on \n\
    an increase of reservoir watershed which would affect environment conservation. Urgent research should focus \n\
    on the prediction of flood and drought to specify water demand, water supply in major and minor watersheds \n\
    especially on conflicting areas of water use. This should include the consideration of an appropriate crop in the \n\
    agricultural area. \n \nParticipatory irrigation management (PIM) for sustainable water management. The PIM shall be cooperation of \n\
    people  in  the  grass  root  levels  which  should  directly  receive  benefit \
    \ from  their  involvement.  However,  its \nachievement should be studied in depth and in parallel fashion which usually is decayed by an inducement of \n\
    populism policy or political policy which permits politician or influential person to withdraw benefit from their \n\
    unfair policy coming with hidden agenda.  \n \nResearch on sufficiency economy should be emphasised in rush. Sufficiency economy has much more details, \n\
    for  instance,  smart  use  of  technology  and  recycling  use  of  by‐products \
    \ from  the  end  process  of  various \nproduction would be sustain at least household economic and imports.  \n\
     \n6. Influence factors for research achievement  \n \nPrevious sections provide various information about research needs, its priority needs, its importance, its challenges, \n\
    agreement  on  research  strategy.  This  session  provides  factors  researchers \
    \ consider  in  the  present  research  work \nachievement.  With  the  results \
    \ analysis  and  results  assimilation,  the  following  is  an  enumeration \
    \ of  the \nrecommendations for the present and future researches: \n \n Understanding of research motivation will be a driving force to launch the research to achieve the goal \n\
     Technology,  tools,  and  information  available.  There  shall  be  source \
    \ of  data,  database  for  basic  data, \nexperimental data and field survey data. Scientific input. \n\
    248 | P a g e  \n \n Accessibility to research or knowledge sharing. \n Experience of researchers, research management, and responsibility of researcher.  \n\
     Present research focus shall be identified the right objective according to the problem requirement and society; \n\
    therefore, it would be acceptable for further application. \n National and government policies shall have appropriate pathway for present research as well as research fund. \n\
     Constraints  in  terms  of  the  politics,  government  policies,  political \
    \ environment  affect  an  achievement  of \nresearch. \n Researcher shall have enough knowledge, experience and expertise for his/her particular research field. \n\
     Data used shall have high quality. \n Cooperation and coordination among colleagues and organizations \n\
     Research shall be focused on its proper time management and appropriate plan. Moreover, researcher shall \n\
    think about barriers of research operation in advance and try to handle it \n\
     Research budget allocation plays a significant role in research achievement. Encouragement of research shall \n\
    be supported by enough research fund and enough reward for an achievement. Budgets shall be supported \n\
    enough by organization or donor. Research operation shall be scoped in accordance with budget allowance. \n\
     Vision of high level chief executive, he shall seriously support official staff for research operation and receiving \n\
    research precedence by high level chief executive. \n Research application and practicability \n\
     \n7. Future research trends  \nThe previous section provides valuable information of factors influencing research achievement. This session \n\
    provides some opinions of researchers in the contexts of expectation and prediction of future research trends for the \n\
    next decades in the case of Thailand. With the results analysis and results assimilation, the following is an enumeration \n\
    of the broad recommendations: \n \n \nBecause Thai technologies lagged behind European countries, USA, England or Japan around more than five \n\
    years by estimation. Therefore, trend of the research for the next decades may be an extension of researches \n\
    of  these  countries.  One  reason  is  an  expensive  cost  of  initial  development/research \
    \ operation  and  cost  of \nresources \n \nThe research shall respond the Thai NRPS in both short‐term and long‐term of the National Economic and Social \n\
    Development Plan (NESDP). Research focus shall be considered in the context of integration of social, economic, \n\
    and technical development. More specific research needs may be biotechnology, water resource management, \n\
    biodiversity, alternative energy. \n \nThe future research for the next decades should be planned in accordance with the past identified problems \n\
    that have not been previously solved yet. The research should be a holistic research which accounts social, \n\
    environment, engineering, and economic constraints \n \nThailand should emphasise the innovation development towards commercial, economic and public utilisation \n\
    because the previous research quite rare to reach this point. Benefit of research like this will be utilised to \n\
    support researches in the other sectors such as social science, public health for further development of country \n\
    for all problem topics. \n \nThe research on climate change will be popular. Climate change heavily influences global weather, animal and \n\
    human being, environment, water resources, irrigation. \n \nThe research needs in the area of food security will be paid attention due to an increase of world population as \n\
    reduction in agricultural area is sharply decreased. Research on new technology or strategy for potential use of \n\
    agriculture area is expected \n \nFor  the  next  decades  environmental  effects \
    \ impact  research  achievement.  Researchers  shall  also  consider \nenvironmental \
    \ damage  and  improvement  for  their  research.  Single  solution  and  multiple \
    \ solutions  without \naccounting environmental issues may not be acceptable anymore. Look back project also play a significant role \n\
    in the past research follow‐up and evaluation in order to increase its efficiency and performance of existing \n\
    system. This may account capacity building of tools, technology and officer in irrigation and water management \n\
    as well. \n249 | P a g e  \n \n \nThe  research  needs  for  the  next  decades \
    \ would  be  the  problem  resolving  using  alternative  energy,  natural \n\
    disaster warning system for Tsunami and earthquake, and precise weather prediction. Moreover, research on \n\
    environment in terms of hazardous waste and toxic may be popular because waste is increasing all time. Water \n\
    deficiency  problem  still  threat  Thai  people  until  the  next  2‐3  decades, \
    \ research  on  development  of  water \nresources  and  water  use  efficiency \
    \ would  be  popular  to  respond  the  problem  of  sharp  increase  in  world \n\
    population and intensive extension of different water user sectors. \n \nIV. Conclusion\
    \ \n \nInformation on the overview of the historical evolvement and recent topics of relevant research works related to \n\
    irrigation as well as water management has been described in details. Such past and present immense researches tell \n\
    story  about  their  initial  problem  and  some  technical  development  evolution. \
    \ We  also  paid  attention  on  sharing \ndiscussion with different researchers who are concerned with irrigation and water management. The Thai NRPS raised \n\
    discussion  of  its  appropriate,  additional  needs,  its  consistency,  research \
    \ prioritization  and  research  importance.  All \nresearchers rather have agreement on legitimate Thai NRPS. Moreover, valuable lessons and experiences of researchers \n\
    as well as opinions  on the national research policy and strategy especially about urgent research needs, influencing \n\
    factors for research achievement, and future research trends clarified systematic research needs, its overlooked factors, \n\
    some suggestions and recommendations.  \n \n \n250 | P a g e  \n \nREFERENCES \n\

    \ development \nOver the past 20 years, there have been many scientific studies on meteorology and hydrology, especially \n\
    hydrological research for the development of agriculture and irrigation. The objectives of these studies have \n\
    changed for each development stage of agriculture and irrigation. \nIn the early 90s, agriculture was strongly developed with intensive farming for many places over the country. \n\
    In many regions of both rain‐fed and/or irrigated agriculture, annual crop patterns have changed from 1‐2 \n\
    crops to 2‐3 crops per year. These changes of crop patterns result in changes in the moisture balance. As a \n\
    result, to redefine agricultural meteorological parameters in the scientific references for irrigation planning \n\
    and agricultural production becomes necessary to adjust planning and production practices to these changes. \n\

    Some notable studies on hydrology in irrigation engineering \nStudy on humidity balance in the Mekong delta \n\
    - \nResearch objectives \no To analyse the humidity balance in the cultivated areas of vegetables and rice; \n\
    o To evaluate the effects of the humidity balance on the potential two‐crop areas and the cropping \n\
    patterns. \n- \nResults of research  \nThe study showed that the measured values of evaporation by the mini‐lysimeter were higher than the actual \n\
    values. Therefore, to improve the precision of measurement, the area of lysimeter tank should be increased \n\
    and the water level on the experiment field should be about 5 – 10cm. \nIn the north of the studied area, there is little rainfall and it is difficult to irrigate. As a result, two‐crop rice \n\
    production in this area has a low and unstable yield. However, the combination of 1‐crop rice and 1‐crop \n\
    vegetable could be also applied. On the contrary, in the Southern Area, the abundant rainfall and the longer \n\
    period of growth enable the development of two‐crop patterns. \nBesides,  the \
    \ balance  of  moisture  may  be  deficient  in  some  periods  for  both  summer‐autumn \
    \ crops  and \nseason crops because of little rainfall and its uneven distribution in the studied area. To regulate water, rice \n\
    fields need to be covered by the embankment with a height of about 10‐15 cm for summer‐autumn crops \n\
    and 15‐20 cm for season crops. \n- \nFuture research recommendations \no To increase the number of crops in the dry season; \n\
    o To require specific studies for smaller areas; \no To do further studies to meet the requirements of agricultural production.   \n\
    Effect of temperature and humidity on the development of winter‐spring rice crop in 2000‐\n\
    2001 \n- \nResearch objectives \no To study the relationship between the weather factors and pests in rice fields  \n\
    o To propose the suitable methods and timing to prevent pests. \n258 | P a g e\

    \ climate  factors  and  diseases,  ecological  and  biological \ncharacteristics \
    \ of  the  diseases,  and  the  ways  pests  damage  crops.  The  results  showed \
    \ that  the  pests  are \naffected by many factors, especially meteorological factors. The meteorological factors of the growth of some \n\
    pests are presented as follows: \no Nilaparvatalugens will grow quickly in the environment of high temperature, low humidity (80%), \n\

    Intensive farming increases damages due to  pests, especially in winter‐spring and summer‐autumn crops. \n\
    Although  pesticides  have  been  used  quite  effectively,  they  cannot  fully \
    \ stop  the  diseases  in  some  cases \nbecause  they  are  applied  with  incorrect \
    \ methods  and  timing.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  not  full \nconsiderations \
    \ for  important  factors  in  the  development  of  diseases,  such  as  temperature \
    \ and  humidity. \nTherefore, the effects of temperature and humidity on diseases need to be studied. \n\

    This research is based on field surveys, statistics, Kriging distribution of GIS, and the overlap of GIS maps. \n\

    259 | P a g e  \n \nIn the stage of construction, the Tam Phuong irrigation system had low efficiency. For example, the impacts \n\
    of tide and saline intrusion in the project area were almost unchanged. Also, water levels on the large rivers \n\
    were  quite  stable.  There  was  no  water  supply  to  the  project  area. \
    \ Moreover,  the  in‐field  hydrological \ncharacteristics were influenced by natural conditions. \n\
    After the Tam Phuong irrigation system was constructed, the project area was almost drained because tidal \n\
    valley (the lowest point) is always less than +0.3 m. As a result, the project area enables intensive cultivation \n\
    of autumn‐winter rice with the high yield and the shorter period of cultivation (being reduced from 6 months \n\
    to 4 months). On the other hand, the gravity irrigation capacity increases when tidal peak (the highest point) \n\
    is over +0.7m. However, rice production still depends on natural conditions. \n\

    there are about 19 years in which the flow did not meet to irrigation demands. \n\
    o The water level of the reservoir is lower than the groundwater level and the two have correlation \n\

    o To use GIS. \n- \nResults of research  \nThe results of the research showed that under the impacts of climate change, saline intrusion, sea level rise \n\
    and  drought  may  reduce  the  agricultural  area  in  the  Mekong  Delta  resulting \
    \ in  the  decrease  of  rice \nproductivity. In detail, rice yield might decrease 6% in 2020, 15% in 2050 and 30% in 2100. Similarly, the area \n\
    of rice production might remain about 60%, 50% and 20%, respectively by 2020, 2050 and 2100. \n\

    \ of historical development \nIn recent decades, agricultural production has increased significantly. One of the main contributions for \n\
    that is the development of irrigation systems. These systems not only supply freshwater, but also contribute \n\
    261 | P a g e  \n \nto land reclamation, flood control and salinity. The irrigation works after completion will be separated into \n\
    many  levels  of  management,  from  provincial  managers  to  water  users. \
    \ However,  the  current  hierarchical \nsystem has still some weaknesses. Management and operation of the irrigation \
    \ systems are necessary to \nimprove their efficiency. \nThere were few concerns for implementing studies and transferring of scientific and technical advances into \n\
    the management and operation of irrigation systems. Investment for equipment and scientific technologies \n\
    on management and exploitation of irrigation works was negligible. Consequently, the suitable solutions for \n\
    the management and operation of the irrigation systems need to be studied for the sustainable development \n\
    of water resources. \nRecently, the roles of irrigation systems are more and more important to meet the increasing need of water \n\
    uses for agriculture, aquaculture, domestic users, industry, and transportation. Operation and management \n\
    of the irrigation systems is becoming more complex. Thus, it is required to use the modern tools such as the \n\
    procedures of O&M, devices to support the effective management and operation. Especially, it is necessary \n\
    to have good procedure for the irrigation system O&M that involves provinces because it will help irrigation \n\
    management companies cooperate tightly. \nMoreover, as mentioned above, Viet Nam has been increasingly impacted by climate change and sea level \n\

    \ Also,  the  systems  could  not  effectively \noperate to meet the increasing need of water supply due to the lack of the supporting tools and the efficient \n\

    production  not  only  depends  on  water  resources,  but  is  also  impacted \
    \ by  floods  in  rainy  seasons  and \nsaltwater  intrusion  in  dry  seasons. \
    \ Therefore,  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  sea  level  rise  on  rice \n\
    production need to be studied. \n3. Applied hydraulics calculation in irrigation\
    \ engineering \n3.1. Review of historical evolvement \nThe one‐dimensional hydraulic modelling for network of river channels are setup based on the Saint‐Venant \n\
    one‐dimensional equations for flow and the one‐dimensional propagation equations for salt propagation or \n\
    propagation  of  the  key  elements  of  water  quality  (eg  BOD,  DO,  total \
    \ nitrogen,  total  phosphorus,  ...  ). \n267 | P a g e  \n \nAlthough  these \
    \ models  are  derived  from  physical  (or  mechanical)  principles,  due  to \
    \ the  algorithm,  the \norganisation of various computer programmes, and/or different models, calculated results do not describe \n\
    the physical (or mechanical) phenomena. Traditional methods are using the finite differential implicit method \n\
    with 4 or 6 point or finite differential explicit method with alternating points to simulate water level and flow. \n\
    If only the flow in the river channel system without structures or field is simulated, the results calculated \n\
    from the model and reality are not much different. However, if simulation involves the hydraulic structure \n\
    system like dams and culverts (including culverts, dams with operation) as well as the flow fields, and from \n\

    model, especially for large river systems and complex channel network. \nAs mentioned above, IWRP uses hydraulic models extensively for planning. The following models are listed in \n\
    the order of historical evolvement: \nModel VRSAP \nThis hydraulic model is considered as the beginning of the process of applying mathematical models to solve \n\
    the problem of open channel hydraulics in Viet Nam on the main frame. The model first comes only with the \n\
    flow element, and former Assoc. Prof. Nguyen Nhu Khue imported it from the Netherlands in 1978 through \n\
    the  process of  learning  and  work.  During  the  application  process,  VRSAP \
    \ was  improved and  continuously \ndeveloped and the salt element was added in 1988 based on a central difference algorithm similar to the \n\
    algorithm MEKSAL. VRSAP was continuously developed with added utilities and switched to Visual Basic by \n\
    the  SIWRP  modelling  team  to  take  advantage  of  the  expanded  memory  of \
    \ computers  as  well  as  the \ndevelopment of information technology. \nVRSAP \
    \ used  the  4  points  implicit  scheme  of  Dronker.  River  or  channel  is \
    \ divided  into  sections  and  is \ncharacterised  by  an  average  cross‐section \
    \ selected  by  the  user.  Presume  that  at  node  of  confluence  or \nbifurcation, \
    \ the  cross‐section  of  the  river  tributaries  is  defined  nearby  that \
    \ node,  moreover,  there  is  no \nhorizontal  water  surface  slope  in  a \
    \ cross‐section.  The  field  is  divided  into  cells  by  natural  boundaries \
    \ or \nassumptions. The cells are divided into 2 types open cell and closed cell: \n\
    ‐ Open cells are linked with the river channel cross sections and change only water level with the change of \n\
    water level in that cross‐section. It could be considered simply like an extended river banks. \n\
    ‐ Closed cells are independent, exchange water with adjacent cells via culvert or dam, these structures can \n\
    work 1‐way or 2‐way (just take in or off the water) . \n268 | P a g e  \n \nA downside of the scheme is, when the drainage structures are between cells and specially are right on the \n\
    river,  it  changes  flow  regime  (freedom  to  flooding  and  vice  versa) \
    \ in  some  periods  of  calculation,  which \nmakes the results unsteady even in the iteration. Another disadvantage is the need for introducing dummy \n\
    channel to solve the flood problem. With the dry problem, in the tidal area at low tide there are shallow \n\
    areas where VRSAP stops. So VRSAP runs hardly when using a diagram for both flood and dry problems. \n\
    There are issues about how to organise the data. VRSAP uses average cross‐section for each passage so it is \n\
    difficult to control between real data and processed data. Also, the velocity is average velocity in passages, \n\
    not in cross‐sections. VRSAP used 13 water levels (0.5 m step) to describe the cross‐river terrain fluctuation, \n\
    which is equivalent to 6.0 m of water depth. With more than 6.0 m range, VRSAP must perform extrapolation \n\
    or users have to add storage cells, which leads to inaccurate results especially when calculating the plans. \n\
    VRSAP Software has been extensively used for solving flood and dry problem, especially in flood planning \n\
    calculations for Mekong Delta Viet Nam and the entire Lower Mekong, as well as in the planning calculation \n\
    for water resources projects, and it also delivers reliable results. \nAs stated above VRSAP is also able to solve salt problems. However, solving a salt problem based on the \n\
    central difference diagram is difficult in calibration due to the diffusion phenomenon.         \n\
    Model SAL and VRSAP‐SAL \nSAL  (or  SALBOD)  by  Prof  Nguyen  Tat  Dac  was \
    \ built  from  1980s  (with  the  different  versions  through  the \ncomplete process). \n\
    SAL is  a  model  built mathematically closely, based on  the weighted 4‐point implicit difference scheme \
    \ of \nPreissmanwitha weight value of 2/3 to minimise errors in difference. The solution is divided into two steps \n\
    (after linearisation system of algebraic equations) as follows: \n‐  Step  1: \
    \ Set  up  the  chase  formula  to  calculate  the  water  level  and  discharge \
    \ at  cross‐sections.  Use  this \nformula to establish the system of equations (called nodes system) in which unknowns is only the water level \n\
    at the confluence. This system of equations contains much smaller unknowns from other systems in which \n\
    unknowns are the water levels at all the cross‐sections, so the faster and less memory. \n\
    ‐ Step 2: After solving nodes system, it will show the water levels at the heads of two branches, and then \n\
    solve each branch separately using the original chase formula. \nThe  fact  that \
    \ the  speed  of  calculation  depends  on  the  complexity  of  the  river  and \
    \ channel  system  being \nsimulated,  the  number  of  confluences  determines \
    \ how  much  time  is  needed  to  calculate.  Moreover,  the \niterative algorithm is used to increase calculation time according to the number of iterations. Although it is \n\
    implicit diagram, large time step also affects the accuracy of results. Typically 30 minute time step is sufficient \n\
    to ensure for calculation of flow and salinity. If the calculation is only for flow, 1 hour time step can ensure \n\
    accuracy enough. \nIt  can  be  said  that  by  dividing  into  2  steps,  the \
    \ model  is  creative  and  involves  considerable  academic \ndevelopment.  The \
    \ model  SAL  divided  the  cell  in  the  scheme  MEK01  of  SOGREAH  as  only \
    \ a  preliminary \nprocedure. \n269 | P a g e  \n \nThe  calculation  of  spreading \
    \ substances  in  the  SAL  is  based  on  decomposition  algorithm.  When  solving \n\
    equations for pure transmission by using hidden characteristic line method with cubic spline interpolation to \n\
    ensure maximum reduction of diffuse, the calculation speed of the SAL is very fast. \n\
    VRSAP‐SAL is an improved scheme to coordinate a number of advantages of VRSAP with SAL. In terms of \n\
    algorithms, data structures and the calculation spreading substances remain as SAL. \n\

    Hydraulic thematic report by Bui Quang Tuan (2012‐2013) \nPurposes and requirements for hydraulic calculation \n\
    The purpose of hydraulic calculations is to determine the maximum flood level as well as the evolution of the \n\
    water level and flood discharge for flood prevention in the system of Red River ‐ Thai Binh. Requirements are \n\
    calculated  to  quantify  designed  discharge  and  flood  level  along  the \
    \ routes  of  the  plan  to  determine  the \ndrainage boundary line for each river, identify construction and non‐construction solutions to prevent and \n\
    combat  flood  as  a  basis  for  planning  dikes,  land  use  planning,  construction \
    \ planning  and  other  planning \nrelated sectors and localities. Hydraulic calculations will be described in the \
    \ hydraulic regime  of  the river \nnetwork in the flood season to determine the largest water level and discharge along river according to the \n\
    standards for flood prevention of the rivers in the Red – Thai Binh River Basin, in the normal state as well as \n\
    flood prevention schemes. \nMethod of calculating \nThe flow of the entire river network depends on the calculation of impact: water from the upper and middle \n\
    catchment areas and tide level. The input discharges in the upper and middle catchment areas as well as the \n\
    sea level will change slowly over time. The type of long wavelengths changes during flowing time, too. Flood \n\
    discharge in river networks also changes receiving discharges from distributaries and tributaries along the \n\
    river route. Therefore, the flow regime in the river network is unsteady. The flow regime slowly changes in \n\
    both space and time, and flooding water flows mainly along the river. Hydraulic regime of the river flow in \n\
    the network computing system is described by two differential equations of partial Saint‐Venant. \n\
    Solution of the aforementioned system of equations cannot be calculated by a direct integration method. We \n\
    must  use  approximate  methods.  Finite  implicit  difference  method  is  applied \
    \ to  one‐dimensional \nhydrodynamic model MIKE 11 built by the Danish Hydraulic Institute to solve the hydraulic problem for this \n\

    \ a g e  \n \nThe figure of Mike 21 FM (\" FM \" stands for Flexible Mesh) highlights the differences with the other two‐\n\
    dimensional models of mesh computing that are often curved or quadrangular mesh. \n\
    The model based on a quadrangular mesh gives solutions with sufficient accuracy in simulating river banks. \n\
    However, the complex topography of the river, especially in the curved section of the river and the existing \n\
    river that flows suddenly expanded or narrowed, requires accurate simulation of the border, and so requires \n\
    the use of flexible mesh. And this is the strong point of the study on hydrodynamic regimes of the river using \n\
    MIKE 21 FM. \n \nMIKE 21 flexible mesh \nMike 21 flexible mesh (FM) is used to generate mesh for a simulation. The use of flexible mesh reduces the \n\
    number  of  mesh  comparing  to  the  use  of  a  quadrangular  mesh  because \
    \ it  can  change  the  size  of  mesh \naccording  to  computing  terrain.  As \
    \ simulation  of  boundary  is  better,  and  thus  results  are  calculated \
    \ with \nhigher accuracy. In the FM model, longer time steps can be used and the resolution of the flow improves \n\
    significantly because the mesh always closely follows the flow. And finally, when running FM model, because \n\
    less points are defined and stored, it requires less storage capacity. \nWith the advantages of the flexible mesh and the scientific basis of Mike 21FM presented above, the model \n\
    can be applied for all the following studies: \na) The study on overall hydraulic regime across the river and more details at each point, which include \n\
    characteristics  of  water  level,  discharge,  flow  velocity  and  its  horizontal \
    \ distribution:  its  ability  to \ncalculate the flow in the largely diverted river is an important component in research on erosion and \n\
    sedimentation of river bank. \nb) Calculation of the river bed changes (erosion and sedimentation of river bed) and riverbank erosion in \n\
    its natural as well as planned segments for the exploitation of the river in the future. \n\
    4. Remote sensing and information system application \n4.1. Introduction \nToday, the use of satellite information and remote sensing in the study of monitoring the Earth has become \n\
    an  essential  need  in  many  countries,  including  Viet  Nam.  Regardless \
    \ of  the  type  of  satellites,  military \n274 | P a g e  \n \nsatellites, \
    \ navigation  satellites,  telecommunication  satellites,  the  reconnaissance \
    \ satellite  system  (or \nobserving  Earth)  operating  in  orbits  are  diverse \
    \ of  types  and  features.  The  exploitation  of  Information \nTechnology \
    \ satellite  is  actually  serving  the  people,  bringing  efficiency  in  many \
    \ fields  of  science  and \ntechnology, serving life, production and control of resources ‐ environment. One of modern technologies to \n\
    assist  in  the  integrated  management  of  natural  resources  and  environment \
    \ is  now  remote  sensing  and \ngeographic information system (GIS). In the framework of this report, we would like to address the need and \n\
    the  possibility  of  using  remote  sensing  techniques  (RS)  and  GIS  in \
    \ study  for  integrated  management  of \nnatural resources for irrigation projects. \n\
    4.2. Review of historical evolvement \nThe research and surveys in coastal plains and estuaries is difficult when the weather is uncertain, as in the \n\
    case of storms, cyclones, hurricanes or thunderstorms when heavy flooding and season wind blowing are \n\
    expected. To overcome this difficulty, one very effective method in the present study of coastal plains and \n\
    estuaries is conjunctive use of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). \n\
    Remote sensing \nRS  materials  are  diverse  in  type  and  spatial  resolution, \
    \ including  the  type  of  aerial  photographs  and \nobservational satellite images obtained in the different time, of which kind of Multispectral Image is now \n\
    widely used. Multispectral images are collected by optical devices (so called optical image) in a wide range of \n\
    electromagnetic  waves,  from  visible  spectrum  (Visible)  to  infrared  spectrum \
    \ (Infra‐Red)  and  the  source \ninformation  is  very  important  for  research \
    \ on  different  topics.  In  recent  years  the  introduction  of  radar \nimages marked a huge step forward in remote sensing technology. Radar RS technology allows imaging the \n\
    ground during both day and night, and it overcomes the drawback of the type of optical devices when they \n\
    encounter bad weathers. So, now in addition to the type of aerial photographs, Earth RS satellite capabilities \n\
    can provide quick information about changes on the ground. \nMultispectral Image \n\
    Multispectral images were obtained not only in the visible spectrum, which is the majority of information \n\
    obtained in the infrared spectrum, but also beyond the ability of naked eyes. The optical receiver on the \n\
    satellite (Sensor) is designed to receive separate spectral regions reflected from the ground, depending on \n\
    the type of the object to be observed. The current RS satellite images acquired in different channels. For \n\
    example, Landsat satellite that brings receiver MSS, TM and ETM (U.S.) offers from 4 to 8 channel images. \n\
    The SPOT Satellite (France) provides 3‐4 channels of multispectral images and one panchromatic channel. \n\
    Aster images (from Japan) have 14 channels. Satellites Terra and Aqua that bring MODIS device (U.S.) can \n\
    collect 36 channels of photos for serving thematic studies for the various objects on the ground, in the ocean \n\
    and in the atmosphere. \nThe objects of the study are not likely to reflect the same range of spectral, depending on the chemical‐\n\
    physical  properties,  such  as  material  composition,  colour,  temperature, \
    \ humidity.  Because  of  this  various \nability of reflections, we can distinguish different objects in each image channel in the photographs of colour \n\
    combinations. Each channel image is used in a certain major study group: for example, groups of plants were \n\
    studied mainly in the near‐infrared channel (Near IR), a group of water in the blue region of the spectrum \n\
    (Blue), land‐stone on the green spectral region (green) and near‐infrared spectrum (Near IR), etc.  \n\
    275 | P a g e  \n \nRadar Image \nBecause Viet Nam is located in the humid tropical climate with monsoon, the amount of cloud cover is high in \n\
    average throughout the year. Therefore, the use of optical satellite imagery is always difficult. Except the \n\
    status picture of the cloud value for meteorologists, it causes a major obstacle to study other objects on the \n\
    ground. In addition, there is a downside of the satellite that carries optical receiver. The repeat cycle often \n\
    takes quite a long time: such as 26‐daysfor SPOT, 18 days for Landsat MSS, and 16 days for Landsat TM. So it \n\
    will be very difficult to track the rapid changes happening on the ground such as hurricane disasters, floods, \n\
    landslides, forest fires, pollution from oil spills, etc. by updating satellite images. In order to overcome the \n\
    disadvantages of the optical receiver, in the late 1970s, active RS radar technology was developed with such \n\
    receivers as Side Looking Radar and Synthetic Apecture Radar (SAR) to be equipped on aircraft and satellites. \n\
    The radar device uses microwave wavelengths from centimetres to meters. These satellites that carry a radar \n\
    receiver operated on the orbits near the Earth have been continuously providing information on land and sea \n\
    day  and  night,  as  a  single  system:  Seasat  (United  States),  Almaz  (Russian \
    \ Federation),  ERS  (European \nCommunity), Radarsat (Canada), JERS (Japan) ... \n\
    Currently radar image materials are widely used in studies on the environment on the ground and in the \n\
    ocean. The downside of radar image is a channel images (black and white) and more complicated processing \n\
    technology than those for optical images.  During processing, radar images are often used in combination \n\
    with other types of optical imaging to enhance the volume of information and improve spatial resolution. \n\

    flood in Thua Thien‐Hue, 11/1999. \nGIS \nGeographic Information System (GIS) was formed in 1960 and is widely developed in the last 10 years. The \n\
    application  of  information  technology  in  the  field  of  spatial  data  has \
    \ made  great  strides:  from  mapping \nsupport (CAD mapping) to geographic information systems (GIS). \n\
    Viet  Nam  is  entering  a  new  phase  of  the  application  of  geographic \
    \ information  systems  (GIS),  and  many \nlocalities have been successful in integrating GIS application in many fields, including the water sector. \n\
    At  the  International  Conference  on  GIS,  dated  21/10  in  Ho  Chi  Minh, \
    \ deputy  director  of  the  National \nUniversity of Ho Chi Minh City, Le Quang Minh said the \
    \ GIS research has overcome the narrow  phase  of \n276 | P a g e  \n \nmapping application, and switched to multi‐disciplinary applied research, which has important implications \n\
    for planning and urban management. \nGIS is used to provide information faster and more effectively to policy makers. The government agencies use \n\
    GIS in the management of natural resources, the activities of planning, modelling and monitoring. \n\
    Geographic  information  is  important  to  make  decisions  quickly.  The  GIS \
    \ analysis  depends  on  the  quality, \nvalue and compatibility of digital geographic data. The shared data will stimulate the growth of demand for \n\
    GIS  products  and  services.  The  additional  data  sources  through  a  combination \
    \ of  GIS  with  GPS  (global \npositioning system) and remote sensing technologies have provided the tools to collect data more efficiently. \n\
    GIS has been recognised as a system with many benefits not only in the collection of measurements, but also \n\
    in  the  investigation  of  natural  resources,  analysis  of  the  current  situation, \
    \ and  trend  forecast  of  natural \nresources ‐  environment. \nIn  Viet  Nam \
    \ GIS  technology  was  also  piloted  quite  early,  and  has  been  applied \
    \ in  many  sectors  such  as \nagriculture,  forestry  planning,  forest  management, \
    \ document  storage  geology,  geodesy  and  cartography, \ncadastre, urban management. However, effective applications were limited in the areas of storage, printing \n\
    the  document  maps  with  GIS  technology.  GIS  applications  in  the  fields \
    \ of  management,  administration, \ndecision support stand at trial, and they require time and investment to become the official application. \n\
    We can include some of the GIS software used in the irrigation sector: \n \n\
    AutoCAD \n \nMicroStation \n \nMapInfo \n \nArcGIS \n \nGoogle Earth \nVietnam\
    \ satellite \nVNREDSat‐1 (short for Viet Nam Natural Resources, Environment and Disaster Monitoring Satellite) will be \n\
    the first optical Earth Observing satellite of Viet Nam. Its primary mission will be to monitor and study the \n\
    effects  of  climate  change,  predict  and  take  measures  to  prevent  natural \
    \ disasters,  and  optimise  the \nmanagement of Viet Nam's natural resources. \n\
    The 120 kg satellite will create images at 2.5 m in panchromatic mode and 10 m in multi‐spectral mode (four \n\
    bands)  with  a  17.5 km  swath,  and  will  orbit  at  600–700 km  in  a  sun \
    \ synchronous  orbit.  The  satellite  was \nlaunched from ELV at Guiana Space Centre on 7 May 2013. \
    \  \n4.3. Application of remote sensing and GIS in the recent study \n \nDomestic study \n\
    In  recent  years,  a  series  of  natural  disasters  occurred  in  the  coastal \
    \ plain:  flooding,  storm  surge,  coastal \nstorms. As natural disasters cause serious consequences to the life and in many local products, they have \n\
    been concerned by many research and management agencies. \n‐ Research on shore erosion and landslides in the river in Viet Nam Central (2000); \n\
    ‐ Research on flooding plains Hue ‐ Quang Tri from Radarsat satellite imagery and GIS (2001); \n\
    ‐ Research on erosion and sedimentation of river bed of Red River (2001); \n277 | P\
    \ a g e  \n \n‐ Study on fluctuations of river mouths in Viet Nam Central and drainage problems of flooding water in the \n\

    \ Red  River  Delta  and  Mekong  Delta  through  remote  sensing \ninformation, high resolution (2006‐2008), etc. ... \n\
    The  results  obtained  from  the  above  studies  have  contributed  significantly \
    \ to  the  development  of  the \nscientific basis and methodology for the application of Remote Sensing and GIS in research, monitoring and \n\
    early warning of a number of natural disasters in the plains, and coastal estuaries such as river bank and \n\
    beach erosion, pollution of coastal marine environments, pollution caused by oil spills in the sea. \n\
    International cooperation study \nInternational Prototype Activity with Space Applications for Environment (SAFE), Japan Aerospace \n\
    Exploration Agency (JAXA) \nSpace  Applications  for  Environment  (SAFE)  is \
    \ a  voluntary‐based  initiative.  It  aims  to  encourage  the \nenvironmental monitoring in long‐term to grasp the environmental changes that may be useful to bring in \n\
    risk reduction and adaptation programs for disasters risk related activities to other climate change associated \n\
    problems using space applications, especially satellite remote sensing technology. SAFE considers continuous \n\
    data provision with sensor data that could provide environment sensitive information with varying spectral \n\
    and spatial resolution for better understanding the status of the environment and its changes. Some of the \n\
    changing  environment  parameters  in  water  resources,  river  water  level, \
    \ land  cover,  deforestation, \nagricultural production, and ecosystem could be provided through satellite remote sensing. \n\
    Integrated water resource management (2008‐2010) \nEstimation of rainfall happened in Viet Nam is of great practical importance for the operational monitoring \n\
    and  forecasting  of  flood.  River,  dyke  and  dam  system  improvements  are \
    \ not  sufficient  and  an  active \nevacuation  is  very  important  to  reduce \
    \ damage  caused  by  flood,  flash  flood,  and  tropical  cyclone. \nDevelopment \
    \ of  a  dam  manipulation  and  hydroelectric  system  for  optimised  water \
    \ management  is  very \nimportant  due  to  sparseness  of  rain  gauge  network, \
    \ especially  in  the  remote  areas  and  to  contribute  to \nmitigation  of \
    \ flood  damages.  The  Vietnamese  National  Hydro‐Meteorological  Service  (NHMS), \
    \ Ministry  of \nNatural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE),  is  responsible \
    \ for  flood  management  and  meteorological \nservices in Viet Nam. The objective of this prototype is to strengthen precipitation monitoring and reservoir \n\
    management at the Hong River and Red River by using satellite data and model calculation. \n\
    Rice Crop Monitoring in the Mekong Delta, Viet Nam (2013‐ongoing) \nViet Nam is one of the leading rice producers and exporters in the world. Recent years, remote sensing‐based \n\
    technology has been studied and applied broadly in agricultural area to remedy such drawbacks of traditional \n\
    ground‐based survey methods as time‐consumption, expensiveness, lack of precision, and less reliability. \n\
     \nThe purpose of the prototype is to monitor rice cropping area and rice growth and to estimate rice yield and \n\
    production. Specific outputs will be: \n278 | P a g e  \n \n‐ Rice distribution maps of the Viet Nam's Mekong Delta using ScanSAR data (ALOS PALSAR, ALOS‐2, etc.) and \n\
    optical data (MODIS, etc.); \n‐ Rice yield estimation maps of An Giang province for one district using SAR data (ALOS PALSAR, ALOS‐2 etc.); \n\

    grown  both  in  quality  and  in  quantity,  enough  to  solve  diverse  and \
    \ complex  problems.  However,  due  to \nlimited  economic  and  social  conditions, \
    \ so  specialised  equipment  investment  needs  and  insufficient \nsynchronisation, the development of knowledge and technology for Soil Mechanics requires greater efforts. \n\

    An Linh Commune, Tuy An District, Phu Yen Province, Viet Nam \nLandslide phenomenon at An Linh commune, Tuy An district, Phu Yen province becomes more and more \n\
    severe year after year. The prediction of a highly landslide susceptible zone will support the government and \n\
    local residents to save their properties. The authors carried out the landslide susceptibility mapping at An \n\
    Linh commune using the deterministic approach with knowledge‐driven methods and a stochastic approach \n\
    with  data‐driven  methods.  The  deterministic  approach  used  traditional \
    \ survey,  field  investigation,  and \ngeophysical  survey  to  evaluate  not \
    \ only  geotechnical  properties  of  rock  and  soil  materials  but  also  the \n\
    mechanism of landslide phenomenon in the studied area. The stochastic approach with probability methods \n\
    were chosen to evaluate the weights of influence factors such as elevation aspect, slope angle, distance to \n\
    roads  and  distance  to  drainages,  geology  and  topographical  wetness  index \
    \ of  the  materials.  Landslide \nsusceptibility zoning was developed using the model of Bayesian conditional probability with different criteria \n\

    o The  landslide  susceptibility  map  shows  that  most  of  landslide  occurrences \
    \ concentrate  at  the \nareas  of  low  elevation  (100~200m),  gentle  slopes (slope \
    \ angles  vary  from  5°  to  20°),  high  TWI \nvalues (high water accumulation).  \n\
    o Landslides also triggered due to the road construction. The roadway cuts into the slope faces and \n\
    reduces  the  stability  of  slopes.  Landslides  occur  near  the  road  construction \
    \ sites  (approximate \n100m far from roads).  \no Landslides  also  distribute \
    \ along  the  east‐west  direction,  which  coincides  with  the  direction  of \n\
    narrow valleys of steep slopes in the study area. \no The  results  of  Bayesian \
    \ conditional  probability  model  and  the  fieldwork  survey  show  that \n\
    landslides occur usually in soil layers with high proportion of clay and diatomite clayey soils, which \n\
    are heavily weathered.  \no The Bayesian conditional probability model gives the reliable result of landslide susceptibility for \n\
    the study area. The validation conducted for 39 heavy landslide positions, which show that there \n\
    are 31 positions (80% accuracy) located in the high landslide susceptibility zone.  \n\
    o The  reliability  of  this  model  could  improve  year  after  year  when \
    \ new  landslide  occurrences \nupdated annually in the landslide inventory. \n\
    - \nApplications of research \no Using this method landslide risks can be calculated in areas with high erosion risk, whichprovides \n\

    - \nApplications of research \no By proving the depth of active consolidation over time, it is able to calculate permeability. It will \n\
    more accurately describe work of soft soil under the embankment loads and the results will be \n\
    more reliable. Especially with the calculated consolidation settlement in a short time be able to \n\

    6. Concrete structure \n6.1. Review of historical evolvement \nReinforced  concrete \
    \ (RC)  was  invented  and  applied  from  the  mid‐19th  century.  In  Viet \
    \ Nam,  reinforced \nconcrete has been in use since the late 19th century. After more than a century of use, durability of the \n\
    actual reinforced concrete works in the world nations are summarized as follows:  \n\
    - In the environment without erosion, reinforced concrete structure can work sustained over 100 years.  \n\
    - In  the  erosive  environments  under  water,  erosion,  cracking  and  destruction \
    \ of  reinforced  concrete \nstructures can occur after 10 to 30 years of use. Real durability of structural concrete depends on the \n\
    degree of erosion of the environment and quality of materials used (concrete strength, water tightness, \n\
    resistance to corrosion, types of cement, additives, type reinforcement, quality design, construction \n\
    and management measures...) \nConcrete structures are protected against corrosion and reinforced. In Vietnam, the studies of problem and \n\
    corrosion protection works have been carried out since 1970. Currently, besides the building that sustained \n\
    after 40 to 50 years, many concrete projects in Vietnam under the use of only 10 to 15 years has been eroded \n\
    and severely damaged, requiring about 40 to 70% of new construction cost for repairs to protect them. \n\

    \ of  fine  sand.  Therefore,  the  use  of  this  sand  as  a \nreplacement for regular sand in concrete has practical sense and produces considerable economic benefit. \n\
    When used as fine aggregate in concrete, fine sand with large specific surface area could have high water \n\
    demand for the same consistency resulting in larger cement content. Depending on the fineness modulus, \n\
    the use of fine sand may increase the cement content approximately by 5% to 15%. In Vietnam, the use of \n\
    fine sand in concrete is generally limited due to the higher cement content than specified for coarse sand \n\
    concrete. This paper presents some results from an experimental study investigating the use of fine sand in \n\

    Roller  compacted  concrete  (RCC)  differs  from  conventional  concrete  principally \

    2023, 2023080451. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202308.0451.v1 Abstract The
    global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable practices
    and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play a crucial
    role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security, and minimizing
    reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy consumption associated
    with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge to achieving sustainability
    goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on transitioning greenhouses towards
    near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy consumption in greenhouses refers
    to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy usage to the greatest extent possible
    while maintaining optimal growing conditions for crops. This goal encompasses
    reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting, and other operational
    needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources to power greenhouse operations.
    This review article offers a comprehensive overview of greenhouse energy consumption,
    with the main goal of analyzing the present situation, identifying key challenges,
    exploring potential opportunities, and proposing future perspectives for decreasing
    energy usage in greenhouse environments. As the focus on sustainable agricultural
    practices grows, the need to reduce energy consumption in greenhouses becomes
    increasingly important. The review critically examines current technological models
    and strategies applied in smart greenhouse applications, as well as the monitoring
    of microclimatic conditions inside the greenhouse, encompassing factors such as
    temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover,
    it aims to present existing literature that investigates the advancement of greenhouses
    toward achieving significant reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart

    Technological Survey on the Dependable Self-Management CPS: From Self-Adaptive
    Architecture to Self-Management Strategies. Sensors 2019, 19, 1033. Copy Abstract
    Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade.
    The dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and rare survey has been published
    in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary
    technologies. To avoid human error and to simplify management, self-management
    CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. And to achieve dependable self-management, systematic
    solution is necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation
    decision, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls
    the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing
    flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges
    of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focus on reducing the complexity,
    we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability
    means; then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss
    the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture
    level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaption, we investigate the verification
    and validation (V&V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the
    solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaption, the
    comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing
    pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the
    technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one
    solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic
    SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on
    dependable SCPS building and evaluation. Keywords cyber physical systems; industry

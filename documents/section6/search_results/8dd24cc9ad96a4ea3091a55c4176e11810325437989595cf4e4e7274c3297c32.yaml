  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision

    Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor, aroma,
    and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany and
    Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical applications
    that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou et al., 2022),
    neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and potential benefits
    for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer prevention, menstrual
    health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016, Akhondzadeh et al., 2010,
    Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness
    and safety for specific medical conditions. It should be used in moderation and
    under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et al., 2011), but its cultivation
    is characterized by substantial manual labor, making it one of the world''s most
    expensive spices. This study addresses a significant research gap in the field,
    focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles et al., 2015) of saffron
    and the critical environmental factors that influence its development. The aim
    is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron production through IoT and
    addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation, which have been relatively
    understudied in existing literature. The two major analytical points are: 1. Optimizing
    Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding the specific environmental
    requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead to improved crop management
    practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open
    Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse cultivation provides more
    precise control over environmental factors such as light, temperature, and humidity,
    leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared to traditional open-field
    methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing research. The five
    major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering, leaf development,
    daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various factors, which
    have been deduced and summarized from different works as below 1.1. Temperature
    Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud growth during the
    first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures, but flowering commenced
    shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005) found optimal floral development
    within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though exceeding 150 days resulted
    in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al. (2023) highlighted the crucial
    role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated that lowering the temperature
    to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions (23–27°C) was essential
    for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported by Wang et al. (2020),
    can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms to abort. Notably,
    their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers at all. Further
    research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal temperature fluctuations
    on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering followed by flower initiation
    in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached 20°C. Conversely, prolonged
    hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn when temperatures dropped
    to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh et al. (2021) suggests that
    maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C and relative humidity of 65.71%
    for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient flower ontogenesis. However,
    for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019) found that 36 days of incubation
    at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective. Interestingly, both excessive
    and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting period have been linked to decreased
    saffron production and productivity, as noted by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally,
    chilling periods in December and January, with mean aerial temperatures around
    2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful saffron flowering, according to the
    findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light intensity The role of light intensity
    in saffron cultivation remains somewhat enigmatic, particularly its impact on
    daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However, recent research by Chen et al.
    (2024) explored the effects of different light intensities and red/blue light
    combinations on saffron plants. Their findings suggest that a light intensity
    of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be optimal for maximizing stigma yield,
    quality, and nutrient content. On the other hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020)
    indicate that higher light intensities can compromise stigma yield and quality,
    despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis. Leveraging the wealth of knowledge
    obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based saffron system offers unprecedented
    opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation by providing precise environmental
    control, data-driven insights, and adaptive management strategies. This integration
    of technology and scientific understanding holds great promise for advancing saffron
    production efficiency and sustainability in the future. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Technologies used The technologies that have been used in developing the
    prototype after considering all of the parameters are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller
    -The sensors used are the DHT11 and an LDR -Database management is handled using
    Google FireBase -The app environment was set up and developed using ReactJS Other
    technologies used by researchers in the same field have included Arduino UNOs
    which are generally more expensive than the ESP-32. They have also used separate
    air moisture and temperature while we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both
    these sensors as one and helps reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment.
    Each of them is explained in detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems
    on a-chip microcontrollers features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and
    is cost-efficient and less power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa
    LX7 dual-core The Tensilica Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor,
    or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor, which also has integrated antenna switches,
    power amplifiers, filters,low-noise receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management
    modules. ESP32 used is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (112KB)

    LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor). 2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11
    temperature and humidity sensor consists of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement
    and an 8-bit microprocessor which is used to output the temperature and humidity
    measurements as data which is serialized (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor
    The most common uses for photoresistors, also known as light-dependent resistors
    (LDR), are expected to discern the presence or absence of light or to gauge the
    power of the light. When the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance reduces
    rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms, hinging on the light intensity. In the dark,
    their resistance is very elevated, often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential
    devices consisting of variable sensitivity depending on the wavelength of the
    input light. Although they are exploited in many applications, other gadgets like
    photodiodes and phototransistors frequently perform this light-sensing function.

    sensor (under implementation) In our current prototype of the IoT-based saffron
    system, we are enhancing its suitability for outdoor cultivation conditions by
    incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition will enable real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter for optimizing saffron cultivation.
    By accurately assessing soil moisture content, our system can dynamically adjust
    irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron plants receive adequate hydration
    while preventing overwatering or drought stress. This proactive approach not only
    enhances plant health and productivity but also promotes water conservation and
    sustainability in saffron farming practices. With the integration of the soil
    moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers with a robust tool for
    efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation in outdoor settings.
    2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored app development
    platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides tools to
    trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and create
    business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using Google
    Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting for up
    to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and Android
    app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with Firebase
    Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users and makes
    it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions. These features
    support email and password authentication, phone authentication, and access to
    Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete identity solution.
    Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free, cross-platform messaging
    app that allows businesses to send and receive messages on iOS, Android, and the
    web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, synchronization
    and storage of data between users can be done instantly between users. When the
    app is offline, it is still available because the device continues to connect
    to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash reporting tool called
    Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve security issues
    that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash analysis, developers
    can focus more on building features for their applications rather than managing
    and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance Monitoring Tools
    give developers information about the iOS and Android performance of their apps,
    allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing. When application
    performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android apps on multiple
    connected devices in a single operation. They can view results, including screenshots,
    logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS React is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating user interfaces that are
    based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js or ReactJS. Meta (previously
    Facebook) and a group of independent programmers and businesses are responsible
    for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation for single-page, mobile,
    or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks like Next.js. React
    is only concerned with state management and presenting that information to the
    DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates the use of extra
    libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality. 2.2. Application
    development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application is to display
    and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help to improve on-field
    work. The designing of the application is done such that it is easy for even a
    layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user experience is made
    by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white space and equal
    margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important for demonstrating
    the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward with our research,
    the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate the application''s
    performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness in practical on-field
    use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React JS, which is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript library used for developing user interfaces based on UI components.
    React can be exploited as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or
    server-rendered applications The structure of the appis shown in Fig. 3 The application
    is synced with a real-time Firebase database, from which the app gets data simultaneously
    and displays it on its interface. Firebase web APIs (application programming interface)
    are used to communicate between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4

    The app is integrated with the sensors that need to be installed in the field
    and collects live data that the user can access through the app, unlike the existing
    apps that only have static elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data
    and the data that have been collected, the app compares the live data with the
    optimal data and helps farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield.
    This app currently focuses on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help
    farmers predict which crops will be beneficial based on the live conditions of
    the soil and field. This way, production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3.

    3. Experimentation This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment
    is conducted in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped
    with sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture,
    is installed. These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental
    parameters crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured
    to log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization
    algorithms to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions
    based on saffron cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized
    experimental layout with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive
    optimization recommendations generated by the IoT-based system, while control
    groups do not receive any intervention. Throughout a predetermined validation
    period, environmental parameters and saffron growth stages are monitored and recorded.
    Data analysis focuses on evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    system in providing monitoring and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results
    suggest that the IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively
    monitors environmental parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations.
    Treatment groups receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron
    growth and development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy
    in enhancing saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the
    advancement of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating
    sustainable production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to
    further refine the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities
    to optimize saffron cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future
    work In the next phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into
    our existing IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition
    aims to automate irrigation by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the
    saffron cultivation plot. Our experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable
    pump, installing it in the cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water
    based on soil moisture sensor readings. We will develop control algorithms to
    activate the pump when soil moisture falls below a predetermined threshold and
    integrate pump control functionalities into our IoT system. Through a series of
    experiments, we will validate the effectiveness of the integrated pump in promoting
    saffron growth and yield compared to manual irrigation methods. By automating
    irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to improve resource efficiency, enhance
    crop quality, and increase saffron productivity. 5. Results and discussions This
    study posits the conceptualization and realization of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    application designed for the surveillance and regulation of pivotal agronomic
    parameters, encompassing variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    and luminance levels. The overarching objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges
    while concurrently augmenting the cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant
    application, characterized by its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors
    the capacity to bolster the qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops.
    A salient hallmark of this application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived
    data, thus serving as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers
    for investigative and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently
    adaptable, affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation
    to the cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its
    current purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful
    Luminous intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for
    the optimum range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The
    paramount aim of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural
    methodologies into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious
    economization of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community.
    A plausible extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies
    within a controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract In a world in continuous evolution and in which
    human needs grow exponentially according to the increasing world population, the

    1. Introduction Agriculture 4.0 consists of an upgrade of the usual farming techniques
    and has the scope to create a more sustainable and efficient agriculture system
    that can produce higher yields while minimizing the impact on the environment.
    By using advanced technologies, farmers can make more informed decisions, reduce
    waste, and optimize resource utilization, leading to a more sustainable and profitable
    agriculture industry. Agriculture 4.0 encompasses the advancement of precision
    farming and refers to all agricultural actions that are based on a precise and
    accurate analysis of data and information acquired and transferred using advanced
    tools and technology. This refers to the tools and techniques that allow for the
    synergistic use of a variety of digital 4.0 technologies, allowing for the automatic
    collection, integration, and analysis of data collected from the field, sensors,
    or other third-party sources. Agriculture 4.0 refers to the application of the
    Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, artificial intelligence, and robotics to extend,
    accelerate, and improve the efficiency of operations affecting the entire production
    chain [1]. Some innovations are: Process automation: thanks to the use of drones
    and sensors, it is possible to monitor crops throughout their growth phase, as
    well as check the state of well-being or the need to irrigate and fertilize the
    soil. There are countless benefits associated with drones in the context of the
    agricultural industry. In fact, they can be of help to farmers in acquiring data
    on the state of stress of plants and observing the movements of livestock, but
    they can also allow the identification of diseases in plants and animals, allowing
    timely interventions. The use of GIS: thanks to this software that can integrate
    data of different natures, it is possible to efficiently determine (according
    to different parameters such as soil pH, temperature, and humidity) the position
    of the crops, the land use, and the need for fertilization and irrigation. It
    is also possible to carry out an analysis of historical data to provide farmers
    with tools that allow them to choose the best conditions for their crops. Of fundamental
    importance is the sustainable management of the environment and the planet’s resources,
    including water. As is known, intelligent consumption of this resource is essential
    in the field of agriculture, [2]. Moreover, there are many studies carried out
    on the automation of agricultural vehicles and the monitoring of crops and livestock.
    The advent of robotics in agriculture has allowed numerous benefits, including
    an increase in productivity, the acceleration of operations in the procedures
    related to the maintenance of cultivation, as well as safety during production
    processes and precision in the analysis of the possible interventions to be carried
    out to optimize the harvest [3,4]. The GIS (Geographic Information System) is
    a crucial tool frequently utilized in the realm of Agriculture 4.0. It has numerous
    applications, particularly in precision agriculture, such as assessing the potential
    of agricultural waste to generate bioenergy [5]. Particularly useful are open-source
    GISs that allow for the implementation of internal functions (including forecasting
    ones) useful in various application fields, also allowing interaction with external
    technologies in real time. As it is known, diverse data types can be incorporated
    into the GIS, including free satellite data, although many of these data are limited
    due to their low resolution. As a result, higher spatial and temporal resolution
    multispectral UAV images must be combined with this data to resolve this limitation.
    To address the issue of integrating non-uniform data, data fusion techniques are
    frequently employed [6,7]. So, in the literature, extensive studies could be found
    regarding the technologies, materials, algorithms, and protocols involved in this
    research, but less could be found regarding their integration. The present research
    fits into this context by proposing as the main novelty the use of an atmospheric
    experimental simulator capable of providing punctual variables, which, together
    with local sensor data and the data fusion of satellite and drone images, are
    all managed by an open-source GIS capable of estimating fundamental parameters
    related to the cultivation and automation of agricultural vehicles. This estimation
    is in the frame of a strategic management of crops through the identification
    of local optimal cultivation typologies and the automation of optimal field route
    planning for both self-driving tractors and UAVs, which is further useful for
    tactical in-season crop monitoring to guide crop irrigation and fertilization
    management. 2. Materials and Methods During experimentations, in order to identify
    areas that best fit the different possible typologies of cultivation and to plan
    the routes of both self-driving tractors and UAVs, we have used different systems,
    algorithms, and methodologies structured and integrated with each other as schematically
    shown in the flow diagram in Figure 1. Referred to in more detail: An open-source
    GIS, in particular the open-source QGIS; an innovative and experimental atmospheric
    simulator; satellite and UAV images, local sensors; algorithms and protocols for
    data transmission. Figure 1. Flow diagram developed in the frame of Agriculture
    4.0 concept illustrating the methodological scheme and the different integrated
    systems, algorithms, and methodologies aiming to identify areas that best fit
    the different possible typologies of cultivation and to plan the optimal routes
    of both self-driving tractors and UAVs as final products of the built strategic
    management system for crop irrigation and fertilization. Firstly, the atmospheric
    simulator (using as inputs the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the territory,
    weather sensor data, radar data, and very large-scale weather models) was used
    to obtain, as outputs, the punctual values of some characteristic weather variables:
    precipitation, wind, pressure, and temperature, which were subsequently reprocessed
    to obtain DEM layers of these variables. (Weather variables such as precipitation,
    wind, pressure, and temperature are important for Agriculture 4.0 because they
    directly influence the environmental conditions that can have an impact on crops.
    Precipitation is crucial for the water supply of plants; wind can affect growth
    and disease spread; atmospheric pressure provides information about imminent climatic
    changes; and temperature influences plant growth and maturation). The validation
    of the results obtained was performed through the combination of different ground
    truth devices: local sensors (soil moisture sensor, leaf wetness sensor, pH sensor,
    temperature and humidity sensor, and barometric pressure sensor), using wireless
    sensor network nodes (WSNn). This WSN was supported with the ZigBee protocol (Texas
    Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA), an ATmega128L microcontroller (Microchip Technology
    Inc., Chandler, AZ, USA), and a solar cell module (Canadian Solar, Guelph, ON,
    Canada) with the aim of collecting information from various sensors and passing
    the information to a cloud server. Through the data fusion technique [8], we have
    combined satellite data and UAV images to establish important indices used as
    an indication of vegetation richness and to capture soil differences: NDVI (normalized
    difference vegetation index), LST (land surface temperature), NDMI (normalized
    difference moisture index), and BSI (bare soil index). In particular, the satellite
    images used are: Sentinel-2, Level 2A: Level 2A of Sentinel-2 processing includes
    a scene classification and an atmospheric correction applied to Top-Of-Atmosphere
    (TOA) Level-1C orthoimage products. Level-2A’s main output is an orthoimage bottom-of-atmosphere
    (BOA) corrected reflectance product. WorldView-3: capable of acquiring images
    at 31 cm panchromatic, 1.24 m multispectral, 3.7 m shortwave infrared, and 30
    m CAVIS (clouds, aerosols, vapors, ice, and snow) resolution. As regards UAV images,
    a Micasense Altum Camera was used to capture multispectral photos with a DJI Matrice
    600 Pro. This camera is ideal for agricultural use since it can collect photos
    of crops in both visible and infrared wavelengths at the same time. The drone
    flew around 30 m above the ground, producing aerial GSD photos with a resolution
    of 5 cm. All this information was processed by the GIS, which estimates the optimal
    automation parameters and those relating to the cultivable areas. In particular,
    the algorithms used to identify the cultivable areas are as follows: Spatial data
    analysis algorithms, in particular buffering, intersection, overlay, and clustering
    analysis, are useful for identifying areas of interest, evaluating the proximity
    of climatic data, sensor data, and DEM data, and carrying out comparative analyses
    between different areas. Raster analysis algorithms to extract information from
    raster data such as DEM and NDVI by calculating terrain statistics and identifying
    specific slope or elevation areas that are best suited for certain crops. Supervised
    classification algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine (SVM),
    and neural networks to classify image data to determine crop typology and to build
    a predictive model. These algorithms are available as plugins or additional extensions
    that can be installed and used within the QGIS environment. In relation to the
    algorithms used for tractor automation, QGIS includes a number of tools and algorithms
    that can be used to perform routing analysis and route planning and also supports
    the use of additional plugins and integration with other tools and libraries that
    offer advanced routing and route optimization features. Specifically, the “Network
    Analysis Library (NAl)” and “pgRouting” plugins were used to perform advanced
    routing analysis within QGIS. These plugins offer optimized routing algorithms
    that take into account factors such as obstacles, speed constraints, and specific
    preferences to calculate optimal routes, always keeping in mind the necessary
    use of GPS for positioning and referenced cartography for displaying the position.
    As regards the parameters, the output parameters for identifying the cultivable
    areas are as follows: Crop classification map: Using the supervised or unsupervised
    classification algorithms, it was possible to generate a crop classification map
    that assigns the estimated crop type to each area of the study area. Crop suitability
    assessment: Based on the analysis of climate data, local sensor data, DEM, and
    NDVI, it was possible to generate a crop suitability assessment for the study
    area. Analysis of environmental characteristics: The analysis of climate data,
    local sensor data, DEM, and NDVI provided information on the environmental characteristics
    of the study area, including maps of temperature, precipitation, soil moisture,
    and soil pH, which have been used to evaluate the adaptability of crops to local
    environmental conditions. Analysis report: They included statistics on the prevailing
    crops, indicators of crop suitability, analyses of environmental characteristics,
    and other relevant information for determining the type of cultivation in the
    study area. Tabular output data: In addition to the maps and reports, tabular
    output data have been produced, which reports detailed information on the study
    area. In relation to the automation of the tractor, the output parameters are
    GPS coordinates (in real time), driving routes (to maximize operation efficiency),
    speed control (to ensure safe and efficient driving), sensor monitoring (to detect
    any obstacles, avoid collisions and efficiently manage the resources of the tractor),
    actuator control (to ensure precise and smooth driving according to the routes
    and instructions provided), ground condition monitoring (to adapt the driving
    of the tractor, make decisions in real time and to optimize the use of resources),
    alarms and warnings (to alert the operator or user in case of emergency situations,
    unforeseen obstacles or technical problems during automated driving), and performance
    monitoring (for operations management). Then, through Cannelloni software (written
    in C++11 and capable of transferring CAN frames between two machines using UDP)
    and a series of protocols (datagram protocol (UDP) or stream control transmission
    protocol (SCTP), which are supported by Cannelloni software. In some cases, it
    is necessary to convert SCTP to the transmission control protocol (TCP)). The
    data are transmitted to the agricultural vehicle, which will have the task of
    irrigating and fertilizing the area according to the vegetation’s needs, and to
    the drone, which will have the task of monitoring the existing cultivation. As
    a result, it is possible to visualize the different typologies on the GIS of areas
    suitable for cultivation related to land, water, and climate parameters. 2.1.
    Geografic Information System Geographic Information System (GIS) technology is
    increasingly being used in agriculture to help farmers make better decisions and
    optimize their farming practices. GIS is a system that allows for the capture,
    storage, analysis, and visualization of geographic data, such as crop yields,
    soil characteristics, weather patterns, and other relevant information. By integrating
    this information with other data sources, farmers can gain insights into their
    operations and make more informed decisions. GIS can help farmers in various ways,
    such as: Land use planning: GIS can help farmers make informed decisions about
    the best use of their land. It can be used to analyze factors such as soil type,
    topography, and climate to determine the best species to crop in a particular
    area. Market analysis: it can be used to analyze market trends and demand for
    certain crops. Disaster management: GIS can be used to monitor and respond to
    natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and wildfires. By quickly identifying
    affected areas, farmers can take appropriate action to protect their crops and
    minimize losses. In our research, GIS plays a central role in the management of
    the information collected from different sources and in the return of important
    information related to Agriculture 4.0. In fact, the choice of the optimal areas
    for cultivation depends on several factors that can affect the yield and quality
    of the crop, which include climate, type of soil, irrigation, topography, and
    market needs. In the following study, QGIS (an open-source GIS) was used, which
    consists of software that allows one to process, display, and analyze geographic
    data such as maps, satellite images, sensor data, etc., using the Python language.
    This type of software, which is entirely updatable, has therefore allowed the
    automation of the management of geographical data, the creation of customized
    scripts for data analysis, and the creation of customized tools for data visualization.
    2.2. Atmospheric Simulator The main novelty of this research is the use of an
    atmospheric simulator [9] that, through a DEM and radar/sensor data, can provide
    important climate information in relation to the orographic characteristics of
    the land. This article outlines the functioning of an atmospheric simulator that
    has the ability to generate highly detailed weather field outputs within a restricted
    domain. With minimal input, this software can produce outputs related to wind,
    temperature, humidity, cloud cover, rain, and other atmospheric parameters for
    cubic cells as small as 50 m. Unlike NWP (numerical weather prediction), the simulator’s
    atmosphere microphysics is based on laws that regulate the interaction of a number
    of particles with which the atmosphere has been discretized. The latter, in fact,
    consists of a set of particles contained in the center of a cube (cells). Each
    of these particles contains within it a specific quantity of gas, water, and humidity
    from which its mass exchanges and interactions with other particles and the external
    environment are defined. The particles will be subjected to a force derived from
    their energy state, from interaction with other particles, or from the surface.
    Essentially, the simulator emulates the behavior of the Earth’s atmosphere as
    it relates to weather patterns and represents the state of variation of the particles
    with which the atmosphere has been discretized and how they interact with each
    other. The simulation model incorporates two solvers, L1 and L2, which work in
    tandem and process tasks at a higher level. These solvers translate the phenomena
    of the troposphere and vertical exchange into a particle representation of the
    atmosphere. 2.2.1. Solver 1 Solver L1 is responsible for several tasks, including
    assigning physical and chemical properties to particles, applying forces to particles
    based on their energy state from interactions with radiation and heat sinks, assigning
    initial states to particles and environmental elements, dividing the 3D domain
    into macro-clusters, and providing atomically referable forecast fields for each.
    Real-time data or hypothetical values can be used as input. 2.2.2. Solver 2 On
    the other hand, Solver L2 is a Newtonian Simulator that utilizes the values of
    force, mass, viscosity, and local density assigned by Solver L1 to individual
    particles. It employs a software library for fluid modeling called SPH (smoothed
    particle hydrodynamics) [10] that specializes in realistic simulations of fluids
    or gases within a few hundred meters. The library is developed by Nvidia, and
    the technology is called Nvidia PhysX. Solver L2 introduces the forces attributed
    to the particles by L1 and initiates dynamic evolution through PhysX using SPH
    Fluids rules. For instance, if there is local interpenetration of cells at time
    t, repulsion forces come into play according to the represented parameters, such
    as partial compressibility, friction, viscosity, and mass. This mechanism represents
    winds, including complex turbulence characterizations and localized pressure variations,
    such as convective or ascending situations, in the 3D domain. The mechanism is
    particularly effective in complex orographic regions, such as the Apennines, where
    sudden altitude variations are challenging to manage with classic NWP (numerical
    weather prediction). 2.2.3. General Diagram of the Simulator The initialization
    of Solver L2 involves reading an ASCII DEM that will serve as the orographic domain
    of the simulation. The particles are positioned uniformly on the scene and evolve
    until a point of stability is reached. Solver L1 processes the initial conditions
    obtained from measurements, such as sensors or radar, and provides directives
    for assigning forces, velocities, and positions to particles in specific spatial
    volumes (clusters) to Solver L2. L2 evolves by applying these directives for a
    specified time interval, and Solver L1 is informed of the new state of particles
    at the end of the evolution, including their position, velocity, density, and
    changes compared to the previous state. Solver L1 then associates the attributes
    provided by L2 with particle and atmospheric state-related characteristics such
    as humidity and temperature. The pattern detector (part of L1) creates clusters
    with homogeneous atmospheric characteristics such as cloud cover, rain, humidity,
    average temperature, and pressure from the states provided by Solver L2. The values
    referred to as clusters are the output provided by the simulator. The L1 now has
    the following inputs, which are no longer initial conditions: Pattern detector
    clusters, internal phenomenological conditions such as the position of the sun
    or the orography as seen from the point of view of atmospheric heat absorption,
    and coarse-scale boundary conditions, which are only required at the boundaries
    of the domain. The processed output then becomes directives for the new evolutionary
    step for L2, thus closing the feedback loop. For this research, we have used a
    workstation with 3 GPUs configured in SLI mode with 17280 CUDA CORE and 36 GB
    of video memory, in addition to 12 CORE Intel CPUs, a dedicated CPU Intel I7-10810U,
    and 16 GB RAM. This workstation was built to operate and cover an area of 60 km
    × 60 km. The advantages of this simulator are obvious: allows you to have a general
    view of how some weather variables can evolve in a small area and with high resolution,
    providing valid outputs in the selected area of interest; analyzes inhomogeneous
    data of different nature, therefore different in quality and quantity; use hardware
    components that are affordable and do not limit their use to specialized personnel
    only; operates at the microscale. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the experimental
    software. Figure 2. Architecture of the experimental software illustrating the
    connection of the two solvers aiming to determine the variables useful to identify
    the different possible typologies of cultivation. 2.3. Sensors and Communication
    Protocols Resources such as fertilizers, seeds, and water, the latter of which
    has become increasingly precious for a farmer, are indispensable but unfortunately
    not infinite resources. Today, with the development of new technologies, the concept
    of intelligent or precision agriculture has been introduced, which makes it possible
    to maximize crops while minimizing the resources indicated above. The introduction
    of increasingly performing sensors installed on the ground allows small-scale
    information to be provided to the farmer on crops, minimizing resources and reducing
    the impact on the environment [11,12,13,14,15]. The concept of modern agriculture
    is based on numerous physical and chemical measurements. This is possible considering
    sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Based on this concept, sensors
    in agriculture are primarily used to measure properties in soil, plants, air,
    and water. A sensor is a transducer designed to convert one physical quantity
    into another, usually an electrical signal. The latter will have to meet requirements
    such as the transmission, processing, storage, display, recording, and control
    of information. A real scenario is shown in Figure 3, which shows the real functioning
    of smart farming. Figure 3. Smart farming-based Internet of Things (IoT): (A)
    agricultural sensor nodes with associated sensors and solar cells; (B) sink and
    actuator nodes; and (C) gateway nodes and cloud computing. As regards local sensor
    communication, wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23] communicate
    via their radio modules. If two or more nodes can send and receive data from each
    other, they are directly connected. The result is a network able to transmit/receive
    data to/from each other, collecting large amounts of data. The benefit for WSNs
    is due to their connection without wiring infrastructure. Today, WSNs represent
    a robust, simple, and complete wireless solution for agriculture, improving quality
    and productivity. The elements that constitute a sensor node are mainly sensing,
    storage, processing, and communication capabilities, as shown in Figure 4. Part
    A is composed of several sensors, such as a temperature sensor, humidity sensor,
    rain sensor, leaf wetness sensor, ZigBee protocol [24,25,26], ATmega128L microcontroller,
    and solar cell module, that support this WSN. Communication protocols play a major
    role in intelligent IoT-based agriculture and cover short or long distances for
    smart farming. Wireless protocols/technologies that are used in agricultural applications
    are, for short distances, ZigBee and Wi-Fi, and for long distances, mobile communication
    networks, long-range wireless area networks (LoRaWAN), Bluetooth, and LPWAN protocols.
    Among microcontrollers, the most used in agriculture are ATmega128L nodes because
    this microcontroller supports multi-level data aggregation, decision making, storage
    capabilities, flash memory, low complexity, and energy management. Traditionally,
    batteries limited in size and capacity influence the lifetime of WSNs. Today,
    solutions such as the combination of ultra-low-power nodes with energy-harvesting
    techniques make WSNs perpetually operational. Part B indicates two components—special
    nodes usually called sinks, hubs, or gateways in the literature, depending on
    their function—are added when the network needs to coordinate or communicate with
    an external network. Actuators allow for indirect intervention in the operation
    or control of mechanisms. The sink node passes all information to the cloud platform.
    All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted the low-power ZigBee wireless protocol.
    This information obtained from sensors and governed by actuators is then transmitted
    via a gateway to cloud computing for data processing and storage, as shown in
    Part C. The task of the gateway is to collect information from various sensors
    and pass the information to the cloud server [27,28,29,30,31,32,33]. Figure 4.
    Study area referring to the experimentation of the atmospheric simulator. The
    area in question, located in the province of Reggio Calabria, south of Italy,
    is highlighted with a red line. (Image extrapolated from QGIS, Google Satellite
    base map). Figure 3 represents the area where the deployment of a mobile network
    is beneficial in the agricultural sector for IoT devices such as sensors and terrestrial
    and aerial drones known as UAVs, which require constant, reliable, wide coverage,
    low energy consumption, low-cost devices, high spectrum efficiency, and high-speed
    Internet connections to exchange large amounts of data. Data transmitted by sensors
    on the ground and captured by sensors on board the drone are processed, analyzed,
    and then stored in a cloud data repository through a communication link. This
    swift transfer of data to the cloud is possible in real time thanks to common
    communications protocols between sensors/vehicles and operators. Typically, agricultural
    drones are used for low-altitude flights below 120 m and use Wi-Fi, with a limited
    range of 3–7 km if on board the drone is a large transmitting antenna. Alternatively,
    for wireless control, the use of a 4G network link seems to alleviate the distance
    problem, allowing the drone to fly several kilometers away from the controller.
    To increase the range of UAVs, the 5G mobile network is suitable to promote low-flying
    drone communications and enhance the safety and security of drone operations.
    Moreover, 5G cellular networks allow farmers to receive real-time data, such as
    high-resolution video streams and other critical sensory and telemetry data from
    drones, faster and more seamlessly than with previous-generation mobile networks.
    Drones do not need to be equipped with large amounts of processing power, and
    5G technology allows all data to be transmitted to the cloud for faster processing.
    Today, cellular technologies are playing a crucial role in IoT devices. Narrow-band
    IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system protocol derived from the current long-term evolution
    (LTE) capabilities that can share the LTE frequency band without coexistence problems,
    use the same devices, and seamlessly connect to the LTE main network. NB-IoT design
    shows high coverage area, extended battery life (i.e., 10 years), high network
    size (52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost devices. In the near future,
    NB-IoT technologies such as long-range radio (LoRa) will be preferred for transmitting
    agricultural information over long distances due to their low power consumption.
    In a point-to-point Zigbee network, the communication range can reach 100 m in
    an outdoor environment. ZigBee’s range can be extended by employing ad hoc distributed
    and mesh network topologies. In addition, drones and UAVs can be used as mobile
    router nodes to extend the communication range within smart farming. Drones can
    pass data collected from sensor nodes to master nodes through multi-hop [34,35].
    Sensors Used in the Study In the study, five types of sensors that measure important
    soil characteristics were mainly used: Soil moisture sensor, leaf wetness sensor,
    pH sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, and barometric sensor. As is known,
    one of the limitations of using point measurement sensors is their representativeness
    of soil or vegetation parameter variability within a field. In fact, point measurements
    provide information at a specific location, but they may not fully capture the
    spatial variability of the parameters of interest. While aware of the limitations,
    we have used these local sensors because they have been useful to validate the
    reliability of the model given by the atmospheric simulator. Soil moisture sensors
    are commonly used in agriculture to help farmers determine when to irrigate their
    crops, as overwatering can be costly and damaging to the crops, and underwatering
    can also be detrimental. They can also be used in landscaping to ensure that plants
    are receiving the appropriate amount of water. Information given by the soil Moisture
    Sensor (we have used the TEROS 12 soil moisture sensor (Meter Environment, Washington,
    DC, USA) is of fundamental importance in agriculture; in fact, thanks to this
    instrument, farmers can measure the volumetric water content in the soil—which
    is the amount of water present in the soil as a percentage of the total volume
    of the soil—and manage the irrigation system in a productive way. This type of
    sensor uses different technologies with which the content of water is measured
    indirectly through specific parameters such as the dielectric constant. As is
    known, there are two categories of soil moisture sensors depending on the technology
    they use: sensors that measure volumetric water content (VWC) and sensors that
    measure soil tension when placed in the soil profile. Volumetric content is the
    volume of liquid water in the soil, usually expressed as a percentage. Soil water
    tension indicates, instead, the energy required by plant roots to extract water
    from soil particles. As soil water is removed from the soil, soil tension increases.
    The three most common types of soil moisture sensors are: Electromagnetic sensors:
    The most common electromagnetic sensors are capacitance sensors or frequency domain
    reflectometry (FDR) sensors and time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. These
    sensors indirectly measure VWC based on the dielectric and electric properties
    of the soil medium (soil bulk permittivity or soil dielectric constant). The dielectric
    constant is a measure of the substance’s ability to store electrical energy. Since
    soil particles, water, and air all have different dielectric constants, their
    ability to store or dissipate electrical energy is different. Capacitance or frequency
    domain sensors: Typically, these sensors are in the form of two parallel rods
    (two electrodes) or a pair of metal rings (two electrodes) mounted along the length
    of a PVC pipe. The capacitor along the length of the PVC pipe allows simultaneous
    measurements of soil moisture at different depths. Portable capacitance probes
    also allow measurements at several locations through access tubes. When electric
    current passes through these electrodes, they form an electromagnetic field in
    the soil. The probe measures the permittivity of a soil medium by measuring the
    charge time of a capacitor made with that medium and thus the soil water content.
    Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors: Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors
    consist of two or three parallel rods inserted into the soil, acting as waveguides.
    When a defined voltage pulse is sent to the sensor, it travels along the waveguide.
    When this pulse reaches the end of the waveguide, it reflects back. The oscilloscope
    connected to the sensor measures this reflection. As the soil’s water content
    increases, the dielectric constant of the soil also increases. Consequently, the
    travel time of the pulse decreases, and thus, the soil moisture content can be
    estimated using the calibration equation [36]. A leaf wetness sensor is a device
    used to measure the amount of moisture present on the surface of leaves. It is
    often used in agriculture to help farmers determine the optimal time for irrigation
    or to prevent fungal diseases that may occur due to prolonged leaf wetness. The
    sensor works by measuring the electrical resistance between two conductive plates,
    or probes, that are placed on the surface of the leaf. By monitoring the changes
    in resistance over time, the sensor can detect when the leaf becomes wet and when
    it dries out. Leaf wetness sensors may also include temperature and humidity sensors
    to provide additional environmental data that can help farmers make more informed
    decisions about irrigation and disease management. In particular, in this study,
    we have used the AccuPAR LP-80 Leaf Wetness Sensor: The LP-80 Leaf Wetness Sensor
    consists of a flat surface that is placed in contact with the leaves. It utilizes
    electrical resistance or capacitive sensing technology to detect the presence
    or absence of moisture on the leaf surface. By measuring the wetness level, the
    sensor can provide valuable information for various applications, such as determining
    optimal irrigation schedules, assessing plant health, and monitoring disease conditions
    [37]. A pH sensor is a device used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a liquid
    or soil. A pH sensor works by using a probe or electrode that is sensitive to
    changes in hydrogen ion concentration. Modern pH sensors may also include temperature
    sensors and microprocessors to automatically compensate for changes in temperature
    and provide more accurate readings. pH sensors are widely used in agriculture
    for monitoring and maintaining the pH levels of soil, water, and nutrient solutions
    used for crop growth. pH sensors are essential in agriculture because pH levels
    directly affect the plant’s ability to take up nutrients from the soil or water.
    They are also used in hydroponic farming to monitor the nutrient solutions used
    to grow plants that grow in water. In particular, for the experimentation, we
    have used the HALO wireless Soil pH meter (Hanna Instruments, Inc., Padova, Italy)
    [38]. A temperature and humidity sensor is a device used to measure the temperature
    and relative humidity of the surrounding air. It is commonly used in environmental
    monitoring systems, greenhouses, and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning)
    systems. Temperature and humidity sensors are widely used in agriculture to monitor
    environmental conditions in crop production areas. These sensors are essential
    in agriculture because temperature and humidity levels directly affect plant growth
    and health. The applications of these sensors also include the monitoring of environmental
    conditions in greenhouses and the control of pest infestations. Pests thrive in
    specific conditions, and thanks to this type of sensor, farmers can identify conditions
    that favor pest populations. For the study, we have used BI-SENSOR (Maher Smart
    Agrocontrollers, Almeria, Spain) [39]. A barometric pressure sensor is an instrument
    used to measure atmospheric pressure. It is commonly used in weather monitoring
    systems, aviation, and altimeters. The sensor works by using a thin, flexible
    membrane, typically made of silicon, that is exposed to the atmosphere. As atmospheric
    pressure changes, the membrane expands or contracts, causing a corresponding change
    in the electrical resistance of the sensor. Modern barometric pressure sensors
    may also include temperature sensors to compensate for temperature-related changes
    in atmospheric pressure. This compensation is necessary because temperature affects
    the density of air, which in turn affects atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure
    is an essential factor in determining weather patterns and can affect crop growth
    and yield. Barometric sensors are used in several ways in agriculture, including
    weather forecasting and livestock management. In the study, we used the Digital
    Barometer PS-0060-AD (Netsens Sensing the Environment, Firenze, Italy) [40]. 2.4.
    Self-Driving Remote Controlled Tractor in Smart Agriculture Self-driving tractors
    are autonomous vehicles that use advanced technologies such as sensors, cameras,
    GPS, and machine learning algorithms. Autonomous tractors are becoming increasingly
    popular in the agriculture industry as they offer numerous benefits to farmers.
    One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors is their ability to operate
    around the clock, which increases the efficiency of farming operations. They can
    work continuously without the need for rest breaks or sleep, which can be particularly
    useful during critical periods such as planting and harvesting seasons. Self-driving
    tractors also offer greater precision and accuracy in farming operations. They
    can operate with high levels of accuracy and repeatability, which can help reduce
    the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, leading to improved crop
    yields and reduced costs. Moreover, self-driving tractors can be programmed to
    work in various weather conditions and terrains, which helps reduce soil erosion
    and improve overall soil health. They can also operate in hazardous conditions
    or environments that may be dangerous for human operators. Thanks to improvements
    in several fields of engineering, autonomous and remote-control studies today
    allow increased productivity in agriculture [41,42,43,44]. With a remote control,
    the tractor is operated by a person from a remote area, considering data from
    tractor cameras and sensors. TX/RX of data is possible if requirements such as
    latency and bandwidth for video and control data transfer are verified. A remote-control
    system includes cameras, sensors, collision avoidance sensors, and control devices.
    ISO 11783, commonly known as ISOBUS, is a communication standard that allows a
    link between tractors. ISOBUS is based on the SAE J1939 protocol, which includes
    the controller area network (CAN) and allows electronic control units (ECUs) to
    communicate through the CAN bus. Autonomous control algorithms for agricultural
    tractors use communication based on the ISOBUS standard. The Cannelloni software
    allows the connection of area network controllers on a local area network. However,
    data transmission over the Internet or a mobile network using this software is
    not secure. Control of the tractor is based on the CAN bus, whose protocol allows
    a bit rate of up to 1 Mbps. The components inside the tractor to remotely drive
    the tractor are a remote-controlled cabin, a remote-controlled tractor, and a
    computer for CAN tunneling on a mobile network [45]. All network traffic is over
    a virtual private network (VPN) connection, and communication data among devices
    occurs on the same local area network. A router connects the tractor to the tactical
    network using various mobile networks. By default, the router uses all these connections
    simultaneously and switches between them to provide the best possible service.
    The target of the remote control is to verify the possibility of remote control
    of the tractor through various trial networks. This is possible by sending CAN
    messages over the network. SocketCAN [46,47] allows the CAN interface to be controlled
    and programmed as a standard network interface. The Cannelloni tool allows CAN
    data to be transferred over an Ethernet tunnel. Cannelloni supports tunneling
    over UDP (user datagram protocol) or SCTP (stream control transmission protocol).
    The two protocols show substantial differences. In fact, SCTP is fast but unreliable
    in receiving data, while SCTP provides reliable transport but is slower. The secure
    shell protocol (SSH) is used to transfer the CAN traffic over the network and
    encrypt it. However, the SSH port is not compatible with SCTP. It is needed to
    convert SCTP to the transmission control protocol (TCP). This step is possible
    using the Socat utility. On board the tractor and remote-control cabin is a Raspberry
    Pi 4 computer connected to the local CAN using a Kvaser USB adapter. The Raspberry
    Pi onboard the tractor represents a client, allowing a connection to the server
    Raspberry Pi computer on the remote-control cabin. The remote-control cab server
    has a known address on the Internet, while the tractor may be behind the network
    address translation (NAT) and/or firewall of the mobile operator. The tractor
    software will constantly try to establish a connection to the server. If the connection
    to the server is lost, the client will keep trying to establish a new connection.
    The devices on the tractor generate a lot of CAN traffic, but much of it is not
    relevant to remote control. The same also applies to the remote-control cabin.
    So, a filter has been inserted so that only the requested messages pass through.
    Filtering is achieved by modifying the Cannelloni software to regulate outgoing
    and incoming traffic [48]. 2.5. Data Fusion Method for Remote Sensing and UAV
    Images Data fusion involves merging data from different sensors, platforms, or
    domains to create a single, integrated data set. The purpose of data fusion is
    to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of data and to improve
    the performance of decision-making systems. By integrating information from different
    sources, data fusion can help identify patterns, trends, and relationships that
    may not be apparent from individual sources alone. Data fusion has numerous applications
    in various fields, including defense, aerospace, medicine, transportation, and
    environmental monitoring. For example, in military operations, data fusion can
    be used to combine data from multiple sensors, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic
    sensors, to provide a more complete picture of the battlefield. In healthcare,
    data fusion can be used to combine data from various medical devices and sensors
    to monitor patient health and provide better care. In this case study, we have
    combined remote sensing and UAV data. Today, real-time information in several
    application fields can be obtained thanks to a variety of sensors on board UAVs.
    These flight objects receive large amounts of data (e.g., large amounts of images),
    and for this reason, it is needed to introduce intelligent algorithms capable
    of receiving different types of data and converting them into valuable and concise
    information. To overcome this problem, the trend today is to use multiple sensor
    data fusions capable of handling not only data from UAVs but also data from regular
    revisit times in high-resolution satellite imagery. So, the use of UAVs allows
    for obtaining periodic data, while the combination of satellites maintains a fine
    spatial resolution in the large area of observation [49,50,51,52]. However, the
    data obtained from UAVs and satellites are used separately; the goal is to merge
    them through data fusion techniques to obtain images useful for determining the
    indices useful for agriculture, bearing in mind all the advantages and disadvantages
    deriving from UAVs and satellite data sources, which differ in flexibility, cloud
    dependence, direct meteorological constraint, operator requirements, data management,
    and payload [53,54,55,56,57]. The “data fusion” strategy (spatial-spectral) aims
    to create datasets with advanced features by combining one or more resolutions
    from each source. This strategy, designed to extract the biophysical properties
    of land cover and vegetation cover at high resolution, is currently little used
    in fields such as agriculture. The fusion of satellite and UAV data offers a range
    of advantages, including improved spatial and temporal resolution, greater customization,
    and more detailed and comprehensive information. However, there are also some
    disadvantages, such as the limited coverage of drones compared to satellites,
    higher costs and more complex logistics, restrictions related to weather conditions,
    and the management of collected data. In particular, the fusion spatial-spectral
    method is useful to improve the spectral resolution of low-cost UAV sensor imagery
    and the accuracy of land cover classification [58,59]. Spatiotemporal is used
    in data analysis when data are collected over both space and time. It describes
    a phenomenon at a particular place and time. The fusion spatial-temporal method
    is useful to obtain biophysical parameters (leaf area index and chlorophyll content)
    of crops and make consistent predictions with fine spatial patterns. The spectral
    resolution of an image describes the frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum
    collected by the satellite. This spectral characteristic allows different features
    to be seen as separate entities. The temporal resolution of an image is defined
    as the amount of time needed to revisit and acquire data for the exact same location.
    The fusion spatial-temporal method is used to obtain information in multispectral
    satellite data with hyperspectral data from a UAV [60,61]. The obtained results
    allow for obtaining biophysical variables (e.g., leaf area index and chlorophyll
    content). Finally, the satellite/UAV data fusion improved the performance of the
    model compared to data obtained individually from satellite or UAV due to satellite-based
    spectral characteristics and structural characteristics obtained from UAVs [62,63].
    As is known, remote sensing techniques could be an important tool to ground information
    on the characteristics of vegetation through the production of significant vegetation
    indices. This information can be collected by multispectral and hyperspectral
    systems using optical sensors, and thanks to these, it is possible to analyze
    some fundamental indices in agriculture, such as the NDVI (normalized difference
    vegetation index), NDMI (normalized difference moisture index), and BSI (bare
    soil index). In this research, Sentinel-2 satellite images were used that have
    a spatial resolution of a decameter and a revisit time of six days, together with
    images captured by UAVs, which have a higher resolution and the possibility to
    catch details within the canopies with no difficulty thanks to their flexibility.
    The data utilized for this analysis included a Sentile-2 Level 2A image obtained
    on four different dates (17 May, 14 July, 30 August, and 25 September 2022) at
    10:00 UTC, as well as a WorldView-3 satellite image taken on 17 November 2022.
    The WorldView-3 images are considered to be one of the most detailed and precise
    commercial satellite images accessible to the public, with a spatial resolution
    of approximately 30 cm per pixel, allowing for the detection of small objects
    on the Earth’s surface, including cars, buildings, vegetation, and other features.
    In addition, the multispectral images acquired by the DJI Matrice 600 Pro drone
    (SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China), which was equipped with a Micasense
    Altum Camera (AgEagle Aerial System Inc., Kansas, USA), were also utilized. This
    camera is well suited for agricultural purposes and has the capability to capture
    images of crops in both visible and infrared spectra simultaneously. The drone
    flew at a height of approximately 30 m above the ground, resulting in aerial GSD
    images with a resolution of 5 cm. 3. Case Study The study area chosen for the
    research is in Calabria (South Italy), in particular, in the municipality of Reggio
    Calabria, as shown in Figure 4. The red line shows the application area of the
    simulator, while the application of the entire methodology was focused in a zone
    near the Castle of San Niceto, always in the Municipality of Reggio Calabria,
    with an extent of 35 hectares. This area was chosen for different reasons: It
    is a virgin area that has not been cultivated yet, so the GIS was able to show
    us the most suitable area for cultivation. It has a morphology suitable for using
    the simulator. In a few kilometers, there is a sudden change in the orography
    of the land: one passes from a coastal area to an Apennine area, and this allows
    the simulator to function properly as it takes the DEM of the area of interest
    as its initial input. The dimensioning described in Section 2 was designed to
    cover an area of 60 km × 60 km. It is a small area, and therefore it is possible
    to apply the entire proposed system and have detailed results. 4. Results All
    the data collected during the research were imported into a GIS that, using the
    methodology in paragraph 2, displayed the main results of the activities we conducted.
    As regards the atmospheric simulator software, Figure 5 shows a single frame extracted
    from the animation offered by the software, highlighting the positions of the
    particles of the atmosphere in the domain of interest. In Figure 5, orography
    (derived from the DEM) is represented with the red color, while with blue dots,
    the positions of particles in the atmosphere are shown according to the SPH model
    that rules the interactions between them and their evolution over time. Figure
    5. Frame extracted from the software showing the positions of the particles. The
    orographic trend of the study area is highlighted in red, and the atmospheric
    particles are highlighted in blue. Once the software is running, the Pattern Detector
    (part of Solver L1) creates clusters with similar atmospheric characteristics,
    identifying rain, humidity, wind, pressure, etc. Each punctual value, referred
    to as Clusters, is the output provided by the simulator, which is then imported
    into the GIS. Below, it shows an example of the extrapolation of the precipitation
    and wind values represented in Figure 6 with dots within the area of the case
    study. One hundred dots with the respective values of these climatic variables
    were produced by the simulator and reported to the GIS. In the specific case,
    the values obtained (also validated with the local sensors considering a tolerance
    of 10%) varied in a range between 0 and 4 mm for the precipitation and in a range
    from 0 to 55 km/h for the gusts of wind. Figure 6. Example of values extrapolated
    from the atmospheric simulator. The orange dots show the precipitation and wind
    values (derived from the atmospheric simulator) imported into QGIS for processing
    and analysis. (Image extrapolated from QGIS, Google Satellite base map). In order
    to identify the area more susceptible to adverse climatic events, we have interpolated
    these values, creating the tridimensional map shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.
    The distribution of climatic events can be variable according to the seasons and
    specific weather conditions. For an accurate prediction of adverse climatic events,
    it is necessary to use local meteorological data. For this reason, an analysis
    of the data from the local weather stations in Calabria (which were used in the
    initialization phase of the simulator) was carried out. From this analysis, it
    emerged that, in principle, the areas most affected in Calabria are the coastal
    areas and the mountainous areas. Figure 7. Tridimensional map derived from the
    interpolation of points (yellow dots) representing the precipitation punctual
    values that have been determined by the atmospheric simulator. These values have
    been interpolated in the GIS to obtain a continuous representation of precipitation
    data representative of the expected precipitation trend, reported in the figure
    with different shades of blue. Figure 8. Tridimensional map derived from the interpolation
    of points (yellow dots) representing the wind punctual values that have been determined
    by the atmospheric simulator. These values have been interpolated in the GIS to
    obtain a continuous representation of wind data representative of the expected
    wind trend, reported in the figure with different shades of red. After having
    evaluated Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 images and UAV multispectral images, a data
    fusion technique (which also leverages different sensors, such as soil moisture
    sensors, to further enhance the overall understanding) [7] was performed in the
    area of interest, determining the different interest indices such as the NDVI
    (normalized difference vegetation index), LST (land surface temperature), NDMI
    (normalized difference moisture index), and BSI (bare soil index) useful for the
    planning and management of agricultural activities. The choice fell into these
    indices because they are very relevant in the context of Agriculture 4.0 in order
    to have an indication of vegetation richness and to capture soil differences [64].
    As is known, to quantify the link between land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation,
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is usually employed as an indication
    of vegetation richness. But the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) is
    an alternative indicator. By studying the correlations between the land surface
    temperature (LST), the NDMI, and the NDVI, some studies show that the linear association
    between LST and NDMI is stronger, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI
    is significantly less and varies by month. The linear association between LST
    and NDMI steadily decreases as the seasons change from summer to fall. This finding
    implies that NDMI, in addition to the previously used NDVI, can be used to analyze
    LST. NDVI values range from −1.0 to 1.0 in general, with negative values suggesting
    clouds and water, positive values near zero indicating bare soil, and higher positive
    values indicating sparse vegetation (0.1–0.5) to thick green vegetation (0.6 and
    above). The bare soil index (BSI) is a numerical indicator that captures soil
    differences by combining blue, red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared spectral
    bands. These spectral bands are employed in a normalized fashion. The blue and
    near-infrared spectral bands are utilized to highlight the presence of plants,
    whereas the short-wave infrared and red spectral bands are employed to measure
    soil mineral content. BSI can be utilized in a variety of remote sensing applications,
    including soil mapping, crop identification (in conjunction with NDVI), and so
    on. In particular, Figure 9 shows an application of the data fusion technique
    [7] used to calculate the NDVI in the study area. Figure 9. Example of data fusion
    technique applied, highlighting (VHR image) the calculation of an important index
    (NDVI) useful for determining vegetation richness. Data fusion techniques enable
    the acquisition of comprehensive information about an area and the associated
    cultivation requirements by merging various data sources, including satellite
    data and UAV images. In particular, VHR (very high resolution) image: green =
    NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) high; yellow = NDVI medium; red
    = NDVI low. Once the data were collected from the multiple sources, we were enabled
    to identify using the open-source GIS, in relation to climate parameters, sensor
    values, and indices deriving from satellite and UAV images (wind, soil type, soil
    moisture, NDVI…), different types of areas suitable for the cultivation indicated
    with different capital letters (A, B, C, D…) and grouped for simplicity of treatment
    according to the parameters useful for the particular types of crops. Specifically,
    the available data have made it possible to identify in the study area exclusively
    three types of classes (A, B, and C) reported with different colors. Typology
    A (orange color): cultivation areas suitable for crops that do not need continuous
    irrigation. Typology B (green color): cultivation areas suitable for crops that
    need continuous irrigation. Typology C (yellow color): cultivation areas suitable
    for trees. Figure 10 shows the three different typologies of cultivation. Figure
    10. GIS showing the three different typologies of cultivation, A, B, and C, reported
    in three different colors (letters and arrows are superimposed on the original
    image to better visualize the different typologies highlighted: typology A (orange
    color) represents cultivation areas suitable for crops that do not need continuous
    irrigation; typology B (green color) represents cultivation areas suitable for
    crops that need continuous irrigation; typology C (yellow color) represents cultivation
    areas suitable for trees. Finally, using the methodology and algorithms illustrated
    in paragraph 2, the GIS allowed us to establish the path of a drone used for monitoring
    existing crops and the path of an automatic tractor used for fertilization and
    irrigation. In Figure 11, the path of the drone in an existing crop is shown with
    a blue line, the path of the tractor with a red line, and the points at which
    greater fertilization and irrigation interventions are required with green dots.
    Figure 10 shows the application of the methodology concerning the choice of the
    different typologies of cultivation in a small portion of the study area. Figure
    9 and Figure 11, representing the calculation of the NDVI and the optimal path
    of the drone and the tractor, respectively, refer to a small area included within
    the larger area represented in Figure 10. Figure 11. GIS, the optimal path of
    the tractor is shown with a red line, calculated within a cultivated portion of
    land. Within this cultivation, points requiring more irrigation and fertilization
    interventions have also been identified and highlighted in green. The optimal
    path of the drone for monitoring an existing cultivation is shown with a blue
    line. 5. Discussion The research conducted in this work aimed to experiment with
    and test an automatic integration system for crop optimization and control. The
    methodology involves the integration of an experimental atmospheric simulator,
    satellite and UAV images, local sensor data, and data transmission protocols,
    all managed in an open-source GIS. The study focused on identifying different
    types of cultivation and establishing optimal routes for an automated tractor
    and a drone to monitor crop growth and health. The research was conducted in a
    specific area in the province of Reggio Calabria, chosen for its suitability for
    applying the various technologies described. Compared to similar approaches, this
    research demonstrates several strengths and weaknesses. One notable strength is
    the comprehensive integration of multiple technologies, allowing for a holistic
    approach to Agriculture 4.0. Our experimentation enables a detailed understanding
    of crop conditions and facilitates precise fertilization/irrigation optimization.
    The tested method is part of Agriculture 4.0, which still has a number of weaknesses.
    In fact, the success of Agriculture 4.0, and therefore also of the methodology
    proposed by us, relies on the availability of accurate and up-to-date data as
    well as the expertise required to interpret and utilize the collected information
    effectively. Additionally, the initial setup costs and the need for skilled personnel
    to operate and maintain the system may pose challenges for widespread adoption.
    Despite these weaknesses (however intrinsic to Agriculture 4.0), this research
    contributes valuable insights into the potential of Agriculture 4.0. The integration
    of various technologies and data sources offers a significant advantage in optimizing
    irrigation practices and monitoring crop health. Clearly, the authors have given
    importance to the methodology and not so much to the results, reserving the right
    to analyze them in more detail through different skills for the subdivision of
    the areas suitable for cultivation. The technologies to be integrated within drones
    may be particularly promising, including increasingly sophisticated sensors for
    the performance of different functions such as the vaporization of fertilizers
    or natural pesticides. In fact, evaporation and crystallization processes are
    currently prevalent in commercial fertilizer production facilities. As fertilizer
    demand continues to rise and the availability of low-cost raw materials decreases,
    new fertilizer production technologies are being developed. Evaporation and crystallization
    techniques have many applications in the fertilizer industry. This research contributes
    to the advancement of Agriculture 4.0 by showing the integration of different
    tools and techniques. While there are weaknesses to address, the benefits of adopting
    such integrated systems for precision agriculture are significant. The results
    of this work demonstrate the value of employing advanced technologies to optimize
    agricultural processes and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable agricultural
    practices in the future. 6. Conclusions The advantages of the proposed innovative
    system are evident in terms of time consumption, human resources, and productivity.
    In fact, the automation of some fundamental agricultural activities normally carried
    out by people saves time and costs. Furthermore, the possibility of analyzing
    different types of data on soil conditions and the well-being of crops can increase
    productivity and quality and save a highly precious resource, water, which is
    instead managed according to what emerges from the weather variables provided
    by the simulator. The main novelty reported in this article lies precisely in
    the use of this software, which, through a few input data, allows you to have
    an assessment of the weather conditions. Furthermore, although self-driving tractors
    are still relatively new, they are already having a significant impact on the
    agriculture industry. With the rapid advances in technology, it is likely that
    self-driving tractors will become more common in the future and will continue
    to transform the way farming is conducted. This research focused on a specific
    area in the province of Reggio Calabria, leveraging the morphological and orographic
    characteristics of the region for the application of various technologies. This
    demonstrates that, with proper planning and implementation, such approaches can
    be adapted to specific agricultural contexts, thus maximizing the benefits obtained.
    The future developments of this research should focus first of all on speeding
    up and optimizing data processing and data transmission protocols, possibly experimenting
    with more efficient algorithms in terms of productivity and processing, and moreover,
    on the validation and large-scale implementation of these integrated systems.
    Collaboration between research institutions, agricultural organizations, and farmers
    will be crucial to promoting the adoption of these innovative solutions. The ultimate
    goal is to create a sustainable agricultural approach that efficiently utilizes
    available resources, reduces environmental impact, and is beneficial for farmers.
    This requires the continuous development and adaptation of technologies and methods,
    taking into account the specific needs of different crops, environmental conditions,
    and the farmers’ requirements. Author Contributions Conceptualization, V.B.; methodology,

    Integration of plant phenotyping and irrigation is particularly advantageous for
    identifying genetic variation associated with crop productivity. Collecting phenotypic
    data and water management under controlled or open environment can be expensive
    and laborious. This study aims to design a cost-effective solution for high-throughput
    phenotyping (HTP) and automated irrigation using open-source electronics. A portable
    HTP system was developed using a microcontroller and a single-board computer Raspberry
    Pi and was extended to include soil water monitoring and water pump control. An
    Arduino board was integrated with a multispectral camera, mini LiDAR sensors,
    infrared thermometers, soil moisture sensors, water pumps, and a temperature/humidity
    sensor. Sensor calibration and power management enhanced the accuracy and reliability
    of the system. Two genotypes (CAM212 and Giessen#4) of camelina were used to evaluate
    the system to measure phenotypic responses to abiotic stress in growth chambers
    under two temperatures (25 °C and 35 °C) and two water treatments (40% and 90%
    water holding capacity). The HTP system monitored 24 plants periodically, and
    data were wirelessly accessed by a smartphone and transferred to a computer for
    further analyses. The system revealed that camelina genotype 1 (CAM212) showed
    superior resistance to heat and drought stress. The results showed that the developed
    HTP system offers a cost-effective and portable solution for phenotyping and water
    management in controlled environment and can be modified for field applications.

    processingArduinoRaspberry Pi Introduction Plant breeding promotes the development
    of new cultivars for sustainable agriculture and requires measurement of phenotypic
    responses developed from the interaction of genotypes with the environment. High-throughput
    phenotyping (HTP) equipped with novel sensing and analytical capabilities is essential
    to improve genetic modeling and thus expedites the identification of germplasm
    that increases the crop productivity. HTP systems have been used in plant phenotyping
    to identify crop responses to abiotic stress and to discover novel traits related
    to tolerance [1,2]. Image-based phenotyping became a promising HTP tool because
    of the improvement in handling large numbers of images. Multispectral cameras
    have been widely used for plant phenotyping [[3], [4], [5]]. Various image processing
    pipelines were developed to assess plant vigor by NDVI [6], growth rate by measuring
    leaf area [7], and shoot phenotypes by image classification [8]. HTPheno software
    [9] was reported to automate image analysis of a single barley plant at a time.
    An ideal image analytic toolbox is to process multiple plants through the automated
    image processing. Canopy temperature was used for plant stress detection [[10],
    [11], [12]] and phenotyping [[13], [14], [15]] using infrared (IR) thermometers.
    Plant height has been measured for plant phenotyping by Light Detection and Ranging
    (LiDAR) [[16], [17], [18], [19]] or ultrasonic sensors [13,15]. Microcontroller-based
    systems are low-cost, highly configurable computing devices that have transformed
    the field of agricultural research. Arduino is an open-source electronics consisting
    of microcontroller hardware and Arduino software for programming and has been
    identified as a viable alternative for commercial instrumentation in scientific
    research [20]. The wide variety of inexpensive hardware and availability of open-source
    code libraries make Arduino the best choice for data loggers [21]. The plug-and-play
    nature of Arduino devices has attracted researchers for power-efficient systems
    [22] such as plant growers [23], environmental monitoring [24], and harvest management
    [25]. Prior applications of Arduino on water management include water conservation
    [26], water quality [27], irrigation [[28], [29], [30]], and water intake [31].
    Most applications focus on irrigation control from soil water feedback [[32],
    [33], [34]] or plant sensing [[35], [36], [37]]. Breeding research increased the
    need to support both plant phenotyping and percipient irrigation for effective
    plant monitoring under the water stress maintained by an irrigation controller.
    Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a compact single-board computer created for the development
    of a small and affordable computing platform for education [38]. Open-source software
    such as Python provides a flexible design of open-source systems and allows users
    to address specific needs in agronomic and environmental monitoring. A growing
    population of researchers use RPi computers for a wide range of applications:
    autonomous farming machines [39], pest detection in livestock feed storage [40],
    and plant phenotyping [41,42]. Arduinos along with the Raspberry Pi (RPi) pack
    considerable power on their diminutive boards, making them ideal for integration
    into scientific sensors and providing tremendous opportunities for automation,
    networking, and data collection and analysis [22]. This inexpensive open-source
    protocol increased the possibilities of design and resources available for troubleshooting.
    Although many applications of this protocol were reported, there are only a few
    applied on plant phenotyping [1,2]. Details of sensor integration, power management,
    and sensor calibration are not sufficiently provided. This research aims to develop
    a cost-effective HTP system to measure plant responses under abiotic stress using
    open-source electronics associated with sensor integration, calibration, and power
    management. Specific objectives are to (1) build a portable HTP system using Arduino-RPi
    protocol and image analytics for remote monitoring of plant phenotypes, (2) add
    an irrigation controller to the system to support water management for drought
    study, and (3) apply the system on camelina plants in growth chambers to identify
    phenotypic responses to heat and drought stress. Materials and methods In order
    to support plant phenotyping and automated irrigation, a cost-effective reliable
    solution was considered for end-users to enable them to afford sensing systems
    and expand their applications. A portable wireless HTP system was designed to
    offer quick installation and easy modification and was developed using Arduino
    Uno (DFR0216, DFRobot, China) and RPi (3B+, Raspberry Pi Foundation, UK). An irrigation
    controller was needed to automate water management for drought study and was integrated
    with the HTP system. The system was applied on camelina plants in growth chambers
    to characterize agronomic traits conditioning abiotic stress tolerance. Sensing
    system Plant phenotyping Metrics for plant phenotyping included canopy temperature,
    plant height, and vegetation indexes measured by infrared (IR) thermometers (SEN0206,
    DFRobot, China), mini LiDAR sensors (SEN0259, DFRobot, China), and multispectral
    cameras (Survey3W, MAPIR, San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. The IR thermometer
    measures the surface temperature by detecting IR radiation energy and wavelength
    distribution through an amplifier with 17-bit ADC. The sensor has a 35° field
    of view (FOV) with 0.01 °C precision and ±0.5 °C accuracy and is connected through
    inter-integrated circuit (I2C) to the microcontroller. An I2C multiplexer (DFR0576,
    DFRobot, China) was used to solve the address conflict of multiple IR thermometers
    on a single I2C port by providing addresses from 0x70 to 0x77. The LiDAR sensor
    is an unidirectional laser range finder based on time-of-flight (ToF) technology
    and measures the distance in the range of 0.3–12 m at 2° FOV in 100 Hz with 1-mm
    resolution and ±6 cm accuracy. The sensor is interfaced through a universal asynchronous
    receiver\\transmitter (UART). In order to connect multiple LiDAR sensors on one
    UART port in the microcontroller, software serial was used through digital ports
    such that Rx (receiver) and Tx (transmitter) wires were defined in SoftwareSerial
    function in the Arduino program. The LiDAR sensor ran at higher amperage than
    the maximum current provided from the microcontroller, and thus an external power
    source was required to achieve stable operation of the LiDAR sensor. A temperature\\relative
    humidity (T\\RH) sensor (DHT22, DFRobot, China) was used to monitor the temperature
    and humidity in the chamber. The sensor delivers digital output of the temperature
    with 0.1 °C precision and ±0.5 °C accuracy and humidity with 0.1% resolution and
    ±2% accuracy. It is connected through a standard single-bus digital interface.
    An LCD screen (DFR0063, DFRobot, China) was added to the microcontroller through
    the I2C multiplexer to display T\\RH with a time stamp. A multispectral (Red,
    Green, and Near-infrared) camera was attached in nadir view to monitor the plant
    vegetation index (VI) and leaf area index (LAI) and triggered by a pulse-width
    modulation (PWM) signal from the microcontroller. Image analytics The images captured
    by the multispectral camera were processed through a series of steps as shown
    in Fig. 1. The raw image is acquired in 3-band (3b) false color in the order of
    red (R), green (G), and near-infrared (N) with 4000 × 3000 resolution and 16-bit
    depth. They were preprocessed for conversion from raw to tif format and radiometric
    calibration to deliver canopy reflectance with a reflectance target board provided
    by the camera manufacturer. An image processing pipeline was developed for HTP
    through thresholding, filtering, masking, segmentation, and gridding (Fig. 1).
    A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image was converted from the 16-bit
    RGN image using a band math of (N - R) / (N + R) and automatically segmented by
    using Otsu [43] algorithm and filtered through the opening operation. Once the
    NDVI is masked to exclude non-vegetation background pixels, A 2 × 7 grid was applied
    on the masked NDVI to create 14 regions of interest (ROI), where seven columns
    were evenly spaced to fit three pots on each side and a dummy column in the middle
    to isolate non-vegetation pixels (Fig. 1). Three ROIs on each side were grouped
    to extract individual metrics of four experimental groups in each chamber. Canopy
    coverage was calculated from the masked NDVI image as a percentage of vegetation
    pixels to the combined area of three ROIs. A Python script was coded for a batch
    process to implement a series of image processing algorithm and export into a
    comma delimited file phenotypic metrics, i.e., vegetation index and canopy coverage.

    a sequence of the images processed. Microcontroller The Arduino is a standardized
    rapid prototyping platform using the ATmega328 microcontroller [44] and was selected
    based on its inexpensive and customizable advantages with a wide range of sensors
    and actuators which are easily setup with sample codes and wire diagrams provided
    by manufacturer. The microcontroller has four main types of sensor interface:
    Analog\\Digital inputs, I2C, serial peripheral interface (SPI), and UART. I2C
    is the most common interface that uses 2-wire bus from a master to many slaves
    in 400 kHz: ‘SDA’ (serial data) for bidirectional data transmission and ‘SCL’
    (serial clock) for synchronizing the data transfer. SPI is used for fast, full-duplex
    sync serial data link. UART is a serial data transfer and has two ways to implement:
    software serial and hardware serial. The software serial reads only a single data
    entry at a time, whereas hardware serial can read data simultaneously using ‘Rx’
    (receiver) and ‘Tx’ (transmitter) pins. Arduino Uno provides six multiplexed analog
    input pins, 14 digital input\\output (DIO) of which six provide pulse-width modulation
    (PWM) output, one I2C, one SPI, and one UART. The analog input pins support 10-bit
    analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) using analogRead function. Most of the analog
    inputs can also be used as digital pins: analog input 0 as digital pin 14 through
    analog input 5 as digital pin 19 [45]. All sensors and actuators were connected
    to the microcontroller that was placed in a waterproof enclosure box (1020, Pelican,
    Torrance, CA, USA) including a relay shield mounted on the microcontroller. Arduino
    Shields were added as pin layout that makes wire connection efficient without
    soldering and thus saves time and cost for projects. The enclosure box was modified
    to feed cables through three holes: a USB cable from the RPi, wires from the four
    water pumps, and wires from all other sensors. The box allowed all wires to remain
    intact and undamaged inside the box during the experiment and the flexibility
    to rewire in hardware update and troubleshooting wire connectivity. Single-board
    computer The RPi is low cost and low power consumption with light weight but still
    offers a powerful computing and a full peripheral interface of a computer. The
    RPi 3B+ contains 1.4 GHz quad-core ARM processor with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI,
    and four USB ports. The RPi was enclosed in a protective box. Table 1 shows a
    complete list of all electronic components of the sensing system with total cost
    of USD 874 and total weight of 1.7 kg. A flowchart of Python code operating RPi
    is illustrated in Fig. 2. For the convenience of debugging, a serial port is opened
    for either an RPi or a personal computer (PC). After first 10 dummy iterations
    to avoid broken characters that were observed at the beginning of serial connection,
    input strings from Arduino were validated by the length of characters before saving
    them into a file Table 1. Electronic components of the sensing system used in

    Fig. 2. Flowchart of Python code in RPi in a sequence of opening a serial port
    for either RPi or PC, reading strings from Arduino after first 10 dummy iterations,
    validating the input strings by a string length, and saving them to an output
    file. Wireless communication The RPi was programmed by a Python script to read
    a serial data from the Arduino through a USB connection at 115,200 baud rate and
    store data strings to a file with time stamps. Real-time status of all sensory
    data was also displayed by the script on the RPi terminal and accessed wirelessly
    from a remote computer or a smartphone through Wi-Fi connection. Wi-Fi was selected
    for wireless data communication, because it is a built-in feature in RPi and can
    easily connect to the internet cloud that allows the user to remotely access to
    data stored in the RPi. The RPi was configured for Wi-Fi by enabling Secure Shell
    (SSH) and Virtual Network Computing (VNC) interfaces. When the RPi is connected
    to Wi-Fi through an access point (AP), network IP address is assigned to the RPi
    and used to remotely connect to the RPi using PuTTY via SSH for terminal access
    or VNC Viewer for remote desktop access. When the RPi is connected to a hidden
    network, wpa_supplicant.conf must be created in the RPi directory of etc/wpa_supplicant
    to assign network ID and user account credential. RPi 3B+ with Debian Stretch
    operation system (OS) was used for a stable Wi-Fi connection, as RPi 4 with Debian
    Buster OS was found unstable in connecting to a hidden network. The RPi configuration
    was updated to automatically run a Python script (e.g., autowater.py) that starts
    reading data from the Arduino when the RPi is powered on by adding codes (Fig.
    3) at the end of the file ‘∼/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart’ for automatically
    opening a terminal at reboot and adding ‘python autowater.py’ at the end of the
    file ’.bashrc’. Download : Download high-res image (38KB) Download : Download

    management The characterization of agronomic traits resistant to drought stress
    requires a system to support both plant phenotyping and water management. The
    HTP system was extended to include soil water monitoring and irrigation control
    for effective monitoring of plant responses to water stress in a controlled environment.
    Growth chambers were used for the experiment to provide arid (heat and drought)
    conditions for the plant. Fig. 4 illustrates a schematic diagram of the automated
    irrigation and phenotyping system in a chamber. Download : Download high-res image

    right were the drought and control group, respectively. Lines of information flow
    and interface types are drawn and described in the right top inset. Drought condition
    was generated by separating water treatments from water pumps (FIT0200, DFRobot,
    China) to plants based on soil status readings from soil moisture sensors (SEN0193,
    DFRobot, China). The water pump was equipped with a capacity of 280–500 L/h and
    powered by 6–18 DCV rated at 64–500 mA. A relay (DFR0144, DFRobot, China) was
    added to operate four water pumps. Each water pump supplied water to three replicated
    pots through an irrigation dripper (Fig. 4). A vinyl-flex PVC tube was used for
    irrigation from the water pumps to pots. A 13-L water bucket was placed in the
    chamber as a water reservoir for 12 pots and was refilled weekly. To automate
    water management, soil moisture sensors were deployed to control amount of irrigation
    based on soil water status. Four soil moisture sensors were used in each chamber
    by installing a sensor on each pot in four observation groups and inserted vertically
    at 7.2-cm soil depth. Four water pumps were paired with four soil sensors to control
    each pump individually based on corresponding soil moisture reading. The closed-loop
    irrigation was scheduled every 6 h to maintain two soil conditions (drought and
    control) by checking soil sensors and triggering the water pumps. Sensor installation
    Two adjustable rods were mounted 131 cm above the floor in parallel between side
    walls of the growth chamber to hold four IR thermometers and two LiDAR sensors
    (Fig. 5). Two LiDAR sensors aimed two pots next to the water bucket: one in the
    control group and the other in the drought group, whereas four IR thermometers
    aimed at four pots located around the bucket. Another rod was mounted 140 cm above
    the floor to hold the multispectral camera. All sensors and the camera were angled
    perpendicular to the ground. Two horizontal metal plates were mounted to a vertical
    rack on the rear wall and used to hold the microcontroller, RPi, and T\\RH sensor
    at the lower plate and the LCD screen at the upper plate. Download : Download

    moisture sensors were installed in the soil of four pots next to the water bucket
    where the water pumps were immersed in the water. Power management Power management
    is important to ensure stable operations of all sensors and actuators, the microcontroller
    (Arduino), and the RPi and must be determined by understanding the power consumption
    of each module and optimizing the wiring configurations. The RPi is powered by
    5 DCV rated at 2.5 A and typically requires 500–700 mA [38]. The USB peripheral
    of RPi 3B+ model draws maximum current of 1.2 A and typical active current of
    500 mA [46]. The Arduino is powered by 5 DCV via USB connection or 7–12 DCV power
    adapter. Maximum DC current provided by the Arduino is 40 mA per DIO pin [45],
    which suffices for most sensors, whereas some sensors or actuators use higher
    current and voltage and thus require power management rewired from an external
    power source. For seamless power management, each sensor was troubleshooted and
    calculated for power consumptions (Table 2). In the sensing system, the LiDAR
    sensor and the water pump draw 120 mA and 500 mA current, respectively, that reaches
    above the maximum current of 40 mA supplied from the microcontroller and can cause
    unstable power supply with the multiple connections. An external power source
    was supplied to LiDAR sensors from a 5 DCV 1A power adapter through an external
    power terminal of the microcontroller. Another external power source was provided
    to the water pump from a 7.5 DCV 2A power adapter through the relay sockets. The
    use of the relay sockets and external power supply allows multiple water pumps
    and LiDAR sensors to work flawlessly without power demand from the microcontroller.
    Though the sensing system was powered by two DC adapters, it can be easily converted
    to a standalone system for outdoor use by using a solar rechargeable battery pack
    (Q90–5, Kenruipu, China) that provides 25 Ah with three ports (two 5 V 2A ports
    and one 5 V 1A port) shown in Table 2. Table 2. Power management of each module
    and external power. Experimental design An experiment was conducted in a controlled
    environment to identify plant responses to abiotic stress (heat and drought) using
    the HTP system while automating irrigation for drought environment. Two camelina
    genotypes (CAM212 and Giessen#4) were grown in two growth chambers located in
    U.S. Arid-Land Agricultural Research Center in Maricopa, AZ, USA, where the average
    daily temperature measures up to 37 °C in the range of 31 °C to 43 °C during the
    growing season. The chambers were equipped with temperature, humidity, and light
    control. The chamber temperature was set at 25 °C in chamber 1 for control and
    35 °C in chamber 2 for heat-stressed environment. Drought environment was generated
    by controlling water treatments with 40% and 90% water holding capacity for drought
    and control plants, respectively. Thus, combined interactions to be observed are
    four treatment groups: control, heat (H), drought (D), and heat-drought (HD) (Fig.
    6(a)). With three replications of two genotypic varieties of camelina at each
    group, total 24 plants were cultivated in pots and split to 12 pots to each chamber
    as shown in Fig. 6(b). All sensors and controllers were installed identically
    in both growth chambers. Data were collected for 34 days from December 12, 2019
    to January 14, 2020 and recorded every four seconds generating 21,600 strings
    per day that were downsized in post processing to the averaged data per 10 min
    for further analysis. Multispectral images were captured every 10 min for 10 h
    (7am - 5pm) during the lights on in the chambers. Download : Download high-res

    °C and heat stress at 35 °C) with two water treatments (drought stress and control
    with 40% and 90% water holding capacity, respectively) for two genotypic varieties
    (var. 1 and var. 2) of camelina with three replications at each group to identify
    plant phenotypic responses to abiotic stress. Sensor calibration Sensor calibrations
    were performed to obtain the unbiased data from the measurements of the soil moisture
    sensors, water pump, IR thermometers, and LiDAR sensors. Each sensor is pre-calibrated
    by the manufacturer, but sensitivity errors between sensors remain. Sensor calibration
    minimizes differences among sensors and ensures sensors for consistent accuracy.
    Soil moisture sensor and water pump The output value of the soil moisture sensor
    (SEN0193, DFRobot, China) is from 0 to 1023 through a 10-bit ADC and affected
    by probe insertion depth and how tightly the soil is packed around the sensor.
    Calibration was conducted for each soil sensor by reading digital values from
    dry to soaked soil in a pot with plants, and the maximum and minimum values were
    reversely mapped to 0–100% water holding capacity. Table 3 shows the calibration
    values obtained for eight soil sensors in two chambers, where digital numbers
    in ‘Min’ and ‘Max’ of each sensor were obtained from soaked and dry soil, respectively.
    For instance of sensor 1 in chamber 1, 244 is the minimum value obtained when
    the soil in the pot is soaked indicating 100% soil moisture, whereas 430 is the
    maximum value obtained when the soil is dry indicating 0% soil moisture. The percentage
    soil moisture values were used to calculate the amount of water treatment, i.e.,
    time to turn the water pump on to supply plant-specific irrigation. Table 3. Calibration
    values of four soil moisture sensors in each growth chamber measured in digital
    readings of Min (soaked soil) and Max (dry soil) that are reversely mapped to
    0–100% soil moisture. Chamber Digital readings Sensor 1 Sensor 2 Sensor 3 Sensor

    243–515 250–515 255–515 The water pump is rated with a capacity of 280–500 L/h,
    i.e., 78–138 mL/sec but practically underrated by the resistance due to the elevation
    and length of the water tubes. The flow rate of the water pump was calibrated
    by recording water amount from the pump. Under the circumstance of the 3-way split
    water piping to distribute water from each pump to three pots, the calibrated
    flow rate (f) of 8 mL/sec was obtained. Total amount of irrigation water (Wt)
    per pot was measured to bring dry (0% watered) soil to soaked (100% watered) soil,
    where no more water drained, e.g., 1500 mL pouring on the dry soil subtracted
    by 65 mL of the drained water, resulting in 1435 mL as 100% water holding capacity.
    The water shortage (Ws) per pot was calculated from the deviation from water moisture
    set points (40% for drought and 90% for control) multiplied by Wt using the following
    equation: (1) The operation time for the water pump was calculated by the water
    shortage divided by the pump flow rate, f using the following equation: (2) Thermometer
    and range finder The IR thermometers and LiDAR sensors were calibrated and corrected
    for the consistency among the multiple sensors. The IR thermometer was calibrated
    at multiple temperatures by attaching four sensors to a horizontal arm of a copy
    stand (402,183, Smith-Victor, Bartiett, IL, USA) and aiming down to the water
    in a glass beaker that was heated by an electric heater. Data were collected at
    six temperatures settings from 21.5 °C to 43.9 °C with approximately 5 °C increment
    with reference temperatures measured by a total emersion thermometer. The IR thermometers
    were run to record 500 readings at each temperature setting. Fig. 7(a) illustrates
    calibration of the four IR thermometers. Linear regression models were extracted
    and applied to obtain the calibrated temperatures of the IR thermometers. The
    LiDAR sensor calibration was performed at multiple distances by attaching two
    LiDAR sensors to a horizontal arm of the copy stand that is vertically adjustable
    up to 107 cm. Data were collected at 16 heights from 30 cm to 105 cm with 5 cm
    increment. 500 readings from the LiDAR sensor were recorded at each height with
    reference distances measured by a tape ruler. Fig. 7(b) illustrates calibration
    of two LiDAR sensors used for dry and wet plants. Calibration coefficients were
    derived from a linear regression model and applied for the correction of sensitivity
    and variation of the LiDAR sensors. Download : Download high-res image (354KB)

    The corrections of the calibrated values of the IR thermometers and LiDAR sensors
    were compared to the uncalibrated values in Fig. 8. The corrected values of the
    IR thermometers remained within ±0.35 °C for all eight sensors except one used
    for camelina genotype 1 of the wet plants in chamber 2 which showed −1.55 °C offset
    (Fig. 8(a)) for which an erroneous sensitivity of the sensor is suspected. The
    performance of the other seven IR thermometers stayed consistent within the manufacture
    accuracy of ±0.5 °C. The corrected values of the LiDAR sensor persisted within
    3.2 cm for all four sensors (Fig. 8(b)) which is within the range of manufacture
    accuracy of ±6 cm. The calibrated values of the temperature and distance sensors

    moisture and irrigation Fig. 9(a) shows the amount of water provided by the water
    pumps based on the soil moisture sensors. Two pots in the dry group had daily
    average water treatments of 4 mL and 15 mL, whereas those in the wet group had
    319 mL and 249 mL in camelina genotype 1 and 2, respectively. There were data
    missing on January 5–7, 2020 in chamber 1 and on December 17–19, 2019 and December
    26, 2019 to January 1, 2020 in chamber 2 due to the accidental disconnection of
    power cables. Fig. 9(b) illustrates soil moisture data from two water treatments
    in chamber 1. The initial large fluctuations in the dry group in Fig. 9(b) were
    caused by the sensor location relative to the irrigation dripper and remedied
    by repositioning the sensor closer to the dripper. Zero soil moisture on Dry1
    during December 23–27 was recorded due to a damaged sensor. Soil moisture was
    expressed in percentage water holding capacity that was converted from a full
    range of calibrated digital readings of the sensor (Table 3). Two pots in the
    dry treatment showed soil moisture in daily average of 63% and 51%, whereas those
    in the wet treatment showed 70% and 72% in camelina genotype 1 and 2, respectively.
    Daily average of soil moisture in chamber 2 under the heat (35 °C) stress reached
    47% and 40% in the dry treatment and 71% and 68% in the wet treatment in genotype
    1 and 2, respectively. These ranges were not exactly matching to the predefined
    set points of 40% and 90% but represented separation of the drought (dry treatment)
    from the control (wet treatment) with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the average
    daily soil moisture indicating that soil water status was significantly different
    between the irrigated and dry plants in both genotype 1 (F1,62 = 15.97, p < .0005)
    and genotype 2 (F1,66 = 3.99, p < .0005). The result indicated that automated
    irrigation successfully produced two different water treatments and effectively
    created drought environment that was used in plant phenotyping for drought resistance.

    responses of the irrigated and dry plants in chamber 2. All measurements show
    the same trend of higher canopy temperatures up to 1.49 °C in the dry plants than
    those in the wet plants (Fig. 10(a)). When plants undergo water stress, their
    stomata begin to close and cease to transpire, causing the canopy temperature
    to rise. Camelina genotype 1 showed 1.32 °C lower than genotype 2 under high temperature
    stress. ANOVA test of the average daily plant temperature showed that the canopy
    temperature was significantly different between camelina genotypes under combination
    of heat and drought (HD) stress (F1,36 = 30.36, p < .0005). Similar results were
    obtained under the individual stress of heat (H) and drought (D). The results
    of lower canopy temperature indicated that camelina genotype 1 has tolerance responses
    under H, D, and HD conditions (Fig. 10(b)). Download : Download high-res image

    camelina genotypes showing lower canopy temperature in genotype 1 under heat (H),

    the height of the wet plant was gradually increased up to 79 cm until December
    23 and became decreasing to 40 cm and fluctuating from 48 to 67 cm, whereas the
    dry plant remained relatively constant at 40–50 cm (Fig. 11(a)). The plant height
    in chamber 2 showed 51 ± 2.4 cm and 38 ± 1.9 cm for the dry and irrigated plants,
    respectively. This adverse response of the plant height was caused by tall thin
    camelina plants leaning out of the sensor''s FOV. The plant height differences
    between camelina genotypes were measured manually for four treatment groups showing
    that genotype 1 is taller under all three stress conditions than genotype 2 (Fig.
    11(b)). The result indicated that camelina genotype 1 grows in lower canopy temperature
    (i.e., more leaf transpiration) and taller and has superior resistance to heat
    and drought stress. Download : Download high-res image (284KB) Download : Download

    vegetation and leaf area Fig. 12 illustrates the phenotypic responses of plant
    vegetation and leaf area measured by the multispectral camera. Plant vegetation
    of all four groups remained greenish at NDVI = 0.7 during the first three weeks
    and decreased to 0.5 except Dry2 group that stayed below 0.6 (Fig. 12(a)). The
    result indicated camelina genotype 1 grew healthier than genotype 2 in the drought
    condition, whereas NDVI in chamber 2 under the heat (35 °C) stress remained close
    (e.g., NDVI = 0.01 or less) between two genotypes. Canopy coverage gradually decreased
    from approximately 40% to 10% (Fig. 12(b)). The irregular increase and decrease
    in Wet1 and Wet2 groups during December 16–20 were caused by manual adjustment
    to keep the plants upright as they became tall and leaning out of the camera''s
    FOV. With the consideration of data from December 20, the result showed more leaf
    areas in camelina genotype 1 than those in genotype 2 in both chambers, indicating
    that camelina genotype 1 has superior performance than genotype 2 in H, D, and
    HD resistance. Download : Download high-res image (329KB) Download : Download

    stress. Discussion The soil moisture sensors responded continuously to moisture
    conditions and should be carefully calibrated with target plants to correctly
    map readings from dry to soaked soil to 0% to 100% soil moisture. As the sensitivity
    of the sensor varies on density of soil contact, a consistent method of sensor
    installation is highly recommended to avoid measurement errors caused by loose
    soil contact. The IR thermometers performed well with stable readings and corrected
    values from the calibration stayed within the manufacture accuracy. The mini LiDAR
    sensor had consistent accuracy within 3.2 cm from the sensor calibration but showed
    measurement errors caused by tall thin camelina plants leaning out of the sensor''s
    narrow FOV of 2°. Thus, it is recommended to use the sensor on the plant with
    broad leaves for accurate height measurement. The performance of the HTP system
    developed in this study is compared with prior studies which were either irrigation
    [[28], [29], [47]], or phenotyping [[35], [36], [37], [48]] not integrating both
    nor fully deploying open-source hardware and software packages. Prior studies
    of RPi-based phenotyping [41,2,42] were limited to an imaging tool using a color
    camera only, whereas the system developed in this study is featured with tri-metric
    phenotyping metrics: canopy temperature, plant height, vegetation/leaf area indexes
    from a multispectral camera. Granier et al. [1] discussed image-based phenotyping
    of plant responses to soil water deficit in a growth chamber but using a color
    camera only without open-source packages. The HTP system performs characterizing
    phenotypes of plant traits but needs to be coupled with a variable rate irrigation
    system in a growth chamber to simulate the drought stress by controlling the amount
    of water to plants. The great value of the system lies in the use of open-source
    hardware and software packages as well as multispectral image (MSI)-based plant
    phenotyping that can maximize the difference of spectral signature of the plants
    in visible and near-infrared bands through image analytics software [49]. Using
    PWM signals from the Arduino allowed the simplicity of the MSI camera trigger.
    Conclusions Current application provided a cost-effective HTP system for plant
    phenotyping and irrigation control using open-source hardware and software packages.
    The proposed system achieved the aim of remote monitoring of plant phenotypes
    using Arduino-RPi and image analytics, integration of irrigation controller for
    water management, and identifying phenotypic responses to abiotic stress. The
    system design was detailed for the seamless integration of sensors and actuators
    with sensor calibration and power management for the accuracy and reliability
    of the system. The system was able to phenotypically differentiate two camelina
    genotypes based on their canopy temperature and height as well as vegetation and
    leaf area. The open-source sensor integration offers a real potential for the
    applied plant scientists to achieve on plant breeding and physiological assessment
    at cost-effective design of an automated control and monitoring system. The total
    cost of the system for each growth chamber was USD 874, and its weight was only
    1.7 kg. With cost-effective, portable, and energy-efficient features, this system
    can be easily adopted for other sensing and control applications such as in greenhouses,
    vertical farms, or outdoor fields. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is a basic necessity for all the life forms on Earth [1], [2]. It is well known
    that water is the main reason behind Earth being the only living planet. It is
    impossible for any living being to live without water [3], [4]. Without water,
    a plant cannot perform its essential photosynthesis. It is understandable that
    if the problem of water scarcity continues to increase, it will remove the greenery
    in the future. As a result of which, there will be less rainfall. Water is also
    essential for agricultural production and food security [5]–[7]. Technology has
    always served to overcome such problems and to make lives easy with its innovations.
    Here through this study one such solution is introduced, named ‘lOT based Soil
    Management System,’ a model for controlling irrigation that uses IoTto sense soil
    moisture with temperature and humidity of the surroundings with a microcontroller
    to make an intelligent irrigation system to help millions of farmers and University
    gardeners [8], [9]. Soil moisture is critical to plant growth, and maintaining
    the right amount of moisture can help plants grow faster and produce better yields.
    An efficient soil moisture management system can help conserve water by reducing
    the water needed for irrigation [10], [11]. A soil moisture management system
    can help reduce water usage and lead to cost savings of water bills and other
    expenses. By managing soil moisture levels, it helps to maintain soil health and
    reduce erosion, which is essential for sustainable agriculture [12]–[14]. Farmers
    and growers can proactively avoid drought conditions and other weather-related
    risks that can harm crops by monitoring soil moisture levels [15]–[17]. To evaluate
    the link between soil moisture readings acquired from soil moisture sensors and
    the gravimetric approach, a study was conducted at the Water Technology Centre
    farm (WTC) at Hyderabad based college [18]. In 2021, Fengfei et al.''s Portable
    PHS Method for Moisture in the Soil Monitoring Based on Thermal Effect is implemented.
    The results were compared to those obtained using the drying procedure, confirming
    the practicality of the suggested method [19]. In 2019, G. S. Swileam et al. assessed
    soil heterogeneity utilising electrical resistance for typical alluvial soils
    in Egypt [20]. In 2018 smith et aI., proposed a system for efficiently maintaining
    optimal soil moisture levels for crops using various traditional soil management
    systems [21]. Gupta et al. (2020) analyze whether rooftop harvesting of rainwater
    and outline bunding enhances the moisture in the soil. Their effects on yields
    of crops, availability of water, and soil moisture management are examined [22].
    Contour plowing, terracing, and checking dams in arid environments are the main
    focus of this study by Patel et al. It assesses their ability to reduce soil moisture
    evaporation and increase water retention [23]. To measure the soil moisture content,
    humidity, and temperature using Raspberry Pi Pico and other sensors to minimize
    the over-watering and under-watering of plants. This paper deals with multiple
    sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil
    & surrounding of the University plants, analyze them, display the measurements
    on the webpage, and automatically water the plants when required by connecting
    them to a water pump. IoT-based soil management systems can collect real-time
    data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.
    This enables farmers and growers of the university to make data-driven decisions
    and respond quickly to changes in soil moisture levels. Farmers and growers can
    remotely monitor soil moisture levels and other factors with this system. This
    can save time and reduce the need for manual labor in the field. The curated system
    can automate the irrigation process based on soil moisture levels and other data.
    Intelligent systems can help reduce water waste and improve crop yields. IoT -based
    soil management systems can be easily scaled to accommodate more significant areas
    of farmland or garden spaces in universities. These innovative systems are also
    suitable for large-scale agricultural operations and smaller-scale applications.
    SECTION II. Proposed Work This IoT -based system deals with multiple sensors/modules
    and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil & surroundings,
    analyze them, display the measurements on the website, and automatically water
    the plants when required by connecting to a water pump. The system uses micro
    python to interface the sensors and modules with the microcontroller Raspberry
    Pi Pico. This project deals with the automatic watering of plants whenever the
    moisture, humidity, and temperature level decreases to a specific standard limit.
    The working of proposed model consists of a soil moisture sensor and a temperature
    humidity sensor, which tracks the soil moisture along with the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. When the measurements exceed the required standard readings,
    the relay directs the motor to pump water to plants. This model will benefit people
    with large patches of gardens, Universities, or those farther from their places.
    The proposed system has advantages in reducing costs, restricting water waste,
    and minimizing physical interference. It also promotes irrigation that requires
    little maintenance and is environmentally friendly. In order to regulate the water
    flow, a relay module has been installed. The model shows expected impacts at various
    levels of humidity and temperature. Figure 1 shows the proposed model of our IoT
    -based system. Fig. 1: Proposed IoT-based system for Soil Moisture management
    system Show All SECTION III. Methedologies Used The Soil Moisture Sensor yields
    real-time data in the form of an analog. Analog to Digital (A/D) and data conditions
    are converted using Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller. The Microcontroller is
    used to acquire real-time soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor. The Thonny
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a cross-platform application that
    supports high-level programming languages like Python. The IDE makes writing code
    and uploading the source program to the board easy. It contains libraries and
    cores. The samples are measured from low to High moisture contents of the soil.
    The gardener can get the processed data through the webpage with the help of Wireless
    Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Technology. This system can give real-time data on soil moisture.
    The Soil moisture system is connected to the web page. We have interfaced the
    soil moisture sensor, DHTII Module, and relay with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure
    the volumetric concentration of water inside the soil and the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. This system uses Raspberry Pi Pico as a microcontroller,
    which is then connected to the Moisture Sensor, which measures the soil''s moisture
    content. Raspberry Pi Pico acts as the central brain of the IoT-based soil moisture
    management system, responsible for data collection, processing, analysis, communication,
    and automated control. It is also linked to DHT -11, the Temperature and Humidity
    sensor, which measures the ambient temperature and humidity. The Pico is also
    connected to the Wi-Fi module ESP-Ol, bridging the divide between the hardware
    and software components of the system shown in fig. 2. The measurements of the
    above sensors and modules and the standard measurements will subsequently be displayed
    for users on our self-designed website using the ESP-Ol. Fig. 2. Schematic Layout
    of our Proposed System Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation & Model Evaluation
    The proposed intelligent system captures data in real-time using a range of sensors
    and modules shown in fig. 5. University gardeners use these sensors to assess
    soil and environmental conditions. The soil management system we built is responsible
    for several duties. It begins by measuring the soil moisture content using a capacitive
    soil moisture sensor and then monitors the humidity and temperature of the surrounding
    environment with a DHTII Module. All plants have a threshold value set to standard
    soil moisture content for home/university gardeners. When the moisture level falls
    below the set standard/threshold level, the relay module turns the Motor On and
    begins pumping water to the plants from the tank until the moisture level returns
    to the desired level. The measurements mentioned above’ readings will be shown
    on a website built with the ESP-OI, which we designed with HTML and CSS and coded
    in Python. Fig. 3 shows the hardware connection of sensors/modules to Raspberry
    Pico and figure 4 depicts the Circuit diagram of the connection of all the sensors,
    modules, and motors. Fig. 3. Hardware connection of sensors/modules to Pico Show
    All Fig. 4. Circuit diagram of our proposed System Show All Fig. 5. Experimental
    model of our proposed System Show All SECTION V. Result Analysis & Validation
    The analysis of the results demonstrates the efficacy of IoT-based watering systems
    in sustaining optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth in the university.
    These systems provide optimal irrigation, water conservation, improved plant health
    and growth, resource efficiency, data-driven insights, remote monitoring and control,
    and flexibility. Using IoT technology, plant owners, farmers, and gardeners can
    achieve precise and effective watering techniques, resulting in healthier and
    more robust plants. The moisture reading experiments conducted at our University
    on different plants and shrubs can provide valuable insights into plant water
    requirements and watering patterns shown in fig. 6. Fig. 6. Soil moisture reading
    experimentation done at our University''s Plants & Shrubs Show All The collected
    data on moisture readings from the different plants and shrubs helps in understanding
    their specific water requirements and watering patterns. This IoT-based system
    enables informed decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling, optimization
    of water management practices, and adjustment of watering parameters based on
    the specific needs of each plant species. The model then starts measuring and
    taking the readings displayed on the Thonny Shell shown in fig. 7. Table I shows
    the soil moisture readings from the capacitive soil moisture sensor & level of
    accuracy of the sensor when compared to the recommended moisture level. Fig. 8
    depicts the soil moisture level and the recommended moisture needed for the plants.
    The relationship between soil moisture levels and the recommended moisture level
    for plants is graphically represented in Figure 8. Individuals can make informed
    decisions to promote healthy plant growth, conserve water, and preserve natural
    and agricultural ecosystems by comprehending this relationship. Gardeners can
    decide when and how much to water their plants by monitoring soil moisture and
    using the specified range. Avoiding under watering and overwatering optimizes
    plant growth and conserves water. Water management influences the ecological balance
    and is essential for plant and animal survival. Fig. 9, the online snapshot showing
    the moisture reading, promotes transparency, engagement, and accessibility, enhancing
    your research''s effect. It supports the study''s findings and contributes to
    broader educational and practical applications, promoting sustainable water management
    and nurturing collaboration within the scientific community. Fig. 7:. Thonny Shell

    to significantly benefit gardeners and farmers of the university by reducing labor,
    saving time, and increasing crop yields while minimizing damage. Furthermore,
    the system''s capability to conserve water and resources contributes to a more
    sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to agriculture. However, this
    research highlights the importance and effectiveness of IoT -based soil moisture
    management systems in precision agriculture. It showcases the potential for using
    advanced technologies to optimize crop growth, improve water management practices,
    and create a more sustainable future. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bengaluru, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Climate change introduces us to many problems and the challenge is intensified
    by agriculture''s extreme vulnerability to climate change. Climate change is already
    having a negative impact, with rising temperatures, increased weather variability,
    shifting ecosystem boundaries, invasive crops and pests, and more frequent extreme
    weather events. The solution for such a problem is a controlled environment such
    as a greenhouse, also called a glasshouse, which is a building designed for the
    protection of tender or out-of-season plants against excessive cold or heat. Maintenance
    and working in the greenhouse are tough as the knowledge of multiple parameters
    such as Electric Conductivity (EC), pH, light intensity, humidity, moisture, and
    temperature is required. This procedure simplified the problem of obtaining the
    reading and the steps required to preserve the plants in a controlled environment.
    Here, drip irrigation is automated to water the plants in a regulated manner on
    a regular basis. Also, it aims to maintain pH and EC using water, by adding fertilizer
    and salt to control pH and EC [1]. Install automated light bulbs and curtains
    to control the light received by the plants in a regulated manner based on the
    plant''s requirements. For example, Gerbera is commercially propagated through
    the division of clumps (suckers). Tissue-cultured plants, on the other hand, can
    be used for commercial flower production. Day temperature of 22- 300C and night
    temperature of 120C to 160C is ideal for growth and flower production. An adequate
    amount of shade net (50%) must be provided to regulate excess light and temperature.
    Humidity should be maintained at 60% Farmers need frequent visits to their farms
    for tasks like watering and fertilizing, which can be costly and time-consuming.
    As agricultural lands grow, remote monitoring and management systems are becoming
    more prevalent. However, weak or inadequate internet connectivity can hinder remote
    farm monitoring and control. The Internet of Things is typically used in agriculture
    through a monitoring network with numerous sensor nodes. Using edge computing,
    which distributes the cloud server burden and reduces wait times, could help address
    this issue. Edge computing applications include pest identification, product safety
    tracking, autonomous equipmentuse, promoting agricultural technology, and intelligent
    management [2]. The paper is divided into 6 sections. Section 1, consists of an
    introduction and motivation. In section 2, a detailed literature review is presented.
    Section 3 consists of the system overview which includes information about the
    slave unit, master unit, methodology, and block diagrams. Section 4 is all about
    hardware and software implementation with all flowcharts. Section 5 explains about
    Results. In Section 6, the conclusion is mentioned. SECTION II. Related Work Greenhouses
    are structures, either with frames or inflated, that are covered with transparent
    materials. They are designed to provide a suitable environment for plant growth,
    allowing for optimal growth and productivity by controlling environmental-mental
    conditions to a partial or full extent. This section includes research done in
    Smart Greenhouse monitoring Systems and EDGE Computing. An automatic irrigation
    system using edge nodes has beenproposed that is unaffected by communication delay
    and disconnection [3]. The Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B were evaluated
    as edge node candidates andthe Jetson Nano was found to perform better at hightemperatures.
    The system can be used to evaluate AImodels and determine water stress for crop
    cultivation. It is currently used for high sugar tomato cultivation in Japan with
    manual parameter management. An Intelligent IoT-based Automated Irrigation system
    has been developed that captures sensor data on soil moisture and temperature.
    The data is communicated to a Raspberry Pi3 control unit where a KNN machine learning
    algorithmis used for analysis and irrigation prediction. The system is developed
    using cheap embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino Uno [4]. A wireless
    sensor network is used to gather data for the prediction of energy and water requirements
    for maintaining a greenhouse''s climate [5]. The input data from sensors is processed
    using fuzzy logic methods to produce output data. The greenhouse is managed and
    monitored through an Android-based user interface. The paper [6] presents a system
    architecture that integrates artificial intelligence at the local network layer
    for smart agriculture and farming applications. Edge and Fog computing, as well
    as LPWAN technology, are used to extend functionality and solve the low-bandwidth
    transmission challenge of LPWAN technologies. The system includes a sensor node,
    an Edge gateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user
    terminal application. The article in [7], discusses the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture and the challenges of integrating this technology
    with traditional farming practices. It lists the available sensors for soil preparation,
    crop status, irrigation, and insect/pest detection, and how this technology helps
    the growers throughout the crop stages. Applying the fuzzy logic method to the
    input data from sensors (temperature and humidity sensors, such as the DHT11)
    has produced the output data. Through an Android-based user interface, the writers
    manage andkeep an eye on the greenhouse [8]. A greenhouse smartphone monitoring
    system has been suggested that combines Eclipse''s Android programming tools and
    Visual Studio''s C++/MFC. The system offers strong cross-platform and secondary
    development portability, enabling real-time data interchange between client software
    and the core module [9]. The article [10] provides a comprehensive overview of
    important technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence used in agriculture
    to inform consumers about the products they consume. The research also sheds light
    on difficulties encountered with tasks like task assignment, data analysis, service
    stability, and privacy protection. Edge AI, also known as local network layer
    artificial intelligence, enables smart farming and agricultural applications using
    edge and fog computing as well as LPWANtechnology for extensive coverage. Moving
    data analyticsand compression close to end devices solves the low-bandwidth transmission
    issue of LPWAN technologies. The system [11], [12] includes a sensor node, an
    Edgegateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user terminal
    application. The article discusses the impact of IoT-based technologies on smart
    agriculture and the potential of wireless sensors. It lists sensors for various
    agricultural applications and explains how they aid farmers throughout the production
    process. The article also highlights modern IoT-based agricultural systems and
    platforms. The article [13] highlights the state-of-the-art IoT-based architectures
    and platforms used in agriculture. The system that forecasts how much water and
    energy willbe needed to keep greenhouse climate factors like soil moisture, relative
    humidity, and temperature stable. Using a wireless sensor network, node packs
    arranged in a star topology are used to gather the data needed for predictions.
    The papers [14], [15] discusses the advantages of advanced wireless sensor networks
    for soil sampling processes, the challenge of maintaining power supply, and the
    potential of ambient energy harvesting as a solution, while also noting the current
    limitations of battery less sensor nodes for extensive environmental monitoring.
    The paper presents a Wireless SensorNetwork prototype with MicaZ nodes for monitoring
    temperature, light, pressure, and humidity in greenhouses, sharing measurement
    data through the Internet of Things for remote control by farmers via mobile phones
    or computers. The paper explores the automation of greenhouse monitoring systems
    using edge nodes, automated plant watering, and sensors to track temperature,
    light, humidity, and soil moisture. It highlights the significance of also monitoring
    soil pH and EC, which can be challenging when dealing with multiple plantation
    areas. To address this, a mobile application and a master-slave unit are proposed,
    enabling the owner to manage all parameters remotely and efficiently across different
    greenhouse sections. SECTION III. The System Overview The system consists of both
    hardware and software technologies. The following sections describe the methodology
    and the block diagram of the system. The goal of this Paper is to fully automate
    a greenhouse shown in Fig. 1. There are three parts in the system, 1. Mobile Application.
    2. Slave unit. and 3. Master Unit. The Mobile application is used to set the parameters
    with respect to the plantation area. The Slave units are implemented in the plantation
    area of the greenhouse and used to sense the temperature, light, moisture, pH,
    and salinity using multiple sensors. The sensed data are sent to the master unit
    wirelessly. The data received from the Slave unit is to the master unit. The master
    unit will take appropriate action to control parameters in the greenhouse with
    respect to the data set by the owner through the mobile application. To regulate
    the pH, EC, temperature, and moisture, a separate solution is prepared and kept
    in a tank. The app helps the user (Farmer)to view the greenhouse condition and
    change, control, and setparameters for the plants as required remotely. The app
    also contains default parameters to set for specific plants. Fig. 1. Block Diagram
    of Greenhouse. Show All A. Mobile Application The owner-specified plant''s threshold
    values for temperature, moisture, light, and soil pH are set using a mobileapplication.
    Users must first sign up and log in using the same email. Users can set data in
    2 modes in the application. The first one is done manually using a slider as shown
    in Fig. 2(a), and if the plant owner is unaware of its specifications, they can
    simply choose the plant type as shown in Fig. 2(b). In accordance with the owner''s
    threshold valve, the master unit will take the appropriate action. Fig. 2. (a)
    Login page of app. (b) Manual setting using slider and Plant type selection. Show
    All B. Slave Unit The Slave unit consists of temperature, luminosity, pH, and
    soil EC sensors along with a microcontroller i.e., ESP32 as shown in Fig. 3. The
    sensor node senses the environmental parameters such as temperature, luminosity,
    soil pH, EC, and Moisture inside the greenhouse with the help of DHT11, light,
    pH, and EC (JXBS-3001-EC-RS-I) sensors respectively. The sensed data is sent to
    the Master unit wirelessly. Multiple slave units are deployed at strategic points
    of the greenhouse. The control signals from these different nodes communicate
    with the master unit. Fig. 3. Slave Unit Show All C. Master Unit As shown in Fig.
    4, the proposed system''s master unit consists of a microcontroller (ESP32), solenoid
    valves, and a diaphragm motor. The control signals from the sensor nodes are received
    by the Master unit from the slave unit. The received data from the slave unit
    is stored locally and also transferred to the cloud using ESP32 module and analyzed
    as an edge node. The control signals indicate the conditions prevalent in the
    greenhouse. The control signals are relayed to the microcontroller which processes
    the data and necessary actions such as bringing the temperature down using the
    humidifiers, improving the lighting conditions maintaining using artificial lighting.
    Soil with a pH level below 6.5 is considered acidic and requires the amendment
    of lime, while soil with a pH level above 8.5 is categorized as acidic soil and
    requires the amendment of gypsum which is added to the soil by mixing it with
    water controlled by the solenoid valves. If the EC level of the soil exceeds the
    established threshold, which indicates the presence of saline soil, and the recommended
    solution is leaching to flush out the excess salts. Fig. 4. Master Unit Show All
    SECTION IV. Implementation A. Hardware The system hardware in the slave unit consists
    of Soil EC sensor, pH sensor, Light sensor, DHT11, Moisture sensor and ESP32 module.
    The primary responsibility of the slave unit is to gather and transmit data to
    the master unit about all sensed data. Fig. 5 explains the complete system design
    of slave circuit. The complete design of the master unit circuit is provided in
    Fig. 6. The primary role of the master unit is to regulate the soil''s acidic
    pH, base pH, temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity (EC) using solenoid
    valves. These valves are controlled by the ESP32 microcontroller integrated into
    the master unit. The working of solenoid valves depends on the data sent by slave
    unit to master unit. Master unit controls solenoid valves so that the environment
    is suitable for greenhouse plants. Pumping solution out of tanks for drip irrigation
    is done with a diaphragm motor. Fig. 5. Circuit of Slave Unit Show All Fig. 6.
    Circuit of Master Unit. Show All B. Flowchart This Paper employs software technologies
    to build user-facing applications, and it stores all of the data it has gathered
    on the cloud. A mobile application was created to update the preloaded data and
    configure the threshold parameters for the particular plantation. The user (owner)
    must first register and log in for the same account in order to manually set the
    parameters using the slider and establish a set of settings, particularly for
    the plantation area. The mobile application''s flowchart, as shown in Fig. 7.
    Fig. 8 explains how the slave unit operates. Fig. 7. Mobile Application flow graph
    Show All Fig. 8. Slave unit flow graph Show All The slave unit collects data from
    all sensors and transmits it to the master unit as soon as it receives power.
    Themaster unit flow will be managed in accordance with the data sent, as shown
    in Fig. 9. The water solution value will open and the motors will pump to maintain
    the soil''s moisture levelif the moisture value falls below the threshold value.
    Then, if the temperature data exceeds the threshold, sprinklers are utilized to
    maintain the temperature. Fig. 9. Master unit flow graph Show All Acid solution
    is used when the pH value exceeds the threshold. Base solution is used when the
    pH value is below the threshold. A motor will pump solutions to keep the pH of
    the soil stable. Then, with the aid of lights, intensity is adjusted by comparing
    light intensity with the threshold value. SECTION V. Results As a case study,
    the Gerbera plants are chosen for implementing and testing the proposed work in
    real-time. Table I represents the ideal environmental conditions for the growth
    of the Gerbera plant. The outcomes of the work are presented in the subsequent
    sections. Table II shows the greenhouse monitoring system can deviate from ideal
    values for optimal plant growth conditions. However, after deployment and operation,
    these parameters are effectively controlled and regulated, resulting in improved

    primary contribution is focused on maintaining the soil pH within the desired
    range. Users have the ability to set all relevant parameters using a mobile application.
    Additionally, all processing tasks carried out by the master unit are efficiently
    performed through edge computing. This ensures effective soil pH regulation and
    simplifies the greenhouse management process for users. Smart greenhouse monitoring
    using edge computing was tested in real time at Akshaya nursery near Gulur. As
    part of the proposed work, the master unit and slave unit both underwent successful
    design and testing. The master unit has the ability to control all greenhouse
    parameters, enabling thorough management. The data from the slave unit can be
    successfully updated to the cloud system, guaranteeing precise and real-time monitoring
    of the greenhouse environment. Two slave units are used to get the soil and environment
    conditions such as Soil pH, temperature, moisture, and light intensity. A master
    unit is used to control the different solenoid valves to let the different solutions
    flow into the plantation area to maintain the soil pH, moisture and control the
    artificial lighting according to requirements based on edge computing. A mobile
    application that allows users to manually change parameters based on plant type
    has also been developed. For quick and personalized control of greenhouse conditions,
    this app offers a user-friendly interface, with these developments able to automate
    the greenhouse, which improved plant growth and reduced manual labor. Edge computing
    eliminates processing delays in greenhouse automation systems by completing processes
    faster, typically within 3–4 minutes. This local data processing and decision-making
    reduces latency, enhancing efficiency andresponsiveness, allowing timely actions,
    and minimizing delaysin critical processes. Authors Figures References Keywords

    Alam, Malaysia Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is increasingly being applied to agriculture and smart farming. Data becomes
    a more valuable resource as our globe grows more technologically networked. The
    information that farmers receive from their devices may help them make better
    decisions, enabling them to produce more safely and effectively while also adjusting
    to changing conditions more swiftly [1]. Various monitoring, and tracking systems
    have been proposed to increase the efficiency and quality of agricultural products
    [2]. While most of the existing systems focus on industrial agriculture, many
    people would like to set up their own small farms at home to produce organic products
    for daily use. However, due to lack of agricultural knowledge and infrastructure,
    people are usually unable to produce healthy agricultural products at home. One
    use of loT technology in agriculture is the measuring and control system for the
    greenhouse production environment. During the agricultural production process,
    the vital indications of temperature, humidity, and soil are gathered in real-time
    and communicated via wireless networks via M2M (machine to machine) support platforms
    [3]. It aims to collect real-time information about the agricultural production
    environment via the WAP (wireless application protocol), SMS (short messaging
    service), and web patterns so that the terminal may master the data and direct
    production [3]. Malaysia fits the description of a nation with high domestic water
    usage and high yearly rainfall. To collect rainwater for both potable and non-potable
    uses, Malaysia is in a good position [4]. According to experts, rainfall may be
    used as an alternative supply of water, which might reduce water costs [5]. Rainwater
    may be used for several purposes such as watering plants, harvesting rainwater,
    landscaping, outdoor washing, and toilet flushing [5]. Rainwater gathered is only
    suited for non-potable applications because it does not go through thorough filtering
    like local water (i.e., usage that does not require water of drinking quality)
    on the other hand, is not only better for plants but is cheaper, too. Rainwater
    is generally purer than municipal water since it includes less salts, minerals,
    and contaminants. Most gardeners feel that slightly acidic water is beneficial
    for soil health. Rainwater is somewhat acidic (pH 5.6), but municipal water is
    more alkaline (between pH 6-8.5) [6]. SECTION II. Literature Review The existing
    literature offers insights into the potential of harnessing IoT technology for
    efficient water management. In [7]. the author proposed home automation system
    exemplifies the fusion of readily available devices like Raspberry Pi, Arduino
    microcontrollers, and XBee modules, showcasing a cost-effective and energy-efficient
    approach. Notably, this system encompasses a smart drip irrigation solution, employing
    ultrasound sensors and solenoid valves to irrigate plants based on environmental
    conditions such as soil condition and user commands. This innovation, capable
    of remote control through simple notifications, exemplifies the intersection of
    convenience and sustainability. The inclusion of smart drip irrigation as a proof
    of concept further exemplifies the potential applications of the proposed design,
    providing an innovative solution for water conservation in agricultural settings
    and small gardens alike. Based on the test results, the results obtained for the
    growth of plants are very good and the soil moisture is below 60% which causes
    the water pump to turn on and the data is sent to the Blynk application. Vatsala
    Sharma (2020) [8] studied Arduino-based Smart Water Management system further
    accentuates the potential of IoT in resource optimization. Emphasizing the adaptability
    of the methodology, the study’s hardware integration, orchestrated through NodeMCU
    and Arduino IDE, demonstrates wireless control via the Blynk app. This approach’s
    efficiency and sustainability enhancement is evident, signifying its applicability
    to smart cities and beyond. Such strategies, underpinned by global awareness and
    sustainability principles, have the potential to reshape water resource management
    paradigms. The results indicate that this smart water management system can improve
    efficiency and sustainability, contributing to better water resource management
    in smart cities and beyond, provided associated strategies are implemented with
    global awareness for sustainable planning and resource utilization. The proposed
    methodology is adaptable to other water networks, making it a valuable approach
    for enhancing overall system efficiency and sustainability. In the context of
    agricultural practices in Namibia, a team led by Anton Limbo from the University
    of Namibia (2021) [9] has addressed the prevalent issue of manual irrigation operations
    among farmers. Currently, farmers in Namibia manage their irrigation systems manually,
    which results in increased labor demands and the need for consistent attention,
    especially for larger farms. To overcome these challenges and enhance water management
    practices, the team proposes the implementation of a smart irrigation system using
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The objective of this study is to enable
    farmers to efficiently manage irrigation processes based on specific water requirements
    of different crops. By transitioning to automated irrigation, farmers can optimize
    water usage and streamline their operations. The conceptual design of the proposed
    system involves strategically positioned monitoring stations across the field.
    These stations are equipped with soil moisture sensors and water pumps that work
    together to maintain an ideal moisture level in the soil, tailored to the specific
    crop being cultivated. To facilitate data transmission and remote monitoring,
    a GSM module is integrated into the system, allowing data to be sent to a remote
    server. The remote server plays a crucial role in this smart irrigation setup.
    It receives data from the monitoring stations and presents it in a user-friendly
    format to the farmers. SECTION III. Methodology In this project, Figure 1 displays
    a block diagram of the development of IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart Agriculture’s
    Automated Irrigation, which illustrates the entire system from input, the system
    with the process, and finally the system’s output. The integration of inputs such
    as soil moisture sensor, DHT11, ultrasonic sensor, and rainwater sensor with the
    NodeMCU ESP-32 microcontroller. The microcontroller communicates with the Blynk
    server to display real-time data on the Blynk application. It also controls the
    water pump and servo motor for the water tank door. When the soil is dry, the
    water pump activates for irrigation, and when rainwater is detected and the water
    level is low, the automatic door opens. This system enables farmers to monitor
    their crops’ conditions and manage water resources efficiently, enhancing agricultural
    practices through data-driven decisions and automated actions. Fig. 1. Ooverall
    Block Diagram. Show All A. System Design and Component Selection The smart irrigation
    component focuses on efficiently supplying water to the crops based on their specific
    needs. The system utilizes a soil moisture sensor, connected to the NodeMCU ESP-32
    microcontroller, to continuously monitor the soil’s moisture level. When the sensor
    detects dry conditions, indicating that the soil requires water, the microcontroller
    activates the water pump. This enables precise and targeted irrigation, ensuring
    that plants receive the appropriate amount of water to thrive. By avoiding overwatering,
    the smart irrigation system conserves water resources and prevents water wastage.
    The smart water tank component focuses on rainwater harvesting and water level
    management. The rainwater sensor detects the presence of rainwater, triggering
    the automatic door mechanism to open when the water tank level is low. This allows
    for the collection of rainwater and its storage in the tank. On the other hand,
    when the water tank level is high or rainwater is not detected, the automatic
    door remains closed to prevent overflow. This feature ensures optimal utilization
    of rainwater resources and prevents wastage. By combining these two systems, the
    overall monitoring of the agricultural environment is enhanced. The integration
    of additional components, such as the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity
    monitoring, further provides valuable insights into the environmental conditions
    that impact plant growth and crop yield. The component selection process involved
    careful consideration of sensor specifications, microcontroller compatibility,
    and the overall system requirements. Each component was chosen based on its performance,
    accuracy, and suitability for the intended application. By combining the smart
    irrigation system and smart water tank functionalities, the developed system offers
    a comprehensive solution for efficient irrigation practices, effective water management,
    and improved agricultural productivity. B. Software Setup The Arduino IDE is set
    up for NodeMCU development, and the required libraries for the selected sensors
    and actuators are installed. The code is then written to read sensor values from
    the soil moisture sensor, DHT11 sensor, rainwater sensor, and Ultrasonic sensor.
    Based on the sensor readings, logic is implemented to determine the soil moisture
    levels and control the water pump accordingly. Additionally, the code incorporates
    logic to detect rain and control the automatic door mechanism based on the water
    tank level. The Blynk library is integrated to establish communication between
    the NodeMCU and the Blynk application. Blynk virtual pins are configured to display
    and update sensor data on the Blynk application The Blynk application is set up,
    and the user interface is created to display the sensor data and control the system.
    The Blynk virtual pins are linked to the corresponding sensor and actuator data
    from the NodeMCU. This allows the sensor data to be transmitted from the NodeMCU
    to the Blynk application, enabling real-time updates and remote monitoring. Equations
    C. Hardware Materials Figure 2 shows the IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart
    Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation of the hardware setup that underpins the system’s
    functionality. The depicted configuration includes a comprehensive assemblage
    of vital components, each intricately integrated to orchestrate the seamless monitoring
    and management of agricultural parameters. Fig. 2. The Hardware Setup. Show All
    To ensure practicality and ease of experimentation, the setup incorporates a container
    of soil, mimicking an actual agricultural environment. The rectangular box, thoughtfully
    designed to accommodate and organize the interconnected components, enhances portability
    and convenience, enabling easy deployment and monitoring in diverse field conditions.
    By effectively blending the hardware components within the hardware setup, this
    embodiment brings to life the intricate interplay of technology and agriculture.
    Based on Figure 3, NodeMCU ESP-32 serves as the microcontroller in the system.
    It is responsible for controlling and coordinating the various components of the
    smart agriculture monitoring system. The NodeMCU ESP-32 connects to the internet
    and facilitates data transmission between the sensors, actuators, and the Blynk
    application. It runs the code that reads sensor data, controls the water pump
    and automatic door mechanism, and communicates with the Blynk server. Based on
    Figure 4, soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content in the soil. It helps
    determine the soil’s dryness or wetness, enabling the system to automate the irrigation
    process. When the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil is dry which is above
    2000, the system activates the water pump to irrigate the plants. Conversely,
    when the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil is wet which is below 2000,
    the water pump remains off or turns off to avoid overwatering. Based on Figure
    5, DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity levels in the environment. It
    provides valuable information about the climate conditions affecting the plants.
    The DHT11 sensor’s readings are used to monitor the temperature and humidity levels
    in real-time. These readings can be displayed on the Blynk application, allowing
    farmers to monitor and adjust irrigation and other farming practices based on
    the prevailing weather conditions. Based on Figure 6, ultrasonic sensor is used
    to monitor the water level in the water tank. It detects whether the water tank
    is low or high. This information is crucial for rainwater harvesting. When it
    is raining and the water tank level is low, the system opens the automatic door
    to collect rainwater until the water tank level reaches a sufficient level. Conversely,
    if the water tank is already high during rainfall, the automatic door remains
    closed to prevent overflow. Based on Figure 7, water pump is responsible for pumping
    water from the water source, such as a water tank, to the plants for irrigation.
    It is controlled by the NodeMCU based on the readings from the soil moisture sensor.
    When the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil is dry, the water pump is
    turned on to provide water to the plants. This ensures that the plants receive
    adequate moisture for their growth and health. Based on Figure 8, automatic door
    mechanism attached to the smart water tank is used for rainwater harvesting by
    using servo motor sensor. It is controlled by the NodeMCU and the ultrasonic sensor.
    Based on Figure 9, during raining and the water in the tank is low, the system
    opens the automatic door to collect rainwater. The automatic door remains open
    until the water level sensor detects that the water tank is filled to a sufficient
    level which is more than 50% and below 100%. This mechanism prevents rainwater
    wastage and allows efficient utilization of available water resources. Based on
    Figure 10, Blynk application provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring
    the smart agriculture system. It displays real-time data from the DHT11 sensor
    (temperature and humidity), soil moisture sensor (soil condition), ultrasonic
    sensor (water tank level), and the status of the automatic door. Users can view
    the temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water tank level, rainwater existence,
    and the status of the automatic door on their smartphones through the Blynk application.
    This enables remote monitoring and allows farmers to make informed decisions about
    irrigation and farming practices. Fig. 3. NodeMCU ESP-32. Show All Fig. 4. Soil

    using Arduino programming language, which offers a simplified and versatile approach
    for emulating hardware functionality. The code was structured into separate modules
    to simulate each component’s behaviour, ensuring modularity and ease of testing.
    The following steps summarize the code implementation. E. Connection & Wiring
    In the Figure 11 show the connection between all the sensors and actuators in
    the IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation system
    using the NodeMCU ESP-32 microcontroller is illustrated. Each component plays
    a vital role in monitoring the agricultural environment. Fig. 11. Circuit Diagram.
    Show All Each pin connection serves a crucial role in the system’s overall functionality.
    Pin D35 connects to the rainwater sensor, which detects rainwater presence and
    initiates actions to manage water collection. Pin D34 interfaces with the soil
    moisture sensor, continuously monitoring soil moisture levels to trigger irrigation
    as needed. Pin D27 links to a relay module controlling the water pump, allowing
    precise control over irrigation based on soil moisture readings. Pin D14 connects
    to a servo motor responsible for the water tank door mechanism, facilitating rainwater
    collection and preventing overflow. Pin D4 interfaces with the DHT11 sensor, measuring
    temperature and humidity to provide real-time environmental insights. Pin D25
    connects to an ultrasonic sensor, enabling accurate measurement of water levels
    in the tank for efficient resource management. The interactions between components
    are highlighted in this circuit diagram, which also shows how easily sensors and
    actuators were incorporated into the system’s architecture. Each pin connection
    functions as a crucial link in a chain that enables the system to monitor, respond
    to, and optimize agricultural conditions. SECTION IV. Result & Discussion The
    results obtained from the data collection phase provide insights into the system’s
    performance and its ability to monitor various environmental factors in agriculture.
    The recorded soil moisture readings indicate the system’s effectiveness in identifying
    dry and wet soil conditions and appropriately controlling the water pump. The
    temperature and humidity data collected by the DHT11 sensor demonstrate the system’s
    capability to monitor and adjust irrigation practices based on prevailing climatic
    conditions. The water tank level readings indicate the successful operation of
    the automatic door mechanism, ensuring efficient rainwater collection. Additionally,
    the rainwater detection data provides valuable information on the system’s responsiveness
    to rainfall events. 1) Designing User Interface on the Blynk Application. Figure
    12 presents the user interface design on the Blynk application, which allows users
    to monitor the development of IoT-based smart agriculture monitoring systems.
    The Blynk application provides real-time data visualization and interaction capabilities.
    Fig. 12. Blynk Dashboard. Show All It shows that the top part of the user interface
    is the live situation that will happen in the garden in real-time with a delay
    of around 3 seconds. The several boxes show the conditions of the garden consisting
    of air temperature, air humidity, moisture level and rainwater detection and water
    tank door status either close or open. The user interface designed on the Blynk
    application proved to be an effective tool for real-time data visualization and
    monitoring. Users could easily monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and
    the status of the water tank door. The insightful interface allowed for seamless
    interaction and control of the system, enhancing the user experience. 2) The Condition
    of the Soil. TABLE I The Soil Condition Table I presented the results of soil
    moisture, temperature, and humidity readings for 7 days. On 22 / 6 / 23, the soil
    was dry (4095), with a temperature of 32.3 ∘ C and humidity of 49%. On 23/6/23,
    the soil was wet (985), with a temperature of 30.8 ∘ C and humidity of 67%. The
    wet condition continued on 24/6/23 (759) due to rainfall, with a temperature of
    30.4 ∘ C and humidity of 72%. On 25/6/23, the soil became dry again (3896), with
    a temperature of 32.2 ∘ C and humidity of 45%. On 26/6/23, it was wet (587), with
    a temperature of 30.2 ∘ C and humidity of 59%. On 27/6/23, the soil turned dry
    (2965), with a temperature of 33.4 ∘ C and humidity of 42%. Lastly, on 28/6/23,
    it was wet (756), with a temperature of 31.2 ∘ C and humidity of 57%. Notably,
    on 24/6/23, the soil remained wet due to rainfall. When the soil moisture value
    is below than 2000, the soil condition is dry. However, when the soil moisture
    value is above 2000, the soil condition is wet. These readings demonstrate the
    system’s ability to monitor and respond to soil moisture levels, allowing for
    efficient irrigation and water management in agriculture. All the data such as
    soil moisture, temperature, and humidity provide insights into the environmental
    conditions affecting plant growth. The soil moisture readings indicate fluctuations
    between dry and wet conditions, which align with the irrigation control mechanism
    of the system. When the soil is detected as dry, the water pump turns on to provide
    adequate irrigation, and when it is wet, the pump remains off to prevent overwatering.
    These actions aim to optimize water usage based on the soil’s moisture needs,
    ensuring efficient irrigation practices. The temperature and humidity readings
    further enhance the understanding of the environmental conditions influencing
    crop growth, allowing for better decision-making in agricultural management. 3)
    Water Collection using Smart Water Tank Table II shows the water intake and smart
    water tank functionality. It includes the amount of water collected, rainwater
    detection, and the status of the water tank door. TABLE II The Water Tank Mechanism
    The data includes information on the water collected, rainwater detection, and
    the status of the water tank door for different dates. On 22/6/23,51 % of water
    was collected, with no rainwater detected, and the water tank door remained closed.
    Moving to 23/6/23, the water collected decreased to 38 %, with no rainwater detected,
    and the water tank door continued to remain closed. On 24/6/23, the water collected
    increased to 59 %, when rainwater was detected, resulting in the opening of the
    water tank door. On 25/6/23, the water collected increased to 59%, when rainwater
    was detected, resulting in the opening of the water tank door. On 25/6/23, the
    water collected remained at 59%, but no rainwater was detected, so the water tank
    door remained closed. On 26/6/23, the water collected decreased to 40%, with no
    rainwater detected, and the water tank door closed. The same pattern continued
    on 27/6/23, with 40% water collected and no rainwater detected, resulting in the
    water tank door remaining closed. Lastly, on 28/6/23, the water collected further
    decreased to 28%, with no rainwater detected, and the water tank door remained
    closed. These observations demonstrate the effectiveness of the IoT-Based Smart
    Agriculture Monitoring System in accurately detecting rainwater and managing the
    water tank door accordingly, allowing for efficient rainwater collection and preventing
    overflow. 4) Product Comparison TABLE III Product Comparison To assess the system’s
    competitiveness and uniqueness, a comparison was conducted against some of the
    ready market products. Table III presented the capabilities and features related
    to soil moisture sensing and irrigation control. The IoT-Based System for Monitoring
    Smart Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation system outperformed the market products
    by integrating additional functionalities such as temperature and humidity monitoring,
    real-time data visualization through the Blynk Application, and automatic rainwater
    harvesting. Based on Table III, the available product A offers limited functionality,
    consisting of a soil moisture sensor to detect soil conditions and a battery-operated
    water pump for basic irrigation. Although this product may have a lower price
    point, it lacks comprehensive monitoring capabilities and sustainable water management
    features. In contrast, the IoT- based system integrates multiple sensors, including
    soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainwater detection, providing farmers
    with a holistic view of their crop’s environment. This comprehensive approach
    allows for better crop health assessment and precise irrigation control, leading
    to improved crop productivity. Based on Table III, product B boasts an advanced
    watering mechanism, offering programmable settings and water pipe connectivity
    for specific plants. Also, the product provides a setting that could help users
    step up the irrigation schedule. However, this enhanced functionality comes at
    a higher cost, potentially limiting accessibility for some farmers. In comparison,
    the IoT-based system achieves a balance between advanced functionality and costeffectiveness.
    Through the utilization of affordable components, optimized resource usage, and
    rainwater harvesting, the system provides farmers with a sustainable and cost-efficient
    solution for smart agriculture practices. In evaluating the communication capabilities
    of the three systems, a pronounced distinction becomes evident in Table III. IoT-based
    smart agriculture monitoring system, utilizing the NodeMCU ESP-32 with its inherent
    WiFi communication protocol, enjoys a notable advantage, enabling seamless data
    exchange between components akin to a cohesive team with effective communication.
    This facilitates real-time data transmission from sensors to the central control
    unit and your smartphone via the Blynk app, ensuring both efficient operation
    and instant field insights. In contrast, the other two ready market products lack
    this sophisticated communication protocol, limiting their individual functions
    without holistic coordination. This comparison highlights the enhanced effectiveness
    of the system in data collection, sharing, and responsive action, showcasing its
    superior intelligence and connectivity compared to alternatives, thereby exemplifying
    the innovation brought about by IoT integration in modem agriculture practices.
    Both ready market products lack real-time data insights for informed decision-making.
    In contrast, the IoT-based system empowers farmers with data-driven decision-making
    capabilities. The Blynk application displays real-time information about soil
    condition, water levels, and weather, enabling farmers to make timely and informed
    choices regarding irrigation and crop management. This real-time monitoring feature
    enhances the system’s efficiency, ensuring optimal water usage and resource management.
    SECTION V. Conclusion The development of the IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart
    Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation using the NodeMCU ESP-32 microcontroller has
    resulted in a successful and efficient solution for smart agriculture. The system,
    equipped with various sensors including soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and rainwater detection, along with the integration of the Blynk application,
    provides real-time monitoring of crucial agricultural parameters. The system’s
    automatic door mechanism for water tank management ensures optimal water collection
    during low levels and prevents overflow during high levels. The study achievements
    highlight the potential of IoT-based solutions in improving resource management,
    enhancing agricultural practices, and ultimately contributing to sustainable and
    efficient farming operations. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors are grateful for the

  description: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture has
    the potential to revolutionize the industry, making it more efficient, sustainable,
    and productive. AI can be used to analyze data from various sources, such as satellite
    imagery, drones, and sensors, to provide farmers with valuable insights. It helps
    in optimizing irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application by identifying
    areas of the field that require attention. AI algorithms can also predict crop
    yield, disease outbreaks, and recommend optimal planting and harvesting times.
    AI-powered systems can monitor crops and livestock through computer vision techniques
    and sensor data analysis. This enables early detection of plant diseases, nutrient
    deficiencies, or pest infestations. Livestock monitoring can include facial recognition
    to identify individual animals, behavior analysis to detect signs of illness or
    distress, and automated feeding systems. In developing countries like India, the
    rapid spread of mobile internet technology is offering a vital role in economic
    growth, social empowerment, and grass roots creativity. Every harvested crop needs
    to be transported. Transportation is one of the important factors for a farmer’s
    success. Transport that is well-managed is effective in transporting farm resources
    and harvested products as quickly as possible. So we are going to develop an android
    application for farmers and transport service providers. By this, we can pool
    the farmers according to their requirements.

    communication 1. Introduction Crops are essential for human life because they
    provide food, animal feed, fuel, and raw materials for clothing and shelter. Crop
    yield has to be doubled in 2050 compared to 2009 in order to meet the demand of
    a growing population while increasing the food quality and reducing production
    inputs (Fukase and Martin, 2020). Potential solutions to enhance global food security
    include closing crop yield gaps, reducing food waste, changing dietary habits,
    and reducing inefficiencies in resource use (Foley et al., 2011). Reducing inefficiencies
    in input resources (such as water and nitrogen) can be achieved by continuously
    monitoring crops, soil, and microclimate, and then properly controlling inputs
    without sacrificing the yield and quality of the crop. Internet of Things (IoT)
    becomes a key technology that enables continuous monitoring and control in this
    scenario. The ability to generate (near) real-time quantitative data with high
    spatiotemporal resolution is a major advantage of IoT systems (Liao et al., 2017).
    IoTs are considered big data systems due to volumes, velocities, and varieties
    of data they generate. These data are mined and modeled to elucidate the relationships
    between inputs and outputs (Tsai et al., 2014). Correlation, trend analysis, classification,
    and numerical prediction are implemented on the data to reach meaningful control
    decisions. Compared with the conventional wireless sensor networks, the holistic
    approach of IoT technology allows users to incorporate data analytics on the big
    data collected by IoT sensor devices. Generally, connected actuators are enabled
    to control the inputs to achieve desired application rates. For example, an internet-connected
    soil water content (SWC) sensor network measures the plant water deficit and uploads
    data to a cloud-based data analysis platform. The analysis will find the trend
    of soil water deficit to determine the best time and quantity to apply irrigation
    water. There has been a boom in IoT application development in agriculture (Ag-IoT)
    in the last two decades, particularly around crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.
    However, the application of Ag-IoT at the commercial scale is still at its early
    stages. A deeper and more holistic understanding of the existing IoT system development
    is important for various stakeholders to sketch the future landscape of Ag-IoT.
    Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the key components of
    Ag-IoT including sensors, actuators, data processing, and data transmission, summarize
    its usage in crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring, and identify the research
    needs for successful IoT implementation in the future. Though Ag-IoT is proliferating
    in both crop and animal monitoring and management, Ag-IoT for crop production
    is the focus of this paper. IoT platforms for livestock production, as well as
    other sectors of agriculture (such as postharvest) are not included. IoT can be
    found in the manufacturing industry, consumers products, retail, finance and marketing,
    healthcare, transportation and logistics, smart city, military applications and
    supply chains (Islam et al., 2022). Fig. 1 shows the three main layers of a generic
    IoT architecture: the perception layer, network layer, and application layer (Jabraeil
    Jamali et al., 2020). The perception layer consists of gateways, mobile devices,
    sensors, actuators, power, and energy storage components. Activities in the perception
    layer include sensing, controlling, actuation, energy harvesting, energy storage,
    data transmission, and power management. The perception layer of the Ag-IoT faces
    challenges including harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneity of the applications,
    nonavailability of communication infrastructure, and lack of continuous power
    supplies, to just mention a few. This review therefore emphasizes the perception
    layer of Ag-IoT. The network layer consists of network devices and data transmission
    and processing functions. The application layer is responsible for user-specific
    applications such as data visualization, actuator control dashboards, as well
    as data storage, analysis, and decision making. This three-layer architecture
    of IoT can be expanded to five layers by including transport layer after network
    layer and adding business layer after the application layer (Banu, 2018). The
    transport layer is responsible for data transmission while the business layer
    manages the whole IoT system according to the user''s business model. Download

    Three- and five-layer architectures of generic IoT systems. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The method of the literature review is presented in Section
    two. Section three details the major elements of Ag-IoT technology. Section four
    describes the challenges that Ag-IoT systems face with emerging solutions. In
    Section five, supporting technologies for Ag-IoT are discussed. How the information
    from Ag-IoT can benefit farm systems analysis and management is discussed in Section
    six. The final section concludes the review article with future research directions.
    2. Review methodology We have come up with a list of eleven research questions
    to guide the literature review and analysis in Ag-IoT. These questions, along
    with the motivation to ask these questions and our initial hypotheses, are listed

    Ag-IoT systems are more popular with perennial crops To find the answers to questions
    in Table 1, a thorough literature review was conducted. The main approach was
    to find the answers based on the recent research carried out in the field of Ag-IoT.
    We have searched for the recent Ag-IoT research published in scientific journals
    and conference proceedings between 2011 and 2021, using keywords through Google
    Scholar and Scopus web search. Keywords used in the search were Internet of Things,
    IoT, Crop Monitoring, Wireless Sensor Network, Smart Agriculture, and Crop Sensing.
    This search resulted in 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings
    papers. After reading the abstracts, 115 papers were determined to be relevant
    to the topic of Ag-IoT. The selected articles are listed in the Appendix, and
    they were used for in-depth analysis. Research papers selected covered countries
    in all six continents (except for Antarctica, Fig. 2a). Asia presented the largest
    number of papers (Scotford and Miller, 2004), whereas Australia had the smallest
    number of papers. In terms of countries, India (Coleman et al., 2022) and China
    (Chen et al., 2014) had the highest numbers of research outcomes. Fig. 2b presented
    the yearly distribution of the research papers. The number of research papers
    published related to the topic increased over time, with the highest in 2019.
    Demographics of the collected data set provided the answer to question 1 in Table
    1, that Ag-IoT has received global attention. More Ag-IoT research has been completed
    in countries with smallholder farmers such as India and China. The selected papers
    were read carefully and analyzed for the technical specification of the IoT systems,
    including the sensors and actuators in each study, communication technologies
    used, environment the system implemented, and the IoT service provider used. Download

    selected papers by year. 3. Technical review of the state-of-the-art in Ag-IoT
    In Section 3, we have thoroughly reviewed the major components of Ag-IoT. To conduct
    this review systematically, we have divided this section into multiple subsections.
    These subsections are sensors, IoT platforms/main control board, wireless communication
    technology, IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and energy management, and actuators.
    3.1. Sensors Sensors play a major role in Ag-IoT systems because they serve as
    the converter between real-world signals and their digital representations. This
    section begins with an introduction and categorization of sensors used to measure
    crop, soil, and microclimate parameters. General purpose sensors such as temperature
    sensor, light intensity sensor, accelerometers, soil moisture sensor, etc., can
    be integrated into Ag-IoT systems (White, 1987). Table 2 gives sensor categories
    along with sensor measurands and provides some examples found in the literature.

    sensor evapotranspiration, irrigation, variety breeding and yield forecasting
    based on leaf temperature (Yu et al., 2016), sap flow rate estimation (Villalba
    et al., 2017) Proper selection of sensors to an application is essential for IoT
    systems developers as well as for users to best use the sensors. The advancement
    of sensor technologies has a major impact on the popularity of IoT. Low energy
    consumption, compatibility in data transmission between the microcontroller and
    the sensor, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and robustness are major considerations
    to select a sensor for IoT system development. To address research question 2
    in Table 1, we marked and counted the sensors in the 115 research papers reviewed,
    with the total count of each sensor given in Fig. 3. Soil moisture sensors were
    used for the largest number of applications (Ivanova et al., 2016) followed by
    humidity sensors (Hurst et al., 2021) and then air temperature sensors (Haque
    et al., 2021). The reason these sensors were integrated most in Ag-IoT so far
    is likely because of the need for continuous in-situ soil moisture monitoring
    for decision making in irrigated agricultural production. Water scarcity is a
    global issue, and the amount of arable land can be expanded significantly if growers
    can apply water efficiently (Aroca et al., 2018). On the contrary, soil water
    tension measured via soil water potential sensors only appeared in three papers.
    This lower interest in soil water potential sensors is likely due to (1) less
    understanding of the relationship between soil water tension and crop growth,
    (2) less availability of low-cost soil water potential sensors, and (3) the difficulty
    in interfacing the available soil water potential sensors to the IoT platforms.
    Next, we will discuss the Ag-IoT sensors found in the literature according to
    the measurand category it belongs to. Download : Download high-res image (192KB)

    research papers and their frequency. 3.1.1. Acoustic sensors Ultrasound distance
    measurement sensors and microphones are the most common acoustic property measuring
    sensors. Direct use of acoustic measurements is limited in Ag-IoT. Hardwood borer
    identification IoT sensor network is a direct application of microphone used in
    pest detection in forestry (Potamitis et al., 2019). Ultrasonic wind speed and
    direction sensor is an important meteorological sensor used in agriculture to
    estimate evapotranspiration (Kameoka et al., 2017). Compared with the mechanical
    anemometer, an ultrasonic anemometer requires less maintenance due to fewer mechanical
    parts involved. Furthermore, an ultrasonic anemometer can capture sudden changes
    in wind speed and direction very accurately. Acoustic sensors were used indirectly
    to measure biological measurands. Crop canopy height estimation by ultrasound
    sensor is an indirect approach to measure biological parameters (Yuan et al.,
    2018; Elci et al., 2018). IoT-enabled ultrasound distance sensors are widely used
    in irrigation systems to estimate the water volume in tanks, wells and reservoirs,
    and it is an essential sensor for irrigation scheduling in automated irrigation
    systems. Recently ultrasound flow meters replaced the mechanical flow meters due
    to their high accuracy in flow rate measurement with less maintenance. Underwater
    ultrasound scanning is possible for aquatic plant growth monitoring purposes such
    as lotas and seaweed and has a huge potential to determine the harvest stage and
    growth rate monitoring (Kool and Bernard, 2019). Fruit ripeness estimation is
    an interesting example of the indirect use of acoustics in agriculture. Daosawang
    et al. (2020) demonstrated that watermelon ripeness could be estimated by a sound
    generator and receiver. In summary, acoustic sensors advanced in recent years
    while replacing some traditional mechanical Ag-sensors and introducing new applications
    in agriculture. 3.1.2. Biological sensors Above-ground biomass of plant, plant
    height, plant density, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI), count of plant organs
    (leaf, fruit, flower), chlorophyll concentration, sap flow, and stomata conductance
    are useful biological parameters in crop monitoring. Crop yield and the growth
    stage can be estimated from the plant''s mass (biomass). Loadcells are used in
    indoor farming pots to measure the plant weight directly (Long and McCallum, 2015).
    Almost all the field crop biomass estimations have been measured by indirect sensing
    techniques such as biomass-sensitive vegetation indices (VI) or by image processing-based
    techniques. However, both techniques require time-consuming ground truth data
    collection for model calibration. The accuracy of these techniques is subject
    to lighting conditions, sensor type, crop type, model parameters, and training
    data set. Just like crop biomass, many other biological measurands are also estimated
    indirectly. For example, stomata conductance can be quantified through optical
    measurands, and plant height through acoustic sensors. Therefore, most of the
    biological measurands will be discussed as indirect applications under other measurands.
    3.1.3. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors can be categorized into two main types:
    photochemical and electrochemical. Photochemical sensors measure chemical reactions
    or chemicals by their spectral signature, and electrochemical sensors measure
    the electrical properties due to chemical reactions or the presence of chemicals
    (Angkawinitwong and Williams, 2021). Soil pH, soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen
    (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), pH and conductivity of irrigation water,
    and photosynthesis are the parameters that often measured by chemical sensors.
    Knowing the pH of water and soil is important because pH affects the solubility
    of nutrients and therefore plant nutrient uptake and growth. Soil and irrigation
    water pH measurements with IoT-enabled sensors were demonstrated in the literature
    in nine studies. Spatial variability and the dependency of sensor accuracy on
    soil condition are the issues to address to promote them in agriculture (Chen
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). The soil salinity sensor and custom-made nitrate
    sensor were counted only once, which highlighted the difficulty of measuring soil
    chemical properties continuously and in a non-destructive manner. The measurement
    of the real-time nutrient content in the soil, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K) are essential for fertigation. These sensors are still
    at the rudimentary stage (Burton et al., 2018) of development. Real-time soil
    nutrient sensing has a huge potential in future agriculture as nutrient leaching
    and groundwater pollution are serious issues people are facing now. Nitrate sensors
    can be fixed to groundwater pumps to monitor the nitrate status of groundwater,
    or installed in leaching water collectors in fields to get reasonable estimation
    about nitrate leaching (Hooper et al., 2019). Soil salinity can be derived from
    the soil''s electrical conductivity (EC), and it was demonstrated three times
    in the literature. This is a very important parameter to measure as soil salinity
    is one of the main soil degrading factors in irrigated agriculture. None of the
    research in the literature highlighted the importance of using EC sensors in soil
    or irrigation systems to ameliorate the soil salinity build-up due to irrigation.
    CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases attributed to climate change and agriculture
    is considered a major source of their emission. Accounting for the sourcing and
    sinking of CO2 and CH4 from soil and crops is important to understand the budget
    of greenhouse gases in agriculture. Research suggested that elevation of CO2 can
    increase crop yield as well as improve water use efficiency (Hatfield et al.,
    2011). Therefore, it is essential to measure CO2 and CH4. There are two types
    of gas sensors available. Metal oxide gas sensors increase the electric resistance
    of the sensor when it contacts certain gas. Optical gas sensors measure the absorption
    spectra to detect spectral signatures unique to the gas. O2 sensors can be used
    to monitor the crop respiration rate. Electrochemical sensors can be used to estimate
    dissolved oxygen as the increased dissolved oxygen in water can improve the quality
    and the yield of the aquatic plants (Shi et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). Another
    interesting parameter to measure is stomatal conductance. Plant stomatal openings
    regulate the exchange of water vapor and CO2 between a leaf and the surrounding
    atmosphere. So far, no IoT-enabled sensor has been developed to measure this parameter
    even though handheld sensors are available (Lamour et al., 2022). Chemical sensors
    can be used to monitor the quality of fruits during harvesting. As an example,
    IoT-enabled Ethelene gas sensors have a huge potential to use in fruit production
    to identify the best time to initiate harvesting (Esser et al., 2012). Although
    chemical sensors improved rapidly in the past decade, applications developed based
    on them in agriculture are still at an early stage. More research is needed to
    incorporate these sensors with Ag-IoT. 3.1.4. Electric sensors Electric sensors
    play a key role in Ag-IoT as they have been used in many industries for a long
    period. The main principle is to measure the change of electrical properties due
    to physical or chemical changes in plants, soil, and the environment. Some electrical
    parameters are charge, current, potential difference, electric field, resistance
    (or conductance), capacitance, and inductance. Soil moisture sensors via IoT systems
    were the most tested sensor in the literature. As most of the agricultural lands
    face water shortages and climate change has heavily affected the water availability,
    most of the studies attempted to address this requirement. We found that electrical
    resistance, capacitance, and permittivity of bulk soils were used to estimate
    soil volumetric water content (VWC). Furthermore, soil water tension was measured
    by the electrical resistance of gypsum blocks. For better irrigation scheduling,
    both VWC and soil water tension are important: VWC quantifies the amount of water
    in the soil whereas soil water tension is a better indicator of how difficult
    plant roots can extract water from the soil matrix. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors are the other two dominant sensors researchers have tested. There are
    three types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive, and thermal. Crop ET and
    pest or disease forecasting are the potential applications of the air temperature
    and humidity sensing requirements. But 90% of the research just demonstrated the
    capability of plug play these sensors; only 10% of IoT researchers demonstrate
    the capability of using those sensors for a meaningful task like disease forecasting.
    Humidity is an important environmental parameter directly related to ET calculation,
    crop quality, and pest growth forecasting. Sensors can be deployed to measure
    absolute, relative, and specific humidity. For example, the best time to start
    grain harvesting is highly dependent on grain moisture content and if harvested
    without considering the optimal moisture level it may cause extensive post-harvesting
    damage and economic loss (Zoerb et al., 1993). IoT-based ET modeling and irrigation
    scheduling enable low water usage and low irrigation energy consumption. IoT also
    opened the path for non-conventional VWC measurement. Aroca et al. (2018) presented
    the use of RFID to estimate VWC with a received signal strength of the tag with
    R2 > 0.9. A rain sensor based on the electrical conductivity principle was demonstrated
    as an IoT sensor that could detect the start and end of the rain (Andrey Rivas-Sánchez
    et al., 2019). Based on these literature outcomes it can be concluded that electric
    sensors are mature compared to acoustic and chemical sensors and have been used
    in the industry for a long time and have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT.
    3.1.5. Mechanical sensors Mechanical sensors convert a physical parameter of interest
    through a mechanical system to an electrical signal. Parameters such as flow rate,
    acceleration, velocity, direction, orientation, and pressure can be measured by
    mechanical sensors. Examples of IoT-enabled mechanical sensors found in the literature
    include rain gauges, mechanical flow meters, air and liquid pressure meters, and
    anemometers. Rain gauge is important to capture the precipitation accurately to
    determine the timing and quantity of irrigation when combined with soil water
    content sensors and evapotranspiration modeling (Kameoka et al., 2017). Tipping
    bucket rain sensor converts water volume it captures to an electrical signal through
    a simple mechanism. Measuring pressure is important for air, liquid, and soil
    pressure calculation. Air pressure is relevant to measure crop transpiration as
    the opening and closing of plant stomata are partially regulated by vapor pressure
    deficit. Soil compaction can be measured by the pressure sensors inserted into
    the soil, which are useful for measuring the impact of heavy agricultural machinery.
    Irrigation line pressure sensors are critical to monitor the irrigation process
    as the wetting pattern of irrigation systems highly depends on the irrigation
    line pressure. High pressure causes loss of irrigation energy while low pressure
    does not allow maximum irrigation area through sprinklers. Anemometers can be
    used to measure the wind speed which is required for calculating ET and detecting
    high-speed wind that could be hazardous to plants. Gas and liquid flow rate are
    significant parameters for crop, soil, and environmental monitoring. Conventionally
    crop and soil inputs in the liquid or gaseous form, such as water input (including
    rain), leaching water, liquid fertilizer, liquid or gaseous insecticides, are
    measured using flow sensors. Some cash crops or niche crops such as wasabi (Sultana
    and Savage, 1970) and lettuce (Sultana and Savage, 1970) need highly precise environmental
    conditions and flow monitoring sensors are important for meeting those conditions
    in the future if climate change imposes challenges to grow them. Overall mechanical
    sensors play a key role in Ag-IoT systems, but most of the mechanical sensors
    are replaced by non-mechanical sensors due to the fact mechanical sensors need
    frequent maintenance and have long response time. 3.1.6. Optical sensors Optical
    measurands play a key role in modern agriculture. There should be a light source
    and an optical sensor to take the measurements. Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and
    near infrared (NIR) are the main wavelength regions where optical sensors are
    operated. It is important to note that optical sensors appear to have the least
    applications as IoT sensors according to the literature. Typical RGB images were
    used to derive RGB image-based vegetation indexes while multispectral sensors
    were used to derive vegetation indexes such as NDVI and NDRE (red-edge NDVI).
    Most of the optical sensors that generate spectral signatures or images of the
    target produce larger volumes of data and consume a higher amount of power compared
    to other sensors in Fig. 3. This appears to be a significant discouraging factor
    to incorporate these sensors into IoT. Naturally, signals in the visible region
    were used as indicators for many crops and environmental parameters such as maturation
    time, crop quality (Long and McCallum, 2015), crop nutrient requirement, pest
    pressure, as well as water and nutrient level in the soil. Historically people
    used their eyes (only responsive to the visible lights) to evaluate the color
    intensities somewhat qualitatively (e.g., comparing those to standard color cards).
    The introduction of these sensors has significantly improved optical measurements
    of crop and environmental parameters by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) enabling quantitative
    assessments and (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001) extending the spectral regions from
    visible only to UV and NIR. Fruit spectral signature was used to identify defects
    in the fruit that could not be revealed via visible light. NDVI and NDRE were
    used to quantitatively determine crop density as well as the nitrogen and water
    requirements (Scotford and Miller, 2004). We would like to highlight that more
    research is needed to demonstrate the optical measurand use in Ag-IoT as they
    can be used in a wide range of applications in agriculture. 3.1.7. Thermal sensors
    Thermal measurands have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT, and most of them
    are measured indirectly with optical and electrical means; for instance, measuring
    crop canopy temperature with infrared radiometers. In the literature, the frequent
    use of air and soil temperature sensors highlighted their importance in crop ET
    modeling and disease forecasting (Symeonaki et al., 2020). These sensors are cheap
    and readily available as off-the-shelf items and support a wide variety of IoT
    platforms (Mohanraj et al., 2016). Thermal parameters have the potential to indirectly
    measure biological measurands. One such example is the sap flow sensor, which
    was described in one study as a transpiration measuring sensor compatible with
    the IoT system (Villalba et al., 2017). The sensor consisted of a flexible tree
    stem heater and a temperature sensor while the IoT platform calculated sap flow
    based on the applied heat and temperature. This sap flow measurement is proportional
    to transpiration (sap movement in the xylem) and therefore useful in crop ET modeling
    (Villalba et al., 2017). Sap flow monitoring is essential in some crops to understand
    the physiological behavior of plants. Rubber, maple, coconut, and palmyra palm
    sap are the output of the harvest, and in these cases, sap flow monitoring is
    useful to estimate yield, optimize production, and develop high-yielding crop
    varieties. Indirectly measured canopy temperature through infrared radiometers
    estimates the transpiration rate and crop water stress index, which is important
    for water stress detection and irrigation scheduling (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001).
    Identification of pests such as wild boar through thermal measurement is an interesting
    application in agriculture. Furthermore, the temperature is found to affect the
    quality of grapefruits (sugar content) and flowering time of several crops (Pérez-Expósito
    et al., 2017). Temperature sensors can also record the temperature variation in
    plant leaves and flowering buds and give a warning about frosting time (Barker
    et al., 2017). This listing of thermal measurand applications concluded that thermal
    sensors are very important in Ag-IoT and have been demonstrated in the past literature.
    3.2. Sensing platforms and main control board Section 3.2 summarizes the statistics
    of the Ag-IoT sensing platforms and control boards in the literature. The answer
    for Question 3 in Table 1 was derived from Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (196KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main control boards
    of the Ag-IoT systems present in the reviewed papers. 3.2.1. Sensing platforms
    Sensing platforms consist of sensor node including sensors, power supply, energy
    storage, actuators, main control board or the data processing unit, and structural
    components. Structural components determine the sensor node establishment in the
    field. There are two main types of IoT platforms available for crop monitoring.
    Stationery IoT platforms can collect continuous crop data or telemetry data targeting
    a single plant or a group (plot) of plants. The main advantage of stationery IoT
    is the high temporal resolution of the data. Mobile IoT platforms can collect
    data over some areal coverage and with high spatial resolution, but with limited
    temporal resolution. Kumar et al. (2016) presented the development and testing
    of a crop monitoring mobile robot. It is capable of automatically planning the
    path to find crops, recognizing plants using neural networks, applying fertilizer
    timely, and applying water based on the feedback from soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and humidity sensors. 3.2.2. Main control boards The communication and
    data processing hardware for IoT systems reported in the reviewed papers could
    be broadly categorized into three kinds: commercial platforms, custom build, and
    DIY (do-it-yourself) development boards. The commercial platforms are reliable
    but have limited support for integrating different or additional sensors. IPex12
    (Odin Solutions SL, Peru), Particle Electron (Particle Industries, Inc., USA),
    MICAZ (MICAS AG, Germany), IRIS (IRIS IoT Solutions, UK), and Telosb (Advantic
    Sistemas y Servicios S.L., Spain) are commercial IoT systems. In the last decade,
    commercial IoT platforms were still at their development stage, explaining their
    lower use in the reviewed papers. Custom build hardware is designed by researchers
    based on their own requirements. Researchers have the flexibility to decide on
    the number and types of sensors, interfacing connections, microprocessor clock
    speed, IoT node memory capacity, input voltage, and the communication technology
    used in the node. Furthermore, the technical complexities present in developing
    customized sensor interfacing may also discourage researchers from using commercial
    systems. The custom build hardware platforms have high levels of customization
    but require extensive knowledge of embedded system development to design them.
    DIY platforms are IoT nodes designed based on commercially available development
    platforms, including Arduino, EasyPIC v7, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Wapmote. DIY
    development board based IoT systems are popular among researchers because of their
    low cost, high availability, compatibility, and easy programmability. The percentage
    of different hardware platforms used in the reviewed articles is given in Fig.
    4. There were 52 identifiable hardware designs in the list of 115 research. Out
    of them, 29% of the platforms had Arduino only, 8% had Arduino and Raspberry Pi
    hardware jointly, and 2% used Arduino and Arducam hardware together. Ag-IoT research
    was dominated by Arduino-based development systems. Availability, reliability,
    easy programmability, and the option of supporting multiple communication protocols
    made Arduino-based systems popular among Ag-IoT researchers. Raspberry Pi systems
    were demonstrated in 12% of the IoT systems, likely due to their capability of
    capturing images and high computing power compared to Arduino. Selection of the
    IoT platform and the main control board is an important activity in IoT system
    design. The mainboard must support the communication protocols and the power requirement
    (e.g., voltage) of the sensors and actuators. Often voltage and communications
    protocol converters are needed to interface sensors with the main control board.
    Mainboards support three types of digital memories. Volatile memory holds the
    instructions and data of the currently running program until the power is on.
    Volatile memory influences the system''s performance. A larger volatile memory
    is needed for IoT nodes with a large amount of data generated via sensors like
    RGB cameras or spectral sensors. Nonvolatile memory stores data and the program
    when the IoT node power is turned off. The operating system, device identification
    data, and system settings are common data types stored in the nonvolatile memory.
    External nonvolatile memory (e.g., SD cards) can be used to store data or system
    settings, greatly expanding the data storage capability of the Ag-IoT system.
    3.3. Communication technologies and IoT protocols Section 3.3 produces the answers
    to research questions 4 and 5 in Table 1 while discussing findings on the literature
    related to wireless communication technology and IoT protocols. 3.3.1. Wireless
    communication technology Wireless data transmission is a key function of an IoT
    system. To design a successful Ag-IoT system, it is essential to understand the
    radio frequency (RF) contributing factors that impact signal strength, interference,
    system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Also, understanding of pros and
    cons of wireless communication technologies is essential for a better Ag-IoT device
    selection. Received power (Pr) of wireless data transmission in an unobstructed
    line of sight in a radio signal-free area depends on the transmitter power (Pt),
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains (GTX, GRX), the distance between the transmitter
    and the receiver (R), and the wavelength (λ) of the radio. This relationship is
    expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, long wavelength radio signals such as LoRa in 900
    MHz are suitable for long-distance data transmission compared to short wavelength
    signals such as Wi-Fi operated in 2.4–3.2 GHz without changing other variables.
    For long-distance communication, the plane earth loss formula is used to account
    for the curvature of Earth for signal strength (Nadir et al., 2008). Equation
    1 Friis transmission equation (Shaw, 2013). Furthermore, radio signals are subject
    to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These phenomena are illustrated in
    Fig. 5. In open flat agricultural fields, reflection, scattering, and diffraction
    may not occur unless there are large agricultural structures. In hilly areas and
    forests, the effects of wireless signal propagation properties may need special
    attention when placing IoT devices. The Fresnel Zone is the area around the visual
    line-of-sight that radio waves propagate out once they leave the antenna. Blockage
    of Fresnel Zone >40% causes severe signal losses (Tate et al., 2008). Therefore,
    factors such as the height and density of the crop canopies nearby, the presence
    of agricultural structures (e.g., irrigation pivots and storage silos), the locations
    to place IoT nodes, and the antenna height and position are important to account
    for in ensuring the signal transmission quality. In fact, the research on wireless
    communications in rural and agricultural landscapes has raised a lot of interest
    recently (Vuran et al., 2022). The signal quality is also affected by channel
    noise, interference, multipath fading, and attenuation. The success of data transmission
    is measured by a parameter called bit rate error (BRE). Based on the above discussion
    we would like to suggest that it is important to use wireless signal strength
    mapping tools during IoT system installations. Such tools will help to select
    the optimum IoT communication technology (for example, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Mobile Communication)
    suitable for each case, accounting for data transmission rates and signal losses.
    This practice would help farmers to reduce the capital and operational costs involved
    with IoT systems. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download

    In the literature, we found that a wide variety of wireless communication technologies
    were used by the researchers. Out of the 35 studies where communication technology
    was clearly mentioned, 34% used Wi-Fi, 17% were conducted using LoRa, and 14%
    used Zigbee. Also 11% of the studies used ethernet or the wired internet connection.
    Less attention was received for mobile communication technologies such as 4G (3%),
    NB-IoT (3%), and GSM (3%). In some cases, researchers used two or more technologies
    to connect different areas in the fields such as LoRa / Wi-Fi, LoRa / TV white
    space (TVWS), and GSM / Zigbee. According to the findings, Wi-Fi and ethernet
    were common in greenhouses while others were favored in outdoor farming practices.

    Fig. 6. Communication technologies in Ag-IoT applications. 3.3.2. IoT protocols
    IoT protocols are data transmission standards that allow communication between
    the endpoint and services with the internet being the common network. IoT protocols
    are broadly classified into two major groups: IoT data protocols and IoT network
    protocols. The data protocols correspond to the application layer whereas network
    protocols correspond to the perception and network layer in the standard IoT architecture
    (Fig. 1). IoT network protocols create networks of device connections. Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth are such network protocols, and the same term is
    used to represent wireless communication technology. Some common IoT protocols
    are listed in Table 3 with specifications such as frequency, data rate, and range
    (Triantafyllou et al., 2018; Farooq et al., 2019). Table 3. Common IoT Network

    and privacy protection, easy to install and connect, faster data transfers Each
    IoT network protocol/wireless communication technology has its advantages (Table
    3). Bluetooth is a popular short-range wireless communication technology standard
    convenient to create personal area networks. It is possible to use Bluetooth in
    indoor applications such as mobile phone-connected soil water sensors and sensor
    networking in small greenhouses. ZigBee is useful in large indoor growing spaces
    and LoRa is suitable for field crop monitoring senor networks. Cellular technology
    is useful for indoor or outdoor spaces where the network coverage is available.
    Wi-Fi is suitable for both small or large indoor spaces as well as outdoor applications
    where there is infrastructure support available to setup Wi-Fi gateways. Cellular
    and Wi-Fi allow transmitting images, videos, and other larger data files such
    as 3D point cloud data. Bluetooth shares the same advantage but is limited to
    a short distance. Compared to LoRa, Zigbee, and cellular technology, Wi-Fi has
    high reliability in data transmission, but power consumption is high too. All
    these protocols were tested in real crop growing environments (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016; Codeluppi et al., 2020). 3.4. Cloud platforms and service models
    3.4.1. Cloud platforms Cloud is an essential part of any IoT system. IoT devices
    are not useful without cloud connectivity. Data gathered via individual IoT sensors
    become useful when connected with other relevant sensors. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling
    ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
    computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
    that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
    service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance, 2011). Essential expected characteristics
    of a cloud system are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,
    rapid elasticity, and measured service. Out of the 115 papers we reviewed, only
    25 papers discussed cloud platforms in detail. Among them, 28% of the researchers
    used the ThingSpeak cloud platform developed by MATLAB as the service provider,
    12% used Microsoft Azure, and 12% used Ubidots platform. Furthermore, 12% of the
    researchers built themselves a local data server with the required functionality.
    Google-based Firebase had 8% usage. Other cloud platform service providers including
    Amazon Web Services, cloud sense, generic cloud, sensorDB, SEnviro, and Huawei
    Cloud had 4% use each. The percentage distribution of these cloud platforms is

    Public, private, and hybrid cloud In terms of privacy policies, cloud platforms
    can be divided into three major models: 3.4.2.1. Public cloud Services are offered
    over the public internet and available to anyone who needs to purchase them. Third-party
    cloud service providers own and operate the cloud resources such as servers and
    storage in the public cloud model. Users do not need to spend any capital expenditures
    to scale up; applications can be quickly provisioned and terminated; and users
    pay only for what they use. These are the advantages of the public cloud. Amazon
    Web Services and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud services. 3.4.2.2.
    Private cloud A private cloud comprises computing resources used exclusively by
    users from one business or organization therefore hardware must be purchased for
    start-up and maintenance is required. In the private cloud model, infrastructure
    is not shared with users outside the organization. A private cloud can be physically
    placed at a data center owned by the user organization, or it can be hosted by
    a third-party service provider. But the organization has complete control over
    resources and security. 3.4.2.3. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud is a computing environment
    that combines a public and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to
    be shared between them. The organizations determine where to run their applications
    while they control security, compliance, or legal requirements. Some organizations
    use a hybrid cloud model to keep sensitive data in the private cloud whereas frontal
    services and web portals are serviced in the public cloud for scalability. Furthermore,
    the public cloud can act as a supporting system if the data and usage exceeds
    the capacity of the private cloud. 3.4.3. Cloud service model Cloud-based services
    provided to the users can be categorized into three major classes based on the
    hierarchy of the service offered. Typical cloud architecture has nine layers.
    They are from bottom to top in order: network, storage, server, virtualization,
    operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. The next section
    will explain cloud service models in detail with hardware and software layers
    they belong. 3.4.3.1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IaaS was the original
    cloud services model. For IaaS, the cloud service provider will provide the hardware
    and keep it up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration
    are up to the client. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational
    in Microsoft datacenters. The main advantage of the IaaS model is the rapid deployment
    of new computing devices. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure are some
    examples of IaaS. 3.4.3.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) In this cloud service
    model, the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources,
    and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
    For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers
    can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical
    hardware and software requirements. 3.4.3.3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) In the
    case of SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment,
    such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
    The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by
    the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working
    version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. 3.4.3.4. Network-as-a-Service
    (NaaS) Software-defined networking and software-defined perimeters are services
    that belonged to NaaS. NaaS is a cloud model that enables organizations to easily
    operate the network and achieve the outcomes they expect without owning, building,
    or maintaining their infrastructure through the cloud. NaaS can replace hardware-centric
    VPNs, load balancers, firewall appliances, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    connections. Users can scale up and scale down as demand changes, rapidly deploy
    services, and eliminate hardware costs. 3.4.4. Fog and edge computing Edge computing
    is the moving of data processing close to where the data is generated. Wireless
    communication-enabled sensors with microcontrollers can be considered edge computing
    devices. The introduction of the edge computing paradigm was due to issues related
    to centralized cloud computing architecture. Data and control signal transmission
    latency and delays in centralized system data analytics are some disadvantages
    of cloud computing. Therefore, network designers proposed architectures where
    the computing power is distributed more evenly around the network. Fog and edge
    computing push the processing capability out to the edge of the network, closer
    to the source of the data. Such techniques are called fog computing and edge computing.
    Fog computing is a computing layer between the cloud and the edge where edge devices
    send large amounts of data to the cloud. The fog computing layer can get the data
    from the edge layer before it reaches the cloud and filter what is relevant and
    what is not. The filtered data gets stored in the cloud, while the unrelated data
    can be deleted, or analyzed at the fog layer for remote access or to use in localized
    learning models. Precision herbicide applications become popular with field crops.
    There, a moving platform that has a camera, carries and applies the herbicide
    at the exact location of the emerging weed. The image processing hardware and
    software in the moving platform do the image processing instantaneously to reduce
    the delay of cloud-based image processing in larger fields (Coleman et al., 2022).
    The centralized cloud-only needs the weed density from the moving IoT platform
    to forecast the future herbicide need to maintain the required quantity in the
    stocks. Therefore, edge computing is all about placing computing power on the
    very edge of the network, on the actual sensors of the device. Low power consumption
    and low processing power microchips or micro-controllers embedded in the devices
    provide the power for edge computing. For that reason, their processing capacity
    is much more limited but sometimes can be adequate to process images (Chamara
    et al., 2021). 3.4.5. Data analytics in IoT Data analytics is one of the most
    important activities in any IoT system, as the decision-making of an IoT system
    depends on hundreds of sensors and events, which is difficult to analyze manually.
    Data generated by IoT devices fall under three categories. They are structured
    data (such as SQL storage), unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), and semi-structured
    data (like social media feeds). Ag-IoT systems can generate both structured and
    unstructured data (Lea, 2020). Stream processing and batch processing are the
    two main types of data processing techniques. Stream processing is useful for
    mobile Ag-IoT platforms since it allows real-time data processing. Batch processing
    can be applied in irrigation, chemigation, and fertigation applications as data
    are processed as a batch to make the decision. Common data analytics activities
    for IoT platforms are listed in Table 4. Below are some examples how they are
    used in Ag-IoT for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. Alerting allows growers
    to receive an alert message when soil water use exceeds the maximum allowable
    depletion (Gamon et al., 2015). Sensors in the field environment are susceptible
    to problems like physical damage, pest attack, misalignment, and breakdown, which
    cause errors in data streams. These problems can be effectively alleviated by
    error finding. Using time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    or Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to determine the next irrigation or fertigation
    time belongs to trend analysis. Triggering sprinklers in a field based on SWC
    sensor values is an example of signaling. More complex decisions can be formed
    by combining several analytical activities. For example, in automated crop disease
    detection, an average daily temperature above 20 to 25 °C followed by 1–2 in.
    of rain, together with sugar beet leaf color change indicated a sugar beet pathogen
    outbreak (Wolf and Verreet, 2002). This analysis was enabled by data joining,
    tracking, and trend analysis. Table 4. Data analysis activities commonly found
    in Ag-IoT applications. Data analysis activity Function Preprocessing Filter out
    data with little interest to reduce data complexity and duplication Alerting Raise
    an alert if data exceed certain boundary condition Windowing Apply rules on data
    in a predefined time window Joining Combine multiple data streams into a new single
    data stream Error finding Find missing values and anomalies in data streams Tracking
    Identify when or where an event has occurred Trend analysis Quantify change or
    trend of data as a function of time Signaling Send control signal when a decision
    is made 3.5. Power and energy management Power and energy storage are the two
    major driving forces for IoT systems, especially for Ag-IoT located in remote
    fields. In the literature, we found 3 main categories of power management systems.
    Direct main power connected nodes is the first type and most common with indoor
    applications. A rechargeable battery with a recharging option such as solar, hydro,
    or wind is the second option. The third one has a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable
    battery but is designed to consume very low power by sending a very low amount
    of data intermittently. Among the 115 pieces of research we have reviewed, only
    27 of them discussed the IoT system power and energy storage features. Out of
    these 27, 11 platforms used solar power as the main power supply while Lithium
    Polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries were used as the energy storage solution.
    Out of 11 indoor farming applications which explained the power management options,
    9 used the main grid power supply. Research that focused on IoT system setup under
    high dense canopies used high power density and high-capacity battery-only solutions
    such as 12 V lead-acid batteries. Two studies mentioned they used battery with
    solar but did not disclose details about the specifications. It revealed that
    there are very limited power supplies available for in-field IoT implementation
    and the findings are highlighted in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    selection of the Ag-IoT systems in the reviewed studies. Unlike edge-computing
    devices, typical IoT end nodes are designed to be less power-hungry. This power
    consumption goes high due to certain reasons such as connected high throughput
    sensors, significant data processing, and massive data transmission. However,
    these power consumptions can be minimized by exploiting different techniques such
    as the semi-active phase and sleep phase (Zhang and Li, 2019). The edge computing-enabled
    devices need more power. It is essential to standardize the IoT power management
    based on the crop and geographical location of the devices. For example, solar
    power is not a very promising solution for locations with large trees such as
    rubber, pepper, and spices that have a dense crop canopy 5–10 m above the ground
    (Villalba et al., 2017). 3.6. Actuators Monitoring and controlling are two agricultural
    operations closely related to each other. Monitoring by itself is an open-loop
    operation; whereas monitoring, controlling, and again monitoring the effects of
    controlling make a system closed loop and can improve the efficiency of the system.
    Efficient controlling of the actuators based on the monitoring is a key feature
    in the agricultural domain for optimizing inputs, maximizing crop yield and quality,
    and reducing the negative environmental impacts. Fig. 9 depicts the number of
    actuators controlled via IoT systems that were reported in our reviewed papers.
    Out of the 115 studies, 54 mentioned IoT-enabled actuation. Some studies used
    more than one actuator, whereas most of the in-field IoT sensor monitoring systems
    did not mention the use of actuators. Download : Download high-res image (130KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Count of actuators controlled via
    IoT systems found in the reviewed papers. Since water is the largest input by
    volume applied to farms, actuators related to water have been mostly discussed
    in the research work. Such controllers are pumps and solenoid valves. Controlling
    these two actuators were demonstrated in 22 and 8 instances, respectively. After
    irrigation, controlling lighting was the most occurred application in indoor farming
    followed by ventilation, fertigation, alert, and air conditioning. Ventilation
    allows outdoor air to come inside the greenhouse while air conditioning includes
    heating or cooling of the air. Alert meant the system sent an email or message
    to the farmer or the operator of the farm when a parameter exceeded a threshold
    value. An IoT-controlled insect repellent actuator was demonstrated twice among
    the 115 case studies evaluated. Automation of soil bed preparation was achieved
    by utilizing stepper motors in one instance of IoT-based indoor farming. According
    to Figure 9, water pumps and valves were the most frequently used actuators, and
    all these systems were closed loop control systems with soil moisture sensors
    and ET modeling. From the study of the above actuator-related research, it can
    be said that there is enormous potential to automate the controlling of the indoor
    crop''s required environment and soil preparation. (See Fig. 9.) 3.7. Ag-IoT for
    crop monitoring Out of the 115 publications reviewed, 71 systems were demonstrated
    in a real environment. Among them, 65% were implemented in the fields, 24% were
    demonstrated in indoor environments, and 11% were simulations. This is an interesting
    finding that reveals the huge potential of implementing outdoor or in-field IoT
    applications. Typically, it is easy to set up indoor IoT sensor networks due to
    fewer technological barriers, such as extreme environmental conditions and sensor
    connectivity issues. Since real applications were available only in 65% (71 out
    of 115) instances, further real implementations can be done to demonstrate the
    capability of Ag-IoT applications. Considering the 71 systems that demonstrated
    the real applications, 49 were practically demonstrated with certain types of
    crops and 22 did not mention the specific crop they used. 15% of these systems
    were demonstrated with grapes while cereal crops accounted for 26%. One research
    was based on both grapes and oranges. In total 50% of the IoT studies focused
    on perennial specialty crops of higher value including grape, moringa, orange,
    citrus, sugarcane, silver maple, apricot, cashew, and olive (Fig. 10). This result
    indicates that IoT can be implemented with diverse crop types to achieve various
    purposes. Ag-IoT systems are easy to set up on perennial croplands as there is
    less soil preparation for the IoT system installation. It is important to develop
    techniques that allow easy IoT implementation to the annual crops as they contribute
    more to global food security. It is also worth to note only one research demonstrated
    the economic viability of IoT implementation (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, future
    research to assess and understand the economic viability of IoT applications in
    various situations is needed. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download

    crop types. 4. Challenges of Ag-IoT systems and potential solutions Ag-IoT faces
    challenges that are unique compared with IoT applications in other industries.
    In this section, we briefly discuss those challenges that are of utmost importance
    for Ag-IoT system researchers and developers. Ag-IoT challenges can be mainly
    classified into three sections: technical challenges, sectoral challenges, and
    business challenges (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.1. Technical challenges Limitations
    of the advancement of technology are the reasons for technical challenges. They
    would likely be effectively addressed as tools and technologies advance with time.
    The Ag-IoT technical challenges are discussed under the three layers of the IoT
    architecture (Fig. 1), namely, perception layer issues, network layer issues,
    and application layer issues. 4.1.1. Perception layer issues Ag-IoT systems''
    perception layer faces unique challenges, because of the requirements it needs
    to meet during crop and environmental monitoring in harsh environments (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Agricultural lands have limited electricity and communication infrastructure.
    It is not practical or cost-effective to use wired power and communication media
    to connect IoT nodes in the field. Therefore, power management, device longevity,
    and ergonomic design are major challenges related to the Ag-IoT perception layer.
    Power management includes Ag-IoT node-level power generation, strategies to reduce
    power consumption, and energy storage. Section 3.5 Power and Energy Management
    revealed that most of the researchers were interested in solar with rechargeable
    batteries as the power source in agriculture. However, there is a challenge to
    introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under the tall and dense
    crop canopy. Micro wind turbines have the potential as an Ag-IoT power source
    but receive less attention in the literature (Jawad et al., 2017). Continuous
    improvements have been made to rechargeable batteries due to the demand for high
    energy to weight ratio batteries. There are several approaches available to reduce
    power consumption. One approach is to select sensors, actuators, and wireless
    protocols with low energy consumption. Selection of a node duty cycle that turns
    the sensor or actuator on when it reads, sends, or receives signals is another
    viable approach (Estrada-Lopez et al., 2018). Harsh environmental conditions such
    as wind and rainfall, continuous high solar radiation, sub-zero temperatures in
    winter, chemicals commonly used in agriculture, and animal attacks make it difficult
    to keep Ag-IoT nodes in the field in operable conditions for a long time (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Sensors, cables, and enclosures should be designed to withstand
    such conditions. Standards are available to follow in most cases, but the cost
    becomes high when required standards need to be escalated. Analog signals (Analogue
    voltage or current), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), Serial Data Interface at
    1200 baud rate (SDI-12), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
    are the common sensor to microcontroller data transmission techniques. The microcontroller
    development boards and commercial IoT platforms are designed to work with different
    voltage levels, such as 3.3 V, 5 V, 7 V, and 12 V. These different communication
    protocols and operation voltages have created barriers to the interoperability
    of the devices in Ag-IoT implementation. Research and development to standardize
    data communication and power supply in Ag-IoT systems would substantially increase
    the scalability, upgradability, and interoperability in the perception layer.
    Improving ergonomic design and reducing the labor intensiveness for deploying
    Ag-IoT systems in the field are urgently needed. IoT-based soil water content
    monitoring is a good example to show this issue. Often soil sensors are buried
    underground for continuous measurements during a season. These sensor nodes also
    have an aboveground section to allow wireless communication, which could interfere
    with farm operations such as tillage, fertilizer application, and chemical spraying,
    and should be closely monitored. For annual crops, the need to remove the sensors
    when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a significant
    logistic issue for using them effectively. Research on underground wireless communication
    technology (Akyildiz et al., 2009) and Internet of Underground Things (Vuran et
    al., 2018) is ongoing, bearing the promise to alleviate this challenge associated
    with Ag-IoT node installation and maintenance. No standards are currently available
    on Ag-IoT installation as agricultural fields and practices are highly heterogeneous.
    Novel solutions are necessary to encourage Ag-IoT users. 4.1.2. Network layer
    issues The most common Ag-IoT network layer issues are internet coverage, standard
    interception, interference, propagation losses, communication range, wireless
    link quality, network expansion, network management, communication protocols,
    latency, and throughput. As most farms are in rural areas, remote locations, or
    mountain regions, it is a huge challenge to get internet connectivity to them
    since these underpopulated areas have limited internet infrastructure. One solution
    could be creating a local network, a concept similar to a hybrid cloud. This type
    of system does not connect to the internet but still allows local servers to perform
    the basic IoT functionality (Akyildiz et al., 2009). Due to the recent advancement
    in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it would soon be possible to have internet
    connectivity via satellite as illustrated in Fig. 11 on a commercial scale (Ivanova
    et al., 2016). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the future, many agricultural
    fields will rely on satellite-based connectivity to connect their gateways to
    the internet. This system consists of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) type
    ground antenna which is connected to the nodes through multiple gateways. Gateways
    can follow different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, or Zigbee.
    One disadvantage of satellite-based internet connectivity is that it needs a clear
    sky to make a successful connection. Therefore, it is logical to have a local
    server for data storage and decision-making when the connection is interrupted.

    Fig. 11. Future Ag-IoT system with satellite connected internet. Standard interception
    refers to difficulties in using the full potential of a communication technology
    due to standards imposed by regulatory authorities to limit the use. Recent advancements
    on long-range low throughput communication technologies such as LoRa become widely
    known communication protocols in Ag-IoT. To promote fair use of LoRa bandwidth,
    governments can regulate the use of wireless frequencies. For example, in Europe,
    the duty cycle or the transmitter uptime of the LoRa node is between 0.1% to 10%.
    This is a challenge in most Ag-IoT applications as there are higher volumes of
    data to transmit and many sensors and actuators to connect. When many IoT nodes
    are deployed, the interference may occur because the data transmission could use
    the same frequency, especially in unlicensed spectrums, such as ZigBee, Sigfox,
    LoRa, and Wi-Fi. Signal interference causes data loss and reduces the reliability
    of the systems (Elijah et al., 2018). Wireless signal propagation strength, communication
    range, and wireless link quality depend on the humidity, temperature, crop growth
    status, and crop morphological characteristics in agriculture fields (Tzounis
    et al., 2017; Cama-Pinto et al., 2019; Vuran et al., 2022). Thus, wireless signal
    propagation strength simulation and visualization software are essential in the
    future for the mass installation of Ag-IoT sensor nodes. Such software will reduce
    the complexity of node placement issues. 4.1.3. Application layer issues Data
    security, data privacy, and data analysis are application layer issues. Ag-IoT
    data is important for a country''s food security as well as for the Ag business
    model security. In the modern competitive world, data breaching could lead to
    a competitive disadvantage on Ag-business model over a competitor as well as risk
    the food security of a country. Therefore, more focus should be put into improving
    the security and privacy of data generated via Ag-IoT systems. 4.2. Sectoral challenges
    4.2.1. Regulatory issues Data ownership creates another business challenge. Companies
    that provide Ag-IoT services can use the data for improvements in their systems,
    but farmers do not receive compensation for that. There is a challenge to implement
    such a system to prevent data monopoly (Misra et al., 2020). Therefore, regulation
    and legal frameworks about the control and rights of data between farmers and
    IoT companies need to be established (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.2.2. Interoperability
    issue According to Elijah et al. (2018), interoperability involves the ability
    to have technical, synthetic, semantic, and organization interoperability. Technical
    interoperability involves the effortless communication among IoT devices using
    protocols. Data interchanging between systems is semantic interoperability. Synthetic
    interoperability deals with IoT system-generated digital data exchange with humans,
    while organization interoperability involves information sharing among different
    regions, infrastructures, and cultures (Elijah et al., 2018). Here we would like
    to introduce a challenge associated with Ag-IoT system interoperability. As most
    of the farmers have crop rotations and multi-cropping systems, it is essential
    to have Ag-IoT systems with context awareness that allows them to work with different
    cropping systems. The heterogeneity of agricultural systems imposes the system
    interoperability challenge. 4.2.3. Business issues The cost and non-availability
    of skilled personnel in Ag-IoT is a business issue. Cost is a challenge for Ag-IoT
    implementation. There are three types of costs involved with Ag-IoT systems: the
    setup cost or the capital expenditure, running cost or operational cost, and upgrading
    cost. Due to the nature of IoT business models and being a relatively new technology,
    analysis on return on investment of Ag-IoT systems is not yet discussed considerably
    in the literature. Chen et al. (2019) highlighted that application of IoT systems
    on irrigation controlling in turmeric turned out to be profitable. Several factors
    increase capital expenditure. Remote and harsh environmental conditions that Ag-IoT
    systems must bear increase the production cost of Ag-IoT systems. Ag-IoT end nodes
    require materials that do not wear and tear due to sun, rain, and chemicals applied
    during crop cultivation. Communication cost is usually a standard rate, but the
    initial investment is required to set up the internet connection, and this cost
    depends on the infrastructure availability where the farms are located. Theoretical
    knowledge and practical experience about the sensing/actuating system and parameters
    of interest are essential to set up a successful Ag-IoT system. Sensor data interpreters
    need an overall understanding of the agroecological principles to reach a decision
    (Duff et al., 2022). Reluctance to use new technology and unskilled manpower are
    apparent obstacles to implementing Ag-IoT in commercial production crop monitoring
    systems. More extension programs are needed to solve this issue while standards
    are necessary for Ag-IoT system development to improve the common Ag-IoT platforms
    that have interoperable qualities. 5. Supporting technologies 5.1. Augmented reality
    and IoT applications Data visualization and real-time decision-making are important
    to IoT. Based on past literature this sector is the least explored area. Wearable
    augmentation devices improve crop monitoring and control. Smart glasses have the
    real-time data visualization capability to indicate the status of crops, soil,
    or environment (Hurst et al., 2021). An irrigation activity can be controlled
    manually by a farmer if he can visualize the real-time soil water content change
    in the field. The conditions within a greenhouse can be controlled in real-time
    and actuators can be controlled via voice command through a smart glass. Harvesting
    can be more enjoyable and more efficient (lower loss) based on image processing
    capable smart glasses. Vegetable or fruit pickers can be assisted through a smart
    glass by viewing what it detects in the fruit to decide whether to pick it or
    not. Untrained labor usage-related losses can be reduced by augmented reality
    related training. 5.2. Big data Big data generated by Ag-IoT are mostly of heterogeneous
    types. The most common IoT agricultural big data are machine-generated data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). These data are generated from a massive number of sensors and smart
    machines used to measure and record farming processes; which are in turn boosted
    by the IoT. Machine-generated data range from simple sensor records to complex
    computer logs. Big data in agriculture are generated mostly when we introduce
    smart sensing and monitoring with the help of IoT. The main sources of big data
    in Ag-IoT are: sensors, robotics, open data, data captured by airborne sensors
    (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014; Cole et al., 2012), weather/climate data, yield data,
    soil types, agricultural census data (Chen et al., 2014) and so on. Typically,
    telemetry data is generated by sensors such as temperature, rotary, or linear
    encoder. These data are well-structured in contrast to imagery data which need
    post-processing. Such unstructured data have issues in terms of availability,
    quality, and formats (Liu et al., 2015) and can be a concern. As the number of
    sensors is increasing and data volumes are growing rapidly, it is becoming a matter
    of utmost importance to store and process big data. Some approaches to handle
    big data are data shrinking, scale up, scale out, and high-performance computing.
    Data shrinking is the process of throwing away some less important data and still
    being able to reconstruct the original data. Scale-up (vertical scalability) is
    adding additional storage and RAM to store and process the big data in the processing
    node. But this technique has its capacity limit. Scale out (horizontal scalability)
    is the concept of using parallel computers to store and process that big data.
    High-Performance Computing is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to handle
    big data, where computers with multiple cores are grouped to create an efficient
    network to deal with the big data. These techniques are essential for successful
    data handling in Ag-IoT. 5.3. Artificial intelligence in Ag-IoT Techniques that
    enable machines to mimic human behavior are artificial intelligence (AI), while
    a subset of AI that gives machines the ability of learning without being explicitly
    programmed is machine learning. Deep learning techniques are a subset of machine
    learning techniques with multilayer neural network feasibility. The data generated
    from the Ag-IoTs are often used to train machine learning models for specific
    agricultural use cases such as yield forecast, crop stress detection, and pest
    spreading prediction. To be more specific, for the agricultural IoT applications,
    raw sensing information such as field and weather conditions and crop status can
    be collected and used for model training locally or in the remote end that has
    more computational resources. These trained models can later be used to control
    actuators for variable rate irrigation and site-specific pesticide/ herbicide
    applications. Deep learning techniques are heavily used with image processing
    applications in agriculture. Trained deep learning models are available for crop
    type detection (de Filho et al., 2020), plant phenotyping (Pound et al., 2017),
    fruit (Patel et al., 2011), flower (Dias et al., 2018), and leaf detection (Chamara
    et al., 2021), and weed detection for herbicide applications (Coleman et al.,
    2022). AI becomes an integral part of IoT due to its capability of using it as
    a data analytics tool. 6. Ag-IoT for farming systems analyses and management In
    this section, we briefly discuss and envision how Ag-IoT would benefit and potentially
    transform farming systems analyses and management, enabled by its unprecedented
    data, analytics, and connected sensors and actuators. Perhaps the most obvious
    advantages of Ag-IoT come from the high spatiotemporal resolution of farm-level
    data it generates concerning crops, soil, and microclimate (Kagan et al., 2022).
    The high spatial resolution data would quantify the the spatial variability of
    crop parameters (such as yield and leaf area index) and soil parameters (such
    as pH, organic matter, and water holding capacility), and elucidate the relationships
    between them to identify yield-limiting factors at different parts of the field
    (Alfred et al., 2021). This is the underlying principle of site-specific crop
    management, which will be greatly enhanced through Ag-IoT. Modern Ag-IoTs take
    measurements at hourly and sub-hourly intervals. This high temporal resolution
    data allow us to observe the crop responses to environmental cues at finer time
    steps, and enhance our understanding on how basic plant physiological processes
    such as transpiration and photosynthesis vary due to short-term environmental
    fluctuations. Process-based crop and soil models, which are widely used to evaluate
    the economic and environmental consequences of farming practices, usually suffer
    from the lack of site-specific data to parameterize and calibrate them, especially
    the in-season crop data and soil data. These data are exactly what Ag-IoT sensors
    are good at generating, and therefore would improve the accuracy of these models
    for farm-level management assessment. Networked sensors and actuators of Ag-IoT,
    along with the real-time data processing, transmission, and modeling, would greatly
    improve the decision-making cycle of farm-level management practices (Chaterji
    et al., 2021). The traditional crop management decision-making has several limitations.
    First, the decision is usually based on a single set of data, because other datasets
    are unavailable or expensive to obtain. Second, there is usually long latency
    between data generation and decision-making (e.g., several days or weeks). This
    long latency is in contrast to the fact that many stresses in the field (such
    as pest outbreak) occur and develop quickly and need real-time intervention to
    prevent substantial loss. Thirdly, the present management practice only addresses
    one factor at a time whereas in reality crops can undergo multiple stresses simultaneously.
    Altogether, these limitations reflect our inability to capture the complexity
    of the farming system. Ag-IoT has the potential to transform farm-level decision-making
    by enabling multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategies, powered by real-time
    data processing and relevant models run in the cloud to shorten the latency. For
    example, crop, soil, and microclimate sensors can simultaneously measure the crop
    water and nitrogen status, soil moisture content and nitrate content, and weather
    variables. These multi-source inputs can be fed into the models to output two
    variables: a nitrogen sufficiency index and a water sufficiency index. These two
    variables can further be converted to a nitrogen and water application rate for
    site-specific fertigation. This paradigm has several advantages. First, it is
    a multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategy that accounts for the interaction
    between the water and nitrogen stresses. Second, it reduces the cost of implementation
    and shortens the management cycle because two actions are combined into one (one
    pass of field equipment instead of two). In a similar fashion, decisions such
    as pesticide applications and other chemicals (fungicides, growth regulators)
    could potentially be further stacked to make crop production more efficient. Traditionally,
    farm system analyses and management happen at the individual farm level (Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2019). In other words, data are usually not shared or co-analyzed
    across the farm boundary. In the era of Ag-IoT where farm data are shared and
    stored in the cloud, there represents an opportunity where the analysis and modeling
    of Ag-IoT data can cover a group of farms or at a regional scale. These regional
    analyses would answer other important questions such as regional yield forecasting,
    pest tracking, or agricultural resource prioritization. These questions are not
    necessarily important for individual growers, but are at the heart of other stakeholders
    such as policy makers and input suppliers. Data ownership and privacy, covered
    in Section 4, are two big issues that should be resolved before this type of analysis
    may occur. 7. Conclusions and future directions 7.1. Conclusions Ag-IoT is a promising
    technology that would increase resource use efficiency in agricultural systems,
    and is an essential tool for digital agriculture transformation. In this paper,
    we have overviewed impactful research related to Ag-IoT in the past decade. The
    data collected from these papers were categorized and analyzed under six main
    Ag-IoT system design parameters namely sensors, sensing platforms and main control
    board, communication technology and IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and
    energy management, and actuators. According to the analyzed data, it is revealed
    that there is an increased global attention towards the Ag-IoT system-related
    research in the recent years. However, there are certain research gaps found in
    the literature. One of them is that the implementations of the sensors and the
    actuators seem to be limited to soil and environmental parameter monitoring and
    irrigation controlling. Furthermore, crop macro and micronutrient demand analyses
    are still at the infant stage due to the non-availability of sensors that can
    measure nutrients in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to improve the sensor
    and actuator applications in crop monitoring and controlling. In addition, heterogeneity
    of the system parameters (such as data, platforms, required power) is a major
    challenge to the Ag-IoT systems implementation, to which the improvement of the
    context-awareness could be a solution. Power harness options for Ag-IoT nodes
    need more exploration as there are limited options available and it would be a
    big advantage for the perennial crop monitoring. The perception and the network
    layers of Ag-IoT systems require more improvements to meet the sensor implementation
    ergonomics and long-range high-throughput data transmission, respectively. Edge
    computing can be a replacement of the high throughput long-range communication,
    but to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of practical applications
    have been developed based on edge computing to date. Mobile Ag-IoT platforms such
    as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have a huge potential to increase the spatiotemporal
    resolution in Ag-IoT-based monitoring and controlling. 7.2. Future directions
    From the finding of this review, authors would like to highlight some important
    future requirements for Ag-IoT. The entire Ag-IoT research community needs to
    propose a complete system design for Ag-IoT that will be viable, open, and interpretable.
    The objective is to enable the interconnectivity of heterogeneous systems and
    sharing resources to obtain more detailed and specific agricultural data. Furthermore,
    in the future research work, there is a need to develop complete information perception
    standards and design multi-protocol compatible gateways. With some significant
    efforts in the above-mentioned future research directions, the entire research
    community will be able to solve the problems of inconsistent device interfaces
    and protocols, making the system faster, robust, and more convenient. Making full
    use of long-range low throughput communication technology, virtual reality/augmented
    reality, and big data/AI for Ag-IoT is yet to be thoroughly explored. Declaration

    Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction The amount of sunlight, the amount
    of water and the amount of nutrition a plant gets and as well as the environment
    temperature can have a huge impact on the growth of a plant. To maintain a plant
    these factors must be taken care of. Among them watering the plants is the most
    frequent activity. Traditionally, watering the plants is done regularly without
    a concern about the amount of water the plant gets. A smart system, where the
    amount of water and the environmental factors are always monitored and regulated
    can be of a huge help in the growth of a plant. [1], [2]. It is found that the
    upcoming trends and most of the existing home designs include small roof or balcony
    gardens to fuse in with nature. On the other hand, while adding an element of
    beauty to the homes, these small roof or balcony gardens poses the issue of having
    to dedicate the homeowner’s time to tend to these plants. In our research project
    we are designing a smart irrigation system that can be incorporated into small
    roof or balcony gardens to overcome the issue of having to carry out this monotonous
    task of watering these plants and the need to determine when to water these plants.
    The main reason for carrying out this research project is to help overcome the
    tedious tasks of maintaining a garden which requires the homeowner’s attention
    and time. Determining when to water the plants as well as how much water should
    be supplied at a certain time requires a lot of attention and practice from the
    side of the owner. Different types of plants require different volumes of water
    [3] and watering should be done at different times of the day. A correct watering
    schedule is essential for the healthy growth of plants. If too little water is
    supplied, the plant will not have enough water to successfully carry out photosynthesis,
    and the plant will wilt. In case of flowering plants, they will not bloom and
    in plants that produce fruits, the yield will decrease if the supply of water
    is lower than that is needed. If this incorrect watering pattern continues the
    plants will eventually die. Conversely, if too much water is supplied, in addition
    to the wastage, it will damage the roots of plants. Too much water reduces the
    air pockets present in soil and this will result in less water been absorbed by
    the roots. This will result in plant diseases as well as death of the plants.
    Therefore, only the necessary volume of water should be supplied to the plants
    at the correct time to maintain a healthy garden and to increase yield of fruits
    and flowers. This proposed method will help the homeowners in this aspect. In
    addition, a social aspect of carrying out this research project is to reduce the
    wastage of water. Water is essential for humans, and it is also critical for the
    sustainable development of humans. Access to clean water is decreasing day by
    day. The unplanned use of water in the irrigation of plants further adds to this.
    The conservation of water should be a major objective when designing irrigation
    systems for any purpose like for gardening, agriculture or even in maintaining
    lawns. In our proposed method we will be determining the optimum amount of water
    that should be supplied and only that amount will be supplied to the plants. Therefore,
    we believe our research project will also help in conserving this essential resource
    by the effective usage of water, so that in turn it will help the whole world.
    SECTION II. Literature Review There are numerous projects carried on the aspect
    of designing smart irrigation systems. These projects have their own advantages
    and disadvantages. One such proposed method allows the user to remotely control
    the system, but this system needs the user to analyze the current soil moisture
    level given by the sensors and set the motor status to ‘On’ and ‘Off’ states when
    required. Although this method has the advantage of controlling the system from
    a remote location, it needs considerable attention from the user if he needs to
    supply only the required amount of water and when the water is needed [5]. Another
    such proposed method uses only a method to detect the need to water the plants,
    it does not suggest a method to automatically supply the water to the plants [7].
    A study on a smart Irrigation system for a crop field using IoT for Surveillance
    [6] - An Arduino microcontroller, a soil moisture sensor and a temperature and
    humidity sensor are used. Two sensors have been used therefore it increases reliability.
    The DHT11 sensor, has been selected mainly due to its very low cost. Bluetooth
    has been used as the communication protocol since it consumes less power, but
    it provides very limited range between the two devices involved in the communication.
    GSM based Automated Rain gun Irrigation-System [4] - Only soil moisture sensors
    are used. The user should press a button in the calling function to give the signal
    back to the microcontroller to control the valves, therefore user’s attention
    and time is needed. The GSM module and microcontroller are connected using a MAX232
    device. Sending the message to the user using GSM repeatedly will add to higher
    costs [4], [11]. SECTION III. Methodology The implementation of the system was
    covered under 3 parts: the physical design, embedded system, and the web application.
    An extensive literature review was carried out initially. Then the optimum components:
    soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, level sensors, micro-controller,
    the WiFi module and the solenoid valves were selected. By considering the pros
    and cons of the different irrigation methods available, localized irrigation method
    was selected. The physical system was initially designed in a 2D platform by using
    Draw.io software and then using Solid-Works (Fig. 1). The microcontroller was
    programed to take input readings from the sensors and then give an output according
    to the obtained readings. The threshold values for the soil moisture sensors were
    also determined experimentally. Then the microcontroller was programmed to control
    the solenoid valves according to the obtained soil moisture and temperature values.
    Next a Serial communication link was established between the microcontroller and
    the Wi-Fi module. Then a web interface with all the monitoring information and
    controls of the system was developed. Finally, all the parts were integrated,
    and system was tested. A. System Hardware Fig. 1. SolidWorks Design Show All The
    Arduino MEGA microcontroller - It contains 54 digital I/O pins and 16 analog inputs.
    It was selected because of its comparatively low cost, the higher number of I/O
    pins and the ease of programming. Arduino IDE is used to program this microcontroller.
    The capacitive soil moisture sensor v1.2 - These sensors measure the changes in
    the dielectric. Dielectric is the ability to transmit electric force without conduction.
    The dielectric is mainly affected by water, thus when the water level changes,
    it causes a change in the dielectric formed in the soil. This change in dielectric
    cause a change in the capacitance and this is measured by the sensors. Temperature
    and humidity sensor – These sensors are used to measure both the air temperature
    and moisture level. The DHT22 sensor was selected as the temperature and humidity
    sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the air
    and gives out a digital signal. It does not require any analog input pins. The
    DHT22 sensor gives more accurate readings compared to the DHT11 sensors. This
    sensor is desirable for making readings over the range of − 40 ∘ C to 80 ∘ C temperature
    readings with ± 0.5 ∘ C accuracy. It has a sample rating of 0.5Hz. It is also
    a low-cost sensor. Optical Infrared Water Liquid Level Sensor - This sensor contains
    no mechanical moving parts and can be mounted using a locking nut. It has an operating
    voltage of 5VDC. Wi Fi module - ESP8266 which is a System on a Chip (SoC) was
    selected as the Wi – Fi module. It contains a 32 – bit microcontroller named as
    Tensilica L106 and a Wi – Fi transceiver. It consists of 11 GPIO pins and an analog
    input. The ESP8266 has only one analog input pin but we require four analog pins
    for this system, therefore a microcontroller is also used. To program this module,
    Arduino IDE was selected because of the easiness of this method. ESP8266 NodeMCU
    was selected to program because it is a development board with a USB interface.
    Therefore, it can be programmed over USB directly. Solenoid valves - Selected
    solenoid valve was DC 12V Electric Solenoid Valve Water Air Normally Closed. This
    solenoid valve was selected because of its low price, efficiency, high quality,
    good performance, low power consumption, long life service, and easy to use. And
    this valve was selected it can take care pressure up to 0.8Mpa. For this project
    we need 9 solenoid valves. Relay - It acts as a switch in the circuit. The relay
    operates on the concept of electromagnetic induction. According to the electromagnetic
    induction principle, when current flows through a relay coil, a magnetic field
    is created. This field draws the conduction plate, and when the current stops
    flowing, the coil releases the conduction plate, providing the relay with switching
    action. B. Software Dreamweaver software - The ESP8266 NodeMCU module was used
    to develop the back end while Dreamweaver software is used to make the front end
    of the webpage. Dreamweaver is a software which allows to design, code, and manage
    websites. This software lets us to write codes and to make website by using a
    visual interface. Dreamweaver supports CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and HTML also. Therefore,
    it’s easy to use for developing websites. The front end of the web page was completed
    with Dreamweaver software. HTML language is used in the Dreamweaver software.
    The Dreamweaver software supports HTML, JavaScript, XML and CSS. HTML codes can
    be developed with a split view in Dreamweaver. In the split view, there are two
    screens divided horizontally, one at the top which is referred to as a live view
    and one at the bottom which is referred to as the code view. C. System Functions
    Fig. 2. System Block Diagram Show All The proposed smart irrigation system consists
    of an Arduino MEGA microcontroller, capacitive soil moisture sensors, DHT22 temperature
    and humidity sensor, optical level sensors and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module (Fig. 2).
    The overall system was designed to implement in the following way. The sensors
    will sense the environment of the plant and send the readings to the microcontroller.
    Then the data obtained from the sensors will be analyzed and compared with the
    threshold values that were predefined by the user. These predefined values can
    be varied by the user through the web application. Then depending on the soil
    moisture and temperature values the decision whether to water the plants or not
    will be decided and the microcontroller will turn the solenoid valves ON or OFF.
    The function was developed such that for each of the plants, first the soil moisture
    reading will be compared with their respective predefined threshold values. If
    the value is above the threshold value, the next condition will be checked to
    see whether the temperature value is below the threshold value. If the temperature
    reading is below the threshold value, it will open the solenoid valve connected
    with that plant to let water flow into the plant. Therefore, the solenoid valve
    will open only if both the soil moisture and temperature criteria are fulfilled.
    If either condition is not satisfied, the solenoid valve will remain turned off.
    When water is supplied to the plant after the solenoid valve is opened, the soil
    moisture content in the soil will increase (refer Fig. 3 and Table I). The soil
    moisture sensors continuously measure the moisture content with a delay of 1 second,
    so with the increasing amount of water added, the moisture reading will continue
    to decrease. When the decreasing soil moisture value drops below the threshold
    value, it will turn the solenoid valve off. For the above function the threshold
    value for temperature is taken as 27 ∘ C . This is because if water is supplied
    to the plants when the temperature is higher than 27 ∘ C , this will affect the
    metabolic functions in the plants. Further, when temperature is high, the water
    will evaporate quickly from the soil and also from the surface of the leaves through
    stomata. This will make the watering process inefficient. Therefore, the temperature
    reading of 27 ∘ C was taken as the optimum threshold value. The sensor readings
    will be displayed to the user via the web page. It was designed with four main
    items such as home, statistics, settings and about. All the four sections consist
    of information relevant to the system and they were placed with buttons. In the
    home section, current soil moisture values, temperature and humidity values are
    included. In the settings section, additional features can be set. Status of the
    fully automated mode Status of the semi – automated mode The user has freedom
    to select any mode, and to monitor status of the modes. In the about section,
    it shows the main information about the system. Through the webpage, the user
    can monitor the-soil moisture sensor readings and temperature and humidity, and
    they too can give the command to water the plants or not depending on the information
    displayed to them. If the fertilizer level is low, the user will be notified and
    request the user to fill it. This system could be controlled with a high level
    of flexibility through the web page. Therefore, the user can have the access to
    fully control the system via a laptop or smartphone. D. Physical Implementation
    This physical design was implemented with the aims of reducing the cost, power
    consumption, maintenance cost and the complexity. The user may prefer to set this
    system either inside or outside in the open, therefore when implementing the design,
    special attention was given to the following factors. The wiring of the system
    was done with utmost care because an unsafe wiring would be highly dangerous in
    conditions of rain and especially when pets and people are around. The surrounding
    material should be corrosive free to increase the safety and durability of the
    system. Further, the material of the system should be highly durable and should
    be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Two different pipelines were
    installed to supply the fertilizers and water separately. Initially silicon pipes
    were used but when the components were tested under different weather conditions
    it was found that when exposed to sun for several days the pipes become distorted.
    This could cause leakages which will in turn lead to changes in flow rates through
    the pipes. Therefore, the silicon pipes were replaced with PVC pipes which have
    good heat resistance and higher durability than silicon pipes. To protect the
    micro-controller, relay modules, ESP8226 module and the solenoid valves enclosures
    were created. In addition, wires were run through conduit tubes. By doing so we
    completely water sealed the above stated electric components. Table (Table I)
    shows the performance of the solenoid valves. Table I Summary of Solenoid Valve
    Operation SECTION IV. Results A. Deriving an equation to obtain a connection between
    sensor readings and moisture level The threshold value for the soil moisture sensors
    was found experimentally using the following process. A unit sample of the soil
    composition which is used to grow the plants was taken. Initially the soil moisture
    reading of the soil sample that was left dry for 24 hours was measured. This value
    was considered as the soil moisture reading for 0% water content. Then water volumes
    of 100ml were added each within equal time intervals of 2 minutes. To improve
    the accuracy, this was repeated three times with three different unit samples
    of the soil composition and the average value was calculated for each volume.
    The table (Table II) shows the average value of the readings that were obtained
    for each volume. The logic of controlling the solenoid valves is provided with
    below figure (Fig. 3). The graph of soil moisture sensor reading against volume
    of water added was plotted (Fig. 4). Fig. 3. Solenoid valve controlling logic
    Show All Table II Average Value of the Readings Obtained For Each Volume Fig.
    4. Soil moisture sensor reading against Water Volume Show All A linearized equation:
    a Polynomial trendline of 6th order was obtained (dotted line in Fig. 4) and the
    relevant equation was derived (1). y=0.0043 x 6 −0.1678 x 5 +2.5863 x 4 −19.75
    x 3 +78.704 x 2 −175.3x+394.96 (1) View Source In the above equation ’y’ is the
    sensor reading and ’x’ is the water level. Equation (1) can be used for any particular
    plant that is to be planted in the garden as the relevant sensor value for the
    required moisture level can be obtained. That sensor value is the threshold value
    that is utilized to operate the functionality of the solenoid valves. Sensor readings
    were displayed to the user on Arduino serial monitor (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Sensor
    values and messages displayed on Arduino serial monitor Show All B. Web Application
    WebSocket was used for sending and receiving data to make the communication between
    the client and the server. To display the sensor readings in the web page, WebSocket
    server was established in the code at a particular port. Some functions which
    are responsible to start the WebSocket server and receive data from the client
    were declared in the code. A JavaScript base code was written inside the HTML
    document to develop the WebSocket server on the client side. A function was constructed
    on the HTML document to get the messages that sent through the serial monitor.
    The messages were displayed on the text areas which were set to the sensor values
    separately. We could get the actual data from the sensors by using the read method
    of the serial object (Fig. 7). Before that, the user should provide username and
    password to log into the web page (Fig. 6). After the username and the password
    are given, user can view the web page which have all the monitoring and controlling
    information. From the main menus in the web page, user has freedom to select any
    section. All the sensor readings can be viewed from “Home” section (Fig. 7). Watering
    process could be activated from the “Settings” section. The status of the modes
    can be obtained as the mode is changed by the user (Fig. 8) Threshold values for
    the sensor values can be set by the user as he/she wants. According to the threshold
    values, the watering process could be activated. In the settings section, the
    overall system can be controlled through the semi – automatic mode or fully automatic
    mode. Four functions were developed inside the HTML document which belongs to
    the settings section of the web page, to perform the function for the ON and OFF
    buttons in the semi – automatic mode and fully automatic mode (Fig. 8). The code
    was modified inside the ESP server to read out the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    formatted data and to turn on and off fully automatic mode and semi – automatic
    mode. To develop the code in the ESP side, Arduino JSON library was installed
    into the Arduino IDE. Front end of the web page was developed with Dreamweaver
    software while the back end part of the web page was developed with Arduino IDE.
    The implemented web page was successful as the mode selection, sensor reading
    display was 100 % functional. The final fabricated prototype of the overall system
    was obtained with high accuracy (Fig. 9). Fig. 6. Login Page of the Web page Show
    All Fig. 7. Sensor readings displayed during testing Show All Fig. 8. Settings
    section of the web page Show All SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Work In this
    project we have presented an accurate, reliable and user-friendly method to detect
    the need to water the plants and supply water to the plants either automatically
    or with the user intervention remotely through a web application. The testing
    phase was carried out with four plants by individually monitoring them and supplying
    them with water and fertilizers. The results obtained from the testing phase portrays
    that the system successfully operates according to the obtained soil moisture
    level and the ambient temperature. An equation was derived (Eq. (1)) to make a
    connection between the soil moisture percentage and the sensor reading values.
    This reduces the set-up time of the system drastically as the sensor calibration
    time is significantly reduced. Since the system was developed in a modular form,
    it can be expanded or changed according to the physical environment without doing
    any major change to the components which increases the versatility and adaptability
    of the system. In our project, the system can be controlled through a laptop or
    a smart phone that can access the web page and the web page was functioning as
    intended. Fig. 9. Fabricated Prototype Show All As future development, we can
    integrate our system into a smart home. Also, a dedicated app can be made for
    the system for both Android and iOS platforms. Also, the user requires certain
    technical knowledge to change the threshold levels of the solenoid valves. Therefore,
    separate section can be made in the web page which allows the user to change the
    threshold values via the web page itself. This will make this system more user
    friendly and approachable for people. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

  description: Climatic factors affect various stages of plant growth, thereby affecting
    agricultural productivity and production stability. The growth and development
    of various tissues and organs during the complete growth period of plants are
    affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype is the internal cause
    for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment is the external conditions
    for the appearance of various morphological characteristics. With the rapid progress
    of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology, combined with genomics,
    bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping will greatly promote
    the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular breeding and efficient
    cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links between genotypes, environmental
    factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype data, it is difficult to fully
    understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental factors on plant phenotypes.
    Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research are gradually shifting from
    genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping began at the end of
    the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality, reproducible trait
    data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment and their
    impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance. As more
    and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately, many
    of the world's top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and
    analysis methods are the core part of plant phenotyping research, including indoor
    and outdoor parts. Modern indoor high-throughput plant phenotype detection platforms
    generally detect plants closely related to plant genetics and variation through
    automated transmission equipment and integrated sensors (such as visible light,
    near-infrared, far-infrared, fluorescence, multispectral, laser, hyperspectral,
    etc.). The acquisition of a plant dynamic growth and developmental phenotype dataset.
    Its advantages are high resolution, high controllability and high-throughput,
    which can provide high-quality multidimensional images and experimental data for
    subsequent plant phenotyping. Whether it is aboveground or underground, indoor
    phenotype monitoring usually takes the individual plant as the unit and describes
    the population characteristics by collecting the characteristics of the individual
    plant. Depending on the image sensor accuracy, the extracted phenotypic data can
    often be accurate down to the tissue cell level. Thus, the scale division of indoor
    phenotypic traits can range from populations to histiocytes. Field-oriented plant
    phenotyping platforms provide accurate and continuous collection of single leaves
    or plant organs, single plants, small plots, and entire farms from proximal to
    long distances, mainly including vehicle-mounted, self-propelled, gantry, and
    suspension as well as several types such as drones, aerial remote sensing and
    spectral satellite imaging. The field high-throughput platform mainly includes
    two types of field machinery and UAVs equipped with multi-sensors, which can achieve
    rapid and non-destructive acquisition of plant population phenotype information
    under field conditions. The combination of agricultural machinery and equipment
    with a multi-sensor platform can effectively reduce the variation in measurement
    results but is limited by the distribution of crops and soil conditions after
    irrigation. Therefore, it is difficult to quickly realize cross-regional applications,
    the operation efficiency is low, and it cannot be used over a large range. However,
    the rapid analysis of field crop phenotype information based on an UAV-equipped
    multi-sensor platform has high technical efficiency and low cost and is suitable
    for complex farmland environments. It has a wide range of applications in the
    analysis of crop height, chlorophyll content, LAI, disease susceptibility, drought
    stress sensitivity, nitrogen content and yield, making it an important means to
    obtain crop phenotype information. Plant roots are an important part of plants
    and have very important functions such as water and nutrient absorption and transport,
    organic matter storage, plant anchoring, and interaction with soil. Since roots
    grow underground, the core of collecting root phenotypes is how to visualize roots
    growing under natural conditions. Therefore, the collection and analysis of root
    phenotypic traits has become the focus and challenge of biological and phenotypic
    research. At present, the research progress of cultivation and improvement based
    on root traits is very slow, and the screening of root traits is still a very
    time-consuming task. Researchers must continue to develop systematic and large-scale
    high-throughput root phenotyping platforms suitable for different cultivation
    goals, so as to accelerate the screening of root traits and the understanding
    of root function, and to gain an in-depth understanding of how root traits are
    related to whole plant stress resistance strategies correlate to increase crop
    productivity and ultimately successfully identify key root traits for crop improvement.
    In recent years, with the continuous development of remote sensing and related
    sensor technologies, a variety of non-destructive plant detection technologies
    have emerged, providing effective means for crop phenotype monitoring, disease
    and insect pest monitoring, and crop identification. RGB cameras are a relatively
    common sensor device in crop phenotyping technology. In the experiment, a digital
    camera with visible light imaging on a UAV can be used to improve the efficiency
    of data collection and achieve rapid acquisition of high-definition images. It
    can be used to monitor crop emergence during agricultural production, rate, flowering
    dynamics, canopy coverage, and lodging. Thermal imaging sensors use an infrared
    detector and an optical imaging lens to receive infrared radiation energy in a
    photosensitive element infrared detector. Infrared imaging technology is used
    to measure plant canopy temperature to infer plant water use efficiency and photosynthesis
    efficiency. It is also used to measure the response of crops to osmotic stress
    such as salinity or drought. It can also measure the impact of other abiotic stresses
    on organisms and detect the presence of pests in the grain. Because the crop canopy
    temperature changes with time, conventional handheld infrared temperature measurement
    equipment is limited by its low measurement efficiency, and it is difficult to
    be widely used in large-scale breeding areas. However, UAVs are equipped with
    thermal imagers for breeding areas, where canopy temperature provides a new efficient
    and reliable method. At present, thermal infrared technology is increasingly used
    in the field of precision agriculture. To ensure stable agricultural production,
    increased production and food security, optimized agricultural production structure,
    and a reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers, it is necessary to accurately
    monitor and warn the occurrence of diseases during agricultural production. Experts
    at home and abroad have carried out a series of thermal infrared imaging technology
    to detect crop disease research. The importance of data interpretation in phenotyping
    research cannot be overstated. With the continuous development of phenotyping
    platforms and related technologies at home and abroad, the current plant high-throughput
    phenotyping platform can obtain massive digital images, point cloud data, spectral
    imaging and thermal imaging data, and undergo geometric correction, radiometric
    correction, and data modeling. And a series of processing processes, and finally
    realize the use of remote sensing means to analyze plant phenotype information.
    High-throughput phenotyping is expected to become the latest tool for sustainable
    production under global climate change. However, at present, there are few plant
    species as the research objects of plant phenotype information, and there is a
    lack of analysis and identification of plant phenotype information in complex
    natural environments. The breadth and depth of plant phenotype analysis research
    must be continuously expanded to establish a unified plant phenotype monitoring
    system and specifications, form a network resource sharing library, and strengthen
    mutual cooperation among developers of various phenotype platforms. Using modern
    mathematical analysis methods, the rapidity and effectiveness of the algorithm
    can be achieved in image processing and recognition software design to improve
    the analysis ability of the analysis module of the plant phenotype monitoring
    system. It is necessary to use multi-domain knowledge to carry out comprehensive
    control and establish background expert decision-making support systems to automatically
    monitor and analyze target plants in real time.

    Abstract Climatic factors affect various stages of plant growth, thereby affecting
    agricultural productivity and production stability. The growth and development
    of various tissues and organs during the complete growth period of plants are
    affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype is the internal cause
    for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment is the external conditions
    for the appearance of various morphological characteristics. With the rapid progress
    of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology, combined with genomics,
    bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping will greatly promote
    the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular breeding and efficient
    cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links between genotypes, environmental
    factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype data, it is difficult to fully
    understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental factors on plant phenotypes.
    Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research are gradually shifting from
    genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping began at the end of
    the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality, reproducible trait
    data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment and their
    impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance. As more
    and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately, many
    of the world''s top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Santa Clara, CA, USA SECTION 1. Introduction
    Optimum management of water and fertilizer can increase crop yield and net return
    remarkably at harvest. Just as there are benefits, risks also need to be considered.
    A significant risk when utilizing water and chemicals is over-application, which
    could lead to contamination of water resources and reduce crop yield and net return.
    Traditionally, irrigation and chemigation applications involve human engagement
    to interpret crop conditions and to implement the respective applications. This
    mode of operation can result in human error, less than optimal crop yield and
    lower water and chemical use efficiency. Recently, automated irrigation and chemigation
    strategies based on sensor data have been widely studied [1]. However, those strategies
    mostly use thresholds or simplistic mathematical models for decision making, which
    often result in imprecise applications. Another significant weakness of sensor-based
    strategies is that, given the complexity of real-life environments, human management
    decisions are based on thresholds and mathematical models that lack scalability,
    and forming or using thresholds or mathematical models can be complex and time
    consuming. To address these issues, some neural network-based approaches have
    been developed [2]. But those methods still require human understanding and oversight
    to analyze and control the irrigation and chemigation events effectively. In this
    work, we present a double deep Q-learning-based technique to maximize the net
    return at harvest. The proposed technique is designed to optimize timing and amounts
    of irrigation and chemigation applications during the crop growing season. Simulation
    results show an average of 50% increase of net return at harvest when compared
    to traditional methods based on DSSAT [3], which is a software-based predictor
    that predicts crop yield. SECTION 2. Previous Work Typically, irrigation and chemigation
    applications require human engagement to analyze crop conditions, decide a course
    of action, and execute the action. Figure 1 shows an example flow of typical (traditional)
    irrigation and chemigation management. This approach requires considerable human
    understanding and engagement, including collecting data from different sources,
    for example, soil characteristics, weather conditions, crop growing stage, and
    soil moisture and nutrient information. The complexity of the calculations and
    analysis is proportional to the amount of information used by the control system,
    and such process can take many hours to be executed by a human. Thus, this process
    may have a low efficiency and hence a poor net return. As sensor technologies
    have matured, they have made it more feasible to automate management decision
    with the aim of improving efficiency of irrigation and chemigation. In the last
    decade or so, many sensor-based agricultural irrigation and/or chemigation systems
    have been studied. The systems introduced by [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] can
    make irrigation decisions based on sensor information. Their work demonstrates
    that better water use efficiency can be achieved by avoiding unnecessary irrigation
    events. Figure 1: Traditional irrigation and chemigation system Show All In the
    work done by [11], a smart irrigation decision support system was introduced,
    the whole flow of this work is shown in Figure 2. In this approach, a neural network-based
    model calculates and analyzes information from sensors and generate the irrigation
    report. The professional worker can then select appropriate irrigation events
    for maximum benefit based on the irrigation report. Their work significantly reduced
    the amount of human effort involved in the irrigation decision. Figure 2: Smart
    Irrigation Decision Support System Show All However, the system still requires
    human supervision for the control of irrigation events, and the decision-making
    process heavily relies on historical data, and thus lacks the ability to learn
    from the changing environment. Another approach by [12] implemented irrigation
    control by a model-based reinforcement learning technique where the system is
    assumed to be linear, whereas the systems in real crop environments are more complex.
    An advanced approach by [2] proposed a reinforcement learning-based irrigation
    control system which is a fully automated high efficiency irrigation control system
    (patent pending). The system flow is summarized in Figure 3. Figure 3: Reinforcement
    learning based irrigation system Show All The main idea of the work is to construct
    a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to perform irrigation control. Two
    neural networks are trained to replace DSSAT [3], where one network takes weather
    and irrigation information and predicts soil moisture levels, and the other network
    takes daily soil moisture information over the entire crop growing season and
    then predicts crop yield at harvest. In the reinforcement learning phase, the
    predicted yield is used to train the decision-making module. This work provides
    a solution of fully automated irrigation control, but it is limited by small state
    space which limits applicability. To overcome the weakness of [2] ’s approach,
    the work done by [13] provided a solution by using a deep reinforcement learning
    technique which no longer requires a small state space. However, in real world
    practice, irrigation and chemigation are often combined to achieve the maximum
    crop yield, [13] ’s work failed to address the chemigation events; hence it only
    solved the irrigation side of the problem. In the work done by [14], they presented
    a computer based chemigation control solution, which takes the state variables
    in agricultural systems and compares them with the predefined value and then makes
    the decision of chemigation. Their work can achieve a better efficiency of chemigation,
    but it still limits the decision-making process within some human defined range.
    In this work, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is presented for irrigation
    and chemigation together to fill the gap of automatic irrigation and chemigation.
    Our constructed method is based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) which was first
    introduced by [15]. The experiment results shows that our solution outperforms
    previous techniques. SECTION 3. Irrigation and chemigation with deep reinforcement
    learning Reinforcement learning is a decision-making process in an uncertain environment,
    which is represented by set of states S = {s1, s2, s3,…}. Over time, the environment
    transits from one state to another. Meanwhile, there are a set of actions A =
    {a1, a2, a3,…}. At a time step, an action which is taken by an agent is to affect
    the state transition probability, and then an immediate reward is received. Reinforcement
    learning is to train a policy that guides the agent to determine the action at
    each state. The goal is to maximize a long-term return, which is the accumulated
    reward over time. For agricultural irrigation and chemigation, the states can
    be observed from the crop during the growing season. In our approach, the states
    are defined to be weather conditions, soil moisture and fertilizer information,
    and crop growth stage. The action corresponds to different application amounts
    for water and chemicals (fertilizers). The immediate reward can be extracted from
    intermediate DSSAT result files. Meanwhile, Eq. 1 illustrates how the return is
    calculated. Return=Y∗ P y −W∗ P w −C∗ P c (1) View Source Y is the final dry yield
    at harvest, W and C correspond to total application amounts of water and chemical
    during the entire crop season, and Py,Pw and Pc represent the prices for crops,
    water, and chemicals. Other costs of production (seed, tillage, and other inputs)
    are assumed constant between the management scenarios under given crop-soil-climate
    conditions. In our approach, the agent is the entire irrigation and chemigation
    control system. The DSSAT environment in our approach is a simulator, which takes
    an action from the agent’s output as input and simulates the corresponding rewards
    and moves to the next state. An agent must follow certain policy during the interaction
    with the environment, and the policy tells which action the agent should take
    given the current state of the environment. In this approach, we used action-value
    function Q(s,a) [16] to help us to locate the optimal policy. The Q value function
    maps each state action pair (s, a) to a numerical value, and it defines how good
    the action is in the long run given a state. The Q value provides the discounted
    cumulative reward in the future that the current action can expect given the current
    state. The optimal action value function, Q*, corresponds to the optimal policy,
    and during the training the policy Q has the control of which state action pair
    is visited, hence, the Q value of the visited state action pair gets updated.
    It is common that an action has a \"bad\" immediate reward, but a good cumulative
    reward in the long run. With traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, Q
    values are stored in a lookup table during the training process. When states of
    the problem increase, the table size increases exponentially. In real world applications,
    storing such a large table is inefficient and often impossible to attain convergence.
    To overcome this issue, deep Q-learning [17] uses convolution neural network (CNN)
    and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to replace the Q value table. Let
    Q(s,a;θ) be the approximate action-function with parameters θ which are all trainable
    parameters in CNN and ANN. Then, one can update θ through a variety of reinforcement
    learning algorithms. With deep Q-learning, the direct approach of the optimal
    action value function is shown in Eq. 2. The parameter θ can be updated iteratively
    as shown in Eq. 3, where ∇ θ t Q( s t , a t ;θ) is the gradient of the action
    value function Q on θ and α is the step size of the stochastic gradient descent
    method [18]. Q ∗ ( s t , a t )≈Q( s t , a t ;θ) θ=θ+α( Y DQN t −Q( s t , a t ;θ))∗
    ∇ θ t Q( s t , a t ;θ) Y DQN t ≡ r t +γ max a t+1 Q( s t+1 , a t+1 ;θ) (2) (3)
    (4) View Source After a number of iterations, the Q value will converge to the
    optimal target value Y DQ N ∗ t for every state-action pair (st, at). Hence one
    can pick an action based on the Q value. Unfortunately, Q-learning, and deep Q-learning
    have a well- known drawback which is overestimated action values under certain
    conditions. To overcome this weakness, we use double deep Q-learning (DDQN) by
    [15] for combined irrigation and chemigation control. The large bias due to the
    overestimated action values of Q-learning and deep Q-learning will lead to suboptimal
    policies. The problem of overestimation of Q-learning was first discovered by
    [19], where the uniformly distributed random errors are contained in the action
    values. The work done by [15] investigated that estimation errors of any kind
    can induce an upward bias. Hence, to overcome this issue, double deep Q-learning
    is studied. The idea of using double deep Q-learning is to reduce overestimations
    by separating action selection and action evaluation. In this scenario, an additional
    network Q(s,a;θ−) is introduced which is used to estimate the action at. The update
    of double deep Q-learning is the same as deep Q-learning, but the target Y DQN
    t in Eq. 4 is replaced by Y DDQN t in Eq. 5. The update of the network Q(s,a;θ−)
    is a periodic partial copy of the network Q (s, a; θ). Y DDQN t ≡ r t +γQ( s t+1
    , max a t+1 Q( s t+1 , a t+1 ;θ); θ − ) (5) View Source In this work, we present
    a double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation system to maximize the
    net return for the crop at harvest. The environment is defined by inputs selected
    within the DSSAT software, which takes application amounts of water and chemical
    (in this case fertilizers) as inputs for each time step during the simulated crop
    growing season and outputs the simulated final crop yield at harvest with daily
    soil information given predefined crop type, weather information and soil type.
    SECTION 4. Implementation The Q value is approximated by a multi-layer ANN which
    takes sensor data of soil information (water content and nutrient levels) from
    different depths (soil layers), crop evapotranspiration, precipitation and crop
    growth stage as inputs to the current state, then outputs Q values of all possible
    actions, respectively. Since the inputs are in vector form, CNN is not needed
    in our approach. By the greedy method, one can choose the action corresponding
    to the highest Q value. To increase the stability and performance of the neural
    network, we implemented experience replay [20] with DDQN algorithm. The idea was
    to construct a limited size replay memory, which stores experience et = (st, at,
    rt, st+1) at each time step t into the memory, where st and at are the state and
    action at time step t; rt is the cumulative reward at time step t ; and st+1 is
    the next state observed from the environment. When the memory reaches the maximum
    size, the new experience will overwrite the oldest experience and this process
    continues until the end of the training process. To deal with the tradeoff between
    exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning ϵ– greedy algorithm was
    also implemented. The irrigation and chemigation system structure is shown in
    Figure 4. The complete DDQN algorithm for irrigation and chemigation control is
    shown in Figure 5. Figure 4: DDQN based irrigation and chemigation flow Show All
    For the DDQN algorithm in Figure 5, lines 1-4 illustrate the algorithm setup.
    One must initialize replay memory M with size N, agent network Qaction, and evaluation
    network Qevaluation. The agent network Qaction is used to select an action, and
    the evaluation network Qevaluation is used to evaluate an action. The number of
    training episodes G, batch size, update evaluation network, and τ must be chosen
    carefully. A small G is not sufficient to ensure DDQN convergence. Typically,
    large batch size speeds up the training, but may degrade the performance of the
    network. The \"update evaluation network\" determines how often the evaluation
    network gets updated, too frequently or too infrequently will degrade the network
    performance. The parameter τ controls the step size for each target network update.
    Line 5 is the start of the training process where the total number of training
    episode is G. Each episode represents one entire crop season. Line 6 is the starting
    point of one episode and a starting state st must be initialized. Lines 7-22 are
    the body of one crop season which ends at harvest. Lines 8 and 9 illustrate the
    ϵ-greedy algorithm which is an action select strategy. A random action at for
    irrigation and chemigation is chosen with probability ε; otherwise, the action
    at will be chosen based on the highest Q value. Figure 5: Algorithm for DDQN irrigation
    and chemigation Show All Lines 10-12 define the reaction of the DSSAT software
    given the action at. Once the action at is passed to DSSAT, a set of result files
    is generated and one can extract the next state st+1 and the reward rt from those
    files. Line 13 stores the experience et into the memory M. Line 14 defines the
    state transition where the next state is set to the current state. Line 15 extracts
    the number of samples from the memory M which will be used for updating the Q
    value. Lines 16-20 illustrate the update role of the Q value. If the sample’s
    state is at the terminal state, Q value get updated by reward ri. Otherwise, Q
    gets updated following Eq. 5. Line 21 updates all trainable parameters θ in an
    agent network Q by the gradient descent method based on mean square error. Lines
    23-26 define the update of the target network Qtarget. If the target network needs
    to be updated, then the process partially copies the parameters from Q to Qtarget.
    SECTION 6. Results and discussion To evaluate the performance and efficiency of
    the proposed double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation approach,
    we compared its results versus multiple differing approaches, including three
    traditional application scheduling methods, the threshold-based method [14], and
    another deep reinforcement learning algorithm [13]. The three traditional application
    scheduling methods represent methods that are commonly used in agriculture for
    chemigation. The detail of associated chemigation control for the three traditional
    application methods are shown in Table 1; with the irrigation method being the
    same among all three traditional methods. The total suggested irrigation and chemical
    amount during the crop growing season can be found in Table 2, and those values
    are calculated based on crop type and maximum yield that can be expected at harvest.
    For the traditional methods, irrigation and chemigation are scheduled to be applied
    once per week. (This application practice is sometimes referred to \"spoon feeding\".)
    The irrigation amount was based on averaged weekly suggested value, minus the
    total precipitation for that week, which was extracted from historical data in
    DSSAT, but one could substitute infeed from onsite weather data in the case of
    field studies; the chemigation amount was based on the DSSAT mean weekly suggested
    value. Table 1: Traditional Method The threshold method compares the current soil
    content information, extracted from DSSAT resultant files, with a predefined (set)
    threshold; thus, if soil water or fertilizer level is lower than the predefined
    threshold then a corresponding application is executed until it reaches a certain
    value. The threshold value is set to match the value system used in DSSAT. Table
    2: Suggested water and fertilizer For the double deep Q-learning and deep Q-learning
    techniques, the time interval between two consecutive applications was set to
    be at least 3 days to represent a reasonable field practice irrigation and chemigation
    schedule; however, this value can be changed depending on different production
    situations. The successfully trained double deep Q-learning and deep Q-learning
    methods were then used for the comparison. Figure 6 shows the double deep Q-learning
    and deep Q-learning training curve for sorghum under Austin, Texas historic weather
    conditions with a Rothamsted (silty clay loam) soil type with all other environment
    modules following the same pattern. As one can observe that the DDQN and DQN take
    similar amount of time to converge, but DDQN has a better reward and less variance
    than DQN. The soils evaluated in this study were selected due to the parameters
    completeness of the respective differing soils data in the DSSAT database. The
    combination of soils and weather conditions in this study were selected to evaluate
    the performance of our proposed method under a diversity of environments. Figure
    6: DDQN and DQN training curve for sorghum at Austin with Rothamsted soil type.
    Show All Table 3: Configuration for DSSAT simulations All comparisons were based
    on simulation results from the DSSAT model. The configuration detail used with
    DSSAT can be found in Table 3. The crop and soil information used in our experiments
    were selected from the DSSAT database, and the weather information was historic
    data in the DSSAT database. The soil water and fertilizer content information
    were extracted from DSSAT results files after each event application. Such information
    could also be obtained by soil water sensors and NPK sensors in field conditions.
    Half of the comparisons assumed sandy clay loam soil type in combination with
    different crops and weather locations (conditions), and the other half of the
    comparisons assumed Austin weather conditions in combination with the other crops
    and soil types. The combinations of weather stations and soil types were imposed
    to generate a diversity of crop conditions under which to evaluate the strategies.
    The comparison results can be found in Figure 7. Figure 7: Experiment Result Comparison
    Show All In each set of comparisons, we selected the best of the three traditional
    methods for comparison with other methods. Through comparison we observed that
    our proposed double deep Q-learning irrigation and chemigation approach outperformed
    all other approaches for corn, sorghum, and most of the cases for cotton and for
    two cases for soybean. For the rest of the cases, the double deep Q-learning is
    the second-best result which is also very close to the optimal results. Meanwhile,
    we also observe that the double deep Q-learning maximized the net return and achieved
    the highest crop yield. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the proposed
    double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation control can achieve a
    better net return under various DSSAT simulated crop-field conditions using a
    precise application amount and schedule. SECTION 7. Conclusions In this work,
    a double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation approach is proposed
    and evaluated. Using this approach, the final net return of a crop is increased
    due to high efficiency of irrigation and chemigation. Using DSSAT to simulate
    crop conditions and responses, the double deep Q-learning approach determined
    profitable solutions under various situations to achieve a higher net return as
    compared to traditional irrigation and chemigation methods. The experiment compared
    the double deep Q-learning approach with baseline scheduling approaches and indicated
    that that the double deep Q-learning approach outperformed the other approaches
    in most cases. Future study is needed to focus on testing the double deep Q-learning
    scheduling in actual field studies. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated rice
    production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent

    WSN; smart irrigation 1. Introduction Rice (Oryza sativa) is the second highest
    ranked food staple in the world, feeding one third (2.6 billion) of the population
    (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice is produced in Asia, and it is
    the fastest growing staple food in Africa and Latin America [2] due to its ease
    of preparation compared to that of corn and wheat. It provides 21% of global human
    energy per capita and is the largest single source of energy [3]. A total of 75%
    of world rice is produced in 92 million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia
    occupies 56% of this land [4]. Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated
    water, which is two to three times more than other irrigated crops, and thus places
    an excessive demand on water usage compared to other staple crops. Bangladesh,
    an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing demand for rice,
    is playing an important role in rice research. According to the Bangladesh Rice
    Research Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation for rice is from ground
    water. However, the ground water is retrieved using shallow tube wells (STW) and
    deep tube wells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating ground water levels
    [5]. The production of 1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000 L of water [6], and Boro
    rice, which is generally grown in dry months, predominantly relies upon the groundwater.
    In order to address this situation, the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation method used during
    the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown that, compared to the
    traditional method, AWD requires five fewer irrigation cycles and fewer pumps
    which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the use of groundwater, AWD
    reduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield [9]. Due to intermittent
    flooding in AWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is reduced by 73%
    in the dry season and by 21% in the wet season [10], compared to the continuous
    flooding method. This also decreases arsenic concentration in the shoots of rice
    plants [11]. Unlike other countries adopting AWD, where water is charged based
    on volumetric usage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation water is charged per hectare,
    without any incentives for the farmers to reduce their water usage. Sharing a
    single pump amongst the farmers often gives rise to conflicts that usually deter
    any collaborative effort [11], which is a key point of AWD. The lack of proper
    knowledge and information sharing are also limiting the adoption of the AWD method.
    Research has shown that there is a significant opportunity for AWD in Southeast
    Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam [12]; however, due to social, economic,
    and technical challenges, the AWD method is not well perceived in these regions
    [13]. Besides the challenges of AWD described above, applying AWD to a wide area
    poses additional challenges, such as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,
    before it can become economically feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected
    wireless sensor network (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates
    monitoring data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs
    require three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN),
    the cluster head (CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown
    in Figure 1a. All of the SNs are distributed into multiple, unequal clusters headed
    by a CH that sends sensor data to the DS. Functionally, the clustering process
    and data transfer protocol may vary depending on the nature of the application
    and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also require these WSNs to
    be connected with other networks through gateways and to the internet infrastructure
    [14], as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1. (a) Network elements and functional layers
    of the IoT-connected wireless sensor network (WSN), and (b) Automated AWD-specific
    WSN with IoT connectivity. IoT is the network of various smart devices to facilitate
    information flow to the end-user through the existing internet. The exponential
    growth and distribution of IoT devices are giving rise to numerous innovative
    and real-life applications. COVID-SAFE [15] monitors and predicts the infection
    by monitoring social distancing with the help of wearable IoT devices. Various
    wearable IoT devices are used for human emotion recognition [16] to facilitate
    online communication. The growth of the IoT applications, such as smart health
    using wearable IoT devices and smart cities, results in security threats to the
    network itself. The authors [17] proposed an IoT Botnet Detection using salp swarm
    algorithm (SSA) and ant lion optimization (ALO) models to minimize security threats.
    Authors of [18] proposed an enhanced information-centric networking (ICN) for
    IoT using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing in the internet cloud.
    Studies are conducted on the design and fabrication technologies to utilize smart
    IoT devices [19]. The researchers focus on IoT nodes’ accurate and fast localization
    [20]. IoT connected to WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture
    as reported in [21,22,23,24]. Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems
    utilize soil moisture content and other environmental variables to schedule irrigation
    without considering plant growth; however, this is insufficient for automating
    the AWD method and gaining the farmers’ trust. Besides monitoring and controlling
    the pumps, an effective water distribution system through pipes is also required,
    giving rise to the added complexity of having to both monitoring and controlling
    the distribution system. Moreover, present WSN technologies are optimized for
    applications with densely populated SN and small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring
    requires long-range and low-power wireless connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area
    AWD automation involves three different WSNs, dedicated for (1) field water-level
    and environmental monitoring; (2) irrigation system monitoring; and (3) irrigation
    system controlling, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely populated and widely
    distributed sensor and actuator nodes are required for these three different WSNs.
    These three WSNs will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtualization
    involves multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN
    traffic [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD
    also requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant
    physiological data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting
    the WSNs with different servers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure
    1b. Literature shows that large-scale irrigation is required to limit water usage
    to provide more water for the growing industrial sectors and increasing urban
    population [27,28]. Large-scale multiple cropping can further limit water usage
    [29] using the automated irrigation framework proposed in this article. Despite
    the inherent advantages of the AWD, both small- and large-scale implementations
    are yet to achieve the expected success for lack of proper adaptation of technologies,
    namely IoT and WSN [30]. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of an irrigation
    system, such as AWD, involves multiple stakeholders and different technologies.
    That may require an effective dimensioning tool for a practical convergent solution.
    The research presented in this article has focused on automation through proper
    technology adoption by providing a mathematical model and addressing all the required
    systems. The proposed mathematical model considers the irrigation system as a
    distributed system. It separates its components into pipe networks, localized
    water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control, thus making the automation
    platform applicable to AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The pipe network will
    facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in a scalable manner.
    The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the clustered pumps
    will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level sensors in an IoT-connected
    WSN will help build a long-term database enabling scientific research to study
    the impact of climate change on crop yield [31], physiological changes, greenhouse
    gas emissions for different crops, and the application of various irrigation models.

    2. Related Work Irrigation automation is not a very recent phenomenon and, as
    a result, is usually performed by adopting existing mathematical models and optimization
    algorithms. These primarily control the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization.
    Baki et al. [32] have proposed a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts
    and the water flow in soils to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled
    irrigation days for the highest irrigation efficiency and optimum crop yield.
    Shahdany et al. [33] developed a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation
    using both known and unknown water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides
    the model-based optimization approaches, machine learning is also used by [34]
    to predict crop irrigation requirements based on soil parameters. Linker et al.
    [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal irrigation scheduling system that utilizes
    weather data alongside the crop’s physiological state and soil water availability.
    However, users need to decide between yield and irrigation performance depending
    on their applications. To achieve better optimization, Munir et al. [36] included
    parameters such as the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light intensity,
    and soil type for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses
    low power sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller
    prototype based on the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal
    irrigation environment for farming. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used
    by [38] to predict soil moisture changes and to schedule irrigation based on climatic
    information and rooting depth. This ANN method was compared with the established
    water stress (WS) method, which well predicted the soil moisture during the main
    growing season, but was error prone at lower soil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear
    regression (NLR) were used by [39] to find the distances between the emitters
    in order to achieve optimum drip irrigation in the wet areas. Human expertise
    is also used by [40] for their proposed online decision support system (DSS),
    which consists of a meteorological model for weather forecasts, and a computational
    model for soil water balance and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation
    schedule for a week in advance based on the DSS data repository. Irrigation automation
    is further upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links, and internet
    infrastructure due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these
    technologies. Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost
    water level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In
    [42], the authors present a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and
    management system that utilizes water flow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors.
    The over-usage of freshwater for flood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author
    proposed an IoT-based intelligent decision support system to improve the farmer’s
    water utilization by using weather data and sensor data. A complete irrigation
    supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN was implemented by
    [44] to compare seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and found that
    soil-based approaches were not adequate in providing sufficient water for the
    plants. Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported
    in the academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing the
    water level lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar panels
    as the power source [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors for precise
    water level measurement for automation of the AWD technique [46]. The proposed
    system was implemented for different sizes of fields, from 0.7 acres to 55.8 acres.
    Besides these local and remote irrigation automations, performance optimization
    of the WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They developed a 3D ray-launching
    (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm to characterize the radio channel of LoRa and
    LoRa wide area network (LoRaWAN) in order to provide better connectivity to transmit
    sensor data in obstacle filled scenarios for irrigation automation. Cardoso et
    al. [48] have proposed a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor
    and schedule irrigation using machine learning. Unlike irrigation automation,
    AWD requires additional parameters such as plant physiological data in order to
    automate the irrigation system. As discussed in the previous paragraph, some irrigation
    automation utilizes weather data or plant physiological information from the farmer;
    however, this platform targeted only a single pump as the irrigation control unit.
    Most of these solutions are offline, of the open-loop type, and do not synthesize
    the data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple
    physical and logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water
    distribution networks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-specific
    schedule mapping is absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination
    may not be suitable for the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,
    which is highly required for the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.
    3. Problem Formulation As one of the rice-producing countries of southwest Asia,
    Bangladesh produces three types of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west part
    of Bangladesh produces more than one-third of these three types of rice and 35%
    of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence, the irrigated lowland of this
    part can be considered for the AWD implementation, as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2a shows the annual Boro production areas in overall Bangladesh. Figure 2. Boro
    production and illustrative implementation of AWD in Bangladesh; (a) Total Boro
    cultivation (2015–2016), (b) Portion of the medium Boro production zone focused
    for AWD implementation as marked in (a) by the red box, and (c) closer view of
    an IoT-based AWD system. For implementation of the wide area AWD, a portion of
    the medium Boro production area that produces less than 16% Boro [49] and lacks
    adequate irrigation facilities, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 2b which
    was chosen as the test site. Figure 2c shows the land condition of this area.
    The AWD zone is 5 km by 20 km, covering more than 24 thousand acres of cultivable
    lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water source is a river
    which is at least 2 km away from the cultivable land. Therefore, traditional canal-based
    irrigation methods are inadequate as they can suffer from water seepage of about
    40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to provide efficient water level
    control over this large area of irrigated land. The proposed IoT-based automation
    system with pipe-based water transportation and distribution using the AWD system
    may reduce the seepage loss by up to 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation
    is not adequate in monitoring and controlling the large number of elements in
    the AWD system. Therefore, an intelligent layered IoT-based closed-loop automation
    system is required and is proposed for this project. 4. Proposed Solution The
    proposed automation of AWD is a closed-loop control system that uses an IoT based
    WSN, which is represented by a simplified block diagram as shown in Figure 3.
    This system has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental
    inputs from the field and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from
    a plant physiology database; and (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network
    and water distribution system. Figure 3. Functional blocks of the IoT–WSN-based
    AWD automation control loop. The environmental parameters to be monitored are
    temperature, pressure, humidity, and the greenhouse gas methane ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ) . Rice
    fields emit a considerable amount of methane, which can be reduced significantly
    by the intermittent flooding that occurs in the AWD method. The field temperature,
    pressure, and humidity data are required to calculate the evapotranspiration loss,
    seepage loss, and water level of the field, which are used to calculate the basic
    parameters used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters, such as wind
    speed and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through
    the IoT cloud. The wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines
    and a pipe-based water distribution system to meet the field irrigation requirement.
    To maintain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of the
    pipes need to be monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets and
    pumps are controlled to maintain proper pressure and water flow during the wetting
    phase of the AWD method. Additionally, the pump power and mechanical parameters
    need to be monitored continually. The crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐  ) determines the
    AWD stages and can be determined from plant physiological data stored in the database
    and from input entered by farmers. The external data obtained from sensors in
    the field, the weather forecast, the crop coefficient, and user input are combined
    and processed in the closed control loop by the cloud-based AWD server through
    the IoT network. The control logic generated by the cloud server is then sent
    to the actuators and pumps through the IoT network to control the irrigation processes.
    All of the sensor nodes (SN) and actuator nodes (AN) are grouped into clusters
    and connected with the base-station (BS) through the cluster head (CH) using a
    LoRa wireless interface. The BS connects the whole WSN to the IoT network through
    the general packet radio service (GPRS) or third generation (3G) cellular network
    as per availability and coverage. The BS also acts as the WSN to an IoT gateway
    that converts the SN/AN data packets to message query telemetry transport (MQTT)
    messages. 5. System Design and Integration The proposed AWD automation consists
    of two main parts: (a) design and dimensioning of the AWD system; and (b) design
    and integration of the WSN. The AWD method at its core is an irrigation schedule
    that depends on certain the water requirements which vary depending on soil condition
    and the growth stages of the crop. Automation of the AWD using the IoT and WSN
    requires the sensor and actuator networks to be designed together, integration
    of various service modules, and development of the software algorithm. These are
    described in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Irrigation Scheduling The water
    volume of the irrigated field changes due to evapotranspiration and percolation.
    Evapotranspiration is influenced by the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration
    (𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 ) [52] can be calculated as 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 =𝐸 𝑇 0 × 𝐾 𝑐  (1) where ( 𝐾 𝑐 ) is the
    crop coefficient (potency of soil evaporation and crop transpiration), and (𝐸
    𝑇 0 ) is the reference evapotranspiration. Among the different methods, the Food
    and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered
    to be the best estimation for 𝐸 𝑇 0 , and can be expressed as 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ (
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+γ 900 𝑇+273 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 𝑢 2 )   (2) where, 𝑅 𝑛 = net
    radiation at the crop surface ( MJ m −2 d −1 ) , G = soil heat flux density (
    MJ m −2 d −1 ) , T = mean air temperature (°C), Δ = slope of saturation vapor
    curve (kPa°C−1), 𝑢 2 = wind speed ( ms −1 ), 𝑒 𝑠 = saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and 𝑒 𝑎 = actual vapor pressure (kPa). Water requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day
    is given in Equation (3), which measures the receding water level. 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 =(𝐸
    𝑇 𝑜 × 𝐾 𝑐 𝑗 )+𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐶 (3) where PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping into
    the ground through pores, and j is the growth-stage index (1 to 3). Figure 4 illustrates
    the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation frequency (lower
    row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three development
    stages (transplantation, flowering, and panicle initiation) along with a water
    level indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous standing water
    and irrigation scheduling is required. Figure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method. The different crop coefficients, including
    Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in Figure 4 [53]. It is quite evident
    when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days, depending on the soil
    type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing water is required at
    the beginning of all three stages which approximates to about 30 days in total;
    hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during these times. Therefore,
    depending on the stages and in accordance with the 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 , irrigation scheduling
    is applied. Irrigation scheduling is divided into two sections. The first section
    is for continuous standing water and the second section is for AWD period. Continuous
    Standing Water: For the three development stages, if the standing water level
    recedes to 2 cm from 5 cm as given in Equation (4), then the irrigation schedule
    or cycle 𝐼 1𝑗 is applied using Equation (5). 𝐼 1𝑗 represents the number of times
    the pump is turned on and is used to maintain a continuous water level of 5 cm
    above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is the total number of days related to
    the transplantation, panicle initiation, and flowering stages. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 𝑊𝑅 𝑅
    𝑗 (𝑡)=3 cm 𝑖𝑛 𝑇 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 𝑗∈{1,2,3}  (4) 𝐼 1𝑗 = 𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 𝑇 (5) Establishment of continuous
    standing water during these stages is necessary as rice is quite sensitive to
    fluctuation in water level. Alternate Wetting and Drying Method: For the AWD method,
    when the water level falls 5 cm from above the ground and reaches 15 cm below
    the surface as given in Equation (6), then irrigation 𝐼 2 , which is the number
    of times the pump is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where 𝑊 𝑗 is
    the total days for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above
    the surface. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 1 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 (𝑡)=5 cm 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 1  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
    𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =15 𝑐𝑚 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 2  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒     (6) 𝐼 2𝑗 = 𝑊 𝑗 𝑇 1 + 𝑇 2 𝑗∈{1,2,3}
    (7) The AWD method is utilized in three different stages of the plant development
    period: (i) 15 days after transplantation; (ii) then seven days before panicle
    initiation; and (iii) finally seven days after flowering. 5.2. Dimensioning of
    the AWD System Proper dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is
    required for the implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are
    used in several clusters for a field of 25,000 acres to reflood the field in the
    shortest time possible. Multiple clustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet
    rice irrigation (MIRI) option available with AWD which allows the water to flow
    into the fields from several inlets, flooding the field in the shortest amount
    of time. The capacities of the pumps are chosen to meet the recommended minimum
    swift flooding rate of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per minute per acre),
    which varies depending on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the total
    number of pumps required ( 𝑛 ), when operating for 𝑡 hours with pumping capacity
    ( c ) in m3/s. The available pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309,
    0.1009, and 0.1262 m3/s, and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000
    GPM (gallons per minute) pumps that cover an acre of area (A) with q (150/m for
    one cm per hour water delivery) amount of water. 𝑛= 𝐴 𝑐×𝑞×𝑡       (8) Figure 5a
    shows the number of pumps required to irrigate 100 acre-inches. Using our proposed
    area of 25,000 acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM
    capacities. Figure 5. (a) Number of pumps required when operating for duration
    of time (b) Average power consumption between different water lifting devices
    (c) Efficacy of the water lifting devices. Beside the volume of water to be delivered,
    the selection of water pump depends on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters
    of the water sources. Depending on the lifting head and the source of the water,
    there are three different types of pumps used for irrigation in South-East Asian
    countries including Bangladesh. For the surface water on bodies of water such
    as rivers and lakes, low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is between
    1 to 5 m. A shallow tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water
    irrigation [56]. The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities
    called deep tube wells (DTWs). Irrespective of the type of pump used, pumps with
    higher efficiencies must be selected [57]. Pumps with 70% efficiency (as commonly
    used) are chosen for better selection among different lifting capacities. Average
    energy consumption (Ea) is calculated using Equation (9). 𝐸𝑎=ℎ𝑝·𝜂· 𝑡  (9) where
    hp is the horsepower of the pumps, η is the pump efficiency, and t is the operating
    time of the pumps. The efficacy of the system is measured using Equation (10).
    𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑦=𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( m 3 /s)/ 𝐸𝑎  (10) The average power consumption and efficacy
    of different water lifting devices are shown in Figure 5b,c. The efficacy curves
    in Figure 5c assume 600 GPM, 400 GPM, and 1110 GPM capacities for the low-lift
    pumps (LLP), STW, and DTW pumps. Figure 5b,c shows that LLPs have greater efficacy
    and low energy consumption compared to the other two types. This is mainly due
    to less heads [58] and thus makes the LLP type an economically feasible solution.
    Therefore, multiple low lift pumps are to be used for the wide-area AWD implementation
    as it would allow for proper utilization of the surface water and help lessen
    the exploitation of groundwater irrigation. The proper dimensions of pipes are
    of paramount importance in carrying surface water to the field; therefore, pipes
    are chosen to ensure minimum friction loss while maintaining the recommended water
    flow velocity [59]. The pipes are placed on a downward slope, as shown in Figure
    6a, to overcome the loss of pressure that occurs when travelling larger horizontal
    distances. Moreover, due to multiple inlets for irrigation, the pressure of water
    may fall from one inlet to the other; hence, when needed, the inlets closer to
    the source can be closed, to ensure sufficient water pressure at the opposite
    end of the field. Figure 6. (a) Downward slope water pipe (b) In-field Automated
    AWD setup. According to Equation (8), 250 units of 0.1262 m3/s (2000 GPM) capacity
    pumps need to be formed into clusters to ensure that the field is reflooded within
    16 to 17 h of operating time. The frictional head loss for a steady pipe’s flow
    is calculated using the Hazen–Williams equation [59], which is given by Equation
    (11). ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 =(0.2083× ( 100 𝑐 ) 1.852 × 𝑞 1.852 )/ 𝑑 ℎ 4.8655 (11) where ℎ 100𝑓𝑡
    = friction head loss, in feet, of water per 100 feet of pipe, c = Hazen–Williams
    roughness constant, q = volume flow (gal/min) and 𝑑 ℎ = inside diameter of the
    pipe (inches). Subsequently, the friction loss in psi [59] can be calculated using
    the following Equation (12). 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =(1/2.31)× ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 (12) where, 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =
    friction loss in psi per 100 feet of pipe. Equations (11) and (12) are required
    to determine the diameter of pipes needed for specific applications. The holes
    of the inlet would need to be 0.0635 m in diameter to obtain a flow of 0.004732
    m3/s (75 GPM) from every inlet in order to fill the field in the shortest possible
    time [55]. Table 1 shows the proposed AWD system with the number of monitoring
    and driver nodes needed to ensure that water gets dispersed evenly throughout
    the field. Figure 6b shows the AWD setup of the field, designed to ensure that
    all farmers receive a fair share of irrigation water, thus resulting in greater
    acceptance of the AWD. Table 1. Proposed AWD system setup. 5.3. WSN and IoT Integration
    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.
    A WSN collects field parameters such as water level, gas emissions ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ),
    temperature, pressure, and humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min
    intervals. The other WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as
    pipe pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power. Based on
    these data, it generates alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations.
    There is continuous monitoring at the SN which allows for immediate action when
    needed. The actuator network operates the actuators of the pipe to control the
    water flow through the pipe and is updated every 15 min. Comparing the low-power
    wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was chosen for the WSN in order to
    achieve the wide area coverage needed at the monitoring area for the AWD automation.
    Table 2 summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14] including range, data rate,
    and power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited technology in terms
    of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox. Table 2. Basic features
    of wireless technologies. LoRa employs chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation
    for better noise immunity and sensitivity in order to achieve low-power and long-range
    wireless connectivity. The LoRa data rate ( 𝑅 𝑏 ) depends on the channel bandwidth
    (BW), coding rate (CR), and the CSS spreading factor (SF), and can be calculated
    using Equation (13). Data Rate=SF [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ]  (13) For the proposed
    automated-AWD system, the LoRa physical layer was chosen instead of LoRaWAN in
    order to customize the channel access interval and achieve better channel utilization
    by implementing a custom MAC (Medium Access Control) layer. Furthermore, WSN coverage
    can be improved by increasing the CSS spreading factor of LoRa, without increasing
    transmission power or changing any network elements [14]. Table 3 summarizes the
    LoRa configuration parameters used for the SN where the data rate Rb is calculated
    using Equation (13). Table 3. LoRa parameters. The multi-purpose sensor node (SN),
    shown in Figure 7a, is designed for all WSNs in order to keep the network homogeneous.
    It consists of a LoRa transceiver module (SX1278) unit, main processor (ATMega
    328), and network specific sensors and actuator drivers. Depending on the specific
    application, the sensor node can be used to either drive actuators or collect
    and monitor sensor data. Figure 7 shows the hardware blocks of the SN with the
    power unit and the base station. Figure 7. Hardware block diagram showing (a)
    Sensor node consisting of sensors, actuator drivers, and power unit; (b) base
    station (BS) with LoRa and cellular data connectivity. The base station (BS) consists
    of a Raspberry Pi-4 which acts as a host computer to control the WSN, data communication,
    and gateway functionalities. It has both LoRa and Wi-Fi/3G/LTE to maintain the
    connection with the WSNs and IoT cloud. Figure 7b shows the hardware block diagram
    of the BS. 5.4. Communication Protocol and Automation Algorithm Data transmission
    from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request messages to
    a specific SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after successful
    reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the actuator
    control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database
    after receiving the data and from the AN. All of these communications between
    the WSN and the BS are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa
    packets. The BS processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface
    are connected with the IoT server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer
    protocol (HTTP) gateway. All of the data communication and AWD automation processes
    are performed by the SN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible
    software algorithms designed for the SN and AN, respectively. At first, it configures
    and initializes the sensors, LoRa module, and driver unit. It then starts reading
    the field, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor their condition continuously. The
    AN takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. All the
    internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at regular
    intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such as user
    input, plant-specific data, and weather forecasts, are collected through the IoT
    server. Figure 8c shows the AWD automation control logic performed by the IoT
    server. The SN algorithm, shown in Figure 8a, was used for the field trial (described
    in Section 6). The algorithms, shown in Figure 8b,c, intended for wide-area AWD
    automation, were not used in the field trial. Initially, the irrigation phase
    (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the phase specific decisions
    are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored in terms of
    TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked to determine
    whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently, after toggling the
    actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF and AWD, and then, if
    the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and pumps are switched off.

    actuator node algorithm, and (c) Control logic algorithm for the AWD server intended
    for wide-area AWD automation. 6. Field Trial A field trial was performed in two
    phases: (i) WSN formation and data collection at UIU (United International University),
    Bangladesh; and (ii) remote data collection using the IoT network in an AWD plot
    at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Figure 9a shows the location
    of the UIU campus fields and Figure 9b shows the BRRI’s research agricultural
    field on Google Maps. Figure 9. Field trial location: (a) On-campus trial at United
    International University. (b) Agricultural land trial at BRRI. Figure 10a shows
    the IoT-connected (wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) architecture which
    is comprised of two sensor networks (WSN1 and WSN2) and one wireless actuator
    network (WSN3), as described in Section 5.3. In phase one, four sensor nodes (SNs)
    were placed at each corner of a 500 m by 500 m field with the indoor base station
    (BS) located in a lab on the fifth floor of the campus building. The approximate
    distances between the SNs and the BS were 500 m to 750 m, as shown in Figure 10b.
    Figure 10. (a) IoT-connected WSAN architecture (b) On-campus trial setup with
    sensor devices connected to a base station IoT-connected WSAN architecture. Sensor
    data were collected on a round-robin basis to avoid the co-channel interference
    that occurs at high frequencies (30 s period), and to evaluate the data transfer
    performance of the WSN. The base station (BS) consisted of a Linux-based (Redhat
    7) Apache web server with Node.js, HTM, Python 3, and Maria Database. It also
    acted as a WSN-IoT gateway using the LoRa–WiFi interface. To collect real-life
    data and to evaluate the AWD algorithm’s performance, SNs were placed in the agricultural
    plots of BRRI in a Boro field. The field was divided into irrigation blocks of
    15 m by 15 m, and the SNs were placed 200 m apart from each other. The irrigation
    system was controlled using a central pump. Figure 11 shows the field setup. Figure
    11. Agricultural field level trial setup: (a) Top view of a sensor device in the
    field (b) The receiver base station setup. The BS located at BRRI acquired all
    the sensor data from the field and stored it in the IoT server in a lab at UIU
    through the 3G cellular network. To monitor and process the field data in real-time,
    a distributed application structure was designed, as shown in Figure 12c. Here,
    a smartphone app, web interface, and other automation applications were developed
    and primarily implemented within the central IoT server [60]. Figure 12a,b show
    the smartphone app and the web interface. Figure 12. (a) Mobile Application, (b)
    Web Application, and (c) client-server connectivity for user interface. The mobile
    and web applications were linked to a Node.js server. A mobile Android application
    was used to collect data, a server was used to store the data and generate notifications,
    and a web client was used as a dashboard to display all the AWD specific information.
    The mobile app and web dashboard used rESTful APIs, HTTP requests, and web sockets
    to interface with the server. Sensor data from the external sensor devices was
    recorded on the server, where it was reactively pushed to the mobile client and
    dashboard using web sockets. Web sockets were used to communicate between the
    server and the clients. Both the Android and web apps provided similar services,
    such as user registration, sensor data acquisition, warning generation based on
    sensor data, and data and AWD status reports on the dashboard. The end user, farmers,
    can reconfigure the AWD parameters, such as water level and pump operation time
    using either the smartphone app or web interface. 7. Performance Analysis In traditional
    irrigation systems, water distribution is performed using earthen canals [50]
    due to their low initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribution
    efficiency, less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance
    costs. The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which
    is expressed as water conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation
    (14). 𝑆={( 𝑄 1 − 𝑄 2 )÷𝐿}×100 (14) where S = the rate of conveyance loss in the
    canal ( m 3  s −1 ) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of flow at the inlet ( m 3  s
    −1 ), Q2 = rate of flow at the outlet ( m 3  s −1 ), and L = distance between
    two points (m). The main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due
    to seepage loss. Studies have found that about 40% of the water is lost during
    the distribution time through the earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated
    AWD system using plastic pipes can overcome this conveyance loss, and help reduce
    the irrigation time, which in turn results in less energy (fuel or electricity)
    to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the proposed project derived
    from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance loss between earthen
    canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the water source
    to the field. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when transporting
    it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method
    with plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption
    by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. Figure 13. Conveyance loss compensation
    between earthen canal and plastic pipe. Using Equations (5) and (7), the frequency
    of irrigations, 𝐼 1𝑗  and  𝐼 2𝑗 , can be used to determine the total energy consumption
    of the pumps. For instance, to reflood a 100-acre field with 3 cm of water while
    maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-GPM capacity pump with
    70% efficiency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufficient as seen in Figure
    5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the pump is found to
    be 142.8 KWh. Similarly, the average energy consumption can be determined for
    the AWD method. Therefore, the total energy consumption for the whole season can
    be found by using Equation (15): 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝐾𝑊ℎ)= 𝐼 1𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹
    𝑗 )+  𝐼 2𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) (15) where 𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 ) represents the energy consumption during
    the TPF stages in order to supply 3 cm of water to the field, and 𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) denotes
    the energy required to supply water when water reaches 15 cm below ground during
    the AWD method. It can be observed that, compared to the traditional method which
    utilizes continuous water, the proposed automated system is expected to require
    less energy. Figure 14 shows the dimensioning steps and mathematical calculations
    that are used for the proposed AWD system. Figure 14. Required dimensioning and
    calculation steps for an IoT-based AWD system. Table 4 compares the automated
    AWD method with manual AWD systems. Manual AWD studies focused on limited field
    sizes, soil types, and water sources. Sharing a limited number of water-lifting
    devices amongst numerous farmers tended to cause conflicts among them. Furthermore,
    the number of farmers it supported was generally quite limited. However, in the
    proposed IoT- and WSN-based automated AWD system, large-scale implementation is
    possible using a pipe and actuator-based water distribution system with cluster
    pump operation and monitoring. In this proposed system, 10 clusters, each containing
    25 pumps with capacities of 0.1262 m 3 /s (2000 GPM), can cover an area of 25,000
    acres. In this system, the pumps have 12 hp with an average pumping efficiency
    of 70%, which can support a large number of farmers while still allowing each
    farmer to obtain a fair share of water. Table 4. Comparison between manual AWD
    and automated AWD. In manual AWD, due to manual inspection of water levels throughout
    the irrigation season, pumps may operate for more hours than necessary, resulting
    in the wastage of valuable resources. However, in automated systems, pumps are
    switched off as soon as the water level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting
    in water and energy savings. The experiments presented in [46] showed that the
    automated AWD saved between 13–20% of water, with a 25% decrease in irrigation
    energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11% over manual AWD. The AWD
    automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected to reduce irrigation costs
    further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover, integration of weather
    forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping pumps off when
    the forecast predicts precipitation). Research in [45,46] presented automation
    of the AWD process by using sensors to precisely measure the water level precisely.
    These studies focused on small areas compared to that of the system described
    in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple WSNs need to be designed
    and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer certain advantages over the
    manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning of the wide-area automated
    AWD system may face challenges during implementation. The plant physiological
    database for developing countries such as Bangladesh is not regularly updated
    and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where farmers are largely not exposed
    to technology, their knowledge and experiences about rice and irrigation are not
    readily available. Moreover, one of the research constraints is that the weather
    forecast information is not based on the specific local territory. Rather, it
    is based on the general meteorological information of the whole region. 8. Conclusions
    This paper has presented an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system covering
    a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large
    irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is imperative
    that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional manual operation
    and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential
    and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised
    of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an IoT system
    that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The data from
    the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central server
    that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The system
    is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with different
    sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support the design
    and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware for
    the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation
    of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm
    have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system’s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system. Despite numerous advantages, such as
    reduced water consumption, and economic and environmental benefits, widespread
    adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to social, economic, and technical
    challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption of existing sensor
    networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically
    viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and
    real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water amongst the
    farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of the proposed system,
    wide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries. These countries will
    then reap the full benefits of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.
    For future expansion of the proposed system, long-term data can be collected and
    analyzed to improve the system further and to further control the greenhouse emissions
    more effectively. Since the proposed system enables the collection of data and
    creation of a large database, new models can be generated and advanced techniques,
    including machine learning and big data, can be applied for better performance.
    Furthermore, incorporating the farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data
    and algorithms will make it possible to accurately identify the different physiological
    stages of plants during the season, resulting in the improved development of plants
    and yields. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.M.E.R. and R.M.; methodology,

  description: Agriculture is the backbone of all the developing countries. The economy
    of a developing country mainly depends on agriculture and farms in rural areas
    and applying traditional approaches is not sufficient in today’s scenario. Now
    a day, water scarcity is one of the main challenges faced by the farmers. Another
    major challenge featured by Indian agriculture sector is that the increase in
    rate of farmers’ suicide due to debt. Monitoring environmental conditions is the
    major factor to reduce the cost of farming and improve yield of the efficient
    crops. Focusing on encouraging innovative challenges in agriculture, smart farming
    is the solution for the problems that the industry is currently facing. Use of
    modern technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) gives a new dimension in the
    area of smart farming in agriculture domain with low cost and scalable solutions.
    Smart irrigation system not only overcomes this problem but also provide clean
    source of energy. The IoT technology has realized the smart wearable's, connected
    devices, automated machines, and driverless cars that contain electronics, software,
    sensors and connectivity which allows these things to connect, interact and exchange
    data. However, in agriculture, the IoT has brought the best impact. This paper
    includes development of a smart irrigation system which can monitor temperature,
    humidity, moisture in agricultural field through sensors using PIC Microcontroller
    and in case of any discrepancy send a SMS notification as well as a notification
    on the application developed for the same to the farmer’s smart phone using Wi-Fi/3G/4G.
    The proposed system gets Live Data feeds, various devices like Smart Phones, Tablets
    are used. The data generated via sensors can be easily shared and viewed by agriculture
    field owner (farmer) anywhere remotely via Cloud Computing technology integration.
    The farmers can see the field data (moisture, temperature, humidity) using Thingspeak
    website through their unique login id and password from database with cloud computing.
    Unauthorized person can’t view or access that field data without getting permission
    from the owners.

  description: Traditional gardening requires labor to control the environmental parameters.
    The manual intervention method requires high labor cost and it is less effective
    especially for busy people. This paper introduces the concept of a smart edible
    garden with the integration of the Internet of Things (IOT). IOT is a smart farming
    concept that is able to monitor the parameters thus, reducing the need for manual
    intervention. For controlling the environment in a smart edible garden, different
    sensors are proposed such as temperature, moisture, humidity, light dependent
    resistor (LDH) and pH. These sensors collect parameters from the environment to
    help in the decision making. Data will be sent to a cloud server and is accessed
    using IOT. IOT approach eliminates the need for constant manual monitoring. It
    uses a cloud server to store and perform data analytics to control connected devices.
    This concept provides cost-effective and optimal solutions to the farmers with
    minimal manual intervention. A solar powered IOT sensors will be an energy efficient
    option to smart gardening. With these sensors, the greenhouse state, plants and
    water consumption can be monitored via digital alerts from the system to the grower
    through a mobile apps and online web portal. Automatic irrigation is carried out
    in this intelligent system. An automated worm farm system is integrated to supply
    organic fertilizer for the garden. Worms can turn organic waste into fertilizer,
    so integrated worm farm can ensure a regular supply of organic fertilizer to the
    plants. A water system from a fish tank will add the advantage as the water source
    is very rich in nitrogen and other nutrients came from fish waste in pond water.
    This multi-function IOT garden is proposed for the indigenous community to give
    them the digital empowerment to adopt and use technology in their everyday life.
    This is a work in progress. Results have shown that 50% growth of kangkung plant
    is recorded in 7 days with IOT farming against traditional farming.

    worldwide, we can see an incensement in the food needs of people, with the demographic
    explosion and the higher consumption in homes, it is necessary to look for more
    sources of food; this situation is increasingly aggravated by the erosion of soils,
    which leads the search for new areas of agricultural production that are naturally
    becoming scarce. This situation is harder in developing countries where agriculture
    is one of the main sources of work and income of its population, Ecuador being
    a mainly agricultural country, Footnote 1 necessarily must look for new ways to
    cultivate the land and one of them are hydroponic crops [1, 2]. Hydroponics or
    hydroponic agriculture is a technique that consists in cultivating without soil,
    also called agriculture without soil. In different parts of the world, this type
    of crop is widely used, especially in places where conventional agriculture presents
    adverse conditions. In Ecuador, acceptance is being reached for this type of crops
    where they can become a good alternative for food in homes [3]. However, although
    the benefits of this type of agriculture are encouraging, performing these types
    of crops at a commercial level is often complicated given the amount of nutrients
    that the water must have so that it can nourish the plants in an adequate manner;
    Due to this, we developed a MODULAR HYDROPONIC SYSTEM controlled by a microprocessor
    [4]. The use of this technology will allow us to manage in a better way this type
    of crops, since with the help of sensors it will be possible to monitor and control
    the level of hydrogen concentration present in some solutions. When sensing all
    pH levels in the water, the system will have a module that will proceed to inject
    saline solution to level the necessary values so that the crops can continue their
    growth stage. 2 Related Works Japiest [5] is an intelligent integral system for
    the prevention, diagnosis and control of diseases affecting tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),
    which are grown in hydroponic greenhouses, in which temperature, humidity and
    nutrient consumption can influence the diseases or pests that crops may get, this
    tool helps farmers to make decisions to apply appropriate control treatments to
    treat a disease or pest. Domingues et al. [6] presents the development of a software-managed
    system that monitors the conductivity and the PH of the lettuce (Lactuca sativa),
    as it is one of the highest consumption vegetables, the study was carried out
    for 24 h, meaning the production cycle, it is also possible to adjust any variation,
    by using solenoid valves that provide acid or nutrient solutions. The proposal
    was evaluated in two different ways: one was hydroponics in a controlled greenhouse
    with the system devices and those cultivated manually in the soil. As results,
    it was obtained that using the developed system analyzing agronomic and chemical
    parameters, the precocity in the harvest was demonstrated, offering the farmer
    an effective and viable alternative. Ibayashi et al. [7] in his paper A Reliable
    Wireless Control System for Tomato Hydroponics, proposes a reliable wireless control
    system for a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) hydroponics crop, this system has fault
    tolerance and self-healing functions to recover from packet transmission failures.
    The system achieved a hydroponic solution supply control in real time without
    data loss by using a 400 MHz WSN band in the tomato hydroponic harvest. Under
    the approach presented in this article, Saaid [8] presents an investigation in
    which the pH level in the crop´s water solution will be maintained automatically
    by the microcontroller and measured by a sensor, in such a way that the pH level
    begins to change, and the effects of the water solution were determined. This
    research also focuses on the ability to adjust the pH value in the water solution
    for (DWC) Deep Water Culture that allows the normal and more efficient growth
    of the plant. In his work Ferentinos [9], develops two separate fault detection
    models: one for the detection of faulty operation of a deep-trough hydroponic
    system which is caused by mechanical, actuator or sensor faults, and one for the
    detection of a category of biological faults [10], this work supports in the previous
    analysis for the first model, where he properly sensed a faulty situation in a
    very short time, within 20 or 40 min for the devices and shows that a neural network
    have useful generalization capabilities. As Savvas [11] this development was applied
    to a pepper (Capsicum annuum) crop in closed hydroponic systems in a glasshouse,
    with two different irrigation regimes by adding NaCI, also combined with two different
    levels of irrigation frequency in a two-factorial experimental design. After nearly
    three months they converged gradually to maximal levels depending on the NaCl
    treatment, which is a similar approach as Tuberosa [12]. 3 Methodology For the
    development of this hydroponic modular system controlled by microprocessors, it
    was sought to relate the areas of agriculture with technology; and with this,
    achieve to encourage the community to be able to implement this system for the
    improvement of the techniques used in hydroponic crops [13]. For the implementation
    of the system, the component-based software process model was used; which is based
    on the reuse of a large number of components. Component-based projects seek re-use
    informally, since when assigning a work team to a project, they develop the skill
    and expertise of codes, similar to the one requested and many times even the designated
    project, since when searching and using it only is modified according to the needs
    of our system, making its reuse independent of the processes used for its development
    and thus providing specific functionalities. The fundamental part that was used
    for the execution of this system was the free hardware, which allows us to implement
    the system without a significant increase in costs. This hardware has been implemented
    using microcontrollers and one of the most popular is the so-called ARDUINO [14,
    15], which is based on open source hardware and software. It details the way in
    which this electronic device was used, where signals captured by sensors were
    entered, after developing algorithms for the management of these inputs and thereby
    generating output signals that are used to indicate the status of the hydrogen
    concentration in the water of the hydroponic crops and in turn, if necessary,
    saline solution is added to obtain the required pH levels [16]. The system does
    not use a “software” as such, the configuration of the inputs and outputs is made
    directly using the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) which is open-source.
    Figure 1 shows the hardware connection diagram, where the connections are established
    between an Arduino Mega 2560 card, as the general controller of the system, an
    8-channel relay, that will allow to operate the valves in charge of the automated
    irrigation of the crop and several different sensors that will measure the different
    analogue values of the harvest and command actions deployed by the Arduino, as
    for example irrigation of the substrate in case it is necessary. It is observed
    that this is a simple circuit that could be implemented in an agile and simple
    way, and does not need a large space to be installed, it is completed by a stainless
    steel structure and ordinary PVC pipes to contain the resulting crops (Fig. 2).
    Fig. 1. Hardware connection diagram Full size image Fig. 2. Actual hardware connected
    Full size image A. Sensors To obtain data of the level of hydrogen concentration
    in water, it is necessary to use sensors, for the development a pH sensor was
    used, its operation consists of detecting the electric current, which can be a
    negative or positive value, and its generated by the existence of hydrogen ions
    present in the water. This device is composed of an electrode, a BNC connector
    and a sensor circuit. The sensor circuit is an integrated element that facilitates
    reading the pH level, it uses an asynchronous communication protocol, used in
    computer systems due to its compatibility with other components. In addition to
    the measurements of the concentration of hydrogen in the hydroponic harvest, its
    humidity must also be monitored, this action consists of measuring the humidity
    due to the variation of its conductivity and thus be able to activate the irrigation
    system. The humidity sensor used is the FC-28, which is a plate that allows us
    to obtain the measurement as an analogue value or as an digital output signal
    activated when humidity exceeds a certain threshold, which are values ranging
    from 0 (submerged in water) to 1023 (in the air or dry substrate). As for the
    digital output, this is triggered by exceeding the humidity threshold that is
    adjusted by a potentiometer built into the YL-83 module, to obtain a LOW signal,
    if the substrate is not wet and HIGH when the humidity exceeds the set value,
    it will depend on the type of soil or substrate and the presence of fertilizers,
    since different plants do not require the same humidity, so the calibration of
    the analog value of the YL-83 module must be done in the workplace. B. Results:
    First of all, achieve the interconnection of the different components, the different
    sensors have to be are calibrated. With the pH sensor, the correct calibration
    is checked with the pH 10.00 solution. After checking the pH sensor calibration,
    the levels present in the solution are observed, this is observed with the Arduino
    interface. To verify the correct functioning of the implemented system, a hydroponic
    crop of peppers (Capsicum annuum) was implemented. The proper growth of the vegetable
    crop was supported with the appropriate pH level in the nutrient solution, this
    result was given by the pH sensor, which varies according to the type of harvest.
    Up next the measure of acidity or alkalinity in the crop is shown for the vegetable
    chosen for the validation of the proposal. In Table 1, pH levels for a pepper
    crop, it is indicated that the levels suitable for the pepper range from 6.5 to
    7.5, the pH sensor is in charge of controlling the adequate levels in the nutrient
    solution based on the programming code of the microcontroller and calibration
    of the pH circuit. Table 1. PH levels for a peppers crop Full size table The showed
    results are based on a survey with subjective questions made to experts in the
    area of agriculture, who compared the products obtained using the automated hydroponic
    system, in contrast, to products obtained by conventional sowing, with a similar
    period of time to develop. 4 Analysis Due to the correct measurement of the pH
    sensor and humidity sensor that activate valves for automatic irrigation, we proceed
    to demonstrate the growth result of the pepper crop which takes about three months
    of development and flowering in the structure of the hydroponic system. It must
    be taken into consideration the rapid growth of hydroponic harvest compared to
    conventional crops [17, 18], due to the high proportion of air that it has, this
    becomes a saving of light and products, to be less time in growth than in land,
    with hydroponics, a larger size is reached in the same time of cultivation than
    on land. Analyzing the air issues, its greater presence favors a development of
    the roots much higher than on land, which produces a higher production than on
    land, or at least, it is usually easier to get more production in hydroponics
    [19] The flavors tend to be lighter, although the washing of roots in hydroponics
    will be much easier than on land, and, depending on the hydroponic system, it
    is usually also cleaner than on land. Both, at the time of the crop and at the
    time of throwing the surplus of the crop, in hydroponics it will be much easier
    to recycle the harvest products (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Flowering in two months of the
    pepper cultivation Full size image 5 Conclusions With the construction of the
    structure of the hydroponic system it was possible to apply technological solutions
    in the field of agriculture, through a prototype applied to hydroponics with intelligent
    and independent automated irrigation, based on the results provided by the sensors
    to the microcontroller. Not all plant crops nourish with the same pH value for
    their proper growth and flowering in the nutrient solution, so using the pH sensor
    we can apply the appropriate level of pH required by the crop in order to be able
    to carry out an agricultural precision. The main function is through the use of
    free hardware components [20] from different manufacturers that were connected
    together, in order to convert the analog values present in the nutritive solution
    into digital values sent to the microcontroller, which in turn executes the determined
    actions. For the standard avr-libc programming of the source code of the Atmel
    microcontroller of the arduino mega, free programming software was used, such
    as the IDE Arduino. It must be taken into consideration that the system has some
    limitations, such as the fact that a stable and continuous energy supply is required,
    which suggests the implementation of voltage surge protectors, against voltage
    variations and energy backup systems due to the sensitivity of the elements, in
    addition that the system is developed for a specific vegetable, as a result of
    the different controls implemented. At the same time, the developed work can be
    improved through a macro project that seeks to implement an orchard with a greater
    number of vegetable varieties, with the respective expansion of sensors, research
    and new configuration of controllers, or on the contrary, micro projects to encourage
    the population to have homemade hydroponic crops as an alternative source of food
    for nutrition. Notes 1. http://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/estadisticas-agropecuarias-2/.

  description: This paper presents an irrigation system that controls the water distribution
    and determines the amount of water to be provided for a given area in the farm.
    The computed amount of water was based on the data gathered from the environmental
    sensors and actuators installed in the farm. Brassica Rapa, or commonly known
    as Chinese cabbage were the crop being cultivated when the study was conducted.
    The system was composed of a microcontroller with the integration of environmental
    sensor node and actuator node; the actuator node composed of rain gauge and flow
    meter and the sensor node which was composed of temperature and humidity sensor.
    Each node serves as an IoT device. A web application presents the environmental
    parameters being monitored and the controls of each node and configuration settings
    for irrigation. It shows the maximum, minimum, current and the average readings
    for the temperature and humidity sensor. For the computation of the amount of

  description: In recent years, precision agriculture and Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) technology have attracted great attention and concentration in industrial
    and academic levels. The combination between WSNs and the agricultural sector
    will be beneficial to solve several issues and challenges. This combination can
    realize a set of benefits such as improving the quality of the agricultural product,
    increasing the efficiency of production, improving the efficiency of crop, and
    conserving energy and water resources. Precision agriculture manages a set of
    different services (e.g., irrigation, fertilization), especially irrigation systems.
    The irrigation system is considered one of the most critical factors for successful
    agricultural production and development of the agriculture. However, the current
    irrigation systems are characterized by poor performance and a significant increase
    in demand for agricultural productivity. In addition, these current systems are
    affected by many factors and problems such as the water scarcity, drought, and
    waste of limited water resources. To correct these problems, we propose a prototype
    for an intelligent irrigation system that is based on the integration of a drip
    irrigation technique with the wireless sensor network. In this paper, we develop
    an automated and intelligent irrigation technique using a WSN and ZigBee wireless
    communication technology for saving water and increasing the performance and efficiency
    of irrigation systems and we present the operation and design of this system.
    The proposed system controls irrigation water through the detection of temperature
    and soil moisture and other environmental parameters; the data is measured using
    several special sensors deployed near the root part of plants. This system also
    allows an analysis and checks the measured data with a developed base of threshold
    values for each measured parameter in order to activate or deactivate the irrigation
    mechanism. The main aims of our proposed system are saving of water, time, and
    energy.

  description: A prescription map is a set of instructions that controls a variable
    rate irrigation (VRI) system. These maps, which may be based on prior yield, soil
    texture, topography, or soil electrical conductivity data, are often manually
    applied at the beginning of an irrigation season and remain static. The problem
    with static prescription maps is that they ignore spatiotemporal changes in crop
    water status. In a two-year study (2012 and 2013), a plant feedback system, including
    a wireless sensor network of infrared thermometers (IRTs), was used to develop
    dynamic prescription maps to accomplish adaptive irrigation scheduling for cotton
    (Gossypium hirsutum L.). One-half of a center pivot field was divided into manually
    and plant feedback-controlled irrigation treatment plots. Irrigation treatments
    were at three levels, 75, 50 and 25 percent of full as defined by either replenishment
    of crop water use to field capacity or by the equivalent threshold of the IRT
    sensed crop water stress. The system accepted user input to control irrigation
    for the manual treatment plots (I<inf>75M</inf>, I<inf>50M</inf>, and I<inf>25M</inf>),
    and calculated and compared a thermal stress index for each plant feedback-controlled
    treatment plot (I<inf>75C</inf>, I<inf>50C</inf> and I<inf>25C</inf>) with a pre-determined
    threshold for automated irrigation scheduling. The effectiveness of the plant
    feedback irrigation scheduling system was evaluated by comparing measured lint
    yield, crop water use (ET<inf>c</inf>), and water use efficiency (WUE) with the
    manually scheduled treatment plots. Results for both years indicated that average
    lint yields were similar between the manual and plant feedback-control plots at
    the I<inf>75</inf> level (181 and 182gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in 2012; 115
    and 103gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in 2013) and I<inf>50</inf> level (146 and
    164gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in 2012; 95 and 117gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively,
    in 2013). At the I<inf>25</inf> level, average lint yield was significantly greater
    for the plant feedback-compared with the manual-control treatment plots (142gm<sup>-2</sup>
    and 92gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively), but the mean amount of irrigation was twice
    that of the manual-control plots. Mean water use efficiencies (WUE) within the
    same irrigation treatment levels were similar between methods. Importantly, the
    automatic plant feedback system did not require the time consuming and expensive
    manual reading of neutron probe access tubes that was required to schedule the
    manual treatments. These results demonstrate that the integration of a plant feedback
    system with a commercial VRI system could be used to control site-specific irrigation
    management for cotton at higher irrigation treatment levels, i.e., I<inf>75</inf>
    percent and I<inf>50</inf> percent of full. Such a system can facilitate the use
    of a VRI system by automating prescription map coding and providing dynamic irrigation
    control instructions to meet variable crop water needs throughout the irrigation
    season. As of yet, further research is required to maintain automatic deficit
    irrigation at a level equivalent to 25 percent replenishment of crop water use
    relative to field capacity.

    with a plant feedback system. Abstract A prescription map is a set of instructions
    that controls a variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. These maps, which may be

    and compared a thermal stress index for each plant feedback-controlled treatment
    plot (I75C, I50C and I25C) with a pre-determined threshold for automated irrigation
    scheduling. The effectiveness of the plant feedback irrigation scheduling system
    was evaluated by comparing measured lint yield, crop water use (ETc), and water
    use efficiency (WUE) with the manually scheduled treatment plots. Results for
    both years indicated that average lint yields were similar between the manual
    and plant feedback-control plots at the I75 level (181 and 182 g m−2, respectively,
    in 2012; 115 and 103 g m−2, respectively, in 2013) and I50 level (146 and 164
    g m−2, respectively, in 2012; 95 and 117 g m−2, respectively, in 2013). At the
    I25 level, average lint yield was significantly greater for the plant feedback-compared
    with the manual-control treatment plots (142 g m−2 and 92 g m−2, respectively),
    but the mean amount of irrigation was twice that of the manual-control plots.
    Mean water use efficiencies (WUE) within the same irrigation treatment levels
    were similar between methods. Importantly, the automatic plant feedback system
    did not require the time consuming and expensive manual reading of neutron probe

    demonstrate that the integration of a plant feedback system with a commercial

    irrigation (VRI) systems provide the flexibility of delivering accurate but variable
    depths of water along a sprinkler lateral or in the direction of sprinkler travel
    (Dukes and Perry, 2006, Han et al., 2009, Chávez et al., 2010, Evans et al., 2010,
    O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013a). These systems are now commercially available and
    could be used as a tool for improving crop water management by delivering water
    to plants where needed, when the crop demands it and in the appropriate amounts.
    Prescription maps, sets of coded instructions, control pivot movement and flows
    to apply specific irrigation depths for each management zone. Management zones
    are defined by the radial extent of controlled sets of drop hoses along the sprinkler
    lateral, and by the angular extent of pivot rotation in the direction of travel.
    Prescription maps for a VRI system are usually generated at the beginning of a
    growing season, manually uploaded to the irrigation control panel (Evans et al.,
    2013), and typically based on geo-referenced data from prior yields, soil texture,
    apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), or topographical elevations. Static
    prescription maps are problematic in the sense that spatiotemporal variability
    of crop water stress throughout the growing season is overlooked. Such variability
    can be a consequence of spatially variable precipitation, topography, variable
    soil infiltration rates and soil storage capacity (Sadler et al., 2005), variable
    plant stand, or disease and pest infestation (Falkenberg et al., 2007). Additionally
    crop evapotranspiration varies over a growing season and between years, due to
    fluxes in radiation, temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure deficit. Dynamic
    prescription maps resulting from continuous monitoring and assessment of climatological
    and crop data are highly desirable. Crop water stress has been characterized using
    infrared thermometry (Nielsen and Anderson, 1989), and theoretical (Jackson et
    al., 1981) and empirical (Idso and Reginato, 1982, Wanjura and Upchurch, 2000,
    Barbosa da Silva and Rao, 2005) thermal stress indices. Information from IRTs
    mounted on a moving sprinkler irrigation system with a global positioning system
    (GPS) has been demonstrated to provide spatial and temporal crop water status
    (Sadler et al., 2002, Peters and Evett, 2007, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2011a) at
    the field scale. By continuous crop canopy temperature and meteorological monitoring,
    the use of IRTs on a moving VRI irrigation sprinkler provides plant feedback control
    (Fig. 1) for irrigation scheduling. Control of irrigation is possible using threshold
    stress indices (Nielsen and Gardner, 1987, Garrot et al., 1994, Evett et al.,
    1996, Evett et al., 2002, Barbosa da Silva and Rao, 2005, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008).
    The amount of irrigation to be delivered can be determined using multiples of
    peak daily water use (i.e., frequency of repeat travel over a management zone
    multiplied by daily peak crop water use) (Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010) or by estimating crop water requirements using weather based
    measurements and crop coefficients. After the sprinkler travels over the field,
    the need to schedule an irrigation is automatically re-assessed for each management
    zone. In the strictest sense, plant feedback systems are open-loop feedback systems.
    However, crop response (yields and water use efficiencies) using plant feedback
    systems for irrigation scheduling has been similar to or better than crop response
    from irrigation scheduling using direct soil water measurements with the neutron
    probe (BIOTIC method, Upchurch et al., 1996; the time-temperature-threshold method,
    Evett et al., 1996, Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010; CWSI
    and time threshold, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012; and the integrated CWSI (iCWSI),
    O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013b). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Design
    of integrated system of wireless sensor network and variable rate irrigation sprinkler
    controlled with dynamic plant feedback prescription maps. If prescription maps
    are constructed using geo-referenced plant sensing data and pre-established thresholds
    to indicate where, when, and the depth of irrigation required, then dynamic site-specific
    instructions for irrigation scheduling can be developed throughout the irrigation
    season. These dynamic prescription maps could direct site-specific irrigation
    according to crop water needs, potentially improving crop water use efficiency
    by irrigating the crop only when it needs it, and reducing the likelihood of excessive
    irrigations, runoff and deep percolation. Using a computer for centralized data
    collection, storage and control, construction and uploading of the maps can be
    automated. However, to date, the effectiveness of dynamic prescription maps for
    controlling site-specific variable rate irrigation using plant feedback methods
    has not been demonstrated. Therefore, our specific objectives were to: (1) assess
    the feasibility of developing dynamic prescription maps from a plant feedback
    system for irrigation control of a center pivot outfitted with a commercial VRI
    package; and (2) evaluate irrigation control via the dynamic prescription maps
    by comparing cotton responses of lint yield, water use (ETc), and crop water use
    efficiency (WUE) from plots irrigated automatically using the plant feedback system
    with the responses of plots irrigated manually based on weekly neutron probe readings.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site and irrigation system The two-year
    study was conducted at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL),
    Bushland, Texas (35°11′N, 102°06′W, 1170 m above mean sea level). The field soil
    was a Pullman clay loam, a fine, mixed, superactive, thermic, Torrertic Paleustoll
    (Soil Survey Staff, 2004). The field capacity (0.33 m3 m−3) and wilting point
    (0.18 m3 m−3) (Unger and Pringle, 1981) water contents were assumed uniform across
    the center pivot field. The climate is semi-arid with an average annual rainfall
    of 470 mm. Upland cotton, delta pine, variety 1212RFBG21 was planted on May 19,
    2012, day of year (DOY) 140, and on May 31, 2013 (DOY 151) at a rate of 198,000
    seeds ha−1. The planting date was delayed in 2013 due to low spring soil temperatures.
    Irrigations were applied in alternate furrows with low energy precision application
    (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every other furrow. Furrows were
    diked to minimize runoff (Schneider and Howell, 1995) and to provide temporary
    detention required for LEPA irrigation. 2.2. System design The plant feedback
    system (Fig. 1) was comprised of a wireless sensor network (WSN) system of infrared
    thermometers (IRTs) (Melexis, MLX90614, Ieper, Belgium) and meteorological data
    integrated with a commercial VRI system. The embedded computer (base station)
    was located at the pivot point and provided central data collection and data processing.
    Data collected at the base-station was time stamped and geo-spatially referenced.
    Prescription maps were built every two days using data manually entered by the
    user and information calculated by the embedded computer. The manual input was
    the amount of water to be applied to replenish 100% of mean soil water depletion
    to field capacity to the manual treatment plots in the I75 treatment level. Irrigation
    applied was 75%, 50%, and 25% of the amount entered by the user, and was calculated
    within the embedded computer. The integrated crop water stress index (iCWSI) values
    were calculated for daylight hours from continuous crop canopy temperature and
    meteorological data collected over a 24 h period. More details are provided later
    in this section. 2.3. Variable rate irrigation system The irrigation system was
    a three-span center pivot with a 131 m lateral, retrofitted with a commercial
    variable rate irrigation (VRI) package (Valmont Industries1, Valley, Nebr.). Each
    drop hose was plumbed with a hydraulic valve, which pulsed water “on” and “off”
    and regulated to 41.4 kPa. The pivot lateral was configured for 12 irrigation
    zones. Each irrigation zone was comprised of six sprinkler drop hoses that were
    hydraulically connected and actuated by a single electronic solenoid valve. A
    programmable logic controller in the irrigation system’s control panel regulated
    the VRI hardware using the prescription map uploaded into the control panel using
    an RS-232 serial connection between the computer and control panel. A wide area
    augmentation system (WAAS) corrected GPS, with a differential position accuracy
    of ±3 m, communicated with the programmable logic controller using power line
    carrier communication. 2.4. Sensor network systems The wireless sensor network
    (WSN) was comprised of a base station (embedded computer) at the pivot point,
    infrared thermometers (IRTs) installed on the pivot lateral and in the field below
    as described by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2013b), and a weather station located in
    near proximity (8 m from the pivot point). The wireless IRTS (simple IRTs) and
    multiband radiometers (MBRs) were developed at the USDA-ARS CPRL. The thermal
    detectors of each instrument were calibrated in a temperature controlled chamber
    against a commercial black body prior to the beginning of each growing season
    using methods similar to those described in O’Shaughnessy et al. (2011b), in ambient
    temperatures of 15 °C, 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C, while the black body temperature
    was stepped down from 55 °C to 10 °C in increments of 5 °C. The infrared thermal
    detector is an off-the-shelf sensor (Melexis, Model MLX90614BCF, Belgium) with
    a field of view (FOV) of 28° and a pass filter ranging from 8 to 14 μm. The temperature
    accuracy is 0.5 °C over the range of 0–50 °C for the target and sensor body temperature.
    The measurement resolution is 0.01 °C. In 2012, eight simple IRTs were mounted
    on masts located on the pivot lateral at the border of each concentric plot looking
    inwards at an oblique angle (angle of 135° relative to the vertical mast on which
    the sensor was mounted). The sensor was pointed slightly forward at an azimuth
    angle of 70° between the direction of pivot travel and the crop row. The simple
    IRTs were housed in weather-proof cases milled from solid white ploy-vinyl chloride
    (PVC), and measured 17.8 cm in length and 4.4 cm in diameter. The sensors located
    on the pivot lateral viewed the cropped field forward of the irrigations and were
    maintained at a height approximately 1.0 m above the crop canopy. Additionally,
    three IRTs were placed in the well-watered inner border region (Fig. 2) at nadir-looking
    views and adjusted to maintain a height of 1.0 m above the crop canopy. Data from
    these sensors were used as reference temperature measurements for the scaling
    algorithm (described below). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Experimental
    field layout; plots designated with the letter “M” indicate manual irrigation
    scheduling using weekly readings from a neutron probe, and those with a “C” indicate
    irrigation scheduling using the plant feedback algorithm (iCWSI) for (a) 2012
    and (b) 2013. In 2013, wireless multiband radiometers were used in lieu of simple
    IRTs. The sensor housing measured 23.0 cm in length and was 6.5 cm in diameter.
    The MBRs contained three filter/detectors with bands in the visible range, red
    (685 ± 35 nm), blue (450 ± 40 nm), and green (560 ± 10 nm) range; one filter/detector
    with a band in the near infrared (NIR) (880 ± 50 nm) range; and the infrared temperature
    sensor (Melexis). The white PVC housing for the photodiode detectors was designed
    to collimate light onto each detector/filter (Intor, model T-5, Soccoro, NM).
    The MBRs were developed by ARS scientists at the CPRL in Bushland, TX. The MBR
    footprint was a circular pattern with a FOV determined to be 28°. These sensors
    were mounted as described for the simple IRTs used in 2012. Reflectance measurements
    from visible bands within the MBR were individually calibrated against red, blue,
    and green (5 cm × 5 cm) samples in a color chart (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ)
    in full sunlight and then cross-calibrated against a reference sensor over larger
    colored targets. During the individual calibrations, each MBR was positioned in
    a nadir view over the color sample of interest. The readings were taken in full
    sunlight to enable us to determine the maximum response of each band, while the
    minimum response was determined by capping the sensors with an opaque cover. This
    procedure provided a qualitative means to determine if the photodiode detectors
    were responding appropriately. The cross-calibration procedure required simultaneous
    reflectance measurements of multiple sensors over large (2 m × 2 m) color targets
    (red, blue and green). These targets were made of plywood and spray-painted to
    achieve an even coat of color. One of the eight MBRs was chosen as a reference
    sensor and was always included during batch measurements with the other MBRs.
    During the batch measurements, the MBRs were placed in a nadir-looking view over
    the large target, and measurements were made over daylight hours. A band-to-band
    cross-calibration was made between each photodiode detector of a MBR and the corresponding
    photodiode detector of the reference MBR. Coefficients from the resulting linear
    regression equations were used to establish custom calibration equations for each
    photodiode detector of each MBR. Coefficients were entered into the base station.
    Even with these calibrations, it was expected that reflectance readings from the
    MBRs would vary due to differences at the circuit board level, height above the
    canopy, and variations in the viewing angle from manually adjusting and aiming
    the MBRs. Prior to deploying the sensors on the pivot lateral, continuous reflectance
    measurements were then made over dry and wet soil (Pullman clay loam) and green
    vegetation-grass fetch at the CPRL weather pen and winter wheat planted on the
    laboratory. The grass represented an example of a pixel that was comprised nearly
    of 100% vegetation, the winter wheat samples represented pixels that were of mixed
    percent vegetation and soil. A customized metal stand was built to accommodate
    six MBRs. An algorithm was used to qualify the thermal data as being relevant
    to either plants or some mixture of soil and plants in the viewing area. The algorithm
    was based on a normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) (Rouse et al., 1974)
    calculated with reflectance measurements taken from the NIR and red bands (ρNIR
    − ρred)/(ρNIR + ρred) and concomitant with the reading of the thermal band. Thermal
    measurements recorded in conjunction with NDVI values less than 0.25 were not
    used to calculate the iCWSI. Radiometric instruments capturing mixed pixels of
    vegetation and soil are a common problem in agricultural applications. Jiang et
    al. (2006) demonstrated that NDVI over partially vegetated surfaces were non-linear
    and that NDVI calculated at different resolutions were not comparable. Additionally,
    the detection of water stress and disease using thermal images can be confounded
    with pixels containing a mixture of soil and vegetation (Jones and Sirault, 2014).
    When canopy temperature is used for irrigation scheduling, temperatures resulting
    from pixels comprised mainly of soil can result in false positive triggers and
    over-irrigation in the long run. After the analyses of NDVI from multiple measurements
    over grass, wheat and soil, we determined that at NDVI values <0.25 there was
    enough soil background to make the temperature data unrepresentative of the plant
    water status. Data from the wireless IRTs and MBRs were sampled every 5 s, averaged
    and stored every minute, and transmitted ad hoc every 5 min to the base station.
    Meteorological data (wind speed, relative humidity, air temperature and solar
    irradiance) were sampled every 5 s, and averaged and stored every minute to the
    weather station''s datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah). Weather
    station data were polled hourly by the base station using radio telemetry in the
    900 MHz bandwidth. 2.5. Treatment plots and irrigation scheduling Treatments consisted
    of three irrigation levels and two irrigation-scheduling methods, replicated four
    times. The irrigation treatment amounts were 75%, 50%, and 25% of full as defined
    by either replenishment of crop water use to field capacity or by the equivalent
    threshold for the IRT sensed crop water stress. One-half of the center pivot field
    was cropped and divided into seven radial sectors of 24° each, and four concentric
    plots, and inside and outside borders for well-watered cotton. Treatment plots
    were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications (Fig.
    2). The width of each plot was 18 m (defined by two irrigation zones), and consisted
    of 24 plant rows. Access tubes were placed in a row in the center of each plot
    (24 rows wide). The pivot scanned the field on even days of the year (DOY). On
    odd DOY, a prescription map was automatically coded from canopy temperature and
    meteorological data for the plant feedback-control plots (designated with a “C”
    for CWSI), and from user input for the manual-control plots (designated with an
    “M”) (Fig. 2). Plots were irrigated on odd DOY as instructed by the updated prescription
    map. The maximum application depth of the irrigation system was fixed at 20 mm
    by setting the pivot travel speed at the end tower to 43.8 m h−1 (19° h−1). Treatment
    plots designated I0 were quasi-dryland established to compute IWUE. These plots
    did not receive irrigation past the establishment of a uniform plant stand. 2.5.1.
    Manual method Manual irrigations were scheduled weekly and carried out over 2
    or 3 days as needed in a 7-day period and based on 75%, 50%, and 25%, (designated
    I75M, I50M, and I25M, respectively) replenishment of crop water use to field capacity
    in the top 1.5 m of soil. Soil water content was determined weekly using a neutron
    probe (NP) (model 503DR1.5, Instrotek, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Martinez, Cal.)
    in 0.2 m increments from 0.10 m to 2.3 m (center of measurement) in the I75M treatment
    plots. The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy of better than 0.01
    m3 m−3, resulting in separate calibrations for three distinct soil layers, Ap,
    Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Any precipitation occurring
    prior to irrigation of the total amount for the week was subtracted from the required
    total. 2.5.2. Plant feedback method Infrared thermometers located on the pivot
    lateral recorded temperature measurements of crop canopy as the pivot moved across
    the field. Therefore, canopy temperature measurements were recorded from different
    parts of the field at different times of the day. By using the temperature-scaling
    algorithm developed by Peters and Evett (2004), temperature measurements comparable
    in time were estimated for each portion of the field over daylight hours. In doing
    so, stress indices developed from canopy temperature measurements could be compared
    across different parts of the field for the same time of day. The scaling algorithm
    uses a one-time-of-day temperature reading taken during daylight hours, and scales
    it to a known reference temperature curve (taken from measurements made with stationary
    IRTs located in the field over well-watered plants, Fig. 2) and a measured early
    morning temperature: (2.1) where Te (°C) was the predawn canopy temperature; Tref
    (°C) was the reference canopy temperature at the same time interval as Ts (°C);
    Trmt,t was the one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurement at the plot (remote
    location, denoted by subscript rmt) at any daylight time t measured by the IRTs
    on the pivot lateral; and Tref,t (°C) was the measured reference temperature for
    the time t that the plot (remote) temperature measurement was taken. The integrated
    CWSI (iCWSI) thresholds were calculated for every minute, t, and averaged over
    each treatment plot between the hours of 9:00 am and 7:00 pm (inclusive), using
    a theoretical CWSI (Jackson et al., 1981): (2.2) (2.3) (2.4) (2.5) where dT was
    the difference between measured canopy (Tc) and air temperature (Ta), dTll was
    the estimated lower limit for a well-watered crop and assumes that bulk canopy
    resistance (rc) = 0, while dTul was the estimated upper limit for a non-transpiring
    crop and assumes that rc approaches infinity. Net radiation, Rn (MJ m−2 d−1),
    was estimated as the difference between incoming net shortwave and outgoing net
    longwave radiation using equations 38, 39, and 40 in FAO-56; albedo (α) = 0.23;
    G = soil heat flux (MJ m−2 d−1) was estimated using equation 45 from FAO-56; ρ
    (kg m−3) was the density of air approximated as a function of air temperature,
    ρ; Cp = specific heat capacity of dry air (1013 J kg−1 °C−1); and ra was aerodynamic
    resistance (Eq. (2.6)) (FAO-56). The psychrometric constant, γ (Pa °C−1) was calculated
    as a function of Cp, ρ, and latent heat of vaporization; Δ was the derivative
    of the saturated vapor pressure-temperature relationship calculated at the average
    of canopy and air temperature expressed in °C (as in Jackson et al., 1988); es
    was saturated vapor pressure, ea was actual vapor pressure, and ra = aerodynamic
    resistance (s m−1). (2.6) where zm = height of wind measurements (m); zom = roughness
    length (m) for momentum transfer, approximated by 0.123 × crop height; zh = height
    of humidity measurements (m); d = zero plane displacement height (m), approximated
    by 2/3 × crop height; zoh = roughness length governing transfer of heat and vapor
    (m), approximated by 0.1 × zom; k = von Karman’s constant = 0.41; and uz = wind
    speed (m s−1). Three threshold values (thresholdi), where i є (75%, 50%, and 25%),
    were established at 260, 290, and 344 (dimensionless) for the plant feedback treatment
    plots, I75C, I50C, and I25C, respectively. Thresholds were based on previous data
    measured over differentially irrigated cotton at the CPRL in 2007 and 2008 (O’shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010). By varying the stress index thresholds, differential levels
    of irrigation could be achieved, i.e., treatment plots with the higher thresholds
    would receive irrigation signals less frequently than those plots with lower thresholds
    as demonstrated by Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2000, Evett et al., 2002,
    Evett et al., 2006. 2.5.3. Prescription maps For manually irrigated plots, the
    amount of irrigation to replenish 100% of crop water use to field capacity was
    entered using the graphical user interface (Fig. 3). User input at this level
    was provided to satisfy the objective of comparing plant feedback and manual control
    methods of irrigation scheduling. Irrigation amounts delivered to the manual designated
    plots were achieved by pulsing the appropriate sprinkler banks at rates that were
    equivalent to 75%, 50%, and 25% of the entered application depth. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Graphical user interface constructed to deliver the appropriate
    irrigations depths to manual control plots (based on entered data) and to plots
    controlled by the plant feedback method when thresholds were exceeded. The interface
    enables the generation of the prescription map, its uploading to the pivot control
    panel, and the start of an irrigation. For each plant feedback-controlled plot,
    p, a mean daily iCWSIp was calculated after midnight for daylight hours from the
    preceding 24 h period. Mean values for each treatment plot were calculated from
    approximately 85 temperature readings. If the iCWSIp was greater than the assigned
    thresholdi, an application of 20 mm [2 days (frequency of pivot rotation across
    the cropped field) × peak daily crop water use (10 mm)] was delivered to plot,
    p. Plant feedback control-plots generating an irrigation signal were irrigated
    by sprinkler banks delivering water at a rate of 100% (i.e., always “on”) of 20
    mm. When the “generate prescription” button was pressed, watering rates for each
    of the 28 treatment plots were converted into code that was compatible with the
    commercial VRI system (Fig. 3). Treatment plot boundaries were static and defined
    by sectors and sprinkler irrigation zones. A visual prescription map, coded in
    extensible markup language (XML), could be reviewed using commercial software
    provided by the pivot manufacturer prior to uploading the map to the control panel.
    The user could view the prescription map, but could not easily modify the instructions.
    The prescription map was uploaded to the pivot control panel after pressing the
    “send prescription to panel” button, and irrigations were activated using the
    “start irrigation” button. The direction and speed of the pivot, its angular location,
    and water pressure were recorded at one-minute intervals using software previously
    developed by the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS). All code was written
    in visual basic using Microsoft Visual Studio 20101 (version 10.0.4). 2.6. Agronomic
    practices and biophysical measurements Each season, trust (a.i., trifluralin)
    was sprayed as a pre-emergent herbicide at a rate of 2.41 L ha−1 prior to planting.
    In 2012, fertilizers, N and P, were applied at a rate of 68 kg N ha−1, and 37
    kg P ha−1. In 2013, only N was required and applied at a rate of 150 kg N ha−1.
    Preplant irrigation totaled 127 and 107 mm in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Cotton
    was planted later in 2013 due to cool springtime temperatures. Plant height and
    width measurements were recorded every two weeks, and digital images were taken
    of each plot with a RGB digital camera (IS-1, Fuji, Edison, NJ) on a weekly basis
    from late June through the first week of August for both years. Percent canopy
    cover was determined using Multispec ver 3.3, Multispectral Image Data Analysis
    System software (Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN). The supervised classification
    was performed in a manner similar to that described by Colaizzi et al. (2010).
    Bolls were harvested by hand on DOY 303-305 in 2012, and on DOY 299 and 300 in
    2013. 2.7. Sampling methods and calculations Plant sampling, height and width
    measurements were recorded approximately every two weeks from three subsamples
    in each of the 28 treatment plots. Bolls were harvested by hand from a 10 m2 area
    near the middle of each plot and stored in cotton bags inside of a drying facility
    for three months. A 500 g subsample of cotton from each plot was ginned at the
    Texas AgriLife Gin in Lubbock, TX. 2.7.1. ET, WUE, and IWUE Water use or ET was
    calculated using the soil water balance equation: ET = P + I + F − ΔS − R (2.7)
    where ET is evapotranspiration, ΔS is the change in soil water stored in the profile,
    R is runoff, P is precipitation (mm), I is the irrigation water applied (mm),
    and F is flux across the lower boundary of the control volume (taken as positive
    when entering the control volume), all in units of mm. Water use efficiency (kg
    m−3) was calculated as; (2.8) where Yg is the economic yield (g m−2 of lint),
    and ET is the crop water use (mm). Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, kg m−3)
    was calculated as; (2.9) where Yg is the economic yield (g m−2), Ygd is the average
    dryland yield (g m−2), and IRR is the irrigation water applied (mm), Howell (2002).
    2.7.2. Statistical analysis Results were analyzed using mixed models in the PROC
    MIXED models procedures (Littell et al., 2006) with SAS statistical software1
    (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The main factors of irrigation scheduling
    method (plant feedback and manual) and irrigation levels (75%, 50%, and 25%) were
    treated as fixed effects. Concentric plots were considered random effects, and
    their contributions to variability could signal erraticism among sensor measurements.
    Differences between means were tested using least square means. Comparisons of
    multiple means were performed using the Tukey–Kramer method and considered to
    be significant at the p < 0.05 level. Statistical results were analyzed for individual
    seasons. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Weather conditions Drought conditions
    prevailed during both growing seasons (May–October) at Bushland, with precipitation
    totaling only 31% and 38% of the 20-year historical mean of 377 mm for Bushland
    (Howell et al., 2004) (Table 1). In 2012, ninety percent of rainfall received
    in September occurred at the end of the boll-filling stage. In 2013, rainfall
    from May through August was approximately three times that of 2012, and minimal
    rainfall occurred in September. For both seasons, maximum daily air temperatures
    were greatest June through August, and ETo was largest in June. Early in the growing
    season, mean wind speeds in 2013 were greater than in 2012. Table 1. Climatological

    and irrigation amounts Dynamic prescription maps directed irrigation control for
    each of the 28 treatment plots during these two growing seasons. As an example,
    a map of calculated iCWSI values for each treatment plot is shown for DOY 221
    (Fig. 4a). Treatment plots (1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25) where the calculated
    iCWSI exceeded pre-established thresholds are shown in red. The ensuing application
    depth (shown in green; Fig. 4b) for these plots was 100% of 20 mm. The calculated
    iCWSI for plots 7 and 21 were less than the pre-established threshold and are
    shown as white polygons with a watering rate of 0% and application depth of 0
    mm (Fig. 4b). The iCWSI was also calculated for manual-control plots (shown in
    blue; Fig. 4a.), but not used for irrigation scheduling. Download : Download full-size

    signal (hatched plots) show a prescribed watering rate of 100% of the depth applied
    (19 mm), automatic plots that did not receive a signal are shown in white and
    will not be irrigated. I75% manual plots (shown in blue) will receive 75% of the
    applied depth, I50% manual plots shown in pink will receive 50% of the applied
    depth, and I25% manual plots (shown in peach) will receive 25% of the applied
    depth. The northwest side of the field will not irrigate because ARS software
    code turns the water off prior to crossing the pivot road at 58°. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) In 2012, differential irrigation treatment amounts
    (75%, 50% and 25% of 20 mm) were applied on June 19 (DOY 171) and June 20 (172)
    to the I75M and I75C, I50M and I50C, and I25M and I25C treatment plots, respectively,
    by use of the “all plots” button (Fig. 3). Plant feedback irrigation scheduling
    was initiated on June 27, 2012 (DOY 183). Irrigations continued through September
    3, 2012 (DOY 247). In 2013, irrigation treatments were started on July 12, 2013
    (DOY 193), using the “all plots” button. However, 51 mm of precipitation occurred
    between DOY 194 and 199. Differential irrigation treatment amounts (as described
    for 2012) were applied on DOY 205 and DOY 209, and the plant feedback system was
    initiated on DOY 211. In 2012, the mean post-plant irrigation applied at the I75
    level was similar between the plant feedback-control plots and the manual treatment
    plots. In the I50 and I25 treatments, mean post-plant irrigation amounts for the
    plant feedback-control plots were significantly greater, 15% and 120%, respectively,
    than the amounts applied to the corresponding manual-control plots (Table 2).
    At the start of the irrigation season, soil water content was variable among treatment
    plots. For plots, there was evidence of soil water storage at the depths of 30-
    through 110-cm, but no evidence of deep percolation (Fig. A.1, Appendix). No post
    plant irrigation was applied to treatment plots at the I0 treatment level, as
    antecedent soil water content was enough to establish a uniform plant stand in
    these plots. Table 2. Post-plant irrigations for the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons

    plots was similar to the amount applied to the manual-control plots in the I75
    treatment level. In the more deficit-irrigated treatments (I50 and I25), the mean
    irrigation amounts were 24% and 63% greater (significantly so) than manual control
    treatment plots for the respective irrigation treatment levels. However, there
    was no indication of deep percolation from soil water data or observations of
    run-off during the 2013 irrigation seasons (Fig. A.2, Appendix). A review of the
    multiband radiometer data indicated a general negative trend between concomitant
    NDVI calculations and canopy temperature measurements; i.e., temperature measurements
    were generally higher when NDVI was lower (see Fig. A.3, Appendix). Later in the
    irrigation season for the I25 level, leaf wilt occurred due to deficit irrigation;
    this is evidenced by lower mean NDVI values in the I25 treatments for both the
    manual and plant feedback-control plots (Fig. A.4, Appendix). Plant feedback irrigation
    signals in the I25C treatment plots were more frequent early in the 2012 growing
    season as compared to the 2013 season. The mean percent canopy cover for the I25C
    treatment plots was estimated to be 18% from analysis of digital images taken
    on DOY 181 (2012), while in 2013 mean percent canopy cover in the I25C plots was
    49% at the start of plant feedback irrigation scheduling (determined from digital
    images taken on DOY 210). 3.3. Yield, WUE, and IWUE Plant counts were recorded
    during the hand-sampled harvest (Table 3). In 2012, plant counts were similar
    when compared between irrigation methods, irrigation levels, and between irrigation
    method × irrigation treatment levels. During the 2013 season, plants harvested
    in the I0 treatment level were significantly less than those plots receiving irrigation.
    Mean plant numbers in the I25 level were significantly greater for the plant feedback-control
    plots as compared with the manual-control plots. This was likely due to the differences
    in irrigation amounts applied between the two treatment application methods. Although
    planted at the same rate, plant counts were different between years. Cotton seed
    planted in 2013 was from bags purchased in 2012. The age of the seed could have
    contributed to the difference in final plant counts as could the seasonal variability
    in environmental factors between years. Table 3. Cotton response to manual (designated

    0.05a In 2012, overall mean lint yields (129.07 and 111.81 g m−2) and mean ETc
    (502 and 464 mm) were significantly greater in the plant feedback-control plots
    as compared with the manual-control plots, respectively (Table 3). Irrigation
    treatment levels had a significant effect on lint yield and ETc. The highest amounts
    (181.75 g m−2 and 651 mm) occurred in the I75 treatment level and the lowest (27.91
    g m−2 and 252 mm) in the I0 treatment level. Lint yield, ETc, and WUE were significantly
    reduced in the I0 treatment due to the lack of irrigation, which decreased transpiration
    and fruit production. The mean boll number per plant in the irrigated plots was
    3–4, while for the I0 treatment, the mean boll number per plant was 1 (Table A.2,
    Appendix). The low lint yields were expected since cotton yield is dependent on
    the number of bolls produced and the preservation of bolls to maturity, either
    of which can decline from water stress (McMichael and Hesketh, 1982, Yazar et
    al., 2002, Pettigrew, 2004, Ritchie et al., 2009). Water stress can also cause
    an increase in the shedding rate of squares and young bolls as well as limit canopy
    growth (Gerik et al., 1996, Cetin and Bilgel, 2002) and leaf area (Dăgdelen et
    al., 2009). Water use efficiency and IWUE were not dependent on methods or irrigation
    treatment levels. These results of WUE (0.24–0.29 kg m−3) and IWUE (0.32–0.43
    kg m−3) (Table 3) were higher than WUE (0.13–0.17 kg m−3) and IWUE (0.11–0.20
    kg m−3) reported by Colaizzi et al. (2009) where irrigation treatment levels of
    100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% were applied to a short season upland cultivar of cotton
    using low energy precision application (LEPA). However, WUE (0.20–0.29 kg m−3)
    and IWUE (0.31–0.47 kg m−3) were similar to those demonstrated by O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett (2010) for irrigation treatment levels of 100%, 67%, 33% and 0% applied
    to cotton using LEPA. Comparing crop response between methods within each irrigation
    treatment, lint yields at the I75 level were similar between the plant feedback-control
    and the manual treatment plots, even though ETc was significantly less for the
    plant feedback method (626 mm) as compared with the manual method (677 mm). Variations
    in ETc may be due to differences in the amounts and frequencies of irrigation
    by method (manual and plant feedback). When the plant feedback plots received
    irrigation signals, the applied amount was 20 mm, but the amounts for the manual-control
    plots were typically between 13 and 15 mm. After DOY 192, the frequency of irrigation
    signals for the plant feedback-control plots occurred approximately every 3–4
    days, while irrigations were applied every other day to the manual-control plots
    to replenish 75% soil water depletion to field capacity within the seven-day target
    period. Comparing results between methods at the I50 irrigation treatment level,
    mean lint yields (164.2 ± 17 and 146.1 ± 17 g m−2), mean ETc (580 ± 26 and 542
    ± 17 mm) and mean WUE (0.27 ± 0.04 and 0.28 ± 0.02 kg m−3) for the plant feedback
    and manual irrigation treatment plots, respectively, were similar. The relationship
    between lint yield and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was linear for both the manual-
    (Yield = 0.36 × ETc − 53.4, r2 = 0.95) and plant feedback-control methods (Yield
    = 0.41 × ETc − 75.3, r2 = 0.96). At the I25 treatment level, lint yield (141.8
    ± 15.1 and 92.2 ± 14.4 g m−2) and ETc (551 ± 28 and 387 ± 14 mm) were significantly
    greater for the plant feedback method as compared with the manual irrigation method.
    This difference can be attributed to higher irrigation quantities applied to the
    plant feedback-control plots (Table 2). Frequent irrigations were applied early
    in the irrigation season due to partial canopy cover which resulted in false positive
    irrigation signals. Towards the end of the irrigation season, the frequency of
    irrigation scheduling in these plots decreased. Mean lint yield (92.2 g m−2) and
    ETc (387 mm) in the I25M irrigation treatment plots were significantly reduced
    as compared with all other irrigated treatment plots (Table 3). There was no difference
    in the number of bolls among irrigated treatment plots. However, the average boll
    weight in the I25M plots was reduced by 51% and 35% as compared with mean boll
    weights for the I75M and I50M irrigation treatment levels, respectively (Table
    A.2, Appendix). Papastylianou and Argyrokastritis (2014) also reported that limited
    irrigation (50% of ETc) negatively influenced boll number and boll weight, decreasing
    boll number by 25% of the fully irrigated crop. In 2013, solenoid valves controlling
    zones 9 and 10 were mistakenly wired in reverse from the period of DOY 193–DOY
    217, after replacing failed valves. This resulted in differential irrigation amounts
    between zones 8 and 9 located within concentric plot 4 (Fig. 2b). Although, hand-samples
    were taken from both zones in each affected plot (4, 5, 12, 13, 20, 21 and 28),
    neutron access tubes were only located in zone 9. Because the focus of this study
    is to compare cotton response between the plant feedback- and manual-control methods,
    the ensuing analysis and discussion for 2013 data only contains the 21 plots (3
    replications) not impacted by this mishap. For lint yields compared by irrigation
    method in 2013, the overall mean lint yield and mean ETc (95.07 g m−2 and 441
    mm) in the plant feedback-control plots were significantly greater as compared
    with the manual-control plots (76.57 g m−2 and 411 mm) (Table 3). Again, these
    responses can be attributed to larger total irrigation amounts. Initial soil water
    content was again variable at the beginning of the irrigation season. Similar
    to 2012, overall mean WUE and IWUE were not dependent on the method of irrigation.
    Irrigation treatment level significantly affected mean lint yields between the
    I75 (109.6 g m−2) and I0 treatment level (28.9 g m−2). Again, mean lint yield
    in the I0 treatment level was significantly less compared with mean lint yields
    from all irrigation treatment levels. In this year, lint yields at the I75 and
    I50 treatment levels were similar. Mean ETc was significantly different between
    irrigation treatment levels and ranged from 535 mm in the I75 treatment to 294
    mm in the I0 treatment. Water use efficiency and IWUE were similar between the
    irrigated treatment plots (I75, I50 and I25); however, the minimal irrigation
    amount (80 mm) applied to the I0 treatment plots limited transpiration and fruit
    production, significantly reducing ETc and WUE as shown in 2012. Comparing multiple
    means of lint yield and ETc for each type of treatment plot (irrigation method
    × irrigation treatment level), means for the I25M treatment plots were significantly
    less. Limited irrigation likely affected boll production and transpiration in
    these treatment plots. The number of bolls per plant in the I25M treatment plot
    was significantly less compared with the number of bolls in the I75M and I75C
    treatment plots (Table A.2, Appendix), but boll weights were similar among these
    treatment plots. However, mean boll weight in the I25M treatment was less compared
    with the I50C and I25C treatment plots. When comparing crop response between irrigation
    methods at the same irrigation level, mean lint yields and mean ETc in the I75
    and I50 treatments were similar. In the I25 irrigation level, lint yield and ETc
    were significantly greater for the plant feedback-control treatment plots as compared
    with the manual-control treatment plots. Again, this was attributed to greater
    irrigation amounts scheduled by the plant feedback-control method. Mean WUE was
    not affected by the irrigation method × irrigation treatment interaction. Irrigation
    water use efficiency was significantly greater in the I25C treatment plots as
    compared with the I75M and I75C. The plant feedback method, which used iCWSI thresholds
    of 260 and 290 to schedule irrigations for the I75 and I50 treatment plots, respectively,
    was useful for indicating the need for irrigating cotton. Wanjura et al., 1992,
    Wanjura et al., 2004 also demonstrated successful automatic irrigation scheduling
    of cotton using continuous canopy and air temperature measurements for drip and
    center pivot irrigation systems, respectively. Our method was able to control
    irrigations to produce cotton lint yields at levels similar with the manually
    scheduled irrigations at the 75% and 50% irrigation treatment levels. Thus, the
    iCWSI method, which uses environmental parameters and canopy temperature to characterize
    the level of water stress, was sensitive to spatial and temporal soil water deficits
    that developed during the growing season. Many studies demonstrate the link between
    thermal stress indices and soil water deficits in the root zone (Ehrler, 1973,
    Lacape et al., 1998, Colaizzi et al., 2003a, Colaizzi et al., 2003b, Padhi et
    al., 2012). The mixed linear models for crop response (yield, ETc, WUE, IWUE)
    were fitted using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML). The models
    were fit with the main factors irrigation method and irrigation treatment level
    and their interaction as fixed effects. Concentric plot (block effect) was treated
    as a random effect. The variance was partitioned into components contributed by
    the blocking effect and residual error. The variability of crop response due to
    differences in the concentric plots were small, less than 3.1% and less than 0.5%
    of the total variance in 2012 and in 2013, respectively. However, the standard
    deviation for lint yield and ETc means within each irrigation treatment level
    were greater in the plant feedback control-plots. If the goals is reduce this
    variability, refinements to the hardware or software of the MBRs need to be made.
    Canopy architectural features and sun angle effects (Pinter et al., 1985) could
    influence the variability in spectral reflectance, since spectral reflectance
    measurements were made from sensors moving over the different plots during different
    times of the day. It is expected that variability could be reduced by making improvements
    to the thermal qualifying algorithm, such as adjusting the threshold value between
    soil and vegetation or by estimating crop canopy cover from additional MBRs placed
    on the pivot lateral with a nadir-looking view angle. Irrigation treatment amounts
    applied to the I25C plots were less than in 2012, but larger than expected. This
    suggests that changes could be made to the iCWSI threshold values, perhaps increasing
    the threshold value for the I25C treatment plots to reduce the excessive irrigation
    triggers. In a previous study where irrigation scheduling of cotton was controlled
    using a plant feedback method (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010), similar results
    comparing plant feedback and manual irrigation methods were demonstrated for cotton
    grown in 2007 and 2008 at the CPRL. In these earlier years, yields for the greatest
    irrigation amount treatment (I100) scheduled by the plant feedback method resulted
    in similar or better yields than those from the manual method. In that study,
    irrigations for the plant feedback-control plots were based on the mean stress
    index exceeding the established threshold. The mean stress index was calculated
    from each of six automatic-control plots designated as I100. Irrigation control
    for the deficit treatments in that experiment (I67 and I33) were dependent on
    the mean signal from the 100% treatment plots. The deficit plots received 67%
    and 33% of 20 mm (twice the daily peak crop water use). This discussion is noteworthy,
    as it points out that under the more recent experimental design reported herein
    (cotton grown in 2012 and 2013), irrigation scheduling for each plot controlled
    by the plant feedback system was independent of every other plot, yet, mean yields
    grouped by irrigation treatments at the highest levels (I75 and I50) were similar
    regardless of irrigation scheduling method. 4. Summary and conclusions This study
    demonstrated that it was feasible to develop dynamic prescription maps to control
    site-specific variable rate irrigation of cotton. These dynamic instructions were
    derived from the plant feedback method using a temperature scaling algorithm and
    an integrated CWSI that evaluated water stress of specific plots on an individual
    basis, or were based on manual input of irrigation amounts for manual-control
    treatment plots using neutron probe readings. Remotely sensed information included
    geo-referenced surface radiometric temperature measurements and meteorological
    data. We were successful in automating the prescription map code that directed
    pivot irrigation control and the separate code that enabled a user to view the
    prescription map in a graphical format. The cotton plants were exposed to environmentally
    induced stresses and to differing levels of water stress during the two-year study,
    yet the plant feedback-control method was able to schedule irrigations that resulted
    in similar lint yields in both years in the higher irrigation treatments. Overall,
    these dynamic prescription maps were effective in addressing spatial and temporal
    crop water stress for the I75 and I50 treatment plots, i.e., plant feedback-control
    plots from these treatment levels were not grossly over- or under-irrigated. This
    demonstrates that plant feedback systems can provide site-specific irrigation
    control. System integration of a wireless sensor network and plant feedback algorithm
    as used in this study provides one possible framework for dynamic prescription
    map construction and seasonal irrigation control. The incorporation of additional
    sensor network systems such as soil water sensors could be useful in overcoming
    problems that might be caused by limitations in temporal frequency and cloudy
    days. Automatic irrigations in excess of manual amounts early in the irrigation
    season were likely due to false positive triggers resulting from temperature contributions
    from soil background viewed by the IRTs due to less canopy cover at the beginning
    of the irrigation season. However, excess irrigation during the latter parts of
    the season may be adjusted by increasing the stress threshold and refining the
    algorithm for the multiband sensors. Further research is required to maintain
    automatic deficit irrigation using canopy temperature data at a level equivalent
    to 25% replenishment of crop water use to field capacity. Acknowledgements The

    A. Soil water data Soil water data Mean soil water content graphs of each irrigation
    method × irrigation level are shown below for each irrigation season (Fig. A.1,
    Fig. A.2). The plots indicate that although irrigation amounts for the plant feedback
    control plots at the I50 and I25 were greater than the manual-control plots, the
    additional irrigation did not result in deep percolation. Soil water storage for
    all plots was mainly within the depths of 30–110 cm. No run-off was observed during
    the irrigation season. NDVI and canopy temperature data Time series plots of NDVI
    and canopy temperature for DOY 224 are shown for concentric plots 1 (Fig. A.3a)
    and 2 (Fig. A.3b). These arcwise plots include treatment plots 1, 8, 9, 16, 17,
    24 and 25; and 2, 7, 10, 15, 18, 23 and 26 as shown in Fig. 2b. The multiple spot
    calculations of NDVI and canopy temperature measurements are highly variable within
    each treatment plot. This is expected due to variability in plant height, and
    width (data not shown) within a single treatment plot and from plot to plot in
    the arcwise direction. Additionally, the sensors were pointed at a downward-looking
    oblique angle towards the canopy, therefore NDVI is not necessarily related to
    the amount of above-ground biomass, but rather is a function of the amount of
    vegetation within the field-of-view of the multiband instrument at the time of
    the spot measurement. The plots demonstrate a general trend of higher levels of
    surface temperature where NDVI values are relatively low, and conversely lower
    surface temperatures where NDVI values are high. Using calculated NDVI from a
    downward-oblique looking angle demonstrated that the average NDVI value for each
    treatment plot gradually increased from 0.12 on DOY 200 and peaked on DOY 230
    (crop was in the R-12 stage). Mean NDVI for the I75 treatment plots peaked at
    nearly 0.6, while the mean NDVI for the I0% peaked at 0.45. (Fig. A.4a and b).
    The NDVI-biomass relationship between NDVI calculated from multi-spectral sensors
    pointed at the canopy at oblique-downward looking angles with a constant adjustment
    of height above the canopy are expected to be less linear compared with NDVI calculated
    from a multi-spectral radiometer used to remotely assess biomass from a nadir-looking
    view. In the latter case, the radiometer is held at the same height above the
    ground for all sampling events. Also, a path is traversed in either a direction
    that is transect to plant rows or if in a parallel direction, measurements are
    made between rows to monitor the change in canopy cover (Gitelson, 2004, Hunsaker
    et al., 2005) into the furrow. From this graph, it is clear that NDVI values for
    the I0 and I25 irrigation treatments were less than treatments receiving more
    water throughout the season, Later in the irrigation season for the I25 level,

    Tc s were scaled into diurnal pattern with time scaling approach (Peters and Evett,
    2004) then irrigation triggering threshold was set at 30 °C above which water
    stress was expected. Likewise, with similar system, integrated crop water stress
    index (iCWSI) using time scaled Tc has also been used as plant water stress feedback
    then coupled with soil moisture sensing as soil water stress feedback for variable
    rate irrigation applications in row crops such as corn, sorghum, and cotton (O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2020, 2017, 2015). Furthermore, Colaizzi et al. (2017) used similar irrigation
    system to collect single-point Tr from remote locations then scaled to find daily
    ETa estimate using TSEB, which was compared against soil water balance (SWB) ETa
    and yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging between 1.5 and 1.8 mm d−1.

  description: In information technology, Big Data is a collection of data sets so
    large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database
    management tools or traditional data-processing applications [74]. The trend to
    larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis
    of a single large set of related data, as compared with separate smaller sets
    with the same total amount of data [26,51,68]. Scientists regularly encounter
    limitations due to large data sets in many areas, including meteorology, genetics,
    complex physics simulations, and environmental research [9,35]. Wireless technology-based
    automated data gathering from the large environmental sensor networks have increased
    the quantity of sensor data available for analysis and sensor informatics. Next-generation
    environmental monitoring, natural resource management, and agricultural decision
    support systems are becoming heavily dependent on very large scale multiple sensor
    network deployments, massive-scale accumulation, harmonization, web-based Big
    Data integration and interpretation of Big Data. With large amount of the data
    availability, the complexity of data has also increased hence regular maintenance
    of large-scale sensor are becoming a difficult challenge. Uncertainty factors
    in the environmental monitoring processes are more evident than before due to
    current technological transparency achieved by most recent advanced communication
    technologies [47-49]. The other challenges include capture, storage, search, sharing,
    analysis, and visualization. Data availability from a particular environmental
    sensor web is often very limited and data quality is subsequently very poor. This
    practical limitation could be due to difficult geographical location of the sensor
    node or sensor station, extreme environmental conditions, communication network
    failure, and lastly technical failure of the sensor node. Data uncertainty from
    a sensor network makes the network unreliable and inefficient. This inefficiency
    leads to failure of natural resource management systems such as agricultural water
    resource management, weather forecast, crop management including irrigation scheduling
    and natural resource-based crop business model systems. The ultimate challenge
    in environmental forecasting and decision support systems, is to overcome the
    data uncertainty and make the derived output more accurate. It is evident that
    there is a need to capture and integrate environmental knowledge from various
    independent sources including sensor networks, individual sensory system, large-scale
    environmental simulation models, and historical environmental data [13,33,36,41,56,58]
    for each of the independent sources). It is not good enough to produce efficient
    decision support system using a single data source. So there is an urgent requirement
    for on demand complementary knowledge integration where different sources of environmental
    sensor data could be used to complement each other automatically [1,17,37,38].

    irrigation 1. Introduction Given the advancements in the field of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) as well as in the miniaturization of such sensor systems, new
    trends have emerged in the field of precision agriculture (Zhang et al., 2002,
    Srinivasan, 2006). Reviews of wireless sensor technologies and applications in
    agriculture and food industry have been given by Wang et al. (2006) and by Ruiz-Garcia
    et al. (2009).Wireless networks allow the deployment of sensing and actuation
    infrastructure at a much finer granularity than has been available before. Sensors
    and actuators can be used to precisely and autonomously control, for example,
    the concentration of fertilizer in the soil, based on information gathered from
    the soil itself, the ambient temperature, and other relevant environmental factors.
    Incorporating feedback into the system through the use of sensors and actuators
    allows for a more fine-grained analysis that can adjust flow rate and duration
    in a way that is informed by local conditions. Significant economic gains are
    expected by applying such precise information to control the growth of particularly
    delicate and high value crops such as wine grapes, citrus fruit and strawberries.
    Sensors that are able to monitor the crop itself, for example, leaf temperature
    in strawberries, or sugar-levels in grapes, or the photosynthetic activity of
    the crop plant, to provide location-specific data could also prove to be very
    effective. In particular, the use of WSN technology to optimize irrigation in
    agriculture is of benefit to both the farmers and the environment. According to
    recent reports, agriculture irrigation accounts for 50–60% of freshwater usage
    from sources in the natural environment and up to more than 90% in some developing
    countries (UNESCO, 2009, pp. 106–115). Given the increasing worldwide shortage
    of water caused by a combination of a changing climate and pressure resulting
    from high demand of agricultural products, it is of primary importance to develop
    new irrigation control strategies that allow the minimization of water wastage
    while keeping associated costs at an affordable level. In this paper we describe
    the design of an intelligent decision support system and its integration with
    a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN) to implement closed-loop zone specific
    irrigation control in greenhouses via wireless communication. Our research focuses
    on the provision of proactive applications by deploying sensor networks and connecting
    sensor data with actuators through an adaptive and able to learn decision-making
    layer. The system developed provides real-time monitoring and control of both
    agricultural inputs and outputs (irrigation control). A rule editor with a graphical
    user interface (GUI) is used by the domain-expert to initialize the knowledge
    base. The system is optimized to adapt to changes in crop development by configuring
    the rule parameters in the system ontology. In addition, machine learning is employed
    to enrich systems’ knowledge base. The remaining of the paper is organized as
    follows. Section 2 gives an overall description of the developed system. The topics
    covered in this discussion include the layered modular architecture of the system,
    the WSAN platform, the supported sensors and their interfacing to the platform,
    the ontology-based decision making layer and the machine learning process followed
    to extend system knowledge. Section 3 details the technological and agronomic
    results. It provides an evaluation of the developed system in terms of a prototype
    deployment, the derivation of new rules from the machine learning experiments
    performed, the WSN performance analysis and the mote lifetime estimation by using
    analytical models, the agronomic impact of the system and also provides a discussion
    of related work and lessons learnt. Finally, Section 4 presents a summary of this
    work. 2. Materials and methods The overall goal of the research and development
    work described in this paper is to design a new plant growth monitoring and control
    system comprising: • a distributed network of sensors for accurately sensing the
    plant growth activity and environmental conditions, and plant growth control actuators;
    • ontology-based decision support mechanisms that associate sensor data with actuator
    commands; • a machine learning process for enhancing plant state diagnosis based
    on logged data; and • a set of tools that facilitate the specification of applications
    and the visualization of measuring parameters and assessed states. As an application
    example of the above system we have considered an intelligent irrigation control
    strategy applied to protected agricultural crops that can improve the environmental
    and economic sustainability of the greenhouse sector. 2.1. System overview The
    system is organized in a layered modular approach to allow flexibility and extensibility.
    A layered system architecture decouples the low-level sensory communication from
    the application business logic; the former gathers raw data from sensors, while
    the latter can be captured as an hierarchy of rules (Goumopoulos et al., 2007).
    In this way, applications do not depend on a specific sensor or a protocol that
    this sensor uses to transfer data values. Therefore, new sensor devices that emerge
    for a selected plant parameter can be integrated to the system without disturbing
    the other modules. Similarly, a different wireless communication protocol can
    be used without affecting the application business logic. This approach allowed
    us to develop and evaluate precision agriculture applications with diverse system
    and technology configurations (Goumopoulos et al., 2007, Goumopoulos et al., 2009,
    Goumopoulos, 2012). Fig. 1 illustrates the system architecture in a high level
    view. In yellow color are shown the components that are discussed in this paper.
    In the lower layer various sensors/actuators that can collectively form composite
    WSANs, provide the raw data and the means to activate devices associated with
    agricultural inputs (e.g., irrigation). In the driver’s layer, a specific driver
    is designed and implemented for each WSAN implementing the hardware communication
    protocol. The coordinator of the WSAN is connected to the corresponding gateway
    at the backend system which collects all sensor measurements before forwarding
    them to populate a relational database. The system architecture embraces the use
    of standalone devices that communicate directly with a driver through a device-specific
    communication protocol. These devices are usually complex sensors such as an infrared
    (IR) imaging system, and the PAM meter. The latter which is used in our prototype
    employs the so-called Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation (PAM) measuring principle to
    provide a selective measure of the relative chlorophyll fluorescence quantum yield
    for determining the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant. This parameter acts
    as a general plant health indicator and provides a reference for the classification
    process of the machine learning algorithm applied. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. High-level system architecture. The functionality of the backend
    system is supported by the following main components: Ontology, Decision Support
    System (DSS), and Machine Learning (ML). The ontology specifies all the rules
    that support the decision-making process in the form of a knowledge base. The
    DSS provides all the synthetic information, acquired from the analysis of the
    stored data, needed to make operative decisions for the plant growth management.
    The purpose of the ML component is to analyze the structured information using
    machine learning and data mining techniques in order to find interesting new correlations.
    A number of tools have also been developed to support the application development.
    2.2. WSAN platform and sensor/actuator interfacing The hardware platform used
    is the 25 mm mote developed at Tyndall (Bellis et al., 2005, Tyndall, 2014). The
    hardware platform is analogous to a Lego™-like 25 mm × 25 mm stackable system
    (Fig. 2). The module contains an Atmel ATMega128L 8-bit microcontroller and a
    Chipcon CC2420 ZigBee RF chip both of which are combined on one layer. The microcontroller
    is equipped with 128 KB in-system flash memory and can be programmed to handle
    analogue to digital conversion (ADC) of sensor data and the communication networking
    protocols for interfacing with the RF transceiver to achieve communication with
    other nodes. The CC2420 transceiver used is 802.15.4 compliant – and as such can
    cover 16 channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Current consumption is very low with transmit
    and receive currents typically 17.4 mA and 19.7 mA and 1 μA in sleep mode. Stacked
    upon this RF microcontroller layer is our custom sensor/actuator interface layer,
    which allows any combination of eight different sensors or actuators to be connected
    to the 25 mm module. On the software side, the microcontroller runs a tailored
    version of TinyOS, an optimised operating system that allows fast configuration
    of the sensor nodes. The power layer may include batteries or other energy supply
    or power harvesting mechanisms, i.e., solar cells or piezo electric power generation
    mechanisms. An 25 mm Li-ion battery layer is also provided with built-in USB charger
    capability. In an early version of the system the authors have investigated an
    alternative configuration of the Tyndall25 mote regarding the communication layer
    (Nordic VLSI nRF2401 2.4 GHz RF transceiver) and the network topology (peer-to-peer)
    (Goumopoulos et al., 2007). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Tyndall25
    mote modular platform. 2.2.1. Communication protocol and topology The communication
    protocol used in our case is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE 802.15.4
    Standard, 2006) which specifies the physical layer and the Medium Access Control
    (MAC) layer of the protocol. IEEE 802.15.4 combined with the ZigBee open specification
    specify a protocol stack for the development of short-range and low power communications
    for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs). The basic configuration of the IEEE
    802.15.4 permits a transfer rate of 250 Kbps to a distance range of 10–100 m in
    the 2.4 GHz frequency band depending on the antenna, the environment and the power
    consumption permitted by a given application. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard supports
    two addressing schemes, either short (16 bit) or long addresses (IEEE 64 bit)
    so theoretical network size is up to 65536 or 264 nodes. A maximum frame size
    of 127 bytes is supported with a payload of up to 114 bytes (assuming short addresses).
    An IEEE 802.15.4 network consists of one PAN coordinator and a set of devices
    which are classified as reduced functionality devices (RFD) and full functionality
    devices (FFD). The interconnection of these devices allow the creation of three
    types of topologies: star (the PAN coordinator is in the transmission range of
    all other devices resulting in single-hop communication), mesh or peer-to-peer
    (a node may communicate with any neighbor enabling multi-hop communication) and
    cluster-tree (a combination of the previous topologies where the PAN coordinator
    is the root of the tree and all the non-leaf devices are defined as coordinators
    with the ability to forward the packets to/from the root). The physical layer
    of IEEE 802.15.4 uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) with Collision Avoidance
    (CA) to access the radio channel (IEEE 802.15.4 Standard, 2006). The MAC layer
    enables two different operational modes: non beacon-enabled mode and beacon enabled
    mode. In the former case the access control is governed by non-slotted CSMA/CA,
    where as in the latter case the network coordinator broadcasts a special frame
    (a beacon) periodically that permits the synchronization of the associated devices.
    In our current system we use the non-beacon mode and thus our network topology
    is a star topology. Selecting the non-beacon mode was mandatory due to the unavailability
    of a beacon-mode implementation for our WSAN platform. In the star topology the
    coordinator and the actuator controlling motes are powered from the mains source,
    where as the sensor motes are battery powered. Given that the plant processes
    we want to monitor and control (e.g. plant dehydration) are slow, the use of low
    sampling intervals (in the order of 5–30 min) is acceptable to save energy. In
    addition, the data to be transmitted is of low complexity resulting in limited
    payloads on the IEEE 802.15.4 data frames. A sampling rate of 5 min with a payload
    of only 18 bytes (total data frame size 33 bytes) gives a sampling rate of 0.88
    bps which is very low compared to the medium transmission rate (250 Kbps). This
    low sampling rate affects the collision probability and allows achieving a high
    successful packet delivery rate for a sufficient number of nodes provided that
    nodes can awake in a random manner during the specified sampling interval to take
    measurements and transmit their values, as we will explain in the evaluation part
    of the sensor network. The protected environment of greenhouses provides also
    the possibility of using a range of facilities like mains power for certain devices
    (e.g. controlling of water pumps). By using the star topology we have avoided
    well known complications that are related with the use of the beacon-enabled mode
    such as clock drifts between coordinators in cluster tree topologies, dynamic
    network resynchronization in the case a cluster joins/leaves the network and the
    need for dynamic rearrangement of duty cycles in the case of a coordinator failure.
    2.2.2. Sensors The interfacing of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors generally
    requires special hardware for each sensor. This is because different sensors may
    have different power requirements and output type and range. Three types of sensors
    had to be interfaced for the Tyndall25 mote: soil moisture sensors, humidity sensors
    and thermistors for determining leaf/air temperature. The main properties of these
    sensors are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Sensors interfaced to the 25 mm mote.

    http://www.sensirion.com http://www.cantherm.com 2.2.2.1. Soil moisture sensor
    Soil moisture can be measured by electromagnetic sensors which determine volumetric
    water content (VWC) and occasionally electrical conductivity in the soil under
    consideration. The correlation between the electromagnetic signals measured and
    VWC is attributed to the high permittivity of water which can be inferred by the
    sensors through various means (e.g., time, frequency and capacitance). In our
    case the ECHO EC-10 soil moisture probe by Decagon was selected. It uses the capacitance
    technique to measure the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium which
    can then be related to the VWC of the soil. The ECHO EC-10 sensor provides fast
    measurements with very low power consumption, giving the ability to take many
    measurements over a long period of time (e.g., a growing season) with minimal
    battery usage. Regarding the accuracy of the measured VWC the manufacturer recommends
    establishing soil-specific calibration functions (Campbell, 2004). The soil used
    in our applications was a peat substrate. A series of soil/water mixtures were
    used and the corresponding sensor responses were recorded. The process was performed
    for different sensors and the average values of 3 repetitions were used to obtain
    the following equation: (1) Soil moisture sensor outputs could be input directly
    into the analogue to digital converter because they are in the voltage range of
    the microcontroller. 2.2.2.2. Humidity sensor For measuring humidity we have selected
    the SHT11 component from Sensirion which also provides temperature measurements.
    A capacitive sensor element is used for measuring relative humidity while temperature
    is measured by a band-gap sensor. The device also integrates signal processing
    and provides a fully calibrated digital output. To obtain the relative humidity
    we used the accuracy enhancement formula that is provided by the manufacturer
    (Sensirion, 2011): (2) where SORH is the humidity readout value (12-bit length),
    C1 = −2.0468, C2 = 0.0367 and C3 = −1.5955 * 10−6. The humidity sensor provides
    its output in a digital format which can be input directly into the microcontroller.
    2.2.2.3. Temperature sensor There are different types of sensors that are used
    for temperature measurement in greenhouses. Of the sensors available, thermistors
    were chosen as they have high sensitivity to minute changes in temperature (change
    in resistance vs. temperature on a scale of −3%/°C to −6%/°C for NTC thermistors),
    low thermal mass, high thermal conduction, low cost and are small enough to be
    placed on the plant leaf. Two important parameters that must be taken into account
    when designing a temperature measurement system are resolution and accuracy. The
    temperature resolution is the smallest detectable incremental change of temperature
    that can be detected by the system. Thermistors’ inherent high sensitivity can
    provide high resolution measurements. The temperature accuracy is the maximum
    difference that will exist between the real temperature (which must be measured
    by a reference thermometer) and the measured value by the system. In our case,
    we have selected a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor (i.e. resistance
    decreases as temperature increases) with high resistance tolerance (±0.5%) and
    a nominal resistance of 10 kΩ at 25 °C (Cantherm, 2006). The measurement system
    we have designed achieves a temperature resolution of 0.02 °C and an accuracy
    of ±0.05 °C over a temperature range of 5–45 °C. The resolution and accuracy of
    temperature measurement is critical for the precision irrigation application we
    developed and therefore we have carefully designed the corresponding system. Moreover,
    higher resolution and accuracy are required for the machine learning experiments
    that will be described later in the paper. A characteristic of thermistors is
    the non-linear relationship between thermistors resistance (Rth) measured in ohms,
    and temperature (T) measured in Kelvin, as given by the well-known Steinhart–Hart
    thermistor equation or the simpler B-parameter equation: (3) where R0 is the resistance
    value at reference temperature T0 (typically 25 °C/298.15 K), B is the B or Beta
    value, which is an indication of the slope of the Rth–T curve (the higher the
    Beta value the greater the change in resistance per degree C). Both R0 and B are
    specified in the sensor data sheet. R∞ is the thermistor resistance as the temperature
    approaches infinity. Eq. (3) solved for T is written as: (4) The measurement system
    provides temperature values in three steps: 1. Measurement of the conditioning
    circuit output voltage by means of the ADC module. 2. Calculation of the thermistor
    resistance from the ADC value. 3. Calculation of the temperature using Eq. (4).
    In order to obtain both high precision and high resolution temperature values
    by the measurement system several design choices have to be made in the above
    three steps. A conditioning circuit is used to interface thermistors to the ADC
    module of the Tyndall25 mote working with an external reference voltage of 2.5
    V (Vref) for 12-bit ADC. The conditioning circuit includes four high precision
    resistors (0.1% tolerance) and a high precision operational amplifier (op-amp)
    with low noise and low offset voltage that scales and shifts the analog signal
    of the thermistor voltage in order to correctly map the required thermistor resistance
    range to the voltage range (0–2.5 V) supported by the ADC module. To overcome
    the impact of the circuit component uncertainties and get highly accurate measurements
    careful calibration was performed, matching the output of the measuring system
    to a set of known reference values. Details of this calibration process are omitted
    due to lack of space. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the calibration data and also the
    thermistor resistance variation compared to the temperature variation. The figure
    shows also the linear fit of the curves that could be used for applications that
    can afford lower accuracy measurements. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Calibration data plot. 2.2.3. Irrigation system Fig. 4 shows the schematic
    layout of the irrigation distribution unit. In principle, the mote’s controlling
    software, via a transistor switch, activates a relay that in turn activates the
    pump device. The interface layer sits on top of the Tyndall25 mote as additional
    layers cannot be placed above it due to the size of the connectors attached to
    it. In order to toggle the external relay, which is part of the actuator portion,
    12 V must be supplied at the interface layer output. The heart of the actuator
    portion of the interface layer is a simple transistor switch that is controlled
    by the microcontroller. When the software running on the microcontroller toggles
    the appropriate output a voltage is supplied to the base of the transistor and
    the switch is turned on and 12 V is supplied to the relay which is connected to
    a Harwin M30-610 connector. The 12 V supply voltage is used not only for the actuators
    but also to power all possibly connected sensors and the entire Tyndall25 mote.
    The interface layer contains a Torex XC6202 voltage regulator to regulate the
    12 V supply down to 3.3 V in order to power the mote and connected sensors. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Schematic layout of the irrigation distribution
    unit. In order for this system to work the mote has to take commands from the
    coordinator node so as to know what section to irrigate and for how long. The
    coordinator sends a command via its radio link to the associated node controlling
    the actuator. This command is sent to the module in the irrigation distribution
    unit that converts the signal to a voltage level that the microcontroller can
    read. Once the microcontroller receives a valid command according to the decision
    making output it will actuate the pump valve and open a particular solenoid in
    order to irrigate a specific section of the crop layout. The solenoid operated
    water valves distribute the watering supply in four distinct zones of plants.
    A fifth water valve provides humidity control. The pumps used in the system are
    the Whale Whisperflo UP0815 pressure pump with a flow rate of 8 L min−1. The solenoids
    are manufactured by Bermad, model S-390-2-R. 2.3. Ontology-based DSS and tools
    At the heart of the back-end system (Fig. 1) lies the DSS component which is build
    on top of an ontology. An ontology is a tool that can conceptualize a world view
    by capturing general knowledge and providing basic notions and concepts for basic
    terms (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). The ontology developed defines domain concepts
    and relations among them. It provides a vocabulary for expressing the decision-making
    rules based on plant and environmental sensing parameters which are related with
    a set of sensors and actuators as well as correlated biological information (Fig.
    5). The specification of the ontology was performed using the Protégé ontology
    development tool (http://protege.stanford.edu/) based on the OWL standard language.
    An in depth discussion of the ontology design is provided by Goumopoulos et al.
    (2009). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Part of the system ontology
    hierarchy. In this context, the decision-making process is based on a set of rules
    in operational representation forms, which are applied on existent knowledge and
    allow the use of the ontology for reasoning providing inferential and validation
    mechanisms. For example, there is a need for a set of rules that will take into
    account both plant and environmental parameters and the description of a plant
    in order to diagnose a plant’s state. Other rules would take into account the
    plant’s state, its description and user defined policies to determine the possible
    actions of the system, such as the request for a resource. An inference engine
    is used for the decision-making process. The inference engine module exploits
    the Jess (Java Expert System Shell) rule engine (http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/).
    The execution of this module starts based on the initial facts and the rules stored
    in the rule base using CLIPS format. The concepts that appear in the rules have
    emerged from the ontology. Essentially, this is an approach of building rules
    on top of ontologies. Therefore, the reasoning is based on the definition of the
    ontology, by using first-order predicate calculus. The user, however, can define
    or update existing rules using a front-end tool and expressing the rules with
    simple if-then-else logic. A number of tools have been developed to facilitate
    the development, configuration and monitoring of applications. For each node in
    the WSAN we provide a driver operator configuration software that specifies the
    actions to setup the properties of the WSAN in order to make it functional for
    the agricultural application. This configuration provides also the definition
    of certain parameters that will allow the proper interpretation of the data received
    by the device operator. Fig. 6 illustrates the interface defined for configuring
    the Tyndall25-based WSAN. Options include setting the mote to be configured, its
    frequency channel and position in the field, the active ADCs and the type of the
    associated sensor/actuator. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Tyndall25-based
    WSAN driver configuration software. Fig. 7 shows the design of the ‘Heat Stress’
    calculation rule for the irrigation application using a simple rule editing tool
    targeted to the domain expert, which provides a visual interface based on a node
    connection model. The rule consists of three conditions combined with a logical
    AND node. An expression builder facilitates the definition of the condition relying
    on concepts stored in the ontology. The rule, as designed, states that when all
    conditions are met then the heat stress state of the RC area must be set to active
    (HeatStress ACTIVE). The Supervisor Logic and Data Acquisition (SLADA) tool is
    another tool used to view knowledge represented into the ontology, monitor and
    log plant/environmental parameters and manage dynamically the rules taking part
    in the decision-making process in co-operation with the rule editor. The rule
    editor and the SLADA tool are described in detail in Goumopoulos et al. (2007).

    rule for the irrigation application. 2.4. Machine learning In the context of precision
    agriculture it is feasible to extract new knowledge from stored data in the form
    of models that are in an easy to manage form by the decision making system and
    understandable to the domain expert involved in the crop production process (Dimitriadis
    and Goumopoulos, 2008). Elaborating on our previous research work, we used classification
    algorithms, which produce a classifier as a set of rules or decision trees that
    can be then exploited to predict the classification of new data cases and can
    insert new rules to the domain model. Before that, the application of clustering
    algorithms based on particular proximity criteria-attributes can create hypotheses
    about the relationships that can be found in the dataset and identify the natural
    groupings in the input data. We devised a machine learning process model that
    guides machine learning experimentation with an aim to incorporate derived rules
    and attributes into the decision-making mechanism (Fig. 8). This process is an
    expanded form of the process model for machine learning application in agriculture
    that was created by the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) group
    in University of Waikato in New Zealand (Witten and Frank, 2005). The close cooperation
    between the data mining expert and the plant science field expert is required
    in several phases. In the pre-processing and analysis phases, their collaboration
    will shape the datasets upon which the machine learning algorithms shall operate.
    The responsibility of the field expert is to review and interpret the appropriateness
    of the data and suggest possible transformations and/or relaxations. The responsibility
    of the data mining expert is to guarantee that the inferred rules correspond satisfactorily
    to the evaluated measures (e.g., overall success rate and false positive rate)
    from the machine learning perspective. Regarding the data mining process, algorithms
    provided by the WEKA workbench are used. At the post-processing phase the field
    expert could indicate which subset of the derived rules establishes new valuable
    knowledge, and which part describes common knowledge. To estimate the performance
    of classifiers generated from the entire data set of example cases, the 10-fold
    cross validation approach to training and testing was used. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Machine learning process model. 3. Experiments and results
    Strawberry plants (Fragaria ananassa) have been selected for system validation
    and evaluation because the delivered technology can be relevant to the commercial
    production of this crop, while on a practical level, the size of the leaves enables
    easy attachment of sensors. In addition, irrigation control on strawberry plants
    is important as they have a shallow root system making them particularly sensitive
    to water stress. On the other hand, controlling excessive irrigation is significant
    for avoiding nutrient leaching and disease development that affect negatively
    the crop yield. The most effective balance needs to be achieved between these
    two requirements. The irrigation treatments, controlled by our system, were imposed
    from the beginning of the flowering to the end of the fruit maturity from early
    June to late July in a greenhouse establishment at the University College Cork
    in Ireland (Fig. 9) in the context of the PLANTS project (daisy.cti.gr/plants/)
    funded by the European Community under the Information Society Technologies Programme.
    A subset of this experiment was performed using a different WSAN platform (Crossbow
    MICAz) and the results regarding this configuration are discussed in Goumopoulos
    (2012). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Experimental setup (left);
    drip-feed into a pot (right). 3.1. Plant signals and environmental parameters
    The primary plant signals and environmental parameters explored during application
    development are: Plant’s leaf Temperature (PT), Chlorophyll Fluorescence (CF),
    Ambient Temperature (AT), Humidity (H) and Soil Moisture (SM). PT was chosen as
    it indicates drought and heat stress (Mannini and Anconelli, 1993). The former
    is due to lack of water and will be reflected in the stomata (leaf pores) closing
    when the plants are under water stress and with the shutdown of transpiration
    the leaves will begin to heat up (i.e., monitoring the temperature of the leafs
    to determine drought state). On the other hand, heat stress can occur independently
    of water stress when the environmental temperature gets very high and transpiration
    cannot maintain leaf cooling. By comparing PT and AT one can deduce an indication
    of plant stress. The addition of the SM parameter enables the system to decide
    between heat stress (i.e. plant has adequate water but temperature is high) and
    drought stress (i.e. both water content is low and temperature is high). The CF
    parameter serves as the feedback mechanism to determine the state of the photosynthetic
    rate of the plant and from this determine how productive or stressed the plant
    is under the current conditions (Norikane et al., 2003). We use this parameter
    for the machine learning process. A healthy plant absorbs light from the sun and
    directs a proportion of the energy absorbed (slightly above 80%) to photosynthesis,
    through chlorophyll a. This proportion can be determined by providing a very bright
    pulse of light and determining the difference between minimal and maximal fluorescence.
    Any decline in this proportion indicates a reduction in the efficiency with which
    light is converted to photosynthetic product, and such a decline is often seen
    when a plant is stressed. So when plants become dehydrated or are otherwise stressed,
    they are often less able to convert sunlight into photosynthetic product and this
    stress can be detected using fluorescence (Razavi et al., 2008). Fluorometers
    that use the PAM technique (PAM meter) work by rapidly sending brief pulses of
    light to a plant. A healthy plant responds to this light very quickly (within
    microseconds) by re-emitting some of the light energy as fluorescence which is
    detected by the fluorometer. CF measurements are taken using a standalone sensor
    device (Junior PAM1), whereas PT, AT, H and SM measurements are taken by the WSAN.
    3.2. System deployment The experimental setup consists of an array of 96 plants
    placed in a glasshouse, arranged in an array of 12 by 8. Four different zones
    are defined: Left-Edge (LE), Right-Edge (RE), Left-Center (LC), Right-Center (RC).
    Also, there is one zone selected for misting which overlaps with the RC zone.
    The setup integrates 36 thermistors (8 ambient and 28 plant temperature thermistors)
    and 8 soil moisture probes into one system that when required can irrigate and
    also determine when to stop the irrigation. This deployment takes into account
    differences in the location of the plants in the overall area and will allow for
    independent irrigation of edge or centre zone plants as required. Eight Tyndall25
    motes are used for connecting the various sensors, one mote is sensorless and
    is used as a gateway with the backend system, and one mote is used for controlling
    the irrigation system. The motes are placed in IP-67 rated water-proof packaging
    to endure the field conditions (Fig. 9). Sensor mapping to the zones is managed
    with the WSAN configuration tool (Fig. 6). Sensor nodes are taking measurements
    at user-defined intervals. For this experiment the rate was 5 min. To reduce random
    noise each measurement is the average of ten sensor readings. SM, PT and AT values
    are calculated from measurements taken by multiple sensors deployed in a zone.
    For the SM and AT parameters the average is calculated since a few sensors are
    involved (up to 3). In case of PT, where more sensors are involved (up to 10),
    both the mean and the median values have been considered and finally the median
    has been selected because of its robustness to outliers. The PAM meter sensor
    has been used for collecting data only from the RC area. The timewindow for measuring
    the photosynthetic activity is set between 9 am and 5 pm. The sensor uses a magnetic
    clamp to hold the plant leaf about 1 mm from the end of the light pipe. In order
    to receive readings from the PAM meter, successive measuring cycles must be initiated
    by the corresponding device driver. Each cycle starts with illuminating the leaf
    of the plant with an actinic light, followed by a saturation pulse, followed by
    a measurement. Then the driver pulses the leaf with increasing quantities of actinic
    light to get characterisation curves that contain information on the state of
    the leaf. A sequential protocol to communicate with the PAM meter has been implemented.
    The communication is done via the COM port connected to the PAM meter using a
    standard cable. The PAM meter uses a series of ASCII commands that are sent from
    the controlling device in a binary format. Some of these commands control the
    saturation pulse (i.e. ‘s’) and the actinic light intensity (e.g., ‘ai3’, ‘ai4’,
    etc.) and others like the ‘etr’ command request specific readings from the sensor.
    In particular, actinic light intensity commands also request PAR (photosynthetically
    active radiance) readings transmitted from the PAM meter. For example, actinic
    intensity ai3 will have a PAR value of 50, ai4 a PAR value of 70, etc. A delay
    of at least 100 ms is required between character transmissions, whereas a delay
    of up to 10 s is necessary between commands. Table 2 contains the application
    rules for the RC zone with thresholds specialized for the reproductive phase of
    strawberries. It is possible the threshold values to vary depending on the growing
    phase of the crop. In the strawberry fruiting stage, for example, more irrigation
    is required for quality production. In Table 2 we have shown a separate rule that
    defines the variable RCSMThreshold to the proper threshold value during the reproductive
    phase of the crop. Similarly, another rule defines the variable IrrigationThreshold
    with the proper value in the same growing phase. Note that the SM threshold can
    be defined to be both zone-specific and growing phase-specific, where as the irrigation
    threshold is defined to be the same for all zones. Existing knowledge from the
    horticulture literature can be easily integrated into our system through the ontology
    and rule editing tools discussed earlier. The uncertainty of the decisions can
    be modeled with confidence factors that can be integrated into the rules (Goumopoulos
    et al., 2007). Table 2. Application rules. Rule Body RCDroughtStress IF RCLeafTemperature
    – RCAmbientTemperature > 0.9 °C THEN RCDroughtStress ← TRUE ELSE RCDroughtStress
    ← FALSE RCHeatStress IF RCDroughtStress AND RCSoilMoisture > RCSMThreshold THEN
    RCHeatStress ← TRUE ELSE RCHeatStress ← FALSE RCNeedIrrigation IF RCDroughtStress
    AND NOT RCHeatStress THEN RCNeedIrrigation ← TRUE ELSE RCNeedIrrigation ← FALSE
    RCNeedMisting IF RCDroughtStress AND RCHeatStress THEN RCNeedMisting ← TRUE ELSE
    RCNeedMisting ← FALSE RCSMThreshold IF GrowingPhase = REPRODUCTIVE THEN RCSMThreshold
    ← 0.6 IrrigationThreshold IF GrowingPhase = REPRODUCTIVE THEN IrrigationThreshold
    ← 1800 s Two additional parameters must be defined for the prototype to be properly
    working: the duration of irrigation/misting and an idle time, which specifies
    the amount of time the rules should be disabled, after the action is performed.
    This is to allow the ecosystem to absorb the changes. The values used for the
    example application were 30 min/1 min and 4 h respectively. The irrigation system
    uses a reservoir, a pump system, standard pipe work, nipples and drippers which
    emit water directly into the plant pot. Flow rate depends on the pump pressure.
    The emitter flow rate per pot is regulated at 1 L h−1 with an application efficiency
    of 95%. In the misting system the drippers are replaced by nozzles that are designed
    to produce a fine spray. 3.3. Machine learning experiments For the machine learning
    experiments datasets collected by the deployed system were used. The attributes
    involved are: CF, PT, SM, AT, PAR, and the derived properties ETR (electron transport
    rate), QE (quantum efficiency of photosynthesis), InfPAR (inflection PAR), and
    the learning goals DS (DroughtStress) and HS (HeatStress) categorized with values
    TRUE/FALSE. The ETR is calculated within PAM meter by combining the CF (represented
    by several fluorescence quotients) and PAR measurements (Pfündel, 2007). InfPAR
    is calculated on the ETR vs. saturated PAR curve (Fig. 10); the curve is calculated
    using a second degree least squares algorithm. The point of inflection is calculated
    as the intersection point between the asymptotic lines of the curve’s first derivative.
    QE is the slope of the above curve. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.
    ETR vs. saturated PAR curve. Data gathering was performed for a period of seven
    weeks corresponding to the reproductive phase of the crop. For analysis purposes
    we have divided this process into two stages. The first stage is represented in
    a dataset called “ETR_Photosynthetic Activity” which includes only the properties
    related to the plants photosynthetic activity and a characterization of the plant
    DS state, used as the classification parameter of the applied learning algorithms,
    within 234 instances (half of them were characterized as stressed and half as
    not stressed). The classification was done manually by domain experts. The aim
    was to acquire rules that determine the DS status of the plant based on its photosynthetic
    activity (rules #1 and #2 in Table 3). The second stage leverages on the knowledge
    acquired by the previous stage and is represented in a dataset called “MultiParameterCorrelation”
    which includes all attributes, the HS class assessed by the built-in rules (Table
    2) and the DS class assessed by both built-in and inferred rules from the first
    stage, within 4032 instances. The aim was to find new correlations between plant
    stress states and sensor measurements (rules #3–#7 in Table 3). The attribute
    Δtmp denotes the difference between plant and ambient temperature. By examining
    the list of the inferred rules it is obvious that rules #4 and #5 can collide
    with rule #1. Consequently, the rules that have been inferred might not be in
    a fully operational form. To alleviate this specific issue we need to conjugate
    the condition part of rules #4 and #5 with the term “SM > 60” in order to differentiate
    between DS and HS assessment. Table 3. Part of the rules derived by running machine
    learning algorithms. # Inferred rule Correctly classified (%) 1 IF (InfPAR ⩽ 319)
    THEN DS = TRUE 100 2 IF (QE < 0.87) THEN DS = TRUE 100 3 IF (AT ⩾ 18.5 AND AT
    ⩽ 28.5 AND PT ⩾ 20.8 AND PT ⩽ 29.9 AND Δtmp ⩾ 3.3 AND Δtmp ⩽ -1.3) THEN HS = TRUE
    100 4 IF (InfPAR ⩽ 243) THEN HS = TRUE 95 5 IF (PT ( 19 AND InfPAR ⩽ 313) THEN
    HS = TRUE 95 6 IF SM ⩽ 0.62 THEN DS = TRUE 91 7 IF Δtmp ⩾ 0.84 THEN DS = TRUE
    85 Based on the suggested machine learning process model (Fig. 8) and by using
    the WEKA feature selection tools we analyzed the relation between the parameters
    of lower informational value and the learning goals, and we created new data sets
    for each classification goal. This methodology disqualifies the appearance of
    complicated rules with many parameters not related to the classification class.
    Furthermore, we see in Table 3 that the rules for the prediction of the DS can
    be based on 3 different parameters. By having such a pluralism, the failure of
    a sensor may not be critical for the assessment of a state. Rules #6 and #7 in
    Table 3 are particularly interesting as they indicate a possible refinement on
    the threshold values of the corresponding rules for the assessment of the DS state
    with respect to the ones used by the built-in rules. Although the horticulture
    literature suggests a Δtmp value of 1 °C (Mannini and Anconelli, 1993) our machine
    learning experimentation indicates that this could be refined to 0.84 °C. Such
    an update can benefit the adaptation of the system in the current environment
    and improve the precision of the applied rules. This refinement has been also
    explored by the application of the Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm
    of the WEKA workbench in terms of the PT, AT and SM attributes. The result was
    a four cluster set which is graphically depicted in Fig. 11. As the plot depicts,
    each cluster is generally allocated in one of the four areas separated by the
    dotted vertical and horizontal lines. The different colors indicate the cluster
    a data instance belongs to. Black, blue red and cyan refer to cluster C0, C1,
    C2 and C3 respectively. Cluster 3 contains approximately 95% of the instances
    marked as healthy (DS = FALSE and HS = FALSE). All instances belonging to clusters
    1 and 2 needed irrigation treatment. For cluster 0, 82% of the instances required
    misting treatment and the rest were healthy. Finally, 9% of the instances belonging
    to cluster 3 requested irrigation and 3% requested misting. All other instances
    were stated as healthy. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Clustering
    of the “MultiParameterCorrelation” dataset. 3.4. WSN performance In this section
    we analyze the WSN performance focusing mainly on the estimation of the packet
    loss rate in terms of the number of motes and the duty cycle of the system. The
    duty cycle is defined as the ratio of the time required to sense and transmit
    a sample of the sensors attached to the mote to the sampling period. We assume
    a star topology formed by a set of sensor motes and a coordinator powered from
    the main source. We assume a steady state network where child nodes have already
    been associated to the coordinator node. The unslotted CSMA/CA protocol is used
    for the channel access, briefly described next. Two variables are used for each
    transmission attempt: number of backoff retries (NB) and backoff exponent (BE).
    In the beginning these variables are initialized as NB = 0 and BE = macMINBE (default
    value is 3). NB represents the number of backoff retries before assuming a channel
    access failure having a range between 0 and 5. The 802.15.4 MAC layer uses BE
    to choose a random backoff between 0 and 2BE – 1 to delay the Clear Channel Assessment
    (CCA) phase. BE has a range between 0 and 5 (setting BE to 0 means CSMA/CA is
    switched off). After the backoff period the MAC layer issues a CCA and if the
    channel is clear transmission can start. If the channel is found to be busy, both
    NB and BE are incremented by 1 and a new backoff is attempted. If NB exceeds the
    maximum threshold (macMaxCSMABackoffs = 5) then transmission is aborted. After
    the transmission the node waits for an ack frame. If the ack is successfully received,
    the transmission is considered successful. Our analysis is based on the analytical
    models developed by Timmons and Scanlon (2004) to describe the performance of
    the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol focusing on the estimation of the lifetime of an 802.15.4
    network of sensors in a star topology. For a network of n sensors the probability
    that the channel is clear in the CCA phase after the first backoff interval is
    given by the following formula: (5) where q is the probability of a node transmitting
    at any time. This probability depends in our case on the sampling period interval
    (SPI) defined for taking measurements and the payload size of the data frame.
    We do not take into account the polling messages from a sensor node to the network
    coordinator since these messages are very sparse (a pooling message is sent every
    measurements, approximately three times a day). The total size of the data frame
    is 33 bytes (18 bytes payload, 9 bytes MAC headers and 6 bytes PHY headers). So
    q is calculated as follows: (6) where TDF is the data frame transmission time.
    To estimate the packet loss rate we need to take into account the cumulative probability
    to find the channel clear so that packet transmission can happen (Ptr) by taking
    into account up to five backoff intervals as defined in the 802.15.4 CSMA/CA protocol
    and the probability of packet collision due to the fact that two or more nodes
    can select the same delay and transmit simultaneously. Ptr is defined as follows
    (Timmons and Scanlon, 2004): (7) Given that the probability of selecting the same
    backoff delay leading to collision is we can approximate the packet loss rate
    as follows: (8) The analysis shows that for a large number of sensors (up to 1000)
    with a low duty cycle (0.04% corresponding to an SPI of 5 min) both the probabilities
    of the channel being free for transmission and of not having a collision are greater
    than 99%. This means that the loss of packets is negligible. For the rather small
    number of devices used in our application it would be also more efficient to remove
    the CSMA/CA technique to avoid the initial backoff period and thus save more power.
    Fig. 12 shows the effect of the duty cycle of the system (determined by the selected
    SPI) on the packet loss rate for a constant payload size of 100 bytes. The results
    demonstrate that for a sufficient number of sensors duty cycles up to 1% give
    an acceptable packet loss rate in the range of 5%. Download : Download full-size

    The sensor motes operate according to the duty cycle in order to achieve the monitoring
    requirements of the application and conserve power by entering as much as possible
    to the sleeping mode. The energy consumption can be modeled by the following equation:
    (9) where ESense, ETx, ERx, EInit and ESleep represnt the energy consumed for
    sampling the sensors attached to the mote, transmitting data frames and receiving
    ack frames, initializing the mote and sleeping. Energy ESense is calculated as
    follows: (10) where V is the battery voltage (3.3 V), Ic is the current consumption
    to sample a sensor and ts is the total time to sample a sensor during a time interval
    T. Assuming a sampling period interval SPI then where tm is the measurement time
    for each sampling. For each sensor the Ic and tm values are defined in Table 1.
    Assuming SPI = 5 min Table 4 summarizes the energy consumption for the mote. In
    every cycle the sensing and the transmission operations are taking place only
    once. The duty cycle (DC) of the service is measured at 0.04% and the average
    power consumption is approximated by the following equation: (11) where Pactive
    is the sensing and transmission power consumption and Psleep is the sleep mode
    power consumption. From Table 4 the average power consumption is estimated to
    151 μW. Lifetime of the mote can be computed as where CBATT is the battery capacity
    (expressed in mAh) and E is the average energy given in Table 4. Using a 3.3 V
    Li-ion battery of 500 mAh the lifetime of the mote will be 1.2 years whereas a
    battery of 1200 mAh will achieve a 2.9 years lifetime. Therefore, the mote lifetime
    can easily satisfy the full crop agronomic cycle of strawberries which is 200
    days. Table 4. Energy consumption measurements. Empty Cell Energy (mJ) Power (mW)

    of the strawberry field with the WSN and the plant-driven irrigation resulted
    in a notable reduction in water consumption (∼20%) with respect to traditional
    agricultural practices involving user defined timed irrigation based on rules
    of thumb (twice or thrice a week for 1–2 h). The latter was applied in a parallel
    setup for the same growing period of the crop. The irrigation treatments were
    imposed from the beginning of the flowering to the end of the fruit maturity from
    early June to late July. Since the objective of any crop cultivation is to achieve
    the highest yield, crop yield is the most effective way to evaluate the benefits
    of crop growth systems. Therefore we compared the plant-driven irrigation system
    with the traditional irrigation scheme, regarding strawberry growth, in terms
    of crop yield, water use efficiency and other yield parameters. In our experiment,
    the strawberry harvesting stage started about 28 days after flowering and there
    were ten harvests that took place every 3 days. The highest quality of the crop
    was noticed in the first rounds. At each round of the harvest period the yield,
    the number of strawberries and the average weight per strawberry were recorded.
    The dry weight of strawberries was also determined by drying them at 80 °C in
    an oven. Water use efficiency was also determined for each case as the ratio between
    yield and the water amount used. Statistical analysis of the collected data was
    performed by standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Statistical Package
    for the Social Sciences for Windows. The irrigation treatments were run as one-way
    ANOVA. Table 5 summarizes the comparison of the two irrigation treatments. There
    was no statistically significant difference between the yields achieved by the
    two irrigation treatments. Traditional irrigation produced a slightly higher yield
    than the plant-driven irrigation, which can be explained by the excess amount
    of water provided. Dry strawberry yields were similar as were the average number
    and average weight of strawberries. On the other hand, the water use efficiency
    of the plant-driven approach was significantly better than of the traditional
    approach. Therefore the plant-driven approach with the system configuration discussed
    in this paper was successful in providing the proper amount of water for the physiological
    growth of the crop producing similar crop yield with the traditional irrigation
    system. Table 5. Crop quality indicators for the different irrigation treatments.

    Related work and discussion Over the years there has been a tremendous progress
    on the application of WSN technology in the precision agriculture domain at various
    forms. In the work of Peres et al. (2011), for example, an Intelligent Precision
    Agriculture Gateway was developed that can provide middleware services between
    on site deployed WSNs and remote locations. Data are gathered by ZigBee operated
    WSNs that feed a local database which can be then queried by authorized remote
    clients. Usability and scalability issues are in the focus of their research.
    As another example, in the work of Garcia-Sanchez et al. (2011) an integrated
    WSN-based system for crop monitoring and video surveillance was developed in a
    distributed environment using cost effective communication technology (IEEE 802.15.4).
    Energy consumption, end-end transmission delays and network synchronization are
    some of the main features that have been addressed during system design by the
    authors. Irrigation scheduling based on WSNs has been proposed by Vellidis et
    al. (2008), by Kim et al. (2008) and by Pardossi et al. (2009). Coates et al.
    (2013) have integrated a commercial WSN with valve control software and hardware
    for agriculture irrigation based on soil moisture monitoring. The design of the
    actuator hardware and the development of the actuator firmware implementing a
    custom communication protocol are discussed in detail. A stress-test of the system
    was conducted with successful results. In a similar setup, Li et al. (2011) report
    a WSAN prototype deployed in a crop field for precision irrigation. While our
    system presents some common features with systems such as the above mentioned
    (e.g., the design and deployment of a WSAN for monitoring the crop and controlling
    irrigation), our overall solution is different in concept. We propose a new proactive
    computing model by looping sensor data with actuators through an adaptive and
    able to learn decision-making layer. In addition, the use of an ontology-based
    knowledge representation scheme for the organization of concepts and definition
    of operational semantics provides system flexibility and adaptability and supports
    the application of automatic inferential and validation mechanisms. Several implementations
    of WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses focusing mainly on crop and climate
    monitoring (Ahonen et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2008, Jimenez et al., 2012). The
    common characteristic of these implementations, independently of their state-of-the-art
    approaches in communication networking or hardware and software integration or
    their theoretical foundation, is that they tend to be simple prototypes which
    lack long-term evaluation. On the other hand, implementations that integrate wireless
    sensors with actuators for automatic control of greenhouse processes are limited.
    Park and Park (2011) developed a monitoring and control prototype that uses a
    WSN deployed in a greenhouse with a goal to gather environmental and plant based
    data. The data are used by a decision support system that attempts to optimize
    the greenhouse climate in order to improve crop productivity by controlling the
    HVAC system. The application logic is encoded in a set of rules which take into
    account current sensor values and actuator states. This prototype presents common
    features with the system we have developed but also has significant limitations
    regarding the size of deployment, the accuracy of measurements (no calibration
    of the used sensors is performed), the lack of supporting tools for application
    development and the lack of an overall system evaluation. Rule-based systems for
    irrigation management have been proposed in the field of agriculture in the form
    of expert systems (Thomson and Ross, 1996, Mohan and Arumugam, 1997). Knowledge
    acquisition is a basic building block of any expert system. Knowledge acquisition
    tools have been developed to help with building and maintaining the required knowledge
    (Rafea et al., 2003). Besides managing the existing knowledge acquired from the
    domain experts and literature using a handy rule editing tool, we have demonstrated
    in this paper the use of machine learning techniques to enhance the knowledge
    base with new rules for irrigation management. Two key parameters explored in
    the proposed rule-based irrigation control system are the plant leaf temperature
    (PT) and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF). Even though experimenting with strawberries
    we have not noticed significant differences in PT and CF between the leaves of
    a plant, this may not be true for other plants and other parameters. It is well
    accepted that plant-based techniques monitoring physiological responses require
    much replication for reliable data (Jones, 2004). In our prototype, for example,
    to get a representative measurement of the plant temperature in a specific zone,
    multiple sensors are used, scattered among multiple plants. Thermistors are used
    in our case because of their low cost, easy installation and high accuracy. Other
    solutions, such as IR imaging, which can scan the canopy of several plants, provide
    alternatives that have their own advantages and shortcomings (Wang et al., 2010).
    IR imaging may not provide as much as accuracy we require at an affordable cost,
    non-leaf objects can create noise and environmental factors such as reflectance,
    heating pipes and suspended light can significantly affect the results returned.
    Frequently, a manual image processing method is required for better accuracy.
    Regarding the CF parameter, this is mainly used for the machine learning process
    and works as a proof of concept that new rules can be learned based on this parameter.
    Irrigation decisions can then be based on multiple parameters and this, in principle,
    can improve system fault tolerance in case of a sensor failure. Undoubtedly, the
    robustness of the system can be improved by replicating the CF sensor. Our modular
    architecture allows the replacement of the current CF sensor with a more affordable
    one, which can be easily replicated, whenever such a sensor is available. We argue
    in this paper that deploying a WSN in a greenhouse to monitor both plant and environmental
    parameters in a way that takes into account space variability, in order to control
    irrigation, constitutes an efficient approach. One advantage of this approach
    is that the solution can be easily scaled to include more inexpensive sensors,
    without disturbing the other system modules, and likely improving the decision-making
    process. On the downside, the WSN maintenance and the calibration of sensors are
    tasks that must be taken into account. Regarding the machine learning process
    important conclusions have been drawn. Firstly, it has been verified that applying
    machine learning strategies in precision agriculture applications is a useful
    and efficient method, although not simple, for learning rules and relationships
    automatically from diverse datasets that simplifies the often tiresome and error-prone
    process of acquiring knowledge from the gathered data. Validation of the inferred
    knowledge, however, will require an iterative approach where the situation observed
    is repeated and thus a safe conclusion can be reached. Secondly, there is a need
    of a two-way interaction between the domain expert and the domain modeler. Their
    collaboration is crucial to transform the raw data received from the sensors into
    the final datasets to be used by the machine learning algorithms. Additionally,
    new rules inferred must be validated for their relevance by the domain expert
    and checked for consistency and redundancy with the existing ones. In principle,
    part of the consistency and integrity checks could be managed automatically through
    the rule-based reasoning engine by defining special conflict detection rules.
    An upgrade of the agronomic evaluation performed would be a comparison of our
    system with modern irrigation scheduling practices based on the estimation of
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc.). Here, the main idea is to balance the amount of
    water taken away through evapotranspiration with the amount of water to be applied.
    ETc. can be calculated using various weather parameters obtained by a weather
    station, statistical data and models developed for predicting ETc. Such models
    are integrated in relevant decision support systems for the daily management of
    irrigation. A more simplified approach to calculate ETc. is by using a Class A
    evaporation pan which relates the measured evaporation to crop water use. In that
    case, an appropriate crop coefficient (Kc) must be applied to determine ETc. Accurate
    Kc values, however, depend on various site-specific parameters (e.g., soil characteristics,
    crop physiology, development stage, etc.) and are often difficult to establish.
    The additional complexity of developing an ETc.-based irrigation scheduling system
    from scratch prevented us from making such a comparison. Plant-based methods for
    irrigation scheduling do not indicate directly the amount of water to be applied
    and experimentation is required to determine control thresholds (Jones, 2004).
    Accordingly, it is not possible to use the plant temperature to stop irrigation
    due to the time lag between applying the irrigation, the permeation through the
    substrate and the subsequent uptake of the water by the plant. To alleviate this
    shortcoming, plant-based sensors are combined with soil moisture measurement sensors
    that can indicate when to stop the irrigation. Thresholds then are established
    through experimentation where irrigation treatments are tested over a range of
    sensor values to identify the best case. In such experiments the thermistors were
    used to commence the irrigation, and the soil moisture probes were used to determine
    when adequate water had been added to the substrate. After experimentation the
    average irrigation time to reach the ideal 60% of water content after the identification
    of a water stress was found to be 30 min. 4. Conclusions We have been involved
    with a facet of precision agriculture that concentrates on plant-driven crop management.
    By monitoring soil, crop and climate in a field and providing a decision support
    system that is able to learn, it is possible to deliver treatments, such as irrigation,
    to specific parts of a field in real time and proactively. We have presented in
    this paper an integrated framework consisting of hardware and software components
    as well as tools that support efficiently the development of an autonomous WSAN-based
    system for precision irrigation in greenhouses. Fertilizer and pesticide treatments
    are other examples of applications in agriculture that could benefit from such
    proactive approaches.The integration of a chlorophyll content meter sensor would
    allow system upgrading to incorporate fertigation (supply of fertilizer via the
    irrigation system). In that case the system ontology will need to be updated with
    appropriate rules to determine where/when exactly a fertilizer (e.g. nitrogen)
    is required. The availability of sensors for the detection of plant-emitted volatile
    organic compounds (VOCs) including ethylene (which signals general stress), esters
    of jasmonic acid (which signal pest attack), and esters of salicylate (which signal
    pathogen attack) would allow the issue of infection alerts and actuate a pathogen
    or pest-specific response as appropriate. By integrating to our platform electronic
    nose technology it is possible that volatile sensor arrays could detect the presence
    of specific pathogens or pests. Moving our research towards a more autonomous
    system with self-adaptation and self-learning characteristics, we have been exploring
    ways of incorporating learning capabilities in the system. Our experiments have
    shown that machine learning algorithms can be used for inducing new rules by analyzing
    logged datasets to determine accurately significant thresholds of plant-based
    parameters and for extracting new knowledge and extending the system ontology.
    To deal with the uncertainty of data, work is in progress to define a model describing
    the uncertainty aspects. Quality indicators can be specified so that the end-user
    (either an application or a person) can make judgements on the confidence level
    that the information entails. Uncertain context mechanisms such as probabilistic
    logic, fuzzy logic and Bayesian networks can be evaluated and applied accordingly.

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction In the western US, substantial year-to-year variability
    in weather conditions complicates planning for water managers and agricultural
    producers, and makes it difficult to apply standard rule-of-thumb approaches to
    agricultural water management. In California, the recent three year drought, from
    2007–2009, underscored the vulnerability of the state''s agricultural industry
    to variability in water supply, with hundreds of millions in economic losses and
    thousands of agricultural jobs lost [1]. Concurrent with the drought, groundwater
    levels in the Central Valley declined substantially [2] as growers pumped water
    to partially offset reductions in surface water deliveries. Inter-annual variability
    in water supply is common throughout the western U.S., where growing urban populations,
    increases in water allocations for endangered species, and climate change—with
    predicted shifts in precipitation and reductions in winter snowpack in the Sierra
    and Rocky Mountains [3]–[5]— will continue to constrain water supplies for agricultural
    users. Because agriculture is typically the largest user of water in the West,
    maximizing the benefits of available agricultural water supplies is central to
    the implementation of drought mitigation and climate adaptation strategies in
    western states. Low cost adaptation strategies for agricultural water users include
    the use of irrigation scheduling technologies that incorporate information on
    weather conditions and crop growth stage. Satellite measurements of water resources
    and hydrologic fluxes have great potential for supporting agricultural producers
    and water managers working to optimize agricultural water supply and use. When
    combined with biophysical models, satellite observations can be applied to scale
    point observations from surface observation networks across larger geographic
    areas. Evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture data are particularly relevant
    to both operational water management and long-term planning. Surface measurements
    of these parameters are often difficult and expensive to collect, and generally
    available only from sparsely distributed observation networks. Recent advances
    in modeling and measurement of ET using satellite observations now enable moderate
    resolution (30–1000m), spatially continuous estimates of ET over large areas in
    near real-time [6]–[9]. Integration of this information into current water management
    practices and operational models, however, requires the development of frameworks
    for synthesizing data from multiple sensor networks to drive models for estimating
    evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and other key hydrologic reservoirs and fluxes.
    New approaches are also required for delivery of satellite-derived data and information
    products to water managers and agricultural producers. Table I Summary of Key
    Terms and Abbreviations One water management challenge where integration of ET
    models and sensor network observations has immediate potential utility is in supporting
    agricultural producers and water managers working to optimize irrigation management
    by accounting for current weather and crop conditions when making irrigation management
    decisions. In scheduling irrigation, growers must account for multiple factors,
    including soil type, salinity and leaching fraction, weather conditions and crop
    growth stage. In water limited regions, it is particularly important for growers
    to maximize on-farm water use efficiency by accounting for weather conditions
    in estimating crop water consumption and associated irrigation demand. A common
    method of irrigation scheduling involves estimation of crop water use by multiplying
    weather-based estimates of reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) by crop coefficients
    ( K c ) for a particular crop. (A summary of key terms and definitions related
    to agricultural irrigation management is included in Table I.) ET o is defined
    as the evapotranspiration from a reference crop, typically a well-watered, actively
    growing grass or alfalfa of uniform height. In the western U.S., agricultural
    weather networks such as the California Irrigation Management Information System
    (CIMIS), AgriMet, and the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET) provide hourly
    information on weather conditions and ET o . Within California, CIMIS [10] currently
    operates 139 stations across the state and provides data to growers and irrigation
    consultants on ET o and weather conditions. Spatial CIMIS daily ET o data derived
    using the methods developed by Hart et al. [11] are available from 2003 to present
    at 2km spatial resolution statewide. The method uses cloud cover estimates derived
    from the GOES weather satellites to estimate the daily solar insolation for each
    pixel, and thus represents an initial integration of satellite and surface observations
    within CIMIS. Guideline crop coefficients have been compiled for several crops
    and are available from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Irrigation
    and Drainage Paper 56, commonly known as FAO-56 [12], the University of California''s
    Basic Irrigation Scheduler, the California Department of Water Resources'' Consumptive
    Use Program, and the Wateright system developed by California State University,
    Fresno. K c is a dimensionless value representing typical crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) for a given crop canopy relative to ET o , and it captures the effect
    of crop growth stage on evaporative demand. K c integrates the effects of both
    crop transpiration and soil evaporation. Many growers use a dual-crop coefficient
    approach, which separates the evaporation and transpiration components of ET.
    The basal crop coefficient ( K cb ) represents conditions for an unstressed crop
    on a dry soil surface, and a separate coefficient is used to calculate soil evaporation
    ( K e ) if required. K cb can be used to calculate basal crop ET ( ET cb ) as
    a measure of plant transpiration for a non-stressed crop plus a small diffusive
    soil evaporation component. As such, ET cb also provides a measure of potential
    crop water use, or biological water demand for well-watered crops. While useful
    for seasonal planning, one limitation of this standard approach to operational
    irrigation management is that it requires growers to derive crop coefficients
    from look-up tables and then correct them for site-specific conditions. In addition,
    many crop coefficients were developed decades ago and may not account for current
    farming practices or local and interannual variability in weather conditions and
    crop development rates. Previous research conducted in California quantified the
    observed benefits of using information on ET in irrigation scheduling. This research
    compared applied irrigation and yields reported by growers on 55 farms before
    and after use of ET o data from CIMIS. Results from the study reported an average
    increase in yields of 8%, and a reduction in total applied irrigation of 13% [13],
    [14]. While it is difficult to fully control for the effect of year-to-year variability
    in weather on crop yields in these types of studies, this result suggests that
    during key phases in crop development, some growers may be irrigating to the point
    that the root zone becomes saturated, reducing oxygen availability in the root
    zone and modestly suppressing crop growth. Across the 13 different crop types
    evaluated, including tree and vine crops, vegetable crops, and field crops, growers
    reported total economic benefits from increased yields and reductions in applied
    water ranging from 110to 1,700 per hectare. Due in part to these benefits, use
    of CIMIS data in California has grown from about 450 primary registered CIMIS
    data users in 1987, to nearly 40,000 today. In the year 2010 alone, for example,
    ∼2million reports were generated from the CIMIS database. However, the most recent
    farm and ranch irrigation survey conducted by the USDA indicated that only 12%
    of growers in California utilize reports on daily crop-water ET in scheduling
    irrigation [15], due in part to the barriers described above. Development of an
    automated system for mapping crop coefficients and delivery of data to users would
    enhance the use of ET data in irrigation management. The California Department
    of Water Resources (CDWR) identified statewide mapping of crop coefficients in
    near-real-time as one of the high priority, short term needs for CIMIS [16]. In
    addition to ET o , observations of other parameters related to agricultural water
    management are increasingly available from surface sensor networks and satellites.
    Soil moisture information is available for a limited number of sites from the
    USDA Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). As the cost of soil moisture sensors
    has declined, an increasing number of specialty crop producers are also deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks in their operations. Satellite and aircraft remote
    sensing observations of crop canopies over agricultural regions are used by the
    USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to map crop types and fallowed
    acreage on an annual, post-season basis, and increasingly by individual growers
    to identify and map variations in crop canopy conditions that may be indicative
    of pest infestations, variations in soil texture, or irregularities in irrigation
    systems. Seasonal estimates of evapotranspiration from satellite-driven energy
    balance models such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) [17]
    and the Mapping EvapoTRanspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [18]
    model have also been used by water managers for water rights accounting to resolve
    disputes over water resources [19]. Integration of these data sources into current
    management practices and operational models presents a number of challenges, especially
    for applications that require information in near real-time. In addition to typical
    issues associated with processing large volumes of data from heterogeneous sources,
    data from the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensors
    onboard the Landsat satellites must be atmospherically corrected to minimize artificial
    scene-to-scene variability resulting from the effects of aerosols, ozone, and
    water vapor. A hardware failure on the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument produces regularly
    spaced data gaps that must be addressed. Differences in the spatial scale of different
    satellite sensors must be considered when fusing data from sensors such as Landsat
    TM and ETM+ (30 m–120 m) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) (250 m–1 km) to reduce data gaps due to clouds and improve data reliability.
    Data from surface sensor networks are valuable for calibrating and scaling satellite-driven
    models, but they must be retrieved and transformed into formats that can be ingested
    by various models. At present, a number of satellite-driven energy balance models
    (including SEBAL and METRIC) for estimation of ET also require manual intervention
    to select “cold” and “hot” anchor pixels that serve to constrain the calculation
    of ET, making it difficult to fully automate operation of these models, though
    work by Kjaersgaard et al. [20] shows progress towards resolving this problem.
    As a result of these issues, the full potential of satellite data for supporting
    water managers and agricultural producers has yet to be fully realized. The NASA
    Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) [21] provides a modeling
    and computing framework for integrating satellite and surface observations in
    near real-time to address many of the challenges described above. In the following
    sections, we describe an application of the TOPS framework to develop a system
    for near real-time mapping of crop canopy conditions and associated crop irrigation
    requirements at the resolution of individual fields. To support continued improvements
    in management of agricultural water supplies, the data processing system is designed
    to provide growers and water managers with frequent, accurate, and easily available
    information that includes key indicators of crop canopy development and crop water
    use requirements. SECTION II. A Framework for Satellite Irrigation Management
    Support Fig. 1. Overview of the TOPS-SIMS architecture with primary data inputs
    and outputs. Show All The TOPS Satellite Irrigation Management Support (TOPS-SIMS)
    framework integrates satellite observations from Landsat and MODIS with meteorological
    observations from CIMIS and ancillary data on crop type and site specific conditions
    (Fig. 1). The system employs a modular architecture to facilitate support for
    a wide range of models and data. The initial implementation provides a capability
    for mapping of fractional cover ( F c ) , associated basal crop coefficients (
    K cb ) , and evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) over 3.7 million ha of farmland in California''s
    Central Valley. F c and K cb are mapped every eight days, and ET cb maps are produced
    on a daily basis at spatial resolutions that are useful for irrigation management
    at the field level (30 m). Automated atmospheric correction and gap-filling algorithms
    are optimized for agricultural areas to provide a robust and reliable data stream.
    Information from TOPS-SIMS is distributed to water managers and agricultural producers
    via a browser-based irrigation management decision support system. Users may combine
    the supplied K cb or ET cb with formal or intuitive estimates of soil evaporation
    to derive total water consumption over the recent period at the field level. By
    accounting for the irrigation application rate, distribution uniformity, and any
    corrections for water replacement targets (e.g., intentional deficit irrigation
    or leaching requirement), users can translate TOPS-SIMS output into an irrigation
    management strategy. To evaluate the utility of the system for commercial farming
    operations, TOPS-SIMS estimates are compared against ET data collected by surface
    renewal stations [22] and information from wireless soil moisture sensor networks
    deployed in operational agricultural fields across California in cooperation with
    growers. The TOPS-SIMS architecture facilitates forecasting of potential consumptive
    use and associated irrigation demand with lead times of up to 1 week through integration
    of forecast data from the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted Reference
    Evapotranspiration system (FRET). This capability is particularly relevant for
    future extension of TOPS-SIMS to support both irrigation scheduling and water
    delivery planning. Finally, the TOPS-SIMS architecture is designed to support
    the future addition of other satellite-driven models for estimation of ET, soil
    moisture, and crop stress, all of which further the goal of improving water management
    and making irrigation scheduling more practical, convenient, and accurate. SECTION
    III. Methods TOPS, a NASA modeling and data assimilation framework developed to
    monitor and forecast environmental conditions, provides a range of capabilities
    for integrating observations from satellites and surface sensor networks via models
    including crop models, biogeochemical and carbon cycle models, ecological models,
    and numerical weather and climate models [21]. The TOPS framework has also been
    adapted to run on high-end computing resources in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing
    (NAS) facility as part of the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) [23]. NEX combines supercomputing
    resources, Earth system modeling, remote sensing data from NASA and other agencies,
    and a scientific social networking platform to deliver a complete work environment
    in which users can analyze large Earth science data sets, run modeling codes,
    collaborate on new or existing projects, and share results within and among communities.
    NEX provides direct access to the full archive of Landsat and MODIS data for the
    western U.S., as well as on-demand access to thousands of processing cores, facilitating
    rapid processing of both historic data archives and incoming satellite data. Leveraging
    these capabilities, TOPS-SIMS ingests Landsat-5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ , and MODIS
    satellite imagery for California''s Central Valley and other agricultural regions.
    Landsat provides the spatial resolution necessary to produce information at the
    scale of individual fields. The daily temporal resolution of MODIS provides a
    gap-filling capability to ensure data availability. Methods employed by the remote
    sensing community for satellite mapping of ET at field scales (30 m) rely primarily
    on energy balance models, e.g., [17], [18], [24], or reflectance-based mapping
    of crop coefficients, e.g., [25]–[28]; see also review by Gowda et al. [29]. Of
    these approaches, strategies for full automation at the scale of individual fields
    have only been developed for mapping of crop coefficients from surface reflectance,
    and thus the initial suite of algorithms implemented in the TOPS-SIMS framework
    relies on this approach. In the future, it may be possible to implement additional
    models, including energy balance models and models for downscaling of soil moisture
    estimates from satellite missions such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
    mission. Each Landsat scene is atmospherically corrected using software developed
    under the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project
    [30]. LEDAPS incorporates the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer modeling approach
    of Vermote et al. [31], as included in the standard MODIS data processing chain.
    Landsat TM and ETM+ data are tiled onto a common grid to form an 8-day composite.
    This facilitates use of overlapping portions of each scene to increase the frequency
    of observations and reduce data gaps due to cloud cover. This compositing approach
    also reduces the effects of the ETM+ scan line correction error, as only the central
    portion of the Landsat 7 scenes are used, where the gaps are narrower. The next
    step is to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [32] from
    the composited Landsat scenes. NDVI is an index calculated from the red and near
    infrared wavelengths and provides a measure of photosynthetic capacity. At this
    stage, a suite of gap-filling algorithms are employed to ensure spatially continuous
    data over agricultural regions. Current algorithms include the use of moving window
    averages and linear interpolation to fill small data gaps over agricultural fields.
    Field boundaries available from many of the County Agricultural Commissioners''
    offices in California facilitate identification of MODIS 250 m NDVI pixels that
    are fully contained within agricultural field boundaries, and thus enable use
    of MODIS data to fill the majority of the remaining data gaps with reasonable
    accuracy. Use of the STAR-FM algorithm [33], as implemented within TOPS, can be
    employed to address any remaining gaps through fusion of Landsat and MODIS by
    disaggregating MODIS data to the Landsat scale. Prior to further processing, non-agricultural
    areas are masked out using the USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL)1 [34] and field
    polygons from local County Agricultural Commissioner offices, when available.
    The CDL is also used to spatially differentiate annual crops from perennial orchards
    and vineyards. Following the compositing and gap-filling procedures, NDVI data
    are transformed to F c via empirical relationships developed by USDA and NASA.
    Johnson and Trout [35] and Trout et al. [36] collected field measurements of F
    c across multiple crop types in the Central Valley. These data were compared with
    satellite observations collected on the same day, and revealed a robust relationship
    between NDVI and F c (Fig. 2(a)). This approach is consistent with previous studies
    showing that various spectral vegetation indices, calculated from visible and
    near-infrared (NIR) reflectance data, are linearly related to canopy light interception
    [37]–[39]. To convert F c to K cb , TOPS-SIMS uses different approaches for retrospective
    versus near real-time mapping of K cb . For retrospective mapping of annual crops
    or for fields where information on the current crop type is available from the
    grower, F c is converted to K cb based on a physical description of the crop canopy
    [40]. A density coefficient ( K d ) , based on F c and estimated plant height,
    is calculated first to link increases in the crop coefficient with increasing
    vegetation amount. K d is then used to interpolate between the minimum and maximum
    K cb for a given crop type, as listed in FAO-56. Using methods described by Fig.
    2. Past studies conducted by USDA in collaboration with NASA [35], [36] provide
    the basis for linking NDVI to fractional cover using relationships that are robust
    across different crop types and canopy architectures ( R 2 =0.97) (a). In (b),
    use of a generalized equation (after methods of Allen and Pereira [40]) for converting
    fractional cover to FAO crop coefficients provides a robust approach for mapping
    K cb values for annual crops ( R 2 =0.90) . When the crop type at a particular
    location is specified or can be identified with confidence, crop specific equations
    may also be applied. Show All Allen and Pereira [40], a crop specific F c − K
    cb conversion can be applied retrospectively to a given field based on the CDL
    crop classification or information provided by the grower or farm manager. The
    CDL is not publicly available until after December 31 of each year, however, presenting
    a challenge for near real-time mapping of K cb using this approach. While the
    crop type for perennial fields (vineyards, orchards) can be reasonably determined
    from prior-year maps, the spatial distribution of annuals, such as lettuce, tomato,
    or cotton, is generally unknown within-season due to the complex and diverse nature
    of the agricultural cropping patterns throughout much of California. A generalized
    F c − K cb relationship representing a best-fit to crop specific relationships
    (Fig. 2(b)) is thus applied for near real-time mapping of fields deemed by CDL
    to contain annual crops. Use of this approach introduces K cb mean estimation
    uncertainty ranging from 3–14% across the major crop categories (vegetables, roots/tubers,
    legumes, fibers, oils, cereals). For perennial crops, results from multi-year
    studies recently performed on large weighing lysimeters at the University of California
    Kearney Agricultural Center are used for F c − K cb conversion [41], [42]. Both
    studies reported a strong relationship between mid-day canopy light interception,
    which is closely related to F c , and the crop coefficient. Finally, ET cb for
    both annuals and perennials is calculated as the product of K cb and ET o . For
    California, ET o is retrieved by TOPS-SIMS via FTP (file transfer protocol) from
    the standard Spatial CIMIS 2 km daily statewide ET o grids. Fig. 3. Examples of
    comparisons between profiles from TOPS-SIMS using generalized (solid blue line)
    and crop-specific (dashed blue line) relationships versus FAO-56 [12] (solid green
    line) for various crops during 2011. The comparisons highlight the ability of
    TOPS-SIMS to modify the idealized FAO-56 for observed crop cover and phenology
    as related to site-specific management practices and local weather conditions.
    Show All TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of deriving crop coefficients for estimating
    ET cb using an automated data integration and processing system, fully independent
    of contemporaneous crop type classification, and provides a framework for assimilating
    other sensor network observations and models to provide information on crop canopy
    conditions and ET. Crop coefficient values from the fully automated TOPS-SIMS
    compare well with crop coefficients derived from FAO-56 planning guidelines during
    initial growth and at near full cover, but can deviate during vegetative growth
    and maturation. Comparisons for individual fields highlight differences due to
    agronomic practices and crop response to site-specific weather conditions (Fig.
    3). For example, the seasonal profiles for tomatoes and cotton closely match the
    FAO-56 profiles when using a crop-specific formula to convert F c to K cb , while
    lettuce and watermelon were better characterized by the generalized F c − K cb
    conversion. Corn and wheat observations reveal different development rates and
    overall phenological progression than those of FAO. Johnson and Melton [43] also
    compared TOPS-SIMS ET cb estimates against ET c values from SEBAL, which employs
    a more complex energy-balance approach. SEBAL has been widely used to model ET
    over agricultural regions, but requires a highly trained analyst to manually perform
    the required calibrations and operate the model. TOPS-SIMS ET cb values compared
    favorably with SEBAL ET a estimates for unstressed crops for representative San
    Joaquin Valley crop types, with mean differences ranging from 0.4 to 0.85 mm/day
    (Fig. 4). SECTION IV. Integrating Satellite and Surface Sensor Networks With ET
    Models Automated integration of satellite observations of crop canopy development
    with surface observations of ET o is an important first step in developing a fully
    integrated sensor network or “system of systems” capable of providing estimates
    of ET and soil moisture derived from multiple data sources to water managers and
    agricultural producers. Integration of soil moisture observations from soil moisture
    sensor networks installed in agricultural fields is an important additional advance,
    as soil moisture observations can provide operational users with an independent
    check on a water balance derived from satellite ET cb estimates and field-specific
    irrigation and weather records. Integration of soil moisture data also provides
    a mechanism for future automation of model calibration to account for intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower. It is cost prohibitive to collect soil moisture
    observations across an entire field, but selective use of soil moisture sensors
    can increase confidence in satellite-derived estimates and facilitate use of satellite
    data to scale information derived from soil moisture observations over larger
    areas. Fig. 4. Comparison of daily water use estimates (mm) for unstressed San
    Joaquin Valley fields generated by two satellite-driven models (from Johnson and
    Melton [43]). Actual evapotranspiration ( ET a ) generated using the SEBAL surface
    energy balance approach. Basal evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Mean absolute error (MAE) in mm/day was calculated as a measure of model agreement,
    as shown. All dates 2009. Show All The cost of soil moisture sensors and wireless
    data loggers has declined substantially over the past decade, and there are now
    a number of commercially available options for growers interested in deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks. In addition, new cost effective techniques have
    been developed for measuring actual ET ( ET a ) in agricultural environments characterized
    by fields on the order of 10–40 hectares. While techniques such as the surface
    renewal approach [22] are still too expensive and complex for use by commercial
    farms growing specialty crops, field instrumentation has now become more cost
    effective, such that multiple sites can be monitored by water management agencies
    or small research teams providing important reference and validation data. To
    assist in understanding relationships between satellite estimates of ET cb and
    surface observations of ET a and soil moisture, we deployed soil moisture sensor
    webs on 12 commercial farms in the Central and Salinas Valleys, in research fields
    located at California State University Fresno in Fresno, CA, and at the University
    of California West Side Research and Extension Center in Five Points, CA. Sensors
    deployed included capacitance probes for volumentric soil water content measurement,
    soil water potential sensors, passive capillary lysimeters for measuring deep
    drainage, in-line flow meters for measuring total applied irrigation, aboveground
    pheno-cams (which record digital images of the field once per day), and meteorological
    stations. In collaboration with CDWR, we also deployed and operated above-ground
    surface renewal stations at seven sites in a range of crops to provide measurements
    of each component of the surface energy balance, facilitating calculation of ET
    a for each site. In surface renewal analysis, ET is calculated as the residual
    of a surface energy balance equation using measured net radiation, ground heat
    flux, and high-frequency measurements of air temperature [22]. These temperature
    traces exhibit low-frequency ramp-like structures which are used to calculate
    sensible heat flux. Surface renewal makes no assumptions regarding atmospheric
    stability, and is here combined with sonic anemometer data to account for unequal
    heating of air parcels across heterogeneous landscapes [44]. Integration of data
    from these sources has clear value for understanding spatial and temporal patterns
    in ET and soil moisture. Integration of satellite derived ET cb data with observations
    of volumetric soil water content and soil water potential has particular value
    for optimization of irrigation scheduling. Fig. 5(a) provides an example for a
    sub-surface drip irrigated cotton field located near Huron, CA. The satellite
    data provides information on the day-to-day crop water use under well-watered
    conditions, while the soil moisture sensors assist in identifying the onset of
    water stress and magnitude of deficit irrigation. The net water balance, or change
    in total estimated soil water content ( SWC e ) , is calculated as: Δ SWC e =P+I−D−
    ET cb View Source Fig. 5. To illustrate the benefits of integrating satellite
    estimates of ET cb with soil moisture measurements from surface sensor networks,
    measures of ET and soil moisture from different sources are plotted for a cotton
    field near Five Points, CA. Cumulative TOPS-SIMS ET cb (green line), combined
    total irrigation and precipitation (light-blue dashed line), net water balance
    (dark-blue dotted line), and observed volumetric soil water content (VWC, brown
    line) are plotted together in (a). On June 8, daily ET cb begins to exceed daily
    precipitation and applied irrigation as indicated by the negative slope of the
    net water balance line. By July 4 the cumulative water balance turns negative
    (indicating potential onset of plant water stress), and deficit irrigation is
    sustained through August. In (b), incorporation of a crop stress coefficient (
    K s ) of 0.85 to account for soil water limitations on plant transpiration from
    July 4 onward (solid green line) substantially improves agreement between ET cb
    estimates from TOPS-SIMS (dashed green line) and ET a measurements from a surface
    renewal station located in the field (solid dark-blue line). Show All where P
    is precipitation in mm measured by the on-site weather station; I is irrigation
    in mm, calculated as the average flow measured in two drip laterals and divided
    by effective irrigated area; D is drainage below the rooting zone measured with
    a Gee capillary lysimeter installed at a depth just below the rooting zone (120
    cm); and ET cb is the basal crop ET in mm. The daily measured volumetric soil
    water content (VWC) is calculated as the average of the volumetric water content
    measured using capacitance probes (Decagon 10 HS) installed at three depths (0–10
    cm, 35–45 cm, and 70–80 cm) at each of eight locations throughout the field. ET
    a is the measured ET from the surface renewal station located in the center of
    the field. As shown in Fig. 5(b), ET a and ET cb agree well during the early stages
    of crop development when the crop is well-watered. After June 8, 2011, daily ET
    cb exceeds total applied irrigation and after July 4, the cumulative water balance
    turns negative. This is reflected in the observed VWC which declines from June
    8 onwards. The sustained negative net water balance also reflects intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower, and this deficit is captured by the difference
    between the surface renewal ET a measurements and the satellite-based ET cb estimates.
    Plants respond to water stress by reducing transpiration, and under the FAO-56
    approach, a crop water stress coefficient ( K s ) based on soil water content
    is used to account for this reduced transpiration in calculating ET c [12]. The
    addition of a K s coefficient of 0.85 to account for the deficit irrigation results
    in close agreement between the satellite-derived and surface renewal ET a estimates
    (Fig. 5(b)). This example illustrates the potential benefits of using surface
    observations of soil water content or soil water potential measurements in coordination
    with estimates of ET cb that integrate satellite and surface observations. The
    satellite-derived information can assist with tracking the daily irrigation demand,
    while soil moisture sensor networks provide an important check to ensure that
    the timing and magnitude of irrigation deficits are in-line with targets set by
    the grower. SECTION V. Data Distribution via Web Interface and Web Services While
    TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of integrating satellite and surface observations
    to map K cb and ET cb values, distribution of data and information via intuitive,
    easy to use interfaces is critical to facilitating use of the information by water
    managers and agricultural producers who may not be familiar with the specialized
    data formats used by the remote sensing science community. A web-based user interface
    providing access to visualizations of TOPS-SIMS information eliminates the barriers
    to data access, as only a web browser is needed to view and query the information,
    and no knowledge of specialized data formats is necessary. The TOPS-SIMS web-based
    front-end relies on an open-source software stack that utilizes the Open Layers
    JavaScript library to display maps and execute queries on map data from within
    web browsers (Fig. 6(a)). To facilitate geographic searches by users and provide
    a spatial context for the TOPS-SIMS information products, the interface combines
    TOPS-SIMS overlays with a selection of open-source and commercial base map layers,
    including maps of streets, land use, and aerial imagery. NDVI, F c , and K cb
    overlays are updated on nominal 8-day intervals; ET cb is updated daily. In addition
    to providing views of TOPS-SIMS data at the native 30 m resolution, the web interface
    also allows users to retrieve quantitative information from any variable by specifying
    a point or polygon and requesting the most current values or a time-series summary
    (Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 6. The TOPS-SIMS web interface provides capabilities for visualization
    and data access, including support for geographic queries and selection of data
    for visualization by date. The map in (a) shows ET cb (mm/day) for 3.7 million
    hectares of farmland in the Central and Coastal Valleys on 02-Aug-2011. Retrospective
    time-series for TOPS-SIMS output can be generated, as shown by the K cb graph
    for 2011 for a location near Huron, CA (b). Time-series data can be downloaded
    from the interface in CSV format directly into a spreadsheet for further analysis.
    Show All The TOPS-SIMS web interface relies on data services provided by an open-source
    software stack running a Python-based web server. Tools from the Geographic Data
    Abstraction Library (GDAL) generate the tiles used in the web maps. The server
    responds to map queries by retrieving data resting on an OPeNDAP web service (Open-source
    Project for a Network Data Access Protocol; http://opendap.org) and generates
    time-series charts from the resulting data using the Matplotlib graphics library.
    OPeNDAP is a software framework that facilitates remote access to local data regardless
    of local storage format, and thus simplifies the process of making scientific
    data sets available for other applications via web services. A working beta-version
    of the interface and associated web data services are available at http://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/sims/,
    and are currently being evaluated by commercial growers, irrigation consultants,
    and water managers in California through a series of ongoing pilot studies. SECTION
    VI. Extending the TOPS-SIMS Framework The current TOPS-SIMS K cb and ET cb mapping
    capabilities demonstrate the potential utility of a modeling framework to integrate
    observations from satellite and surface sensor networks to provide new data and
    information services to the agricultural and water resource management user community.
    However, the TOPS-SIMS modular architecture also allows for a number of extensions
    that can be rapidly implemented to expand the data and information services. Key
    short term objectives include: i)linking TOPS-SIMS to ET o forecasts to provide
    forecasts of irrigation demand at various lead times; ii) use of web services
    and a model web approach [45] to integrate TOPS-SIMS outputs with operational
    and planning models utilized by water managers; iii) incorporation of site specific
    information provided by growers to include generation of customized reports; iv)
    expansion of inputs to include observations from a constellation of moderate resolution
    satellite sensors to increase observation frequency and improve the reliability
    and accuracy of data and information products from TOPS-SIMS; and v) incorporation
    of additional publicly available models for estimation of ET, including satellite-driven
    energy balance models for estimation of ET. At present, managers of agricultural
    water supplies generally rely on historic climate data and static estimates of
    irrigation demand when making decisions about the volume of water to release from
    reservoirs. For agricultural water delivery systems such as the Central Valley
    Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP), which together provide
    water for 3.75 million acres of California farmland, water managers must rely
    on this historical data to time water releases up to a week or more in advance
    to meet the needs of growers. While water managers must also consider a range
    of other factors, including environmental constraints and hydropower production,
    new sources of data on forecasted irrigation demand could support improvements
    in the ability to anticipate periods of particularly high demand in response to
    high temperatures or sustained winds, while conserving water during cooler periods
    with lower irrigation demand. The recent development of two experimental ET o
    forecasting systems provides the possibility of using forecasts of short-term
    water consumption in place of estimates derived from historic climate data and
    maps of cropping patterns. The NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted
    Reference ET (FRET) system2 forecasts ET o with a lead time of up to seven days.
    The FRET forecasts for California are driven by outputs from the Weather Research
    and Forecasting model (WRF) [46], and utilize WRF forecast fields to parameterize
    the Penman-Monteith equation for ET o as adopted by the Environmental Water Resources
    Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers [47]. Experimental 8-day forecasts
    and seasonal ET o outlooks are also being developed by the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Bureau of Reclamation, and employ statistical
    forecasting methods to provide probabilistic ET o outlooks3. Data from the NOAA
    NWS FRET system are already being ingested by TOPS-SIMS via a web service, and
    can be directly integrated with K cb maps to provide estimates of weekly irrigation
    demand over California at the scale of individual fields. Pending the outcome
    of ongoing analyses to identify biases and quantify uncertainty in these forecasts
    relative to observed ET o values from CIMIS, data from these forecast systems
    will be applied to produce and distribute ET cb forecasts to agricultural producers
    and water managers to assist in quantification of local, regional, and statewide
    crop water consumption and irrigation demand. Improved data on current and forecasted
    irrigation demand that incorporates satellite observations of crop conditions
    can also be incorporated into operational models utilized by the CDWR such as
    CALSIM [48], and planning models such as Cal-SIMETAW [49], [50]. Incorporating
    recent historic data into these models has potential utility for evaluating past
    decisions on water releases, identifying opportunities for future improvement
    in delivery of water to growers, and developing strategies for implementation
    of water markets during drought years. In cases where forecasted demand is significantly
    higher or lower than historic demand for a given period, water operations managers
    could adjust management practices and improve their ability to deliver water to
    growers when and where it is most needed. Satellite derived K cb and ET cb maps
    are also potentially valuable as inputs into longer term planning models, and
    the development of a 10+ year record of observed crop canopy conditions and K
    cb values could lead to improvements in models used for long term planning, such
    as Cal-SIMETAW. Because TOPS-SIMS is implemented on NEX and data products are
    already distributed via an OPeNDAP web service, integration with other models
    is straight-forward, as data can be requested via existing web services, and data
    not already available in the NEX archive can be rapidly generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Incorporation of site-specific information from growers can assist in eliminating
    sources of uncertainty in estimating ET associated with crop type, the timing
    and amount of irrigation applied, and the irrigation system configuration. Research
    is ongoing to extend the TOPS-SIMS framework to allow growers to specify this
    information for individual fields, facilitating use of crop-specific relationships
    for mapping K cb from satellite data, and allowing growers to specify correction
    factors to account for intentional deficit irrigation or a leaching fraction.
    Grower information on precedent irrigation schedule and irrigation system type
    would allow estimation of soil evaporation and conversion of ET cb to ET c . Allowing
    growers to input information on irrigation system type and application rates would
    also allow TOPS-SIMS to translate ET cb into recommended irrigation system run
    times. TOPS-SIMS algorithms for deriving K cb from NDVI currently rely on data
    from the Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ , and MODIS satellite sensors, but NDVI can
    also be derived from observations from multiple other satellite sensors currently
    collecting data in the red and near-infrared wavelengths at resolutions from 20
    m to 60 m. Data from the SPOT-5 satellite instruments, the Indian Resource Satellite
    Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), and the upcoming Landsat Data Continuity Mission
    (LDCM) and Sentinel-2 satellite mission offer the potential for integration of
    observations into a “system of systems” to provide field-scale observations of
    crop canopy development multiple times per week, reducing data latency and data
    gaps resulting from cloud cover. While issues associated with inter-sensor calibrations
    must be fully resolved [51] and open data policies have not yet been finalized
    for all of these missions, TOPS-SIMS provides a framework for ingesting and compositing
    data from a constellation of moderate resolution (30–250 m) sensors to provide
    robust and reliable data and information services to agricultural producers and
    water managers. Finally, TOPS-SIMS is designed to support multiple models for
    estimation of ET from satellite observations, including energy balance models
    that incorporate information from the thermal bands on Earth observation satellites.
    The initial suite of algorithms implemented within TOPS-SIMS relies on the use
    of spectral information in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths to map F
    c and K cb values since this approach can be fully automated. As research progresses
    on automation of the internal calibration procedures for energy balance models
    [20], TOPS-SIMS is designed to support integration of these models, and to facilitate
    use of a suite of publicly-available models to provide a robust capability for
    automated, frequent, field-scale mapping of ET over regions the size of the western
    U.S. SECTION VII. Summary TOPS-SIMS employs a “system of systems” approach and
    applies the TOPS modeling framework to ingest observations from satellite and
    surface sensor networks to provide new data and information products to agricultural
    producers and water managers via easily accessible web interfaces and web services.
    The current framework supports near real-time mapping of indicators of crop canopy
    development and crop water consumption at field scales over 3.7 million ha of
    California farmland. Integration of satellite-derived estimates of basal crop
    evapotranspiration with observations of soil moisture from surface sensor networks
    offers promise for supporting agricultural producers and water managers working
    to optimize management of agricultural water resources. Use of the NEX computing
    architecture enables rapid processing of large volumes of satellite data and facilitates
    implementation of TOPS-SIMS over regions potentially as large as the western U.S.
    TOPS-SIMS is designed to integrate additional models and data services to support
    forecasting of crop irrigation requirements at weekly to seasonal lead times,
    and concurrent modeling of potential and actual crop evapotranspiration. Future
    integration of observations from a constellation of moderate resolution satellites
    would support further improvements in the frequency and long-term operational
    reliability of satellite-derived estimates of evapotranspiration and crop water
    requirements. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The energy-balance comparison data were generated

  description: 'A six-span center pivot irrigation system was used as a platform for
    testing two wireless sensor networks (WSN) of infrared thermometers. The cropped
    field was a semi-circle, divided into six pie-slice sections of which three were
    irrigated manually and three were irrigated automatically based on the time temperature
    threshold method. One network was mounted on masts fixed to the pivot arm (Pivot-WSN)
    and was programmed with mesh networking firmware. The second wireless network
    was comprised of sensors programmed with non-mesh firmware and was deployed in
    the field (Field-WSN). Our objectives were to: (1) compare the performance of
    a mesh and non-mesh networking systems of wireless sensors on a center pivot platform;
    (2) investigate the relationships between crop canopy, sensor body, and air temperatures;
    and (3) investigate automatic irrigation scheduling using data from wireless sensor
    networks. The Field-WSN outperformed the Pivot-WSN; data packet retrieval was
    more than 90% successful for 93% of the growing season using the non-mesh networking
    firmware for the WSN established in the field. The Pivot-WSN performed only 70%
    of the time at this same level of success. Temperature differences between the
    body temperature of the infrared thermometer and crop canopy varied as much as-5.1
    and 7.6°C. Transmission loss and incorrect calibrations of the wireless sensor
    modules affected irrigation scheduling throughout the season. However, post-experiment
    improvements-software upgrades and memory expansion of the RF module (by the manufacturer),
    changes to the calibration protocol, and an algorithm to interpolate the values
    of non-captured data are expected to improve the overall performance of the wireless
    network systems and automatic irrigation scheduling for the upcoming growing season.'

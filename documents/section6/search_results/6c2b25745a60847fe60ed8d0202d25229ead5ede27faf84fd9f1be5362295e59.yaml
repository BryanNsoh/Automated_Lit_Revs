    \ automation in the farming system is the \nneed of the modern era. The shortcomings\
    \ of the manual \nagriculture system can be rectified by exploiting the automatic\
    \ \nprocess which results in higher production of crops. An \nautomated remotely\
    \ controlled system is proposed that can \nfulfill the water usage for agricultural\
    \ land. The proposed smart \nirrigation system is developed that will irrigate\
    \ the field around \nacres at a time. A remotely controlled robot has been developed\
    \ \nthat will be powered by photo-voltaic panels. The robot has been \nwirelessly\
    \ controlled through an application. Different sensors \nand a high pixel camera\
    \ are attached with a robot to check the \ncondition of crops and sense the condition\
    \ of the soil. The field \nwill be divided into different sectors. For commercial\
    \ purposes, \nthe robot will be gone through all sectors and sense the condition\
    \ \nof the soil that will further send the data through the GSM \nmodule to the\
    \ phone. Furthermore, the developed application \ncommunicates the collected information\
    \ to the PC/Laptop. \nKeywords— Smart Irrigation, Real-Time Automation, Solar,\
    \ \nPhotovoltaic (PV), Crops, Soil. \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nAs we already know about\
    \ the importance of agriculture in \nour daily lives. Living within this most\
    \ advanced era, the \nbiological system of people only depends upon the \nagriculture\
    \ of their country. By keeping a good biological \nsystem, a good human personality\
    \ could be developed. \nPeople get food, vegetables, etc., through their agricultural\
    \ \nland. To keep our agricultural land perfect, we need an \nirrigation system.\
    \ Irrigation is the process of watering our \nagricultural field. Irrigation is\
    \ done through a manual process \nor automation process. In the manual process,\
    \ the farmers do \nirrigation by themselves. This method has a very low initial\
    \ \ncost. However, in the automation process, the irrigation is \ndone through\
    \ remote-controlled devices. This process is most \nefficient and simplest than\
    \ manual irrigation process but its \ninitial cost is quite high as compared to\
    \ the manual process \nand it is also a time-saving process. In the past, many\
    \ artificial \ntechniques have been discovered to make the irrigation \nprocess\
    \ easier [1]. Some of them were very efficient but they \nalso had a few major\
    \ drawbacks such as non-portable devices \nand can only irrigate a single area\
    \ of the field at a time.  \nThe soil is the most important medium for plant growth.\
    \ \nHowever, various parameters including soil moisture, PH of \nsoil, temperature,\
    \ and humidity varies from region to region. \nTesting of the soil for nutrients\
    \ gives valuable information \nabout the soil which can be used to optimize plant\
    \ growth. \nThe proposed project can be controlled using threshold values \nof\
    \ parameters set along with commands through the webpage. \nThe proposed system\
    \ turns “on” and “off”’ depending upon \nthe set values and can be controlled\
    \ by the user. The main \nbenefit of the proposed system is its portability and\
    \ low \nmaintenance cost because it is powered by the photovoltaic \n(PV) panels.\
    \ Furthermore, the proposed model not just \nirrigates the field but it also has\
    \ the ability to kill the bacteria. \nThe automatic irrigation systems are applied\
    \ in many \ndeveloped countries to avoid the wastage of water. The scope \nof\
    \ the proposed project is important because it irrigates the \nmaximum amount\
    \ of field and monitors the land remotely. A \nsolar enabled robot is used to\
    \ capture the condition of crops \nthrough a high pixel camera and sensors. If\
    \ the measured \nvalue of soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and the water\
    \ \nlevel is less or above the set threshold, the farmer got notified \nvia the\
    \ GSM cellular network. Proper action is taken timely \nto add the soil nutrients\
    \ through an irrigation pipeline, to \nspray the field that kills bacteria, and\
    \ to maintain the desired \nthreshold values [2]. \nA large amount of freshwater\
    \ is used in agriculture \nworldwide. The ratio would be increasing with time\
    \ due to \nthe rapid growth in population. When the population increase, \nthe\
    \ demand for food and water will also be increased. As we \nalready know that\
    \ all the food comes from our agricultural \nland. Water wastage has been always\
    \ a major concern for our \nsociety in daily life. Water availability varies drastically\
    \ from \nregion to region. Some regions have plenty of water available \nand some\
    \ face scarcity of water. Managing water resources \nfor agriculture is of extreme\
    \ importance. Water wastage is to \nbe minimized on an urgent basis as the water\
    \ consumption is \nincreasing with the population growth rate [3]. To overcome\
    \ \nthese losses a robotics-based irrigation system is developed \nin which the\
    \ maximum field will be irrigated. The field is \ndistributed into different areas.\
    \ The robot goes through all \nthese areas sequentially to sense the condition\
    \ of the field and \ncommunicates the collected information via message along\

    \ A Wirelessly Controlled Robot-based Smart Irrigation System by Exploiting Arduino\
    \ \nwith the GSM module through an application of the mobile \nphone. \nThe rest\
    \ of the paper is organized as section II contains the \nliterature review. The\
    \ methodology is illustrated in Section \nIII. Simulations and results are presented\
    \ in Section IV along \nwith the conclusion in Section V.   \nII. \nLITERATURE\
    \ REVIEW \nIn [4], the authors have provided a detailed review of the \nexisting\
    \ solar-powered smart irrigation system. The authors \nhave introduced a technique\
    \ in which they did irrigation \nthrough solar energy. The concept has been demonstrated\
    \ in \nFig. 1. They generated energy from PV panels for the \nirrigation process.\
    \ Although, this technique uses renewable \nenergy but it had some drawbacks such\
    \ as its initial cost were \ntoo high and it used a lot of space. In [5], a new\
    \ technique has \nbeen established for monitoring the moisture level of soil \n\
    based on wireless sensor network. They presented the \narchitecture of their project\
    \ and implemented decisions \nthrough real-time data. It had also some drawbacks\
    \ such as \nhigh maintenance costs and difficult installation. \n \nFig. 1. Solar\
    \ Energy Generation Process for Smart Irrigation. \n     Authors in [6, 7], proposed\
    \ an improved automated \nirrigation system. They had proposed localized moisture\
    \ in \nwhich there was a connection between a head of sprinkler and \nwater supply\
    \ through a pipe under some pressure. This \nmethod was highly efficient but during\
    \ the case of heavy \nwind, the water becomes drifting. Several other works that\
    \ \nhave presented several designs for the improvement of smart \nirrigation system\
    \ but as our work is more inclined towards \nsmart irrigation so we have developed\
    \ a robot that can be \nmoved into the maximum area of the field for irrigation\
    \ and \nit will capture the condition of crops through high pixel \ncamera. In\
    \ recent years, researchers have tried their best to \nestablish a system that\
    \ should be renewable and would easily \nirrigate the maximum amount of area at\
    \ a time but they have \nnot achieved 100 percent accuracy yet. In [8, 9], the\
    \ authors \nhave developed an algorithm that successfully extracts the \ndistribution\
    \ of covered temperature. In [10], a GSM-based \nprototype for the automatic irrigation\
    \ system has been \nproposed. Furthermore, in [11, 12], authors have established\
    \ \na technique of duplex communication. The main benefit of \nthis technique\
    \ is that it gave an overview of data and \ntimetable of the irrigation process,\
    \ using an algorithm of a \ncellular internet interface. In [13 14], the authors\
    \ have \nprovided an idea of low cost based wirelessly controlled \nirrigation\
    \ system. The main purpose of this technique was to \nsave the maximum amount\
    \ of water that always waste during \nthe watering of the agricultural field.\
    \ The main drawback of \nthis technique was its maintenance cost. The authors\
    \ in [15-\n18], have designed a fuzzy logic-based smart irrigation \ntechnique.\
    \ In our current work, the following equation (1) is \nused for the detection\
    \ and reduction of error: \n                              m.s.e = 1\nZ . ∑(un\
    \  -ûn)2                                       (1)\nZ\nn=1\n \nwhere; \n• \n\
    Z \n= trained sample numbers \n• \nm.s.e \n= mean square error \n• \n\U0001D462\
    \U0001D45B  & \U0001D462̂\U0001D45B = outputs \nThe researchers in [19-21], had\
    \ discovered a new \ntechnique in the agricultural market named as a center pivot\
    \ \nirrigation system. By dividing their system into two separate \nparts they\
    \ controlled their system through a micro-controller. \nAll the components were\
    \ connected and rotating along with a \ncentral point while on the other hand\
    \ the watering process \nwas done through sprinklers to crops. \nA low initial\
    \ cost, the programmable logic controller \n(PLC) based irrigation system was\
    \ developed by the authors \nin [22, 23] to improve the economic level of the\
    \ market. The \nsystem was reliable with easy implementation. The main \nworking\
    \ of their system was to control the PH level and \nhumidity level of the soil\
    \ and further sent the data to the logic \ncontroller that was used as a switch.\
    \ The main drawback of \nthis system was that the protection of the sensors kit\
    \ was not \nefficient. The authors in [24-28] have provided a system that \nworks\
    \ on the principle of the Internet of Things (IoT). The \nmain benefit of this\
    \ was that more than one task would be \nperformed at a time through cloud computing.\
    \ This system \nhad almost finished the appearance of workers/farmers for \ntask\
    \ formation. In [29, 30], the smart underground irrigation \nsystem has been provided\
    \ by the authors. It was a noiseless \nbased irrigation system having the best\
    \ economic level in the \nagricultural market. The system was beneficial because\
    \ it \ncould automatically water the plants/crops in the absence of \nfarmers.\
    \ Due to the quite complicated installation, this system \nfailed in the market\
    \ very badly. The authors of [31], have \ndesigned an artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) based irrigation \nsystem. This system was based on self-made decisions\
    \ by the \nmachine and it was also a self-healing device. Like previous \nirrigation\
    \ systems as we discussed earlier this system had also \nsome major drawbacks\
    \ such as high initial cost, high running \ncost, and due to the required programming\
    \ language this \nsystem was not understandable for ordinary workers. Also, \n\
    the concept of blockchain has been used in [32] to monitor \nthe agricultural\
    \ land remotely. \nIII. \nMETHODOLOGY \nThe main methodology steps that are used\
    \ to make out \nproject successful are given as follows: \nJournal of Robotics\
    \ and Control \nISSN: 2715-5072 \n31 \n \nAhmed Hassan, A Wirelessly Controlled\
    \ Robot-based Smart Irrigation System by Exploiting Arduino \nA. Schematic Diagram\
    \ \nThe schematic/structured diagram demonstrates the \nworking of the project\
    \ and shows the tasks performed by \ndifferent components to irrigate the maximum\
    \ amount of \nfield as much as we can. The first major process in the circuit\
    \ \nis to develop a wireless controlled robot, in which we \nintegrate the Bluetooth\
    \ module with Arduino which is further \nconnected to an application. A command\
    \ to the robot motors \nis sent through mobile by using an android application.\
    \ The \nrobot contains a camera for checking the condition of crops \nand also\
    \ has a kit of sensors i.e. sensor of humidity, the sensor \nfor measuring moisture\
    \ level in soil, the sensor for measuring \nph level of water, the optical transducer\
    \ to measure the \nnumber of nutrients i.e. Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium\
    \ \n(NPK) in the soil. The field will be distributed into different \nareas. The\
    \ robot will be going through all these areas \nsequentially.  \nFor the commercial\
    \ level, two pipelines will be set in every \ntwo areas by attaching these pipelines\
    \ with the robot in the \nform of tanks. One pipe line is for irrigation and other\
    \ is for \nthe spray to kill the pesticides in the field. The nutrients \ncontainer\
    \ will be attached to the irrigation pipeline when our \nsystem will show the\
    \ deficiency of nutrients in the soil we \nwill give the command by using the\
    \ GSM module and the \nnutrients will be mixed in the soil through the robot.\
    \ The \nstructured diagram of our project is shown in Fig. 2. \n \nFig. 2. Structured\
    \ Diagram for Smart Irrigation Process \nB. Proposed Model \nThe mechanical model\
    \ of our project is shown in Fig. 3. \nIn, this mechanical model different components\
    \ are attached \nfor specific functions. Point no.1 indicates that the robot is\
    \ \nrunning through solar energy with the help of two photo-\nvoltaic plates.\
    \ While point no.2 shows robot tyres and these \ntyres of the robot are controlled\
    \ by mobile App. The point \nno.3 is for pesticide spray that is used for killing\
    \ the bacteria \npresent in the agricultural field. A high pixel wireless camera\
    \ \nis attached at point no.4 which is used for monitoring the \ncondition of\
    \ crops/field. There is a kit of sensors for \nperforming different specific functions\
    \ attached at point no.5. \nFurthermore, a Bluetooth module is attached at point\
    \ no. 6 for \nmanaging a linkage between mobile application App and \nrobot. Point\
    \ no.7 is used for a tank in which two tanks are \nplaced one is for watering\
    \ and the other one is for pesticide \nspray. \n \nFig. 3. Proposed Mechanical\
    \ Robotic Model \nC. Main Components List \nThe \nmain \ncomponents \nused \n\
    for \nthe \nhardware \nimplementation of the robot-based smart irrigation system\
    \ are \nArduino Mega 2560, HC-05 module, optocoupler 6N139, H-\nBridge L298, relay\
    \ module, tyres, servo motors, solar plates, \nand battery, etc. The detail of\
    \ some of these components will \nbe discussed in the coming sections. \nD. Arduino\
    \ Mega 2560 \n     A microcontroller device Arduino Mega 2560 is used for \ncontrolling\
    \ the embedded components connected to it for \nspecific functions [33]. The measured\
    \ analog voltages were \nderived by using a simple equation (2): \n          \
    \  A.M.V=\nADC's Reading\nADC's Resolutiom *(System Voltages)             (2)\
    \ \n    There are the following reasons for using Arduino mega \n2560 given in\
    \ Table I. \nTABLE I. FEATURES OF ARDUINO MEGA \nSpecifications \nAtmega 2560\

    \ Compatibility \nYes \nFlash Memory \n256 \n \nE. H-Bridge \nAn H-bridge is also\
    \ known as an L298 motor driver. This \nmotor driver is used in our project for\
    \ controlling the tyres of \nthe robot. There are also other motor drivers in\
    \ the market \nsuch as L293 but have the drawback of low input voltage \npower.\
    \ We prefer L298 motor driver due to its high input \nvoltage power. The specifications\
    \ of this bridge are given in \nTable II. \nThe power consumption of H-bridge\
    \ is quite low i.e., \n36mA with supply voltages of 5V. It has independent \n\
    direction, speed, and braking system for each motor. Due to \nthis motor driver,\
    \ our robot can move in both clockwise and \nanticlockwise directions. By pressing\
    \ the appropriate button \nfrom the developed mobile application, the motors of\
    \ robot \nstart moving in the forward direction and vice versa [34]. \nJournal\

    \ influence (EMI) of the half-bridge \ncircuit (HBC) in different duty cycles.\
    \ It is observed in \nradiated EMI that a greater duty cycle of H-bridge causes\
    \ low \nnoise current (Icm) with high noise frequency. On the other \nhand, in\
    \ the Dradiated EMI case greater duty cycle of H-\nbridge causes high noise current\
    \ (Icm)  with high noise \nfrequency [35].  \nF. Controlling Through App \nA mobile\
    \ app was developed to control the robot as shown \nin Fig. 4. Robot acted according\
    \ to the specific commands \nthat were given in the Application with the help\
    \ of high-level \nprogramming language.   \n \nFig. 4. Mobile Application  \n\
    \    A threshold value is fixed to each sensor in coding. When \na sensor cut\
    \ off that threshold value in form of voltages, we \nwere notified through a microcontroller\
    \ to a mobile app.  \nTABLE III. THRESHOLD PARAMETER \nSensor \nThreshold Value\

    \ AND RESULTS \nIn this part of the paper, two flow charts have been \ndesigned\
    \ for a better understanding of the whole proposed \nsmart irrigation process.\
    \ In Fig. 5, the mechanism to control \nthe supply of water through different\
    \ valves is demonstrated. \nWhile in Fig. 6, the flowchart illustrates how pesticide\
    \ spray \nkills the bacteria present in the crops/field. \nFurthermore, the schematic\
    \ diagram of our project is \ndesigned by using Proteus as shown in Figures 7-10.\
    \ Also, a \nhex file of the designed project is created for uploading that \n\
    project using C++ code in the Arduino platform.    \n \nFig. 5. Flowchart to Control\
    \ the Watering for Plants. \n \n \nFig. 6. Flowchart of the Spray Process. \n\
    A. Case 1 \nThe first case is for the Ph sensor, as we have already \ndefined\
    \ the threshold value for the Ph level for the soil in our \nArduino code. So,\
    \ when soil overshoots that predefined value \nour robotics system will detect\
    \ it, and LED start blinking. The \nschematic design for the Ph sensor is shown\
    \ in Fig. 7. \nJournal of Robotics and Control \nISSN: 2715-5072 \n33 \n \nAhmed\
    \ Hassan, A Wirelessly Controlled Robot-based Smart Irrigation System by Exploiting\
    \ Arduino \nFig. 7. Schematic Diagram of PH Sensor \nB. Case 2 \nThe second case\
    \ is for soil sensor, this sensor will detect \nthe moisture present in the soil\
    \ of the field. According to this \nmoisture’s level, our system will decide either\
    \ to irrigate or \nnot. As we have already defined the threshold value for \n\
    moisture level for the soil in our Arduino code. So, when the \nmoisture level\
    \ of soil overshoots that predefined value our \nrobotics system will detect it,\
    \ and LED starts blinking. As \nshown in Fig. 8. \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 8. Schematic\
    \ Diagram of Humidity Sensor \nC. Case 3 \nThis case is for nutrients sensor as\
    \ shown in Fig. 9. It \nmeans this sensor will determine the number of nutrients\
    \ in \nsoil such that nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus and \naccording to this\
    \ level our system will decide either to irrigate \nor not. As we have already\
    \ defined the threshold value for \nnutrients present in the soil in our Arduino\
    \ code. So, in case \nof nutrients i.e., NPK below than the average value of the\
    \ \nthreshold level, our LED connected to that sensor will start \nblinking. \n\
    \ \n \n \n  \n \nFig. 9. Schematic Diagram of Nutrients Sensor \nD. Normal Case\
    \ \nThe normal case means when there will be no need to do \nany task through\
    \ a robot. In this case threshold values will \nremain constant and LED will not\
    \ blink as shown in Fig. 10. \nUsually, it is a very rare case in normal days.\
    \ But when this \ncase happens, other tasks could be performed such as killing\
    \ \nthe bacteria present in the field/crops through pesticide spray \nor checking\
    \ the condition of crops through a security camera. \n \nFig. 10. Normal Case\
    \    \n    A threshold value is fixed to each sensor in coding. When \na sensor\
    \ cut off that threshold value, we were notified through \nGSM to a mobile app.\
    \ \nV. CONCLUSION \n    By using the proposed automated irrigation system, excess\
    \ \nwastage of water can be saved that is lost during manual \nmethods. It also\
    \ improvises the irrigation cycle and renders it \na successful one. Furthermore,\
    \ with this method, water \ndelivery to fields is achieved more efficiently. \n\
    The designed automated controlled robot is \ncontrolled wirelessly through different\
    \ commands and the \ncollected information of the field is displayed remotely\
    \ on the \nmobile application as well as on the PC of the farmers.  Also, \nthe\
    \ electricity issue is resolved as the robot is solar-powered. \nThus, this method\
    \ has an upper hand over all other methods \nof irrigation because of its consistency\
    \ and usability. The \nmaintenance cost of our project is low and in the future,\
    \ it \ncould be deployed on a commercial basis because of cost-\neffectiveness.\

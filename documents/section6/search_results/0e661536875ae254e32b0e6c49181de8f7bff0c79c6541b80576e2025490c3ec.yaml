    \ of this review was to synthesize existing evidence on GIS and RS applica-\n\
    tion in agriculture in enhancing evidence-informed policy and practice for improving\
    \ agriculture\nsustainability and identifying obstacles to their application,\
    \ particularly in low- and middle-income\ncountries. Systematic searches were\
    \ conducted in the databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, Bielefeld\nAcademic Search\
    \ Engine, COnnecting REpositories (CORE), and Google Scholar. We identiﬁed\n2113\
    \ articles published between 2010–2021, out of which 40 articles met the inclusion\
    \ criteria. The\nresults show that GIS technology application in agriculture has\
    \ gained prominence in the last decade,\nwith 66% of selected papers being published\
    \ in the last six years. The main GIS application areas\nidentiﬁed included: crop\
    \ yield estimation, soil fertility assessment, cropping patterns monitoring,\n\
    drought assessment, pest and crop disease detection and management, precision\
    \ agriculture, and fer-\ntilizer and weed management. GIS technology has the potential\
    \ to enhance agriculture sustainability\nthrough integrating the spatial dimension\
    \ of agriculture into agriculture policies. In addition, GIS\npotential in promoting\
    \ evidenced informed decision making is growing. There is, however, a big gap\n\
    in GIS application in sub-Saharan Africa, with only one paper originating from\
    \ this region. With the\ngrowing threat of climate change to agriculture and food\
    \ security, there is an increased need for the\nintegration of GIS in policy and\
    \ decision making in improving agriculture sustainability.\nKeywords: GIS; RS;\
    \ spatial autocorrelation; policy integration; agri-spatial policy integration;\

    \ globally has risen tremendously and is expected to increase\nto 59–98% by the\
    \ year 2050 [1]. However, the growing concerns are that the agricultural\nfood\
    \ production systems are unable to match the high demand, especially in poor na-\n\
    tions, causing an intensifying level of food insecurities [2]. The inefﬁciency\
    \ of the food\nproduction systems is also one of the reasons for food insecurity\
    \ [3]. How best to facilitate\nincreased food production without jeopardizing\
    \ land and water resources, energy, and the\nenvironment is a momentous task that\
    \ government and policymakers have to address [4].\nIn many low- and middle-income\
    \ countries (LMICs), most of the food production is\nrural-based, dominated by\
    \ smallholder and subsistence farmers. Enhancing smallholders’\nsustainability\
    \ requires that farmers are empowered with practicable information that en-\n\
    ables them not only to make evidence-informed decisions but also to implement\
    \ them in\nactivities that could increase their farm productivity and sustainability.\
    \ In efforts toward\ntransforming the weak and often inefﬁcient traditional subsistence\
    \ production practices,\nsustainable production approaches [5,6] that support\
    \ production-efﬁciency-enhancement\nand better agronomic practices are needed.\
    \ These include planting climate-resilient crops,\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974.\

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n2 of 15\nhigh-yielding crop varieties, crop yield\
    \ forecasting, integrated pest management, as well as\nintegrating biodiversity\
    \ solutions in sustainable food production systems [7,8] Ultimately,\nthese novel\
    \ interventions would require comprehensive, up-to-date datasets (spatial and\n\
    non-spatial) and the adoption of advanced GIS technologies that can synthesize\
    \ and inte-\ngrate social, spatial, economic, demographic, and environmental data\
    \ in agriculture. The\noutput of this synthesis would be evidence-based spatial\
    \ knowledge that improves our\nunderstanding of agriculture sustainability and\
    \ in supporting better policies and decision-\nmaking processes.\nContemporary\
    \ advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing\n(RS), and\
    \ Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) technologies present an opportunity to\n\
    acquire and operationalize high-resolution satellite imagery and digital spatial\
    \ data [9].\nIn the agriculture sector, these spatial data have aided in the investigation\
    \ of the spatial\nlinkages of social, physical, agroecological, and environmental\
    \ complexities and how they\naffect agriculture sustainability. GIS technology\
    \ provides users with a mixture of geo-spatial\ninformation management tools and\
    \ methods that allow users to collect, store, integrate,\nquery, display, and\
    \ analyze geospatial data at various scales [10]. Remote sensing technol-\nogy\
    \ acquire images and other information about crops and soil from sensors mounted\
    \ on\ndifferent platforms including satellites, airborne remote sensing (manned\
    \ drones and un-\nmanned aerial vehicles), and ground-based equipment that is\
    \ then processed by computers\nto aid agricultural decision-making systems [11,12].\n\
    The spatial context of agriculture can be viewed from the perspective of farmers’\n\
    differentiated access to livelihood capitals, local resources, and access to essential\
    \ infras-\ntructure and services existing in a locality. In a GIS system, the\
    \ data containing each of\nthese aspects can be deconstructed as nested spatial\
    \ layers, each rooted in local geogra-\nphy by geographic coordinates captured\
    \ using GPS [13]. These spatial layers can then\nbe processed and analyzed in\
    \ a GIS system in multiple ways to reveal crop and soil con-\nditions and spatial\
    \ interactions, predict crop trends, monitor land-use change, monitor\npests,\
    \ and in biodiversity conservation [14–17]. They can also be used to map and reveal\n\
    spatial impediments to agricultural production, or even new information for improving\n\
    agricultural sustainability.\nIn recent times, the increasing complexity associated\
    \ with agriculture production sys-\ntems has aroused policymakers’ interest in\
    \ investigating how the spatial aspect “dimension”\nof agriculture can be exploited\
    \ using advanced GIS, RS, and GPS technologies to improve\nagricultural productivity\
    \ and better production practices [18,19]. The integration of GIS\ntechnologies\
    \ in agriculture has increased the opportunities for the development of even bet-\n\
    ter spatial explicit frameworks that support the creation of dynamic agriculture\
    \ databases\nand interactive systems [20]. Such database systems allow users to\
    \ interact with spatially\nreferenced agriculture data in real-time, while accurately\
    \ providing precise positional data,\nthus providing enhanced frameworks for decision\
    \ making. New ﬁelds that apply GIS in\nagriculture have emerged as a result. These\
    \ include precision agriculture, automated farm\nsystems, crop yield forecasting,\
    \ climate change detections, and the real-time monitoring of\ncrop production\
    \ [11,12,21]. These have the capability of improving agricultural production\n\
    and food security.\nIn this regard, several recent systematic literature reviews\
    \ have been conducted to\nilluminate and consolidate various ways GIS, RS, and\
    \ GPS technologies have been applied\nin the agriculture sector. García-Berná\
    \ et al. [11] used a systematic mapping study to focus\non the current trend and\
    \ what new opportunities in remote sensing techniques offer in\nagriculture. Their\
    \ study found increased uptake of RS technologies in the acquisition and\nextracting\
    \ of georeferenced data from satellite imagery and unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\
    Spatial data from these technologies have been applied in several areas including\
    \ crop\ngrowth and yield estimation, cropland parameter extraction, weed and disease\
    \ detection,\nand the monitoring of water and nutrients in plants. How this application\
    \ could be\nintegrated to improve spatial-based agriculture policymaking was not\
    \ elaborated by the\nauthors. The Al-Ismaili [22] review highlighted the integrated\
    \ application of RS and GIS\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n3 of 15\ntechniques\
    \ in precision agriculture and in the mapping, detection, and classiﬁcation of\n\
    the greenhouse through aerial images and satellites. How such a technique could\
    \ be\nassimilated into enhancing policymaking was not mentioned. In yet another\
    \ meta-review,\nWeiss et al. [12] research highlighted the emerging development\
    \ in RS that strengthens the\nspeciﬁc application of RS in crop breeding, agricultural\
    \ land use monitoring, crop yield\nforecasting, and biodiversity loss. Sharma,\
    \ Kamble, and Gunasekaran [23] focused on\nhow GIS data applications have assisted\
    \ in the development of precision agriculture. The\nauthors proposed a framework,\
    \ “Big GIS Analytic”, to guide how big GIS data should\nbe applied in the agriculture\
    \ supply chain. Their framework also lays a foundation for\na theoretical structure\
    \ for improving the quality of GIS data application in agriculture to\nelevate\
    \ productivity. These studies help us to understand how GIS and RS applications\
    \ in\nagricultural production systems have advanced. However, the available systematic\
    \ reviews\nseem not to explicitly provide how GIS and RS technologies could enhance\
    \ the integration\nof the spatial dimension of agriculture into policy frameworks\
    \ and interventions.\nThere is an increasing demand for evidence-supported decision\
    \ making to assist policymak-\ners in assessing the local needs of farmers, improving\
    \ production and supply value chains, and\ndeveloping spatial based-interventions.\
    \ In this regard, this review aimed at synthesizing existing\nevidence on GIS\
    \ and RS application in agriculture in enhancing evidence-informed policies for\n\
    improving agriculture sustainability and identifying obstacles for their application,\
    \ particularly\nin LMICs. The review draws on a decade of literature, from 2011\
    \ to 2021, to examine the current\nand future perspectives on integrating GIS\
    \ in policies that support agriculture sustainability.\nThe main contributions\
    \ of the study are to provide readers and policymakers with evidence on\nhow GIS\
    \ technology has been used in the agriculture sector to improve agricultural production\n\
    practices and inform how the technology can be adopted to improve evidence-based\
    \ decision\nmaking and policies. This paper is structured as follows: after the\
    \ introduction, we describe the\nmethodology applied to select and review the\
    \ articles; then, we detail the findings in Section 3.\nIn Section 4, we highlight\
    \ obstacles to applying GIS in agriculture policy and practice. Lastly,\nSections\
    \ 5 and 6 give the conclusion and the limitations of the study.\n2. Review Methodology\n\

    \ indices \nwere effective in measuring the percentage of wheat straw cover and\
    \ successively deter-\nmining its effect on yields of rice crops. The knowledge\

    \ GIS was applied in the selected papers according to the research\ntopic in the\
    \ sections below.\n3.2.1. Crop Yield Estimation/Forecasting\nMonitoring crop growth\
    \ and early crop yield forecasting over agricultural ﬁelds is an\nimportant procedure\
    \ for food security planning and agricultural economic return prediction.\nThe\
    \ continued advancement in RS and GIS technologies has improved the process and\n\
    techniques of monitoring the development of crops and estimating their yields\
    \ [26,29,31].\nSeveral studies demonstrate the application of integrated GIS and\
    \ RS technologies in crop\nyield estimation. Memon et al.’s [24] study demonstrated\
    \ how integrating multispectral\nLandsat satellite imagery and comparing different\
    \ RS-based spectral indices were effective\nin measuring the percentage of wheat\
    \ straw cover and successively determining its effect\non yields of rice crops.\
    \ The knowledge can inform long-term planning of agriculture\nsustainability in\
    \ rice-wheat cropping systems. The result of the research by Hassan and\nGoheer\
    \ [27] showed that the accurate early estimation of wheat crop yield before harvesting\n\
    can be determined by using vegetation indices derived from moderate resolution\
    \ imaging\nspectroradiometer satellite imagery and crop yield data and the GIS\
    \ modelling approach. In\nyet another study, Hassan and Goheer [28] used a GIS-based\
    \ environment policy integrated\nclimate model that provided a practical tool\
    \ for simulating rice crop yield. The model\ncombined regional level crop level\
    \ data, soil data, farm management data, and climatic data\nto spatially estimate\
    \ variations in crop yield. Likewise, Al-Gaadi et al. [29] extracted the\nnormalized\
    \ difference vegetation index and soil-adjusted vegetation index from Landsat\n\
    satellite images acquired during the potato growth stages to predict potato tuber\
    \ crop\nyield. GIS- and RS-based crop yield forecasting models could have a wider\
    \ application in\ninforming spatially based agriculture policies. For example,\
    \ based on the output of these\nmodels, policy intervention can be designed to\
    \ manipulate the speciﬁc contributors to crop\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n\
    7 of 15\nyields (which include farm management techniques, weather conditions,\
    \ water availability,\naltitude, terrain, plant health, and policy intervention)\
    \ [25,30]. Forecasting crop yields\nwell before harvest is crucial, especially\
    \ in a region characterized by climatic uncertainties.\nMonitoring agricultural\
    \ crop growth conditions and the prediction of potential crop yield is\nimportant\
    \ in planning and policymaking for food security and agricultural economic return\n\
    prediction [26,28,31]. This could include developing policies for improving agriculture\n\
    productivity and sustainability [28]. In feeding a growing population in LMICs,\
    \ agricultural\nproduction systems must strive to reduce the food production yield\
    \ gap between current\nyields achieved by farmers and those potentially attainable\
    \ in rainfed subsistence farming\nsystems. In addressing this mismatch, the study\
    \ by Hochman et al. [30] developed a model\nthat integrated statistical yield\
    \ and cropping area data, remotely sensed data, cropping\nsystem simulation, and\
    \ GIS mapping to assess and map wheat yield gaps.\n3.2.2. Soil Quality/Fertility\
    \ Assessment\nSoil quality assessment is critical for designing sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices\n(optimal agricultural use) that can help bridge the current food\
    \ production and demand\ngap in overcoming the food security problem. The availability\
    \ of RS datasets and GIS spatial\nmodelling techniques provides new opportunities\
    \ for measuring/evaluating soil quality at\ndifferent spatial scales [33,36].\
    \ Shokr et al. [35] developed a spatially-explicit soil quality\nmodel by combining\
    \ soil’s physical, chemical, and biological properties and integrating\nthese\
    \ with a digital elevation model and Sentinel-2 satellite image to produce digital\
    \ soil\nmaps. Abdelfattah and Kumar [32] describe the application GIS-enabled\
    \ web-based soil\ninformation system that provides a descriptive, quantitative,\
    \ and geospatial soil database\nin a simple interface. The system was applied\
    \ to determine the sufﬁciency potential of soils\nfor plant growing and management.\
    \ Using GIS and RS technologies, Abdellatif et al. [38]\ndeveloped a spatial model\
    \ for the assessment of soil quality. His model combined four\nmain soil quality\
    \ indices (soil fertility index, soil physical index, soil chemical index, and\n\
    geomorphological properties Index) and GIS ordinary kriging spatial interpolation\
    \ to map\nthe soil quality index. The application of these GIS-based models provides\
    \ evidence-based\nways to improve soil quality management. This would enable decision\
    \ makers, policy\nformulators, land-use planners, and agriculturalists to efﬁciently\
    \ manage soil resources to\nensure the sustainable use of agricultural lands according\
    \ to their potential [34,36,37]. Thus,\nassessing soil quality indicators would\
    \ be important for sustainable agricultural policies\nand practices and in achieving\
    \ food security.\n3.2.3. Crop Mapping and Monitoring Decision Support Systems\n\
    In an era of unpredictable climate changes, agricultural crop monitoring analysis\n\
    could help government policymakers and farmers plan and design cropping patterns\
    \ that\nadapt to water availability. Agricultural monitoring systems integrate\
    \ multiple geospatial\ndata sets and cropping system models into computer algorithms\
    \ to spatially compute\nand simulate optimum scenarios for site-speciﬁc conditions\
    \ for crop production [42]. A\ncrop monitoring system is developed by integrating\
    \ geospatial data obtained by high-\nresolution remote sensing with a web GIS\
    \ geoportal interface [41]. Santosh and Suresh [39]\ndemonstrated the uniqueness\
    \ of combining GIS and RS in a tool for crop selection and\nrotation analysis\
    \ at the farm level to improve crop management decisions. Cropping\npatterns simulation\
    \ is determined by irrigation water availability, which in turn is affected\n\
    by changes in climate and irrigation water extraction policies. Wang et al. [16]\
    \ combined\nGIS and irrigation water availability simulation models to analyze\
    \ the cropping patterns\nbased on the forecast of irrigation water availability.\
    \ A GIS web-based crop mapping\nand monitoring decision support system at the\
    \ farm level could help farmers to access\ninformation and take appropriate measures\
    \ to improve crop production [39]. Such a\nsystem can have a wider application\
    \ in supporting agronomic decision making including\noptimizing land and labor\
    \ productivities, enhancing higher cropping intensities, and\nSustainability 2022,\
    \ 14, 9974\n8 of 15\nproducing better crop yield [40]. This can increase crop\
    \ production and ensure better crop\nmanagement, in the long run, and precision\
    \ irrigation management.\n3.2.4. Agricultural Drought Assessment\nUsing spatial\
    \ datasets generated by satellite RS and GIS technologies offers very useful\n\
    information for assessing and modelling agricultural drought-risk patterns, monitoring\n\
    drought conditions, and producing drought vulnerability (risk) maps [48]. Hoque\
    \ et al. [43]\nintegrated geospatial techniques with fuzzy logic to develop a\
    \ comprehensive spatial\ndrought risk inventory model for operational drought\
    \ management. This model success-\nfully identiﬁed the spatial extents and distribution\
    \ of agricultural drought risk. Sehgal and\nDhakar [44] used GIS and high spatial\
    \ resolution RS-derived indicators of crop sensitivity to\ndevelop a methodology\
    \ that assessed and mapped, at a local scale, key biophysical factors\ncontributing\
    \ to agricultural drought vulnerability. The drought vulnerability maps could\n\
    inform policymakers in formulating spatially explicit policies for drought mitigation\
    \ and\nintervention strategies [45,46]. In addition, vulnerability maps could\
    \ be used to indicate\nwhere socioeconomic development policy programs should\
    \ be given priority [47].\n3.2.5. Pest and Crop Disease Detection and Management\n\
    Several geospatial tools and techniques continue to be developed to aid farmers\
    \ in\ncrop disease control and management strategies. Several studies [49–52]\
    \ provide practical\napplication of satellite RS data and Geospatial techniques\
    \ for sustainable crop disease\ndetection and management. RS technology including\
    \ Airborne and satellite imagery\nacquired during growing seasons has been used\
    \ for early- and within-season detection,\nmapping of some crop diseases, the\
    \ control of recurring diseases in future seasons, and\nassessing economic loss\
    \ caused by frost damage [49]. Santoso et al. [50] used high-resolution\nQuickBird\
    \ satellite imagery to effectively detect spatial patterns of oil palm plants\
    \ infected\nby basal stem rot disease. They used six vegetation indices derived\
    \ from visible and\nnear-infrared bands satellite imagery to successfully discriminate\
    \ between healthy and\ninfected oil palms. Using precision agriculture technologies\
    \ and remote sensed imagery,\nYang [52] showed how site-speciﬁc fungicide application\
    \ to disease-infested areas has been\nimplemented for effective control of the\
    \ disease. In the future, new approaches that apply\ngeoinformation technologies\
    \ in monitoring and management of pest and crop disease\ndetection could reduce\
    \ the effect of pesticides and herbicide chemicals on the environment.\n3.2.6.\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nIn precision agriculture, automated geospatial analysis\
    \ and decision support algo-\nrithms can provide valuable scientiﬁc information\
    \ to policymakers for better agriculture\npolicy development. Precision agriculture\
    \ practices, which employ integrated GIS, RS,\nand GPS technologies, have gained\
    \ prominence in their ability to optimize crop produc-\ntion, facilitate site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop management, and reduce the application of agrochem-\nicals. Toscano et\
    \ al. [58] demonstrated the usefulness of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 im-\nages to\
    \ depict the within-ﬁeld spatial variability of wheat yield, which is key for\
    \ adopt-\ning precision farming techniques. This provided a potential alternative\
    \ to traditional\nfarming practices by improving site-speciﬁc management and agricultural\
    \ productivity.\nGarcía et al. [59] tested the performance of remote sensing drones\
    \ as mobile gateways to\nprovide a guide to the optimal drone parameters for successful\
    \ Wi-Fi data transmission\nbetween sensor nodes and the gateway in precision agriculture\
    \ systems. The study suc-\ncessfully demonstrated that drones (ﬂying at the lowest\
    \ velocity, at a height of 24 m, and\nwith an antenna with 25 m of coverage) can\
    \ be used as a remote sensing tool to gather the\ndata from the nodes deployed\
    \ on the ﬁelds for crop monitoring and management. This had\nthe potential to\
    \ increase the adoption of precision agriculture by even smallholder farmers.\n\
    Segarra et al.’s [60] study speciﬁcally focused to understand the European Space\
    \ Agency’s\ntwin Sentinel-2 satellites’ features and their application in precision\
    \ agriculture. Their study\nhighlights that Sentinel-2 has dramatically increased\
    \ the capabilities for agricultural moni-\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n9 of\
    \ 15\ntoring and crop management, abiotic and biotic stresses detection, improved\
    \ the estimation\nof crop yields, enhanced crop type classiﬁcations, and provided\
    \ a variety of other useful\napplications in agriculture. All of these contribute\
    \ to increasing the adoption of precision\nagriculture, which leads to more productive\
    \ and sustainable agriculture management and\nenvironmental sustainability [61,62].\
    \ In precision agriculture, plantation-rows extraction\nusing satellite image-based\
    \ solutions is essential in crop harvesting, pest management, and\nplant grow-rate\
    \ predictions. The study of Fareed and Rehman [55] used GIS and RS to\ndesign\
    \ an automated method to extract plantation rows from a drone-based image point\n\
    clouds-based digital surface model. The automatic plantation rows extraction can\
    \ be used\nto quantify plantation-row damage assessment in precision agriculture.\n\
    3.2.7. Weed Management and Fertilizer Decision Support System\nAccurate weed distribution\
    \ mapping could greatly enhance efﬁciency in weed man-\nagement and reduce weed\
    \ damage, overhead costs of herbicide application, and the ratio-\nnalization\
    \ of fertilizers [57]. Dunaieva et al. [21] used GIS technologies to produce accurate\n\
    weed distribution maps in rice farms. This information improved the efﬁciency\
    \ of input\napplication, thus reducing the consumption of inputs including herbicides,\
    \ fungicides,\nand weeding labor costs. This in turn reduced the weed damage and\
    \ crop production\noverhead costs. Xie et al. [56] demonstrated the application\
    \ of GIS in the development of a\nGIS-based Fertilizer Decision Support System\
    \ (FDSS) by integrating RS data, ﬁeld surveys,\nand expert knowledge to develop\
    \ a soil spatial database on the SuperMap platform for crop\nmanagement systems.\
    \ The application of FDSS in agricultural production had beneﬁts,\nsuch as increasing\
    \ fertilizer utilization efﬁciency, thus lowering production costs.\n4. Obstacles\
    \ to Applying GIS in Agriculture Policy and Practice\nGenerally, the use of GIS\
    \ and RS technologies is not a panacea to successful evidence-\nbased policy and\
    \ practice and has its downside. The success of the geospatial technology\napplication\
    \ depends on its proper use, quality data, and considerable resources in its man-\n\
    agement. In countries that suffer low resources, such as LMICs, the cost of the\
    \ technology\nand lack of appropriate skills jeopardize its wider use and adoption\
    \ [63]. Simulating crop\nyield production is always challenging due to the variety\
    \ of cropping systems and levels\nof technology used. Accurate crop yield gap\
    \ assessment would require improvements\nin input data quality, including accurate\
    \ weather parameters, better soil characterization,\nand spatially distributed\
    \ land use data [28]. It would also demand the setting up of in-\nstrumented geo-referenced\
    \ validation sites that provide comprehensive survey data to\ninform a continuous\
    \ improvement cycle for yield gap assessment [30]. As such, future im-\nprovements\
    \ in current remote sensing technology and the development of better-integrated\n\
    cropping systems models would provide more accurate inputs for yield gap assessment.\n\
    In drought vulnerability assessment and mapping, most studies reported in the\
    \ literature\ntended to use aggregated spatial data at higher spatial scales (national\
    \ or regional level), but\nnot at a finer scale (i.e., local level). Since the\
    \ intensity of drought hazards is more felt and\nmanifested at the local level,\
    \ a detailed drought-risk mapping at a finer scale would require\nhigh resolution\
    \ remote sensing and the use of locally contextual indicators to yield a full\n\
    picture of vulnerability. This would have more relevance to policymakers whose\
    \ intent is to\nformulate and implement mitigation interventions at the local\
    \ level. With the prediction of\nmore severe and frequent drought uncertainties\
    \ and increasingly threats from climate change,\ndrought-risk mapping that incorporates\
    \ all the spatially explicit risk components would be a\nhighly efficient contribution\
    \ to drought-mitigating strategies. More skills and knowledge on\nthe use of geospatial\
    \ techniques for agricultural drought risk are needed.\nIn crop disease detection,\
    \ challenges still exist in mapping them using airborne or\nsatellite imagery.\
    \ Although many crop diseases can be successfully detected and mapped\nusing satellite\
    \ imagery, each disease has its characteristics that would require different\n\
    procedures for detection and management. According to Yang, [52] “some diseases\
    \ are\ndifﬁcult to detect, especially when multiple biotic and abiotic conditions\
    \ with similar\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n10 of 15\nspectral characteristics\
    \ exist within the same ﬁeld” (pg. 531). Recurring diseases would\nrequire consistent\
    \ historical imagery and spatial-temporal data, while emerging diseases\nare more\
    \ difﬁcult to detect. Yang argues that more advanced RS imaging sensors and\n\
    image-processing techniques for differentiating diseases from other confounding\
    \ factors\nare needed. In less-developed countries, very few farmers have the\
    \ necessary skills required\nto use RS technologies in creating their prescription\
    \ maps, in the implementation of disease\nmanagement and in the site-speciﬁc fungicide\
    \ application. More research is needed in\nthe development of integrated geospatial\
    \ analytical methodologies and tools for aiding\nfarmers in the detection of different\
    \ crop diseases.\nAlthough precision agriculture technologies can aid in optimizing\
    \ crops and facili-\ntating agricultural management decisions in solving food\
    \ insecurity challenges in LMICs,\nprecision farming requires the adoption of\
    \ geospatial technology and a large amount of\nhigh-resolution spatiotemporal\
    \ data. A lack of skills to use GIS and RS in LMICs can be\naugmented by the dissemination\
    \ and the transfer of practical geospatial technologies from\ndeveloped countries\
    \ [51]. However, considerable investments in ICT infrastructure are\nneeded for\
    \ the effective adaptation of precision agricultural approaches in LMICs.\nSoil\
    \ fertility assessment is considered one of the most important indicators of precision\n\
    farming and for the sustainable use of agricultural lands according to their potential.\
    \ This\nrequires a comprehensive soil information system. However, according to\
    \ Abdelfattah and\nKumar [32], much of the world has very poor coverage of soil\
    \ quality data. In LMICs, the\nfragmentation of agricultural land into small uneconomical\
    \ plots and unsustainable farming\npractices is happening at a much higher rate.\
    \ In such a rapidly changing environment, the\npotential of active remote sensors\
    \ to determine soil quality requires further research.\nOther obstacles to the\
    \ use and adoption of GIS and RS in agriculture include a lack of\ncommonly agreed\
    \ data interoperability standards. Though there is increasing availability\nof\
    \ spatial data usage in LMICs, many of these data are prone to error and are often\
    \ collected\nand stored with different spatial units, formats, metadata, time,\
    \ and space intervals. This\nmakes some data unusable, prevents spatial data integration,\
    \ and hinders a uniﬁed analysis\nof data, especially those collected from multiple\
    \ sensors and platforms. A need exists on\ndeveloping standardized guidelines\
    \ for agriculture spatial data. Training for researchers,\npractitioners, and\
    \ farmers on how to collect quality and accurate spatial data that can\nbe usable\
    \ in multi-platform systems is paramount. Developing spatial data repositories\n\
    with better interoperability can enable data integration and improve the efﬁciency\
    \ of data\nanalyses. In this regard, crowdsourced data collection would be a promising\
    \ contribution\nto developing cost-effective agri-spatial data repositories.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper has explored various ways GIS technology has been integrated\
    \ into agricul-\nture to improve agriculture decisions and policymaking. GIS and\
    \ RS technologies present\nbetter methods for the analysis of spatial factors\
    \ that affect agricultural production as\ncompared to approaches where geographically\
    \ explicit data are absent. If well exploited,\nthe spatially integrated knowledge\
    \ provided by GIS and RS can be applied to enhance\nagriculture policy and evidence-based\
    \ interventions geared towards improving agricul-\nture sustainability. Though\
    \ GIS technologies provide a promising pathway for improving\nagronomic practices,\
    \ they remain underexploited in many LMICs where a dire need for\nenhancing agriculture\
    \ and food production practices is most needed. For LMIC govern-\nments and farmers\
    \ to better exploit the beneﬁt of GIS and RS technologies, there is a need\nfor\
    \ an increased level of awareness and potential use of spatial data related to\
    \ agriculture.\nFurther advances in geoinformatics techniques and computing infrastructure\
    \ will allow\na more collaborative framework amongst scientists, policymakers,\
    \ researchers, extension\npersonnel, crop consultants, and farm equipment and\
    \ chemical dealers with practical guide-\nlines for effective management of crop\
    \ yield estimations, soil fertility, cropping pattern and\nmonitoring, drought\
    \ risks, and fertilizer and weed management.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n\
    11 of 15\nIn enhancing evidence-based agriculture policy, government and policymakers\
    \ would\nrequire hard evidence that brings a clear understanding of the complexity\
    \ and interconnect-\nedness of factors affecting agriculture productivity. This\
    \ would in turn enable designing\nconcrete intervention strategies. Additionally,\
    \ a broad spectrum of stakeholders and\npractitioners in the agriculture sector\
    \ would need location-speciﬁc agricultural data in\nimplementing a wide array\
    \ of decisions that improve agricultural production potential.\nEqually, smallholder\
    \ farmers would require synthesized information to empower them not\nonly to make\
    \ evidence-informed decisions but also to implement practicable activities that\n\
    increase agricultural productivity. This raises the demand for GIS integration\
    \ in agriculture\npolicy formulation and implementation.\nGIS and RS technologies\
    \ provide a big potential in the assessment, storage, processing, and\nproduction\
    \ of agriculture data. The data could be useful in precision agriculture, site-specific\n\
    farming, and disease detection, among others, all geared toward improving agriculture\
    \ food\nproduction and food security issues. Unfortunately, the lack of quality\
    \ spatial data in many\nlocal governments has continued to undermine decision-making,\
    \ policy formulation and the\neffectiveness in their implementation. Where such\
    \ data exists, there is a generally lack of\nskills on the use of GIS and RS spatial\
    \ analytical techniques. Achieving spatially integrated\nagriculture policies\
    \ demands comprehensive, up-to-date spatial datasets and better methods\nthat\
    \ combine and analyze complex data from various sources to produce useful information.\n\
    This would necessitate national as well as local governments to adopt methods,\
    \ strategies,\nand techniques that facilitate the collection and analysis of diverse\
    \ agricultural datasets in\nproviding comprehensive insights to policymakers,\
    \ planners, farmers, and a broad spectrum of\nstakeholders in the agriculture\
    \ sector. GIS thus provides a promising pathway for the acquisition\nof comprehensive,\
    \ up-to-date spatial databases and better spatial analysis methods that are\n\
    capable of analyzing complex data to produce useful information. If properly adopted\
    \ and\nimplemented, GIS can enhance the spatial decision support system in improving\
    \ the efficiency\nand effectiveness of agriculture policy formulation and planning.\
    \ Nonetheless, policy change\ncan guide and catalyze actions but requires public\
    \ and political will to actualize it. Thus, the\nadoption of GIS technology in\
    \ policymaking would require local government to commit public\nfunds to set up\
    \ the required software, hardware, supportive infrastructure, and training of\n\
    staff to use them. Future studies can focus on how GIS and RS technology could\
    \ promote a\ncollaborative framework amongst scientists, policymakers, researchers,\
    \ extension agriculture\nofficers in promoting sustainable, and climate-smart\
    \ farming practices, especially in LMICs.\n6. Limitations of the Study\nThe results\
    \ of this study are purely based on the 40 articles spanning 10 years\n(2010–2021)\
    \ and the learning obtained from them. As a result, we might not have in-\ncluded\
    \ some signiﬁcant research papers published in earlier years. However, the purpose\n\
    of this review was to analyze the most recent trends and relevant publications\
    \ in the appli-\ncation of GIS in agriculture. For this reason, we argue that\
    \ the 40 papers are comprehensive,\nand it is unlikely that the content of previously\
    \ published papers would have substantially\naltered our ﬁndings. Furthermore,\
    \ the selection criteria only included peer-reviewed pa-\npers. However, reﬂections\
    \ on GIS methodologies are sometimes published in books or grey\nliterature since\
    \ they have more space for in-depth reﬂections. To reduce this limitation, we\n\
    formulated our search string to include a broad range of the most relevant terms\
    \ of interest\nin this study. In addition, we performed the search in the largest\
    \ indexed databases of\nSCOPUS, BASE, CORE, and Clarivate. To account for signiﬁcant\
    \ papers that might have not\nbeen indexed in these databases, we also included\
    \ the search results from Google Scholar.\nNotwithstanding these few limitations,\
    \ the insights provided in this review provide valu-\nable information and knowledge\
    \ on GIS and RS application in enhancing evidence-based\npolicy interventions\
    \ for enhancing agriculture sustainability, as well as identifying barriers\n\
    to their application in the LMIC context.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n12 of\

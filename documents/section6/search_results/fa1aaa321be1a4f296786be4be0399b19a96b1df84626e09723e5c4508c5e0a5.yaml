    basis 1. Introduction Subtropics experience warm and pluvial climate, which is
    conducive to crop growth, but also contributes to the growth of pests and crop
    diseases. In Taiwan, the increasing incidence of extreme weather events attributable
    to climate change, such as the frequent occurrence of typhoons and heavy rainfall,
    has increased the challenges in agricultural production. Moreover, population
    aging and low birth rate, which are particularly observed to a greater extent
    in rural areas, have caused a shortage in farming labor, which further aggravates
    the challenges in the farming industry (Haung, 2013). Therefore, to counter the
    negative impact on agricultural production, smart farming technology that enables
    precise decision-making in agricultural management must be introduced. Among the
    crops produced in Taiwan, broccoli is a vegetable rich in vitamin C and prevents
    cancer (Finley et al., 2000). With the advances in processing technologies, such
    as vegetable freezing and dehydration, the market for broccoli has expanded, causing
    an increase in the price and farms of broccoli. Moreover, broccoli has been recognized
    as a vegetable with high economic value and potential. Fertilization is a key
    factor in broccoli production (Yoldas et al., 2008). Farmers tend to overfertilize
    their farms to increase production; however, this can affect the appearance and
    quality of broccoli, and thereby, human health and soil condition (Savci, 2012).
    The cultivation and harvesting of broccoli require professional skills because
    broccoli is sensitive to environmental conditions. The shortage of labor and the
    conventional practice of using massive amounts of fertilizers and chemicals makes
    the management of broccoli fields cumbersome in terms of both time and money.
    Therefore, to fulfill the goals of saving labor and cost, obtaining optimal production,
    and maintaining environmental sustainability, a smart field monitoring method
    is required to assist in the decision-making regarding fertilizer and chemical
    use in broccoli fields. Remote sensing technology has been extensively applied
    in agriculture (Mulla, 2013). In particular, the application of unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) to acquire high-resolution images has become a new trend in precision
    farming owing to its high efficiency and low cost (Candiago et al., 2015). Compared
    with satellite imagery, which is subject to the satellite’s repeat cycle, and
    aerial photography, which is costly, UAV imagery presents the advantages of high
    speed, convenience, and low cost, which makes it ideal for the short-term monitoring
    of plant growth. Because the low flight height of UAVs helps obtain images of
    objects on the scale of millimeters, UAV imagery has been successfully used in
    crop classification, weed detection, and growth monitoring, indicating its feasibility
    for use in precision farming (Mamo et al., 2003). Bah et al. (2017) integrated
    UAV imagery with Hough transform and simple linear iterative clustering for the
    detection of weeds in corn fields and achieved an accuracy of over 90% and an
    overdetection rate of <2%. Agüera et al. (2012) compared the sunflower nitrogen
    content estimated using UAV images to that measured on the ground and integrated
    the data with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for crop recognition,
    and achieved a producer and user accuracy close to 98%. NDVI was also calculated
    to estimate the nitrogen content of corn based on a low-cost color-infrared airborne
    system, and resulted in R2 of 0.7 and RRMSE < 25% in external validation (Corti
    et al., 2019). Yang et al. (2017) applied the digital surface model and texture
    information of visible light UAV images to a decision tree algorithm and achieved
    an overall accuracy of 96.17% for rice lodging identification. Comba et al. (2020)
    predicted the leaf area index of the vineyards by using a 3D point cloud generated
    from UAV-based multi-spectral imagery with R2 of 0.82. UAV images were also integrated
    with Structure from Motion (SfM) to estimate the height and crown diameter of
    coffee trees with a correlation of 87% and 95%, respectively (dos Santos et al.,
    2020). Vegetation indices based on drone multi-spectral images were calculated
    to estimate plant density through empirical regression models with a high prediction
    accuracy for barley and wheat with R2 > 0.91 and MAE < 28 plants (Wilke et al.,
    2021). Green coverage in drone imagery was estimated by SVM classification based
    on RGB composites, and achieved R2 ranging from 0.88 to 0.95 and MAE ranging from
    1.94 to 2.97% (Wang et al., 2022). With the advances in deep learning (DL) technology,
    convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively used in image recognition.
    Notably, the integration of CNNs with high-resolution UAV images has been applied
    to numerous aspects of large-scale agriculture, such as disease detection (Kerkech
    et al., 2018), weed mapping (Huang et al., 2018), and large-area rice lodging
    identification (Yang et al., 2020b, Yang et al., 2020c). For classifying infected
    maize leaves in drone images, various convolutional neural network architectures,
    including VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3 and MobileNetV2, were compared and got that
    both InceptionV3 and MobileNetV2 both achieved 100% accuracy (Ishengoma et al.,
    2021). This approach overcomes the challenges of conventional algorithms, which
    are highly demanding in terms of hardware resources and time. This integrated
    approach also effectively supersedes the labor-intensive conventional field management
    approach. Moreover, compared with naked-eye detection and conventional image classification,
    the DL-based approach yields higher accuracy (Kamilaris & Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018).
    Object detection and semantic segmentation are two widely applied methods in the
    field of DL. Specifically, object detection is performed on a regression/classification-based
    framework (Liu et al., 2016, Redmon and Farhadi, 2018) or a region proposal-based
    framework (Girshick, 2015, Girshick et al., 2014, Ren et al., 2017), wherein bounding
    boxes are generated around a target object and the class and location data of
    a said object are exported (Forsyth, 2014) for further tracking, counting, and
    recognition. This approach has been extensively applied in face recognition (Yu
    et al., 2016), pedestrian detection (Xu et al., 2017), and driver assistance systems
    (Lin et al., 2020). This study combined UAVs and DL technology for broccoli growth
    monitoring. In this approach, an object detection network and a geographic information
    system were used for plant positioning and a small-scale semantic segmentation
    model was subsequently used to filter out background information for the precise
    calculation of VIs and canopy coverage (CC). The traits of broccoli growth, plant
    positioning, and VI results were integrated and visualized on a distribution map
    of healthy plants. Distribution maps enable the comparison of plants treated with
    different amounts of fertilizers by means of their spectral differences that reflect
    the uneven irrigation and fertilization in the fields. Growth monitoring of individual
    broccoli plants is conducive to efficient decision-making related to field management.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Planning for the tested fields In this study, UAVs
    were used to obtain images of two crops of broccoli (cultivar: Broccoli No. 42)
    in 2020 in the Taichung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station (TDARES).
    The specific location of the fields is presented in Fig. 1. The first crop accounted
    for a field area of 1500 m2 and was treated with different amounts of potash-based
    or nitrogen-based fertilizers (K-treatment and N-treatment, respectively). Table
    1 presents the four levels of fertilizers used. When K-treatment was applied,
    N2 treatment was applied concurrently as equivalent. Conversely, when an N-treatment
    was applied, K2 treatment was applied concurrently as an equivalent. For both
    K-treatment and N-treatment, 10 g/m2 of phosphate fertilizer was added as an equivalent.
    Nitrogen was identified as the main fertilizer for the first broccoli crop. The
    second crop was distributed over a field area totaling 1650 m2, and four concentrations
    of nitrogen fertilizers were processed in triplicate. Fig. 2 presents the layout
    of fields for the two crops. In each field, 45% of the total amount of fertilizer
    was applied on Day 0 as basal dressing, and 15%, 15%, and 25% were used on the
    10th, 25th, and 35th days, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (268KB)

    various UAVs, visible orthomosaic images and multi-spectral orthomosaic images
    of the first crop were obtained, respectively, using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro (DJI,
    Shenzhen, China) and a DJI M200 installed with a RedEdge-M (MicaSense, Seattle,
    WA, USA). The images for the second crop were obtained using a Zenmuse X7 (DJI,
    Shenzhen, China) and an Altum (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA), respectively, both
    mounted on a DJI M210 RTK. Specifications of the cameras are listed in Table 2.

    GSD = Ground sampling distance; FOV = Field of view. To adapt to the difference
    in the camera resolutions, the UAVs maintained a flight height of 20 m for the
    first crop and 30 m for the second crop, thus keeping the ground sampling distance
    (GSD) of the visible orthomosaic images and multi-spectral orthomosaic images
    at approximately 5 and 14 mm, respectively. Four ground control points were established
    for each crop, and their coordinates were determined using an S82 RTK surveying
    system (South GNSS, Guangzhou, PRC) and the virtual base station (e-GNSS) obtained
    from Taiwan’s National Land Surveying and Mapping Center. The coordinates, with
    a mean measurement error of < ±8 mm, served as the basis for georeferencing in
    modeling UAV images processed on Agisoft Metashape (Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg,
    Russia) (Yang et al., 2020a). One session of visible orthomosaic image acquisition
    and nine sessions of multi-spectral orthomosaic image acquisition were conducted
    for both crops, with the visible images being used for plant positioning and the
    multi-spectral mages for calculating VIs and CC. Table 3 presents the parameters
    of the orthomosaic images. The multi-spectral orthomosaic images of the first
    and second crops are presented in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, respectively. Table 3. Parameters

    farming field in Lucao, Chiayi (Fig. 5), which was outside the TDARES. The field
    was approximately 7500 m2 in size, and the images were taken using a DJI Phantom
    4 Pro at a flight height of 40 m and a ground resolution of 8.3 mm. Because the
    BR-8 cultivar and not Broccoli No. 42 was planted at this site, the images obtained
    at this site differed from the training images. Therefore, the applicability of
    the model to other cultivars could be evaluated. Download : Download high-res

    and the shutter speed was higher than 1/500 s to ensure clear images. At the same
    time, it has a lower sun elevation angle to avoid sun reflections in the images.
    2.3. Training, validation, and testing datasets Fig. 6 presents the experimental
    procedure in the study. Image acquisition with UAVs was followed by numerous steps,
    namely image modeling (visible and multi-spectral), image mosaicing, ground truth
    annotation, and CNN model training and evaluation. Two data sets were established,
    namely, a broccoli positioning data set based on visible orthomosaic images and
    a broccoli segmentation data set based on multi-spectral orthomosaic images. Both
    the data sets were divided into three parts for model training, validation, and
    testing. The broccoli positioning model was used to determine the geographical
    coordinates of each broccoli plant in a field. These coordinates, when applied
    to the multi-spectral orthomosaic images in the broccoli segmentation model, enable
    the precise calculation of spectral responses for each broccoli plant, and the
    results of all plants are then pooled together to form a distribution map of healthy
    plants. Download : Download high-res image (397KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Research flowchart. 2.3.1. Broccoli positioning dataset To evaluate
    the accuracy of the broccoli positioning model at different resolutions and photographic
    settings, the training data were extracted from the visible image of the first
    crop taken on March 4, 2020 (15th day). An area accounting for approximately 20%
    of the crop was extracted from the image and divided into 72 tiles, each tile
    being 512 × 512 pixels in size. The tiles constituted a training set that was
    imported into a graphical image annotation tool, Labellmg, where the bounding
    box coordinates of broccoli plants were exported in the PascalVoc format as the
    ground truth data and divided into training and validation samples at a ratio
    of 4:1 (Lin, 2018). Thus, the final training and validation sets contained 58
    and 14 images, respectively. Additionally, 12 images from other parts of the raw
    image of the first crop formed a test set. Furthermore, the open-source code from
    Afifi and Brown (2019) was used to augment the training and validation sets through
    manipulation of the white balance and brightness of the images, and the sets were
    augmented by 2.5 times according to the recommendation of Lei et al. (2019). Fig.
    7 presents samples of the training set for the broccoli positioning model, including
    images with adjusted white balance and brightness. In the test set, images of
    the second crop taken on November 12, 2020 (22nd day) and those of the Chiayi
    field taken on December 13, 2019 (25th day) were also added, thereby forming three
    subsets. Approximately 10% of the visible images of the two sites were included,
    and each image was divided into tiles of 512 × 512 pixels in size. The precision
    of the model was evaluated by testing the three subsets separately at different
    photographic conditions. As is evident in Fig. 8, images from the three subsets
    exhibited marked differences in tone, brightness, and resolution. Download : Download

    data set consisted of multi-spectral images of the first and second crops. One
    image of the first crop taken on April 5, 2020 (47th day) and two images of the
    second crop, one taken on November 5, 2020 (15th day) and the other on November
    12, 2020 (22nd day), were included. Six tiles, every 512 × 512 pixels in size,
    were arbitrarily included. These samples covered different stages in the lifecycle
    of broccoli. After the ground truth data were compiled, the raw images and corresponding
    ground truth data were further divided into 24 tiles, every 256 × 256 pixels in
    size. These tiles were distributed into a training set, a validation set, and
    a test set at a ratio of 4:1:1. Thus, the training, validation, and test sets
    had 16, 4, and 4 tiles, respectively. 2.4. Broccoli positioning network training
    This study adopted a single-shot detector (SSD) as the architecture for object
    detection (Liu et al., 2016). Specifically, the SSD7 architecture in the open-source
    code published on GitHub by Ferrari (2018) was used. Compared with the original
    SSD architecture (SSD300 in the open-source code), SSD7 has an identical structure
    but includes fewer parameters, which makes it suitable for relatively simple and
    less data-intensive applications, such as that presented herein. Fig. 9 illustrates
    the frontend feature extraction network of SSD7, which is an AlexNet-Like (Krizhevsky
    et al., 2012) network that achieves multiscale feature extraction through a pyramidal
    feature hierarchy formed by continuous convolution layers and pooling layers.
    The extracted multiscale features are subsequently transmitted to a detector for
    the classification and regression of bounding boxes. In the present study, the
    feature extraction architecture was modified for comparison. Following Li et al.,
    2019, Chen et al., 2017, feature extraction was conducted through dilated convolution
    at various dilation rates. The receptive field of individual convolutional kernels
    was expanded when the resolution was constant, thus attaining multiscale feature
    extraction. Three dilated convolution kernels with dilation rates of 1, 2, and
    3 were parallelly connected to form a module similar to the atrous spatial pyramid
    pooling module of DeepLab V2. This module is called the Trident Block, and its
    architecture is shown in Fig. 10. The Trident Block was integrated with the feature
    pyramid network proposed by Lin et al. (2017) to add a top-down structure and
    lateral connection on the basis of the backend feature pyramid of AlexNet. Thus,
    the association between high-level and low-level features was enhanced, enabling
    the model to perform object detection with higher accuracy. Fig. 11 depicts the
    modified feature extraction architecture. The precision in the detection of individual
    broccoli plants was compared between the modified architecture and the feature
    extraction architecture of the AlexNet-Like backend at the SSD frontend, where
    the input scale of the detector complies with the original SSD architecture. The
    models were trained on the Taiwan Computing Cloud, a platform sponsored by the
    National Center for High-Performance Computing. The training was conducted in
    Tensorflow-19.11-tf2-py3. Except for the parts regarding feature extraction, the
    source code only underwent modification in areas concerning the compatibility
    between different versions of Tensorflow. The default setting of the source code
    was retained for the hyperparameters used for training; that is, adaptive moment
    estimation was used as the optimizer with the following hyperparameters: lr =
    0.001, beta_1 = 0.9, beta_2 = 0.999, epsilon = 1e-08, and decay = 0. Download

    2.5. Broccoli segmentation network training The proposed broccoli segmentation
    network is a small-scale CNN model with six asymmetric convolution (AC) layers
    (Table 4). In AC, the conventional n × n convolution is replaced by a combination
    of n × 1 and 1 × n to factorize the convolution but retain the original detection
    precision and receptive field, thereby reducing the number of parameters and the
    computational load (Szegedy et al., 2016) while enhancing the depth of the network.
    AC has been extensively applied in real-time semantic segmentation (Ghosh et al.,
    2019, Lo et al., 2019). The number of parameters in the proposed AC-based broccoli
    segmentation network is only 8.3 k. In this study, the broccoli segmentation network
    training had the same optimizer and hyperparameters as the broccoli positioning
    network, and it was trained on Nvidia GeForce GTX 980Ti with Tensorflow 2.3.0.

    for individual plants Images of the two crops were all divided into tiles with
    512 × 512 pixels in size. A margin of 50 pixels at the four sides of a tile overlapped
    with that of neighboring tiles to prevent the formation of an incomplete image
    after cropping, which may lead to inaccurate detection of the VI of a plant. An
    optimized plant detection model was used for the generation of bounding boxes,
    and non-maximum suppression (NMS) was employed to identify plants that were detected
    more than once and thus eliminate duplicate counts. Last, the coordinates of the
    centroids of bounding boxes were exported and converted to the TWD97 coordinate
    system, thus completing plant detection. Multi-spectral images were used for VI
    calculation. The coordinates of a plant in an image were estimated using the geographical
    information of the said image. Subsequently, according to the size and interval
    of the grown broccoli plants, a circular mask with a diameter of 400 mm was used
    to extract the image of a single plant. After the broccoli segmentation network
    was applied to filter out the background of the image, VI was calculated for the
    head of the broccoli plant to accurately reflect its spectral features. 2.7. Evaluation
    metrics Appendix Table A1, Table A2 list the evaluation metrics for the broccoli
    positioning network and broccoli segmentation network in this study, respectively.
    Among these, recall and precision were applied in the precision evaluation of
    both networks. In the formulae, TP denotes true positive, FP denotes false positive,
    TN denotes true negative, and FN represents false negative. For the recall and
    precision of the broccoli positioning network, TP represents the number of predicted
    broccoli plants, and the denominators denote the total number of broccoli plants
    extracted from the ground truth data and the total number of predicted broccoli
    plants, respectively. Therefore, recall and precision represent the sensitivity
    and accuracy of prediction, respectively. Intersection over union (IoU) represents
    the accuracy of bounding boxes, which is determined through the intersection and
    union of bounding boxes and ground truths. Distance in both root mean square error
    (RMSE) and meant absolute error (MAE) represents the distance between the center
    of a bounding box and the center of a ground truth; as such, it can be used to
    determine the plant positioning offset. Likewise, the recall and precision of
    the broccoli segmentation network represent the sensitivity and accuracy of prediction,
    respectively. The F1-score, which is determined using recall and precision and
    has values between 0 and 1, indicates the level of balance between two metrics;
    the closer it is to 1, the greater the robustness of the network. 3. Results and
    discussion 3.1. Plant detection All visible orthomosaic images used for broccoli
    positioning in this study were taken when the plants were 15–25 days old. At this
    age, all the plants could occupy>20% of a circle with a diameter of 400 mm (i.e.,
    CC > 20%) yet insufficiently large to overlap with each other. Therefore, a ground
    truth box could be easily drawn along the edges of a plant with minimal overlap
    with another box. This enabled high-precision plant detection and prevented plants
    that overlapped with each other from being mistakenly omitted as duplicates in
    the NMS. Table 5 presents the metrics for the detection accuracy of SSD with the
    two backbone networks. For the test set containing images of the first crop, the
    recall and precision of both networks reached 100%. Furthermore, the AlexNet-like
    backend had higher IoU with more favorable RMSE and MAE than Trident Block. Trident
    Block had a lower IoU because the predicted bounding box was slightly larger than
    the area occupied by a plant, which may be attributable to multiscale dilated
    convolution. Plant detection in the test set containing images of the second crop
    by using Trident Block was substantially superior, with a 95.6% recall when the
    prediction was conducted on raw images and a 100% recall after histogram matching
    was performed to match test images with the pixel distribution in images of the
    first crop for radiometric correction. Under the same conditions, the recall for
    AlexNet-like backend was 70.2% and 96.8%, respectively. These results indicate
    the superiority of dilated convolution, which uses a combination of various dilation
    rates, for plant detection when images at different scales and taken under different
    photographic conditions are used. In terms of IoU, Trident Block was the most
    favorable. In both the aforementioned conditions, the coordinates had an MAE of
    approximately 11 mm, which is acceptable considering that the broccoli has an
    average diameter of > 400 mm. The data sets of the Chiayi field contained images
    with a resolution that was half of that of the images in the training set, which
    makes the recall significantly different between the two backbone networks. In
    particular, by using the AlexNet-like backend, less than half of the total broccoli
    plants could be detected, and some bounding boxes even contained two or more plants,
    which led to the only instance in the entire experiment when a precision of 100%
    was not reached. Additionally, Trident Block outperformed AlexNet-like backend
    in terms of all metrics. These results indicate that multiscale dilated convolution
    is superior to the conventional 3 × 3 convolution when the imported images differ
    in resolution and photographic conditions, thus making dilated convolution more
    versatile for monitoring agricultural images taken in different periods and locations
    and under different conditions (e.g., equipment, flight height, and lighting).

    for the first and second crops, with 3596 and 4423 broccoli plants detected, respectively.
    For the first crop, both recall and precision were 100%. For the second crop,
    after histogram matching was performed to match test images with the pixel distribution
    in images of the first crop, because the three paddy fields that received N4 treatment
    were overfertilized, which resulted in delayed or retarded growth, plant detection
    was unsatisfactory and a small number of weeds were mistakenly identified as broccoli.
    Consequently, the recall and precision were 98.58% and 99.73%, respectively. Fig.

    of results Fig. 14 presents the effect of background filtering when the Otsu algorithm
    (Otsu, 1979) and the proposed model were used for single-plant detection. The
    Otsu algorithm is fast and effective in differentiating plants from the soil in
    a large area, but in the scale of a single plant, differences in lighting conditions
    and background objects can cause the filtering results of images of individual
    broccoli plants taken in the same time period to considerably differ. For the
    test images, the Otsu algorithm achieved a recall of 90.23% and a precision of
    85.41%, whereas the proposed model achieved a recall and precision of 97.94% and
    96.52%, respectively. This proves that the proposed model is more accurate in
    filtering out the background to facilitate single-plant detection. The Otsu algorithm
    and the proposed model achieved an F1-score of 87.75% and 97.22%, respectively,
    suggesting that CNN-based background filtering is more stable. Compared with the
    Otsu algorithm, which performs image segmentation according to the difference
    in pixel values, a CNN-based method performs the task by enhancing the texture
    and geometric features, thus facilitating a more accurate separation of broccoli
    from the rest of the image. This approach enables the proposed model to calculate
    the CC and VIs of a broccoli plant with greater precision. Download : Download

    the two approaches based on their normalized difference red edge (NDRE) indices,
    clearly indicating that the visualization approach could distinctively indicate
    spots treated with different fertilizers. Moreover, the visualization approach
    enabled easy detection of plants that were missing or exhibited retarded growth
    in fields that received N4 treatment, and the uneven irrigation at the upper right
    corner of the image owing to rising terrain. By contrast, the pixel-based approach
    made the distinction of individual plants difficult because of the considerable
    difference in the NDRE values between the plants and the background. Download

    VIs to determine the phenotypic traits of plants has been extensively used in
    precision agriculture. For example, Lebourgeois et al. (2012) used numerous VIs,
    including NDVI, GNDVI (NDNG), and SRPIb, to monitor the leaf and canopy nitrogen
    contents in sugarcane, and Ballesteros et al. (2020) used an artificial neural
    network to predict the yield of a vineyard based on the NDVI and CC of grapes.
    In the present study, the results of El-Shikha et al. (2007) were referenced for
    the calculation of CC and VIs, which served as the basis for field management
    because they reflected broccoli growth under different fertilization conditions.
    The VIs investigated include NDVI and NDNG, which are indices of broccoli growth,
    and NDRE, which is highly sensitive to chlorophyll and nitrogen contents (Tarpley
    et al., 2000). The formulae for the VIs are presented in Appendix Table A.3. Fig.
    16 presents the three VIs with different levels of N treatment (nitrogen-based
    fertilizers) and K treatment (potash-based fertilizers). Differences in potash-based
    fertilizers (K1–K4) did not result in a marked difference in VIs. By contrast,
    the influence of nitrogen-based fertilizers was significant, suggesting that nitrogen
    is pivotal to broccoli growth. The N3 treatment (40 g/m2) exhibited the most favorable
    VIs, consistent with the results of Yoldas et al. (2008). In addition, the use
    of nitrogen-based fertilizers achieved optimal yield at 30 g/m2 and optimal nitrogen
    content at 45 g/m2. In the case of N1 treatment, the three VI curves gradually
    converged with those of the unfertilized control group (CK) after Day 37, suggesting
    that the shortage of nitrogen caused broccoli to become undernourished during
    head development of the plant, indirectly resulting in a drop in yield. In the
    case of N4, the CC curve almost overlapped with the CK curve before Day 27, and
    the VIs were lower than the VIs of N2 and N3 before Day 27, suggesting that a
    high nitrogen content inhibited broccoli growth early on. Moreover, although at
    a later stage, the VIs and CC of N4 became comparable to those of N2, they were
    still slightly lower than those of N3. Download : Download high-res image (634KB)

    Fig. 17 presents the NDRE of UAV images taken periodically. Overall, pixel-based
    VI distribution only exhibited a noticeable difference in that the NDREs of the
    unfertilized control group and the N1 treatment group was noticeably lower later
    in the growth period; no difference was observed in other fields. By contrast,
    results obtained using the visualization method clearly showed that plants in
    fields receiving N3 treatment exhibited stable and high growth and that because
    the source of irrigation was located at the upper edge of each field, the NDREs
    at the lower edge of fields were considerably low. These findings can be used
    as a reference in field management to detect and rectify problems. Download :

    NDRE in first crop (a) Pixel-based monitoring (b) Single-plant monitoring. Fig.
    18 presents the VIs for the second crop. Because the soil of the field where the
    second crop was planted had relatively high electrical conductivity (EC), fertilizers
    with a high nitrogen content (i.e., N3 and N4) caused excessive soil osmotic pressure
    and salinity, which in turn damaged the plant roots and caused their leaves to
    wither or grow at a slower rate. The VIs for N3 and N4 treatments were lower than
    the VIs for other treatments after Day 8. As shown in Fig. 19, the three fields
    receiving N4 treatment had large numbers of plants that were missing or exhibited
    retarded growth early in the growth period. Necrosis was also observed in fields
    receiving N3 treatment, but the number was relatively few. Additionally, Fig.
    19 reveals the presence of poorly irrigated fields (because of the rising terrain)
    that can be seen in the upper right corner of the image. Fig. 20 presents the
    NDREs obtained using the conventional pixel-based approach. Although the conventional
    pixel-based approach enables the observation of broccoli growth at different stages
    (the same effect can be achieved in Fig. 19 by fixing the NDRE interval of each
    day), the retarded growth caused by different fertilization treatments and inadequate
    field management on any given day cannot be readily observed. This limitation
    can be overcome by using the single-plant detection method. The CK and fields
    receiving N1 treatment, which afforded stable broccoli growth at early stages,
    had lower NDRE at later stages compared with fields receiving other treatments,
    similar to the results for the first crop. The same trend was observed for the
    results obtained using single-plant detection. Thus, the amount of nitrogen in
    fertilizers influences broccoli growth; in soil with high EC, high or excessive
    (N4) nitrogen can cause plants to become missing or exhibit retarded growth. No
    instance of necrosis was observed in the first crop growing in fields receiving
    N4 treatment, but the plants exhibited retarded growth and lower VIs compared
    with plants in fields receiving N3 treatment. Although with time and the provision
    of irrigation, the VIs of N4 fields for both crops were eventually higher than
    those for CK and N1 fields, which lacked fertilization, the values were not superior
    to the VIs for N2 and N3 fields, indicating that overfertilization did not provide
    any advantage. For the second crop, the plants in fields receiving N3 treatment
    exhibited retarded growth in the early growth stages, which caused their VIs to
    be slightly lower than those of plants in N2 fields; however, after Day 36, their
    VIs were comparable to those of N2 fields. Download : Download high-res image

    the CCs for each field obtained using the conventional method. The white areas
    denote the number of plants, which increased with time, and the vacant spaces
    caused by missing plants became prominent in N4-1 from Day 29 onward. Fig. 21(b)
    presents the CCs of individual plants. Evidently, most plants in all of the N4
    fields exhibited retarded growth at the beginning of the growth period, but exhibited
    stable growth later. This is an accurate representation of actual plant growth.
    Fig. 22 presents the variation in visible images of individual broccoli plants
    and the variation in CC within a circle 400 mm in diameter, which reveals the
    growth of individual plants. Fig. 23 presents the performance of two CC calculations
    in all fertilization treatments. In Fig. 23(a), the paddy field-based CCs for
    N3 and N4 treatments became saturated after Day 25 and Day 35, respectively, when
    topdressings of fertilizer were added, but they were still lower than the CCs
    for other treatments. The difference is attributable to the vacant spaces (missing
    plants) shown in Fig. 21(a). Therefore, the CC values do not accurately reflect
    the growth of plants that can be harvested. In Fig. 23(b), after two topdressings,
    the single-plant-based CCs for N4 treatment were much closer to, or even higher
    than, the CCs of the CK than to those for other treatments, and the CCs for N3
    and N4 treatments eventually became saturated and higher than the CCs for other
    treatments after Day 43. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    By obtaining the exact location and spectral features of each plant, we observed
    the difference between individual plants in detail. The cumulative number of necrotic
    plants after the five fertilization treatments and the number of surviving plants
    with the bottom 10% of NDREs are presented in Fig. 24 (a) and Fig. 24 (b), respectively.
    Because the soil in the second crop had a relatively high EC, necrosis was prominent
    in the fields that received N3 and N4 treatments from the beginning and worsened
    after Day 10, Day 25, and Day 35, when the fields were topdressed with fertilizers.
    The situation was particularly difficult on Day 25 for the fields receiving N4
    treatment because the addition of fertilizers increased the death of plants that
    exhibited retarded growth. Fig. 24(b) reveals that retarded growth (low NDRE)
    was prominent from the beginning in fields receiving N3 and N4 treatments. On
    Day 10, the growth of plants receiving N3 and N4 treatments temporarily improved
    after topdressing, and the number of plants exhibiting retarded growth temporarily
    became lower than that of the unfertilized CK. The addition of fertilizers on
    Day 25 and Day 35 steadily improved the health of plants receiving N3 and N4 treatments,
    contrary to the steady increase of unhealthy plants in fields receiving CK and
    N1 treatments. Furthermore, overall, fields receiving N3 treatment produced the
    least number of unhealthy broccoli after harvest. Although a higher amount of
    fertilizer can increase the risk of plant necrosis when the soil has a high EC,
    Fig. 24(b) shows that despite the retarded growth early in the life of plants
    that survive necrosis, with steady fertilization, the growth and yield of surviving
    plants surpass that of their peers in fields that are not fertilized or insufficiently
    fertilized (Table 6). Download : Download high-res image (232KB) Download : Download

    of intragroup differences for each treatment. Fig. 25 presents the standard deviation
    in the NDRE and CC of individual plants for each treatment. As expected, plants
    receiving N3 and N4 treatments exhibited considerable intragroup differences in
    the beginning, and plants receiving N1 treatment, which provided little nutrition,
    exhibited relatively steady growth before Day 29. This result can be used as a
    reference in the planning of fertilization schedules. During harvest, differences
    in the NDRE and CC of plants receiving N2 and N3 treatments were minimized, suggesting
    that providing an adequate amount of fertilization is conducive to reducing the
    variation in plant growth. Notably, most treatments resulted in a considerable
    increase in the standard deviation in NDRE and CC on Day 50. Further investigation
    revealed that it rained for several days in the TDARES starting on Day 49 (December
    9, 2020). This was the only instance of rain noted throughout the growth period.
    In Fig. 24(b), the numbers of plants with a low NDRE in fields receiving N2 and
    N3 treatments temporarily increased on Day 50, indicating that an adequate amount
    of rainfall can affect the spectral features of well-grown broccoli to a certain
    extent. Moreover, in Fig. 4, a part of the background in the orthomosaic image
    taken on Day 50 is visible, which causes a change in CC because the leaves of
    some plants became soft and collapsed in the rain. A corresponding drop in the
    single-plant-based CC can also be observed in Fig. 23(b). Download : Download

    of (a)NDRE and (b)CC of broccoli plants for each fertilizer treatment. Table 6
    provides the yields of the second crop after various nitrogen treatments. Because
    the precise location of each plant was known and necrotic plants were excluded,
    the mean plant weight could be precisely calculated. Although N3 treatment caused
    necrosis and apoptosis, it resulted in the highest total yield and yield per broccoli.
    From these observations, N3 treatment can be considered the optimal nitrogen-based
    fertilization regime for the cultivar Broccoli No. 42 because it results in the
    highest yield and relatively stable plant growth in the latter stages. Based on
    the results of single-plant monitoring, this study makes the following suggestions
    for field management: According to Fig. 16 and Fig. 18, at the beginning of the
    growth period, the amount of fertilizer used has no significant effect on the
    growth speed. Therefore, if the EC of the soil is unknown, lowering the amount
    of basal dressing to an N2 equivalent is advisable, which can prevent retarded
    growth and necrosis induced by overfertilization. The effect of various treatments
    on VIs was noticeable only from Day 22–29 onward. Although the topdressing performed
    on Day 10 temporarily lowered the number of plants with low NDRE in fields receiving
    N3 and N4 treatments, the effect lasted for merely one week, after which the number
    increased again and only became steady after Day 29. This finding indicates that
    topdressings are unnecessary in an early stage (before Day 22), which is consistent
    with the findings of Feller and Fink (2005). If the soil has a high EC before
    the broccoli is planted, topdressings too close to the date of basal dressing
    can easily induce necrosis among the plants exhibiting retarded growth. Both the
    crops in fields receiving excessive fertilization (N4) had unfavorable CCs before
    Day 32. The CCs of the first crop were similar to that of the unfertilized control
    group, whereas the second crop had the lowest CC, which was attributable to retarded
    growth caused by overfertilization. This proves that excessive fertilization does
    not improve broccoli growth but can induce necrosis. The VIs of the first crop
    in fields receiving N4 treatment (overfertilization) were largely the same as
    the VIs of the crop in fields receiving N1 treatment (underfertilization). By
    contrast, for the second crop, although the plants receiving N4 treatment experienced
    retarded growth, their VIs did not differ significantly compared with plants receiving
    other treatments before Day 29. Therefore, when VIs alone are not sufficient to
    determine whether a field is overfertilized or underfertilized, CC can be used
    to determine whether plants in said field exhibit retarded growth, which is an
    indication of overfertilization. Single-plant monitoring can improve the precision
    of CC calculation because the method is not affected by plant interval and missing
    plants. Therefore, visualizing the results of single-plant monitoring can reveal
    signs of poor field management, such as uneven irrigation, fertilization, or terrain.
    Compared with pixel-based VI distribution, single-plant monitoring combined with
    visualization can greatly enhance the efficiency and precision of field management.
    Moreover, it can be further integrated with techniques in precision pesticide
    application, disease detection, and optimal harvest time recognition to substantially
    reduce the labor required in patrolling, thereby improving precision agriculture
    efficiency. Broccoli plants that are 15–25 days old (growth stage) are most suitable
    for generating bounding boxes because they are not too large to overlap with each
    other, but sufficiently large to have a CC that enables a bounding box to be placed
    neatly along the edges of a broccoli plant. This prevents the risk of omission
    of plants that overlap with each other because of being mistakenly identified
    as duplicates. Therefore, plant detection at this plant age is advisable. 4. Conclusion
    With the increasing environmental awareness and shortage of farming labor, developing
    a system that aids agricultural decision-making while reducing the costs related
    to pesticides, fertilizers, and labor is imperative. In this study, visible/multi-spectral
    UAV imagery was integrated with two DL methods—object detection and semantic segmentation—to
    effectively extract necessary information from UAV images to obtain a visualized
    map that could assist in precise field monitoring and management. Additionally,
    this study optimized a classic DL architecture to maximize crop detection precision
    when the data are limited. For plant detection, feature extraction was conducted
    using multiscale dilated convolution, which enabled the effective detection of
    broccoli in images that were taken under different photographic conditions and
    resolutions. Subsequently, histogram matching was performed to achieve 100% recall
    and precision for the second crop. For the test set comprising images taken in
    a field in Lucao, Chiayi, a recall of 61.13% was achieved using dilated convolution,
    considerably higher than the recall of 42.49% achieved through conventional 3
    × 3 convolution, proving the excellent applicability of dilated convolution in
    agricultural aerial imagery. The use of plant coordinates, spectral information,
    and the plant segmentation network for precise calculation of VIs and CC enables
    the generation of a large-area growth map in the scale of single plants. Compared
    with the conventional pixel-based plant indices or spectral features, this visualized
    map straightforwardly presents the growth of individual plants, which allows operators
    to easily detect situations such as uneven irrigation or fertilization for future
    reference, greatly enhancing the viability of precision agriculture. The integration
    of single-plant detection and VI analysis for the visualization of results and
    the calculation of unit yield enables effective analysis of the difference between
    fertilization regimes, including intragroup differences for a regime. Thus, the
    optimal amount of fertilization for Broccoli No. 42 can easily be established
    without conducting the conventional labor-intensive field sampling and investigation.
    On the basis of single-plant monitoring, this study proposed a fertilization decision-making
    method for Broccoli No. 42 according to the VIs and CCs observed at various stages
    of broccoli growth. The proposed approach can also be used to observe the size
    of broccoli heads to determine the optimal harvest time. In addition, the single-plant
    detection method can be integrated with disease detection to quantify the degree

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the near future, the
    agricultural sector is called to face a significant challenge due to increasingly
    scarce resources, extreme weather conditions, a growing population, and a reduction
    in arable land [1]. Indeed, according to the FAO, by 2050, the world’s population
    will reach about 10 billion and, to be able to feed everyone, we will have to
    produce 70% more food [2], [3]. A practical and feasible solution is to move from
    the old farming concept to smart agriculture, with the adoption of information
    and communications technologies (ICTs) that help farmers to monitor, manage, and
    optimize their operations more effectively [4]. In particular, the introduction
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, every single step of agricultural
    production can be improved: from soil management to minimizing water consumption,
    from plant protection to animal health and farm automation [5], [6]. Smart devices
    located infields are able to collect information and control the evolution of
    the different processes at various production stages. Besides, the miniaturization
    of electronic components allows to implement IoT sensors with reduced form factor
    and energy consumption, monitoring many variables of interest, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and direction, soil conditions, chemical concentrations,
    crop growth, and solar exposure, as well as possible damages caused by drought,
    hail, or flooding. IoT systems integrate all this and other data and turn it into
    useful statistics: for example, predictive analysis allows farmers to use the
    strictly necessary resources (water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and only where
    there is a real need, e.g., for poorly irrigated areas of the field, weak or sick
    plants, etc. [7], [8]. Despite such potential benefits, the deployment of smart
    agriculture systems is still in its infancy. Indeed, an obstacle to the digitization
    of agriculture is the lack or limitations of Internet connectivity in many areas.
    In the literature, several communication protocols have been proposed, with different
    characteristics related to cost, coverage, power consumption, and reliability
    [9]. Among the available technologies (summarized in Fig. 1 in terms of power
    consumption and coverage range), low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), enlightened
    in a dashed box in Fig. 1 represent the best solution for supporting smart agriculture
    requirements. One of the most adopted LPWAN technology is LoRaWAN, which offers
    wide network coverage, built-in security, low cost, and limited power consumption
    during operation [10]. Fig. 1. Classification of wireless technologies: power
    consumption versus communication range [11]. Show All Indeed, LoRaWAN is an open
    system based on a very robust modulation (called LoRa), which provides several
    interesting features for covering rural areas with simple devices [9]. For such
    reasons, LoRa has been widely employed and tested in the agricultural field, connecting
    environmental sensors measuring temperature, air/soil moisture, etc., or to control
    different kinds of actuators (e.g., irrigation valves), and in applications, such
    as tractor communications, livestock monitoring, and location tracing [12], [13],
    [14]. Differently from existing surveys, which either treat LoRa together with
    all other IoT solutions or consider very specific technological aspects, we consider
    the adoption of these systems from an holistic perspective. For example, LoRa
    is cited in [5] in the general framework of IoT; [7] cites LoRa among the most
    promising technologies for agricultural IoT, and the same plan is followed by
    [8] which dedicated a Section to LoRa in Enabling Communication Technologies;
    similarly [15] includes LoRa in IoT communication protocols suitable for smart
    agriculture. On the other hand, [16] is specific to LoRa but is focused only on
    the protocol performance, [13] takes into consideration only the energy consumption
    of LoRa, [17] discusses the application of the technologies of industry 4.0 in
    the context of smart agriculture. Papers [18] and [19] deal with specific issues
    meaning the decision support system (DSS) and robotics in agriculture, respectively.
    Instead, in this article, we strive to provide a thorough and focused analysis
    on LoRa/LoRaWAN application in smart agriculture, offering a comprehensive view
    of the advancements and in-field applications of this IoT technology. LoRaWAN
    relies on LoRa modulation, a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, patented by
    Semtech [20]. It supports wireless connectivity with limited data rates over large
    areas and without the need of an operator. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart industry,
    smart home, smart city and, increasingly, in the smart agriculture environment.
    In the view of the authors of this article, LoRaWAN possesses five main strengths
    (low-cost, long-range, low-power, no-operator, and unlicensed spectrum) that can
    bridge the gap between smart agriculture and smart cities or industries. Moreover,
    several recent improvements on the resource allocation, channel access protocol,
    and network planning can enhance the efficiency of LoRaWAN networks, reducing
    capital and operational costs [21]. In rural areas, several experiments have demonstrated
    good coverage of LoRa [22], [23], [12]. Coverage ranges of up to 5 and 47 km have
    been obtained in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation
    conditions, respectively. In addition, in the case of NLOS propagation, the coverage
    range can be increased by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [24], [25]. In
    terms of power consumption, LoRa offers up to 15 years of battery life to its
    devices. The low power consumption is a key feature of LoRa that makes it an ideal
    choice for smart agriculture applications. It was demonstrated experimentally
    that the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRa device may be six times that of
    a Wi-Fi device and two times that of a ZigBee device [26]. In this article, we
    provide a broad survey of LoRa-based smart agriculture systems, analyzing the
    state-of-the-art and highlighting for each solution the possible adoption of Machine
    Learning, control automation techniques, and energy autonomy features. We classify
    these works in four main categories: 1) irrigation systems; 2) plantation and
    crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring. These LoRa systems
    are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability, network architecture,
    energy efficiency, and point out some open issues which traverse most of the current
    smart agriculture systems. References have been selected based on recent papers
    dealing with smart agriculture; however, some contributions in different fields
    useful as a benchmark are cited as well. Finally, we present the lessons learned
    and draw future research directions which we think crucial for the success and
    widespread of such technologies. The remainder of this article is structured as
    follows. Section II provides an overview of LoRa technology and its perspectives
    in agriculture, while Section III offers a brief summary on smart agriculture
    applications and their main challenges. Section IV reports on general purpose
    LoRa-based IoT platforms applied to smart agriculture. Section V, instead, discusses
    specific vertical solutions for smart agriculture, according to the four above-mentioned
    categories. Lessons learned and future research directions are proposed in Section
    VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION II. LoRa and Its Perspectives
    in Agriculture LoRa technology is a proprietary physical layer technology patented
    by Semtech, which is revealing as a promising solution for large-scale low-power
    IoT deployments, including smart agriculture applications. Indeed, by operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands and with
    a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, LoRa provides a cheap solution for supporting
    wireless connectivity with limited data rates (from 0.3 to 27 kb/s) in large areas
    and without the need of an operator. Moreover, LoRa transmissions are regulated
    by having a maximum transmission power of 25 mW (14 dBm) in the uplink, a configurable
    bandwidth of 125, 250, or 500 kHz, and a duty cycle of 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10%, which
    permit low energy consumption. In some scenarios, the battery of LoRa devices
    can last up to 15 years. Although LoRa technology is limited to the physical layer,
    different network solutions can be built on top of it, by exploiting its transmission
    interfaces. Among these, the most consolidated one is the open-source solution
    promoted by the LoRa Alliance, which is called LoRaWAN [27]. LoRaWAN networks
    are based on a simple star of star topology (Fig. 2): end-devices (EDs), such
    as sensors or actuators deployed infield, transmit packets on the wireless medium
    to fixed nodes called gateways (GWs), which, in turn, forward the collected packets
    to a central network server (NS) interacting with several application servers
    (ASs) [28]. The network infrastructure between GWs, NS, and ASs is typically based
    on a wired Internet technology, while EDs are not associated to a specific GW,
    which greatly simplifies implementation (e.g., in case of mobility [29]): in case
    a duplicate packet is simultaneously received by multiple GWs, the NS is responsible
    of filtering these packets and performs other simple decisions on network configuration.
    Fig. 2. LoRaWAN typical architecture. Show All To minimize the protocol complexity
    and the energy consumption, LoRaWAN employs a simple Aloha MAC protocol and defines
    three classes of devices (Fig. 3). Device classes represent different ways of
    managing the reception operations performed by the EDs. Class A devices, corresponding
    to the lowest energy profile, can receive downlink packets only in two time windows
    following the transmission of their own packet to the GW. In other words, devices
    can sleep all the time and downlink transmissions are triggered only after an
    uplink one. Class B devices add to this possibility a periodic scheduling of reception
    windows, by keeping a time synchronization with the GW. Finally, class C devices
    are constantly listening to the channel for downlink packets. Any time that a
    new packet is ready for transmission, devices attempt to transmit by randomly
    selecting one of the available channels in the ISM bands (e.g., in the 868 MHz
    there are 16 channels in Europe), together with a modulation parameter called
    spreading factor (SF). More into details, six different SFs are used in LoRa (from
    SF7 to SF12), which result in different symbol times and in almost orthogonal
    transmissions: when two signals modulated at different SFs overlap, the GW is
    able to decode both transmissions in a wide range of power ratios among the signals
    [30]. Unlike many other IoT technologies, the LoRaWAN specification offers dedicated
    end-to-end encryption to application providers, together with network-level security
    primitives, which allow sharing the same network among multitenant applications
    [31]. Fig. 3. LoRaWAN technology stack. Show All Summarizing, the ease of deployment
    with excellent coverage, the availability of devices with very low energy demand,
    and intrinsic security mechanisms make these systems very suitable for innovative
    agriculture applications. Indeed, several state-of-the-art IoT applications in
    smart agriculture are based on LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. For example, LoRa is used
    to connect sensor nodes measuring environmental parameters or to control different
    kinds of actuators (e.g., solenoid valve for irrigation purposes), and in applications
    such as livestock monitoring and location tracing [13], [10], [14]. These applications
    are not critical for data rates and latency, but often require to work in large
    rural areas, with limited access to energy grids and the Internet, and with decision
    mechanisms which benefit from data-driven learning. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture
    Applications and Challenges While industrial production processes have already
    become smarter and autonomous thanks to the implementation of the so called Industry
    4.0 concept, the integration of technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence
    (AI), robotics, and big data is more recent in agriculture. The availability of
    IoT technologies for supporting wireless connectivity in rural areas and controlling
    infields smart objects shows a great potential for improving the agricultural
    sector, toward the so called smart agriculture [17], [18], [19]. Indeed, farm
    monitoring and automation can make production more efficient and sustainable [7],
    by promptly detecting and reacting to water or moisture stress, wastes of raw
    materials, crops’ diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as problems
    related to the wellbeing of farm animals. The interest on the development of smart
    agriculture applications has been demonstrated by the recent commercialization
    of agricultural sensors and robots (called Agribots), specifically designed for
    reducing the intense physical labor traditionally required in agriculture [15].
    Apart from the availability of smart devices for interacting with the farm in
    the physical world, smart agriculture applications require to build a digital
    representation of the farm status and a decision logic based on the collected
    data. Different protocols can be envisioned both for providing the wireless connectivity
    to heterogeneous devices (from simple low-cost temperature sensors, to complex
    remote-controlled robots) and exporting data for analysis and decisions [32],
    [33]. Since a large amount of data can be produced by agricultural sensors, big
    data analysis can provide efficient monitoring and processing methods [34]. Data
    processing may involve various features such as data loading, validation, aggregation,
    prediction, classification, image or video processing, and data mining. Thus,
    based on the acquired data, DSSs can optimize the productivity and reduce the
    ecological footprint of the farm. Researchers recognize that digitization of farming
    processes and activities is an important challenge for the adoption of smart agriculture
    technologies [32], [35]. In particular, the major challenges to digitization in
    agriculture can be categorized as follows. Communication Issues: As we will detail
    later, large-scale implementations of IoT solutions require robust and secure
    network architectures. The reliability of communicating information still represents
    a challenge to be addressed in the agricultural context and justifies the adoption
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies. Energy Management: The power supply in devices for
    smart agriculture is a significant challenge and energy harvesting systems are
    a relevant area of research. The main issue concerns the sensor’s power supply
    and how to optimize efficiently the power consumption. Moreover, distributed nodes
    can execute some computations (Edge computing) which consumes more energy, while
    sensor batteries have a limited capacity. Consequently, smart devices require
    efficient energy storage and supply. Data/Device Heterogeneity: In general, the
    agricultural data is produced by heterogeneous sensors (soil sensors, weather
    sensors, trunk sensors, leaf sensors, etc.). In addition, IoT devices generally
    use different network protocols and platforms. Thus, in addition to sensors heterogeneity,
    network and protocol heterogeneity should be considered as well. Getting these
    technologies to work together is often an issue, especially for unskilled farmers.
    Physical Deployments: Spatial deployment of devices on farms proves to be a significant
    challenge, especially when the entire farm needs to be monitored across a large
    area and with different application scenarios (soil, plants, trees, animals, etc.).
    Data Management: The difficulty of interpreting the data can be a huge barrier:
    indeed, numerous sensors are necessary and big data analysis could be required
    to better understand and forecast the unpredictability of agricultural ecosystems.
    Generic Platform: To promote the adoption of smart agriculture technologies is
    often required to develop user friendly software platforms. The challenge here
    is to build a universal platform that can be easily modified to support different
    types of monitoring ranging from specific crop to livestock. These challenges,
    together with the cost of infrastructure investment, the complexity of technologies,
    lack of farmers’ education and training, data ownership, and privacy and security
    concerns, has motivated the research and development of innovative platforms,
    specific network technologies, and new architectures for smart agriculture [32],
    [35]. SECTION IV. Generic LoRa-Based Platforms Since agricultural applications
    are widely different, varying from soil and air monitoring, to irrigation automation
    and livestock breeding, several general purpose IoT platforms have been adapted
    for farmers to accommodate all these applications together under a unified, easy
    to understand and simple to use interface. Therefore, in this section, we will
    discuss some of these LoRa-based platforms horizontally designed for smart agriculture,
    while in the next one, we will dig into more vertical and application-specific
    systems, focusing on the four reference scenarios depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Four reference applications in smart agriculture. Show All Generic and open IoT
    platforms can indeed help to digitize farms by integrating numerous agriculture
    applications, harmonizing specific sensing devices, actuators, and decision logics,
    which exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, latency,
    sensors’ complexity, and energy requirements. A clear example is constituted by
    FIWARE [36], a powerful open-source platform, sponsored by the European Commission,
    that provides standardized interfaces for many different IoT sectors including
    agriculture. The FIWARE platform includes several parts called generic enablers
    (GEs), which provide components and reference implementations that support specific
    APIs, and can integrate data collected from heterogeneous sensors using different
    communication technologies, to create custom applications [37], [38]. Several
    GEs are available making it easier to interface with IoT systems, and the IoT
    Agent for LoRaWAN offers a bridge between LoRaWAN and the FIWARE Context Broker
    (the core component of the “Powered by FIWARE” platforms). Moreover, FIWARE can
    be combined with other third-party platforms to provide accessible tools to worldwide
    farmers and consumers too [39]. Another example is the work in [40] where low-cost,
    LoRa-based devices are used for soil temperature and humidity monitoring, and
    the data is processed and sent to the Cayenne IoT Platform for storage and visualization
    [41]. This platform is a drag and drop project builder for developers and engineers
    that can be used in different IoT applications. It encompasses cloud-based web
    applications as well as mobile apps for Android and IOS devices. Cayenne can integrate
    any tool into the library with a wide variety of IoT ready-to-use devices and
    connectivity options. Other LoRaWAN-based IoT platforms are more specific to the
    agricultural world, aiming at improving the management of generic farms in a highly
    customizable way. For example, the LoRaFarM platform [42] has a generally applicable
    “core” infrastructure, which can be completed with specialized ad-hoc modules
    depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements. The LoRaFarM platform
    derives its topological structure from the LoRaWAN architecture, since low-level
    communication patterns are built around the LoRaWAN technology (see Fig. 5). Hence,
    expansion modules can be added at farm level (or low level), if they include physical
    hardware to be installed in the deployment (sensors or actuators), as well as
    a high level, in case data processing is needed. The middleware, in the LoRaFarM
    domain, refers to the set of entities and technologies by which data coming from
    farm-level modules are collected, stored, and exposed to high-level modules. This
    middleware can be defined as a sort of “connecting layer” between the farm and
    the back-end domain. Fig. 5. LoRaFarM platform: levels and parallelism with LoRaWAN
    [42]. Show All One of the main advantages of the LoRaFarM platform is that heterogeneous
    subnetworks, in terms of capabilities (transmission range, data throughput, and
    energy consumption), can be incorporated without altering the platform structure
    and, thus, making it highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range
    of scenarios. Indeed, this gives the freedom to choose the most suitable communication
    protocols and traffic policy to monitor and control the farm different areas,
    such as greenhouses and fields. Messages between nodes employing different protocols
    are translated by a multiprotocol GateWay (mpGW), enabling communications between
    non-LoRaWAN-enabled nodes and the LoRaFarM middleware, in a seamless way. Its
    protocol translation functionality, the mpGW can be enriched with edge computing
    features, to process and aggregate sensor data. Moreover, LoRaFarM can be extended
    with new functionalities like data analysis and prediction of the evolution of
    environmental parameters to prevent plant diseases, relying on AI and Machine
    Learning techniques. Finally, the mySense environment proposed by Silva et al.
    [58] is a sensor data integration framework aimed to systematize data acquisition
    procedures to address common smart agriculture issues. It facilitates the use
    of low cost platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making available a set
    of free tools based on the do it yourself (DIY) concept. The mySense platform
    builds over a 4-layer technological structure (sensor nodes, crop field and sensor
    networks, cloud services and front-end applications) and is accordingly divided
    into four levels of operation: Level 1, for data collection using common data
    transfer technologies (ZigBee, GSM/GPRS, LoRa, etc.); Level 2, for GWs (possibly)
    running local tasks according to the fog or edge computing paradigms; Level 3
    for storing data in the cloud; and Level 4 for high-level applications. Data can
    arrive from any device provided that complies with the data formats allowed by
    the platform. Summary and Insights: This Section discussed LoRa-based platforms
    which can be exploited to unify different applications into one simple and easy-to-use
    platform. Platforms such as Fiware, Cayenne, LoRaFarM, and mySense provide standardized
    interfaces to integrate different agricultural applications with each other. These
    platforms provide ready-to-use solutions and connectivity between heterogeneous
    networks. With these platforms, LoRa can integrate and complement existing systems
    based on other network technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.), making them highly
    scalable. SECTION V. Application-Specific LoRa Platforms In this section, we provide
    an in-depth review focusing four reference scenarios: 1) irrigation systems; 2)
    plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring,
    which broadly cover most of smart agriculture applications. A. Irrigation Systems
    Accurate monitoring of the soil water status allows to achieve seasonal water
    savings of up to 90% compared to traditional management, increasing productivity
    and introducing significant savings in energy costs for the water pumps management
    [59]. To improve water management in agriculture, it is necessary to analyze and
    monitor the complex water interactions that occur in field, following the concept
    of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum systems [60]. Indeed, the knowledge of
    the water status of the SPA system plays a significant role for understanding
    the crop water stress and implement water saving mechanisms with a minimal effect
    on the production [59]. Measuring the evapotranspiration (ET), which refers to
    the amount of water that passes from the soil into the air due to the combined
    effect of plant transpiration and evaporation, is another complex task. Examples
    of these sensors are the lysimeters or sophisticated micro-meteorological sensors
    (e.g., Eddy covariance), whose cost and complexity limit their application to
    research studies [61]. Cheaper systems are the time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    technique or gravimetric methods [62], whose main limit is the difficulty in calibration
    and automation. Some LoRa-based irrigation systems are implemented using development
    boards such as Arduino, ESP32, Pycom, or STM32, e.g., [43], [44], [47], [48],
    [46], and [51]. Few of them also include energy harvesting modules, such as an
    hydroelectric generator, allowing them to operate for decades. For example, the
    LoRaWAN-based irrigation system in [51] comprises an energy-neutral irrigation
    node (Fig. 6) with the following modules: controller module, power module, irrigation
    module, and transmitter module. Fig. 6. Energy-neutral irrigation node described
    in [51]. Show All Exploiting AI and data coming from different sensor, such as
    air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, light intensity,
    etc. makes possible to develop and train specific irrigation models to calculate
    the exact amount of water to be distributed. For example, the works [54], [55],
    [56] provide machine-learning-based smart irrigation systems, all employing LoRa
    technology. In particular, in [55], a random forest classifier predicts the soil
    moisture and, thus, irrigation is planned accordingly. In [54], instead, multiple
    linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model using two highest correlation
    coefficient features: 1) light intensity and 2) soil humidity. Data is collected
    with a LoRa P2P network, which uses a master–slave and TDMA-based MAC protocol.
    Each slave node has a unique address and can transmit a packet in each of the
    reserved TDMA time slots. Alternatively, a Penman-Monteith-based irrigation model
    allows for an optimal irrigation strategy for different crop growth periods and
    uses the ET parameter to estimate the amount of water [63]. This solution requires
    an integration of actuators, sensors and a meteorological station in a LoRa network
    [49], [50]. In addition, third-party services such as weather information or fog
    computing may be needed to decide on irrigation schedules [57]. Since in LoRaWAN,
    the latency of downlink communication from GW to Class-A nodes (sensors or actuators)
    is relatively long (must first wait for an uplink transmission), few systems employ
    alternative Master/Slave protocols [52], [53], [54]. These protocols increase
    the stability of the LoRa irrigation system, avoiding packet collisions and, thus,
    can save water during the close command of the solenoid valve. Finally, AREThOU5A
    [43] is an example of a water management system that combines data collected from
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the field and satellite data provided by international
    weather forecast services, to achieve efficient water usage strategies for farmers.
    It employs a WSN with two different sensors for measuring the temperature and
    the soil moisture in field. A routing subsystem controls and routes the data and
    information through LoRaWAN and TCP/IP with SSL network interfaces. The LoRa network
    is used to collect data from the EDs and perform administration processes, while
    the TCP/IP SSL works as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture. Summary
    and Insights: Comparing the characteristics of different irrigation systems, summarized
    in Table I, it is relevant to note that most of these LoRa-based irrigation systems
    adopt temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. However, albeit all cited
    papers are recently published, ML is used only in 1/3 of the applications. TABLE
    I LoRa-Based Irrigation System Comparison Furthermore, only 13% of these irrigation
    systems used an evapotranspiration-based methodology. This strategy, which is
    often expensive, may be accomplished by combining inexpensive sensors and AI (with
    a more comprehensive approach integrating meteorological variables measured by
    a weather station with variables measured by soil sensors into the system), significantly
    lowering the cost of direct evapotraspiration measurements. Such improvements
    could lead to more effective water management, with the simultaneous impact of
    decreasing water usage and increase crop output. Finally, LoRaWAN communications
    can be tuned to adapt the duty cycle and manage the system optimally: for example,
    when the irrigation system is not in use, sensor data could be collected every
    hour or even less, while when irrigation is taking place the measurements could
    be increased to every 5–10 min. This way, the use of water and energy could be
    further reduced [71]. B. Plantation and Crop Monitoring Plantation and crop monitoring
    requires a large number of sensors to obtain an effective control and, thus, increase
    productivity, especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous. For
    example, in order to optimize the production while minimizing the ecological footprint,
    it is necessary to control the injection of pesticides and fertilizers [72], [73],
    increasing yields up to 10% and saving fertilizers up to 37% [74]. Such control
    can be performed by varying the pesticides and fertilizer application rate over
    time and space. Crops do not always need a uniform application, as some areas
    have different requirements due to their location (sunlight, soil features, etc).
    Over-fertilization can deteriorate water quality, favor weed growth, and reduce
    profit. Vice-versa under-fertilization restricts yield or reduces crop quality
    [75]. The application rate can be modified based on weather impacts, nutrient
    availability, and seasonal cycles [73], [75]. Some optical or ultrasonic sensors
    indirectly assess the nutrient request (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)
    of the crop at the time of application [72]. In addition, to reduce the loss of
    productivity in crops, surveillance systems can be adopted [76]. Providing visual
    monitoring to growers can prevent crops from getting damaged by intruders, ensure
    the field conditions or enable the detection of pests attacks remotely. Although
    there are plenty of devices which can be exploited for building a real-time visual
    monitoring system, deploying them in a wide area and over wireless channels can
    be challenging [77], [78], [79]. Table II summarizes the main characteristics
    of several plantation and crop monitoring systems, based on LoRa technology. The
    nodes used in these systems should be of small dimensions, self-sufficient in
    terms of energy, relatively cheap, and often able to acquire a large variety of
    parameters. For example, three different sensor nodes have been developed by Valente
    et al. [64] and tested in a vineyard field: node 1, with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (that measures the direction and speed of the wind) and a sensor that monitors
    bulk electrical conductivity, in addition to volumetric water content (by measuring
    soil permittivity) and soil and air temperature; node 2, an irrometer watermark
    soil water tension sensor; and node 3, an all-in-one weather station with 12 sensors
    to measure air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, gust and direction, solar radiation, precipitation, lightning strike
    counter, and distance. It should be remarked that each node contains sensors which
    differ for the sampling rate, accuracy, and supplied energy. The nodes send data
    using LoRaWAN to a GW that is connected to a the things network (TTN) server.
    In the TTN server, data is decoded and sent to the ThingSpeak [80] platform for
    visualization and possible analysis and aggregation. Fig. 7 summarizes the different
    blocks composing the nodes: 1) a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) applied to
    a photovoltaic source and connected with a storage system; 2) a dc/dc switching
    converter to interface the source with the storage system and loads; 3) the LoRaWAN
    module for communication; and 4) the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module
    to convert the signals available from sensors. TABLE II LoRa-Based Plantation
    and Crop Monitoring System Comparison Fig. 7. Block diagram of the sensor nodes
    taken from [64]. Show All In [66] a LoRa-based IoT monitoring system for starfruit
    plantation is presented. The LoRa network implemented includes three nodes and
    one master, and it can cover a range of 700 m. For optimal growth, starfruit plants
    need soil pH conditions between 5.5–7.5. Thus, thanks to the proposed LoRa system,
    the farmers can make important and precise decisions about how to grow the crop.
    Similarly, works [65], [67], [68], [69], [58] present solutions to increase production
    and fruit quality, with optimal use of resources through LoRa-based networks.
    The Smart Mushroom Cultivation is a system used to automatize the production of
    expensive mushrooms [67]. The smart system includes devices to monitor and control
    humidity and C O 2 levels through sensors and actuators all connected using LoRaWAN.
    The sensor nodes measure the ambient condition inside Mushroom House (humidity,
    temperature, and C O 2 ), and data is sent to the remote server for monitoring
    and analysis. An automatic control maintains the ambient conditions between the
    required levels. Finally, there are cases where anomaly detection near the sensor
    is required to allow decisions and actions as soon as possible. In this direction,
    Brunelli et al. [70] proposed a new paradigm of monitoring and pest detection
    to improve the performance of an apple orchard. They add intelligence to the LoRa
    nodes, shifting the detection of anomalies near the sensor. The application is
    developed on a low-energy platform powered by a solar panel, realizing an energy-autonomous
    system capable of operating unattended continuously over LoRa networks. Summary
    and Insights: Plantation and crop monitoring requires the control of numerous
    parameters, captured by different heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    fields. Some of the sensors used in the cited papers are specific to the type
    of crop, while others (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) are deployed in almost
    all of the literature works. In addition, the use of AI is not yet widely adopted,
    and only three out of nine papers adopt automatic control for the implementation
    of DSSs. An innovative approach in this context would be to add intelligence to
    the LoRa nodes, while moving the DSS closer to the sensor. Finally, note that
    the maximum size of the LoRa payload is 250 bytes; this allows a wide variety
    of parameters to be monitored and transferred in a single packet. For example,
    Sacaleanu and Kiss [69] send eight agri-meteorological measurements in a single
    LoRa packet of only 16 bytes. C. Tree Monitoring Trees are essential in modern
    society and are widely applied in a great number of scenarios including soil erosion
    prevention, air purification, wood or fruit production. For supporting the managers
    of urban/rural green infrastructures and forests, it is important to constantly
    monitor the tree conditions, in terms of growth rate and failure risk, as well
    as micro-climate parameters in the tree surrounding areas. The analysis of this
    data allows the characterization of the trees functional responses to their environment
    and a prompt action in case of problems. Tree monitoring also requires reliable
    long-range communications in the presence of foliage, large sensor densification
    (i.e., one sensor per tree), and measurements of various physiological/biological
    parameters from specific locations (at the root, the trunk, or the branch) as
    a function of vegetation type to obtain accurate readings [83]. In these systems,
    it is also important to measure changes in position over time or instantaneous
    trunk accelerations. Table III summarizes the main characteristics of relevant
    Monitoring systems. TABLE III LoRa-Based Sensors Applications in Tree Farms One
    of the main properties to be measured is the water transport in the xylem of the
    trunk (called the sap flow). A possible measurement method is the Heat Balance
    Method, developed by Granier [91], [92], which is based on analyzing the temperature
    difference among two probes inserted into the stem wood at a 10 cm distance along
    the vertical trunk axis. The probe in the higher position is heated, while the
    lower one provides the stem wood reference temperature. The temperature difference
    generated between the probes represents an index of the transpiration activity
    of the plant, expressed as a variation of the flux density. This method can be
    used for accurate measurements of sap flow in plants, providing a reliable calibration
    procedure to relate the temperature difference to the actual sap flow [93]. For
    example, the TreeTalker (TT) [81] is a device that measures sapflow (water transport
    in the trunk), wood temperature and humidity, multispectral signature of light
    transmitted through the canopy, tree trunk radial growth, accelerations along
    a 3-D coordinate system used to detect tree movements, air temperature, and relative
    humidity, which can be additionally complemented by soil temperature and volumetric
    water content. A TT node is connected via LoRa wireless connection to a GW, that
    manages up to 48 devices in one cluster. The GW is, in turn, connected to the
    Internet via GPRS and sends data to a computer server. This technology can be
    applied to monitor the root plate tilt, as well as the flexion and the accelerations
    that tree trunks receive under the force of the wind for the evaluation of tree
    failure risk. Another solution to analyze the health condition of a tree consists
    on the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it is a well-known technique with
    a wide range of applications. EIS has been applied to characterize solids, liquids,
    both in the laboratory and industrial environments. Moreover, assessment of physiological
    states of some trees (pinus, chestnut, etc.) has also been studied. The method
    based on bioimpedance indexes allows determining three distinct physiological
    states: healthy and watered plants, plants with a high level of hydric stress,
    and plants with disease [94], [95], [96]. For example, Amaro et al. [82] integrated
    an EIS system in a sensor node to analyze the health condition of the tree and
    transfer the results through the LoRaWAN protocol. Finally, tree monitoring systems
    are often influenced by the presence of foliage which can severely impact wireless
    communication systems performance. This generally leads to node densification
    to increase coverage levels, especially in large areas, resulting in additional
    costs and constraining the design of LoRa systems in nonhomogeneous vegetation
    environments [84], [85], [97]. For such reasons, a small drone with a GW is sometimes
    required for collecting data from nodes and solving the Fresnel zone radio propagation
    issues encountered in tree farms [98], [86]. Summary and Insights: In this section,
    some methodologies for monitoring tree health have been discussed. It is important
    to highlight how LoRa can be easily integrated into these systems, e.g., to measure
    the lymph flow or bio-impedance of trees. In case the parameter to be monitored
    involves roots, it has been shown that LoRa can be used for under-ground or near-ground
    communications too [12], [99]. Finally, the use of drones for data collection
    has been exploited to solve the problem of foliage scattering. D. Livestock Monitoring
    System Smart livestock practices aim at improving the productive and reproductive
    parameters, feeding and handling of feces, producing a direct effect on the increment
    of the farmers’ income, and also better milk and meat production [100]. The implementation
    of these practices requires to monitor the general health conditions of the animals,
    by tracking some biological signals to be associated to symptoms of disease, estrus
    and calving [101]. Wearable sensor technologies provide the possibility of remotely
    managing individual animals facilitating urgent interventions, responding to time
    and labor-intensive concerns in a more efficient way [87]. In extensive livestock
    production systems, the absence of access to networking and animal contact presents
    a barrier to the effective use of these technologies. Wearable sensors, to be
    more practical for extensive management settings, must: 1) network over longer
    distances; 2) have reliable power supplies (preferably renewable); 3) be low-cost
    so that damaged and lost sensors are less economically impactful; and 4) transmit
    data in real time. For these reasons, LoRaWAN technology is indicated for above
    described applications, some of which are summarized in Table IV. Primarily, these
    systems are used to monitor the animal health, but by integrating LoRa technology
    with a GPS, remote grazing systems can be implemented [87], [88]. TABLE IV LoRa-Based
    Sensor Applications in Livestock Monitoring Animal monitoring can involve completely
    different scenarios; as a consequence, the LoRa network architecture could require
    a more specific design effort to work either in indoor or outdoor settings. For
    example, the work in [89] proposes two different versions of GWs: an indoor GW,
    designed for installation in sheltered areas such as barns and cowsheds and oriented
    toward dairy cattle livestock scenarios, and an outdoor version, more specific
    for open areas such as paddocks and pasture lands, and designed for beef cattle
    livestock scenarios. The indoor GW is conceived for monitoring several important
    physical parameters typical of the shed environment, such as temperature, relative
    humidity, illuminance, carbon dioxide (C O 2 ) , and ammonia (N H 3 ) concentration,
    while the main purpose of the outdoor GW is to manage nodes in remote areas, far
    from the shed, directly on the pasture land. In the open field scenario, weather
    parameters (temperature and humidity) are collected, for purposes of correlation
    with the animal health status. Moreover, in the presence of large herds, the high
    node density could cause an increase in collisions between sent packets. In such
    scenarios, a MAC layer that includes a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism could
    prevent as much as possible packet collisions among nodes. Indeed, LBT-based carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be incorporated with the
    physical layer of LoRa [89]. The CA mechanism is based on a random retransmission
    time that randomizes the access of the nodes to the wireless medium. The size
    of the pasture area is another factor to consider in deploying the LoRaWAN network.
    In particular, it has been shown that in large areas of pasture, the use of a
    mobile GW that moves along the track is a better solution than the use of one
    or more static GWs [90]. Contrarily, when the livestock area is not too large,
    using only one static GW is preferable because the data extraction rate value
    is high enough and the energy consumption is lower compared to multiple static
    GWs or one mobile GW. The instance of cattle monitoring in New Mexico, as described
    by Actility [102], is one of the successful illustrations of a large-scale LoRaWAN-enabled
    deployment. Due to the large size of these desert ranches (10000–20000 hectares)
    and the large number of cows to track (up to 7000), monitoring and obtaining information
    regarding cattle wellbeing can be time consuming and expensive. Indeed, while
    the cattle were previously followed using traditional GPS devices, the absence
    of reliable cellular connection throughout the whole grazing region made this
    method ineffective. These issues were solved with an off-the-shelf LoRaWAN solution
    because of its extensive range and good coverage. Finally, LoRa technology can
    be used for sharing the short text messages and voice messages in the absence
    of cellular coverage. For example, COWShED [103] is used for supporting livestock
    transhumance in Senegal. Summary and Insights: In this section, we showed how
    LoRa is used to collect information about the movements and health of livestock,
    as well as on the conditions of grassland. LoRa can also aid herders in achieving
    remote grazing by combining data with electronic fences, to identify whether animals
    have crossed it. In addition, LoRa has been used to monitor environmental parameters
    of barns, demonstrating how this technology can be adopted in both outdoor and
    indoor scenarios. Additionally, innovative MAC schemes, such as LBT method could
    be implemented to minimize packet collisions when big herds present, and to mitigate
    the limits on the effective duty cycle of channel occupation. Finally, in the
    absence of cellular coverage, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been used for large-scale
    cattle monitoring or even supporting livestock transhumance for text/voice messages.
    SECTION VI. Lessons Learned and Open Issues This Section discusses the lessons
    learned and the open research challenges for using LoRa technology in smart agriculture.
    According to the aim of this article, it was learned that, given the wide variety
    of sensors used in smart farming systems, different communication protocols need
    to be integrated, particularly when different platforms/vendors coexist and data
    must be collected from the various subsystems. In addition, since power supplies
    are frequently unavailable in a large agricultural area, nodes should be as energy
    self-sufficient as possible. Using local or edge data processing could mitigate
    this problem, optimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, keeping the logic on
    the Edge of the network could alleviate the hurdle on LoRa’s centralized communications
    (especially on the downlink). The development of interoperability in smart agriculture
    systems can also be accelerated by platforms such as FIWARE and Cayenne, while
    machine learning can be used to model and analyze technical problems, improving
    scalability of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion. The experience
    gained in Industry 4.0 can be transferred to agriculture, considering some peculiarities,
    including the need to cover large spaces that cannot be manned. In addition, there
    is the need to provide device power supply and data security (partially solved
    by leveraging on LoRaWAN built-in security schemes). Another significant factor
    is the initial cost of the system, which must be as low as possible since the
    pay-back time also depends on elements that cannot be predicted during the year,
    such as weather. Finally, it has been recognized that although ICT has long-term
    sustainability issues to be solved, they show great potential for improving the
    usage of natural resources, especially when cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are
    combined with IoT, AI, machine learning, and neuromorphic computing techniques
    [104]. Through the study carried out in this article, it is also possible to understand
    in which area LoRa has been applied and is emerging in recent years. In particular,
    among the application areas discussed in Section V, Fig. 8 shows in a pie chart
    that more than 40% of the analyzed studies focus on water management, while almost
    25% are dedicated on crop monitoring, followed by tree monitoring. This result
    is in line with recent market surveys on LPWANs (e.g., [105]), and other general
    studies on communications protocols for smart agriculture [9]. Fig. 8. Distribution
    of the LoRa papers according to smart agriculture application areas. Show All
    All this confirms the great potential of implementing smart agriculture solutions
    using IoT, and LoRa technology in particular. However, there are still some open
    issues that need to be faced: for example, LoRaWAN works quite well in uplink
    when it needs to collect data from sensors, while downlink connections might suffer
    high latency. In what follows, we briefly discuss future research directions related
    to downlink latency, energy management, device heterogeneity and interoperability,
    data management, and scalability. These open issues must be solved for LoRa systems
    to be widely adopted in smart agriculture. We conclude the Section with an eye
    on other wireless technologies, different from LoRa/LoRaWAN. A. LoRa Downlink
    Performance The downlink performance of LPWAN systems still represents a challenge
    since it is related to the energy consumption. In particular, LoRaWAN allows different
    tradeoffs between communication latency on the downlink channel and energy consumption.
    Nodes are classified by classes: they can receive only after an uplink transmission
    (Class A), or at regular time intervals (Class B), or at any time (Class C). The
    modern trend is to optimize energy efficiency, hence, data are transmitted only
    when necessary or periodically. According to the authors’ opinion, a further optimization
    could be retrieved by local data processing. As a matter of fact, even if nodes
    remain asleep most of the time, as in [57], or with scheduling intervals of reception
    windows of 10–20 min as in [48] and [50] or a few hours [58], local processing
    always lowers the data to be transmitted decreasing the transmission time; it
    has been successfully tested in [42] where edge processing on the GW allows a
    more effective control of the actuator nodes. This last approach improves also
    reliability since it allows farms to work even if the Internet connection of the
    LoRa GW is absent for a few hours. Reliability can also be improved by a Master/Slave
    access control method for the LoRa network [52], [53], [54]. Alternatively, for
    short-range communication, a Wake-up Radio (WuR) can be adopted. WuR technology
    is an ultralow-power receiver that is continuously listening to the channel while
    spending a few nanowatts or microwatts depending on the circuit’s design. WuRs
    work in parallel to the main LoRa transceiver and allow asynchronous wake-up of
    the nodes with low latency. With the LoRa-WuR scheme, the downlink latency can
    be reduced by almost 90% compared to the traditional LoRa protocol for a ten nodes
    cluster [106], [107]. B. Energy Efficiency Considerations In addition to downlink
    communication performance just explained, the energy consumption in an agricultural
    ED can include turning on booster pumps or solenoid valves, activating sensors
    over a long period, use of GPS and data transmission, etc. Nodes should be autonomous
    as much as possible since usually power supplies are not available in a wide agricultural
    area. Besides, the use of batteries needs to minimize disposal costs and pollution.
    Providing solutions to avoid the use of batteries by harvesting energy from the
    environment would encourage the deployment of wireless devices in smart agriculture.
    The use of different energy sources, such as solar energy, piezoelectricity, thermal,
    wind, water, and radiofrequency is consolidated [108]. However, making a device
    completely energy-neutral requires a thorough analysis of power consumption in
    different working states [109]. One facilitation is the availability of a renewable
    energy source as in [51]; on the other hand, a high energy consumption due to
    the heating of one probe as in [91] requires a different design or the remote
    monitoring of the energy available or harvested as in [110]. It is evident that
    there are many factors that influence the analysis of offering-demanding energy,
    it varies on a case-by-case basis and does not lend itself to systematic analysis;
    on the other hand, in this context, machine learning algorithms can give a significant
    contribution. Infact, the ML approach has been already successfully applied in
    different contexts allowing to implement an efficient renewable energy selection
    based on the geographic location [111], or to retrieve a good energy prediction
    [112]. An application example is given by the energy-neutral system for pest detection
    [70] which takes advantage of ML algorithms. C. Heterogeneity and Interoperability
    Smart agriculture systems are quite heterogeneous in terms of sensors and, in
    some cases, it is also required to integrate different communication technologies,
    e.g., when multiple platforms coexist and data arrives from different subsystems.
    LoRa platforms are used with ZigBee to implement hybrid communications managing
    different sensors clusters or with the IEEE 802.11s-based system to build a mesh
    networking architecture. The path for the integration of different technologies,
    such as cloud, IoT, and software-defined networking, with AI is proposed in [113]
    with the related challenges and opportunities. Assuring communications in heterogeneous
    smart agriculture systems is a critical issue that has been studied for example
    in [114], where LoRa and ZigBee hybrid communications are implemented. Precisely,
    two LoRa sensor clusters and two ZigBee sensor clusters are used and combined
    with two ZigBee-to-LoRa converters to communicate in a network managed by a LoRa
    GW. The token ring protocol in the ZigBee network and polling mechanism in the
    LoRa network is used. The system can work with a packet loss rate of less than
    0.5% when the communication distance is 630 m for the ZigBee network and 3.7 km
    for the LoRa network. An hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking architecture
    is proposed in [115], where an effective network protocol selection mechanism
    is developed to choose the right interface. Protocol selection is based on multiple
    parameters, including network communication interface type, GNSS position of the
    APs, RSSI of nearby nodes, type and amount of data to be transmitted. Large data
    to be transferred in a short time can rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network while
    small data can be transmitted through a LoRa-based mesh network. Platforms such
    as FIWARE [116], Cayenne [41] and mySense [58], discussed in Section IV, can also
    give a push to achieve interoperability in the smart agriculture systems. The
    above described solutions can benefit of an “industry 4.0”-based approach where
    the integration of different protocols cooperate to address the needs of automating
    computing and technology processes [113], [18]. D. Machine Learning and Big Data
    Management The integration of big data analysis with machine learning can provide
    predictions about future outcomes, such as fruit quality or detect crops’ diseases
    using historical data, analytical techniques, and statistical modeling [117].
    The benefits of ML in the agriculture are relevant [118]. However, the deployment
    of models is the most challenging step to bring the ML algorithms in the production
    fields, and thanks to its advantages, LoRa technology could make a big contribution
    to taking this step. Collected data can be used to implement an intelligent system
    capable of supporting the identification of varieties and predicting the quality
    of the final product [64]. In fact, exploiting ML, the data can be used by the
    biologists to develop crop models and perform disease prediction [68]. The agricultural
    industry produces a large amount of data collected by heterogeneous sensors, so
    best practices should include the mechanisms to reduce the memory and time for
    data analysis. Thus, to pursue such objectives, edge computing models are also
    applied [119]. Distributed data process, such as MapReduce [120], may avoid bottlenecks
    when transferring all data to a single server, as in [121] where the proposed
    method adopts smart sensors to measure the soil quality indicators, while the
    preelaborated data is transmitted using the LoRaWAN protocol. The Apache Spark
    environment is then used to implement a parallel algorithm for statistical models
    based on the soil indicator data obtained from the experimental field. E. LoRa
    Scalability and Network Improvement As concerns scalability, some open points,
    shared with general applications, are recognized. For this reason, most of the
    reference literature does not directly address issues related to agriculture.
    Indeed, scalability is a key feature in LoRa networks due to its long-range and
    large number of devices can concurrently reach a given GW. The network scales
    quite well if dynamic transmission parameters are used, in combination with multiple
    sinks. However, the correct behavior of the NS is not easy to be evaluated [122].
    In fact, the NS presents some challenges from the point of view of its optimization,
    such as processing duplicate packets or packets from other networks, or bringing
    down the entire network in case of Internet connection loss. LoRa networks are
    bound by strict legal requirements, particularly where no LBT schemes are utilized.
    The transmission duty cycle (TDC) regulates the ISM bands to determine the maximum
    time that the band can be occupied, typically bounded to 1%. This implies that
    devices may not occupy the ISM band for more than 36 s per hour, forbidding the
    transmission of new packets when this limit is attained [123]. Machine learning
    can be applied to model and analyze technical problems, improving the scalability
    of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion [124]. Further developments
    could include enhanced ADR mechanisms, optimization of GW locations, and interference
    cancelation techniques [125]. Finally, some challenges remain such as the widespread
    adoption of multihop communications in LoRaWAN. Literature has shown that multihop
    or mesh topologies can extend the coverage of LoRaWAN networks and improve energy
    efficiency in certain scenarios [126]. These solutions propose intermediate nodes
    to forward messages to other EDs to extend the coverage. Other open points include
    the use of GWs as intermediate nodes, GW-to-GW communications, and practical large-scale
    deployment of LoRaWAN mesh networks. F. Other Communication Technologies The choice
    of a specific communication technology is central to the performance of IoT-based
    agricultural applications. Other than LoRa, many standards for wireless communications
    can be employed, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, RFID, Sigfox, and NB-IoT.
    Some of them work well in the short-range (within 100 m), while others are more
    useful to cover long distances (up to tens of kilometers). Examples of the former
    are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and passive and active RFID systems, while in the
    latter, standards are Sigfox and NB-IoT (and LoRa of course). As discussed previously,
    the deployment of a massive number of IoT devices might cause interference problems
    especially for technologies using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRa. On the other hand, IoT devices operating with a licensed spectrum
    eliminate interference problems but might increase costs significantly. Several
    papers have analyzed different aspects of wireless communication protocols for
    smart agriculture, studying possible applications and comparing their performance.
    For example, ZigBee-based smart agriculture systems are described in [127], [128],
    [129], [130], and [131]. The biggest challenges for ZigBee networks are the limited
    range and increased power consumption (compared to LPWANs) and relatively low
    data rate (e.g., compared to BLE or WiFi). Therefore, ZigBee is better suited
    for small-scale scenarios [130], while the use of this protocol is not suitable
    when the agricultural area is vast and the distance between sensor nodes is large.
    On the other hand, the works [132], [133], [134], [135] represent successful examples
    of NB-IoT applications in smart agriculture. Indeed, extensive coverage, adaptable
    power consumption (depending on the mode of operation), and low interference among
    nodes, are features that make NB-IoT an interesting protocol for various agricultural
    systems [136]. However, NB-IoT employs licensed frequency channels, which results
    in higher subscription prices for the associated system even if it offers a higher
    data throughput than LoRa. Moreover, when there is an existing LTE infrastructure
    already in place, the need for hardware update may be another source of expense
    for such a system. This might be a drawback in the context of smart agriculture
    if the projected return on investment is not high enough to cover these costs
    [137]. Overall, the choice of the communication technology in smart agriculture
    needs to consider many factors and requirements, such as support for roaming,
    suitability of technology to small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale deployments,
    geographical location, costs, etc. For example, it has been shown that Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN excel on network capacity, battery lifetime, and cost, whereas NB-IoT
    achieves higher quality of service and lower latency [27]. Finally, while LoRaWAN
    has been considered the most suitable communication network for IoT in smart agriculture
    [16], it is still difficult to tell which technology will dominate the market,
    or if several technologies will coexist, perhaps specializing on different application
    domains. SECTION VII. Conclusion Although the expected transition to smart agriculture
    has already begun, researchers around the world are still looking for new solutions
    to improve agricultural productivity through IoT architectures. Indeed, albeit
    applications in agriculture can benefit from the experience gained in Industry
    4.0, they require specific knowledge regarding sensor management, energy optimization,
    and data processing. LoRa technology is widely adopted, as it allows building
    an autonomous network that meets some of the requirements of the smart agriculture,
    such as low-power and long-range communication. The adoption of LoRa-based systems
    in agriculture results in an effective way to improve the connectivity of farms,
    encourage the deployment of DSSs and consequently improve their management, leading
    the agricultural sector toward smart agriculture. In order to provide a more focused
    and comprehensive view of the applications in the field, in this article, we restricted
    our focus to LoRa/LoRaWAN technology and its uses in the context of smart agriculture.
    We presented many LoRa applications in the field, and we discussed some open issues
    and research areas for future improvements. The main challenges analyzed using
    LoRa Technology in smart agriculture, are: latency on the downlink channel, energy
    management, heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices, data management,
    and scalability. All of these can benefit from the use of machine learning algorithms.
    Indeed, AI and edge computing are still scarcely used but related algorithms and
    technologies are now mature and may be successfully applied in this field. Finally,
    the optimization of multiple GW locations and multihop topologies to extend the
    coverage of LoRa networks have been recently tested to further improve the performance
    and coverage. NOTE Open Access funding provided by ‘Università degli Studi di

  description: The production of row crops in the Midwestern (Indiana) region of the
    US has been facing environmental and economic sustainability issues. There has
    been an increase in trend for the application of fertilizers (nitrogen & phosphorus),
    farm machinery fuel costs and decreasing labor productivity leading to non-optimized
    usage of farm inputs. Literature describes how sustainable practices such as profitability
    (return on investments), operational cost reduction, hazardous waste reduction,
    delivery performance and overall productivity might be adopted in the context
    of precision agriculture technologies (variable rate irrigation, variable rate
    fertilization, cloud-based analytics, and telematics for farm machinery navigation).
    The literature review describes low adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    precision agriculture technologies, such as variable rate fertilizer (39%), variable
    rate pesticide (8%), variable rate irrigation (4%), cloud-based data analytics
    (21%) and telematics (10%) amongst Midwestern row crop producers. Barriers to
    the adoption of IoT-based precision agriculture technologies cited in the literature
    include cost effectiveness, power requirements, wireless communication range,
    data latency, data scalability, data storage, data processing and data interoperability.
    Therefore, this study focused on exploring and understanding decision-making variables
    related to barriers through three focus group interview sessions conducted with
    eighteen (n = 18) subject matter experts (SME) in IoT- based precision agriculture
    practices. Dependency relationships described between cost, data latency, data
    scalability, power consumption, communication range, type of wireless communication
    and precision agriculture application is one of the main findings. The results
    might inform precision agriculture practitioners, producers and other stakeholders
    about variables related to technical and operational barriers for the adoption
    of IoT-based precision agriculture practices.

    Figures Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract The production of row crops in
    the Midwestern (Indiana) region of the US has been facing environmental and economic
    sustainability issues. There has been an increase in trend for the application
    of fertilizers (nitrogen & phosphorus), farm machinery fuel costs and decreasing
    labor productivity leading to non-optimized usage of farm inputs. Literature describes
    how sustainable practices such as profitability (return on investments), operational
    cost reduction, hazardous waste reduction, delivery performance and overall productivity
    might be adopted in the context of precision agriculture technologies (variable
    rate irrigation, variable rate fertilization, cloud-based analytics, and telematics
    for farm machinery navigation). The literature review describes low adoption of
    Internet of Things (IoT)-based precision agriculture technologies, such as variable
    rate fertilizer (39%), variable rate pesticide (8%), variable rate irrigation
    (4%), cloud-based data analytics (21%) and telematics (10%) amongst Midwestern
    row crop producers. Barriers to the adoption of IoT-based precision agriculture
    technologies cited in the literature include cost effectiveness, power requirements,
    wireless communication range, data latency, data scalability, data storage, data
    processing and data interoperability. Therefore, this study focused on exploring
    and understanding decision-making variables related to barriers through three
    focus group interview sessions conducted with eighteen (n = 18) subject matter
    experts (SME) in IoT- based precision agriculture practices. Dependency relationships
    described between cost, data latency, data scalability, power consumption, communication
    range, type of wireless communication and precision agriculture application is
    one of the main findings. The results might inform precision agriculture practitioners,
    producers and other stakeholders about variables related to technical and operational
    barriers for the adoption of IoT-based precision agriculture practices. Keywords:

    1. Introduction Row crop corn and soybean production in the Midwestern US region
    has economic and environmental concerns, based on an increasing trends in the
    application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers [1]. Operational costs and
    fuel consumption costs have increased with a decrease in labor productivity [1].
    As a result, sustainable practices such as profitability (return on investments),
    operational cost reduction, hazardous waste reduction, delivery performance and
    overall productivity might be adopted through IoT-based precision agriculture
    applications, namely variable rate irrigation, variable rate fertilization, cloud-based
    analytics, and telematics for farm machinery navigation to improve agriculture
    operations and net profitability. However, [2] note the low rate of adoption for
    variable rate fertilizer (39%), variable rate pesticide (8%), variable rate irrigation
    (4%), cloud-based data analytics (21%) and telematics (10%) amongst Midwestern
    US row crop producers. The technical and operational barriers include operational
    costs, power consumption requirements, communication range limitations, data latency,
    data scalability, data storage, data processing and data interoperability and
    are highlighted in the literature [3,4,5]. This paper explores answers to the
    following questions: what are barriers to the adoption of IoT-based precision
    agriculture (PA) practices among row crop producers, how are the barriers operationally
    defined, and how are they related to each other? Section 2 highlights research
    background, discussing related PA literature on technologies and barriers to the
    adoption of IoT-based PA practices, Section 3 describes materials and methods
    adopted for this study based on semi-structured focus group interviews conducted
    with subject matter expertise (SME) (n = 18), Section 4 presents results from
    thematic content analysis of interview data describing operational definitions
    of variables and their relationships, Section 5 discusses results and significance
    in reference to previous studies, and Section 6 describes conclusions highlighting
    major takeaways, limitations and future research. 2. Background This section highlights
    research background supported by literature review on PA practices, barriers to
    the adoption of IoT-based PA practices, current adoption in the Midwestern US
    region and IoT-based wireless sensor technologies. 2.1. Precision Agriculture
    (PA) Practices Precision agriculture (PA) practices foster optimized application
    of agriculture inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides and energy
    that result in savings on the input applications, resulting in increased yield
    and improved profitability. Precision agriculture (PA) practices potentially provide
    producers with improved tools to manage inputs and optimize factors of production
    such as fertilizer, pesticides and seed application. The definition of precision
    agriculture published by the National Research Council (1997) defines precision
    agriculture as “a management strategy that uses information technology to bring
    data from multiple sources to bear on decisions associated with crop production”.
    Precision agriculture (PA) tools include information-gathering tools such as yield
    monitors, targeted soil sampling and remote sensing tools; variable rate technology;
    and guidance systems such as light bars and auto steer equipment. Precision agriculture
    technologies include soil mapping, variable rate application, yield monitoring
    mapping, automatic steer global position guidance systems and autonomous vehicles
    [6]. Management zones in the field are developed by using crop and field information.
    Varying input rates increase yields or reduce costs depending on the managers’
    goal for the management zones [7]. The potential benefits of PA practices include
    an increase in the accurate placement of inputs, reduction of machinery costs
    from an increase in machinery field capacity and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions due to reductions in input usage for a given level of production [8,9].
    Precision agriculture (PA) practices have an impact on increasing profitability,
    reducing operational costs, increasing labor productivity, reducing cycle times
    of operation, optimizing fertilizer (nitrogen & phosphate application) and decreasing
    fuel consumption in farm machinery [10]. These technologies may consist of variable
    rate application (water & fertilizer), real-time kinematic (RTK) autosteer, guidance
    systems (GPS-guided autosteers, yield monitors), submeter accuracy auto steering
    (SUB) and telematics. In a study by [11], the authors note the impact of PA technologies,
    such as autosteer guidance, automatic section control spray application and real-time
    kinematic precision tractor operations on the carbon emission and economic operational
    cost in the corn and soybean production in the US state of Kentucky. The findings
    indicate that automatic section control spray application has the capability to
    spray more precisely, reducing the over-application of inputs and giving a mean
    net return of 0.47% [11]. Real-time kinematic precision tractor operations provided
    the most significant improvement in carbon footprint ratio of 2.74% with increased
    technical efficiency in applying nitrogen and seeds more accurately [11]. Labor
    productivity also increased, allowing more desirable production practices to be
    employed [11]. Global navigation satellite systems-based autosteering reduces
    overlap between tractor passes and overall operator fatigue increasing productivity
    [12]. A study conducted by [13] to assess the impact of implementation of PA practices
    in potato and olive production highlighted that variable rate application (VRT)
    of potassium and phosphorus fertilizers lead to a strong reduction in nutrient
    use and an increase in operational profits of 21%, with an increase in overall
    profits of 26%. Precision agriculture (PA) can help in managing crop production
    inputs in an environmentally friendly way by utilizing site-specific knowledge
    targeting rates of fertilizers, seed and chemicals in improving soil conditions
    [14]. 2.2. Adoption of Precision Agriculture Practices among Midwestern Row Crop
    Producers The Midwestern (Indiana) region of the US has been facing environmental
    and economic sustainability issues. There has been an increase in trends for the
    application of fertilizers (nitrogen & phosphorus) and in farm machinery fuel
    costs and a decrease in labor productivity leading to non-optimized usage of farm
    inputs [1]. Precision agriculture (PA) technologies foster optimized application
    of agriculture inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides and energy,
    resulting in savings in the input applications, resulting in increased yield and
    improved profitability [12]. The adoption of PA technologies among row crop producers
    in the US Midwest region has been increasing [2]. The study conducted by [2] notes
    the adoption of different precision agriculture technologies among Midwest region
    producers. Yield monitoring technology has the highest adoption rates as 69% of
    farmers reported adopting it. Variable rate fertilizer (39%), variable rate pesticide
    (8%), variable rate irrigation (4%), cloud-based data analytics (21%) and telematics
    (10%) all reported lower adoption rates [15,16,17]. Different types of IoT sensors
    (temperature, humidity, light, pressure, wind speed) receive and collect data
    managed by cloud information management systems for data analysis solutions through
    application programming interfaces (API) [17]. A wireless sensor IoT framework
    for PA applications consists of: (1) perception layer, (2) communication layer,
    (3) processing layer and (4) application layer [4]. Therefore, it is important
    to understand the barriers and related decision factors involved in developing
    IoT-based PA applications. 2.3. Barriers to Adoption of IoT-Based Precision Agriculture
    Multiple studies note socio-economic factors (farmers’ educational level, age),
    agro- ecological factors (soil quality, farm size, ownership of land), farmers’
    perception (perceived benefits vs. profitability), technological factors (computer
    education, data aggregation) and informational factors (extension services) as
    factors having a positive relationship with adoption [16,17]. The research study
    focuses on cost, technical, operational and data management barriers highlighted
    in Figure 1 and validated in the study conducted by [3,4,5,7]. The factors include
    enumerating cost, power consumption, communication range, data latency, data scalability,
    data storage and data interoperability [3,4,5,8]. A more recent study conducted
    by [5,6,8] highlighted cost of equipment, less benefit, training, data scalability,
    communication range and time of implementation as the IoT precision agriculture
    barriers. Figure 1 highlights cost, operational, technical and data management
    barriers explored in this study. Figure 1. Cost, Technical, Operational and Data
    management barriers. Source: “Reprinted/adapted with permission from Ref. [4].
    2019, Junhu Ruan”. Figure 2 highlights the different layers of IoT framework [4]
    for PA practices. This framework was used to develop the semi-structured interview
    questionnaire highlighted in Appendix B, where questions related to barriers are
    categorized under these framework layers: (1) perception layer, (2) communication
    layer, (3) data processing and (4) application layer. Figure 2. IoT framework
    layers for wireless sensors-based PA. Source: “Reprinted/adapted with permission
    from Ref. [4]. 2019, Junhu Ruan ”. Structured literature review (SLR) methodology
    described in the following section was used to identify technical and operational
    barriers to adoption of IoT-based PA practices. Internet of things (IoT) wireless
    sensors-based PA technologies, namely monitoring row crop diseases, smart irrigation,
    smart fertilizing, cloud-based analytics and telematics for farm machinery navigation,
    have a low rate of adoption among Midwestern (Indiana) region row crop producers.
    These barriers include technical (power limitations, communication range), operational
    (data scalability, sensor distribution, data latency), management (data storage,
    data interoperability & data processing) and finance (cost, return on investment).
    3. Materials and Methods This section describes the research methodology approaches
    adopted for this study. Structured literature review conducted for this study
    is described in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 describes semi-structured focus group
    interviews conducted with (n = 18) subject matter expertise (SME), Section 3.3
    describes thematic content analysis approach and Section 3.4 highlights validity
    and reliability of research methods. 3.1. Structured Literature Review The research
    methodology framework followed a structured literature review and thematic content
    analysis of semi-structured focus group interviews conducted with subject matter
    expertise. Content analysis is defined as “content analysis is a research technique
    for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content
    of communication” [18]. The four-step process model of content analysis by [19,20]
    delimits the material to be analyzed by defining a unit of analysis, creating
    analytical categories, defining the material collection (creating and defining
    categories), pretesting the categories defined, refining through pretesting categories
    and analyzing the data by coding for thematic analysis. The first step was defining
    the unit of analysis, i.e., sample size of relevant peer reviewed journals and
    data reports. The period of analysis chosen was 1990–2019, and in the initial
    review a sample of n = 90 journals was selected. The peer-reviewed literature
    was selected from top-tier publishers Elsevier, Emerald, IEEE, Taylor Francis
    and Inderscience. The second step defined screening categories with inclusion
    and exclusion criteria. Preliminary research criteria were defined based on the
    broader research objectives, screening the selected unit of analysis, relevant
    theories, and a review of the initially selected sample journal articles. Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based precision agriculture technologies were used as initial
    inclusion or screening criteria. Abstract, introduction and findings of the initial
    sample were analyzed as per the research objectives, and 20 articles were screened
    out of 90 articles not meeting the initial screening criteria. The third step
    was pretesting and refining categories in which the sample of n = 70 articles
    was carefully analyzed for progressive refining and validating of the category
    scheme. The fourth and the last step was coding and analyzing the themes, as per
    defined categories in the previous step. The content themes identified for this
    study were based on keywords from the research questions explored in this research,
    i.e., “precision agriculture technologies” and “Barriers to adoption of IoT-based
    precision agriculture practices” were also used to develop the semi-structured
    focus group interview questionnaire in Appendix B 3.2. Focused Group Semi-Structured
    Interviews The data collection methods included focus group semi-structured interviews.
    In this study, a purposive sampling was adopted [21] (p. 94) to collect data from
    the SME’s involved in three focus groups interview sessions. The focus groups
    were categorized based upon the knowledge and expertise of the participants in
    three layers of IoT wireless sensors framework: (1) perception layer, (2) communication
    layer, and (3) data processing & application layer. The credentials of the participants
    and their current roles and expertise in the IoT framework layer are highlighted
    in Appendix A. The researcher contacted 22 individuals, of which 18 participated
    (response rate of 81%) in 3 focus group interview sessions (See Supplementary
    Material) with 6 participants in each session. Each of the focus groups consisted
    of at least one expert representing each layer of the IoT wireless sensor framework
    to reduce bias. The study conducted by [22] defined the term “focus group” to
    apply to a situation in which the interviewer asks group members very specific
    questions about a topic after considerable research. Focus groups are used in
    the studies to investigate complex systems where the research can interact with
    participants and there is further opportunity to ask for clarification questions.
    The study by [21] (p. 18) defines a focus group as a “carefully planned discussion
    designed to obtain perceptions in a defined area of interest in a permissive,
    non-threatening environment”. The critical element of focus group interviews is
    the involvement of people where the information encourages a nurturing environment
    [23]. Diagnosing potential problems, programs, services, products and stimulating
    new ideas results in frameworks for further validation with empirical research
    [24,25]. Because the characteristic of focus group interviews helps to investigate
    complex systems where the research may interact with the participants providing
    an opportunity to further ask for clarification questions, it was appropriate
    to adopt these research methods [21] (p. 18). The studies conducted by [23,24]
    highlighted that purposive sampling may be employed for focus group interviews
    that consist of representative members of larger populations. Most focus groups
    interviews consist of between 6–12 participants [25]. The study conducted by [25]
    suggests that “the size of the group is governed by the objectives of the research
    as well.” Smaller groups (4–6 people) are preferable when participants share information
    about the topic [21] (p. 24). The study also highlighted that the typical focus
    group interview might have up to 10–15 questions, depending upon the length of
    the interview and research objectives. The semi-structured interview questionnaire
    in Appendix B, developed for this study, consisted of 12 questions structured
    in four sections, namely (1) demographics (2) perception layer (3) communication
    layer and (4) data processing & application layer. 3.3. Thematic Content Analysis
    Data analysis is the part of qualitative research that mostly distinctively differentiates
    from quantitative research methods [26]. Qualitative data analysis is a more dynamic,
    intuitive and creative process of inductive reasoning, thinking and theorizing
    [27]. Data analysis in qualitative research is defined as the process of systematically
    searching and arranging the interview transcripts. The process of analyzing qualitative
    data involves coding or categorizing of data, which reduces the volume of raw
    information, followed by identifying significant patterns drawing meaning from
    the data, developing a logical chain of framework or adding to grounded theory
    [28]. The NVivo coding software was used to code the data from interviews. Inter-reliability
    of the coding thematic analysis of the data was checked with another rater to
    ensure the reliability kappa value k > 0.70 for acceptable reliability [29,30].
    3.4. Validity and Reliability Validity and reliability of the research design
    for this study follows a triangulation method, which is a typical practice for
    rigor in qualitative research methodologies [29,30]. Triangulation may involve
    combining multiple data sources (data triangulation), using multiple research
    methods to analyze the same problem (methodological triangulation) or using multiple
    investigators [31]. In this study, the approach of triangulation was followed
    by the researcher collecting and analyzing data from different sources, i.e.,
    the SLR (n = 70) and the three focus group interview sessions. The content analysis
    from the focus group interviews was triangulated by three non-subject matter expertise
    appraisers for inter-reliability. 4. Results This section highlights the results
    and findings from thematic content analysis conducted on the focused group interviews
    (See Supplementary Material). The frequency of emerging themes from content analysis
    conducted on focus group interviews is shown in Figure 1. How the variables are
    defined in the context of barriers and their potential relationships with each
    other are described in Table 1. Subsequently operational definitions for variables
    identified and defined through content analysis are highlighted in Table 2. Table
    1. Variable Relationships and Descriptive Content Analysis. Table 2. Operational
    Definitions. 4.1. Themes from Content Analysis Figure 3 highlights the reference
    frequency of emerging themes identified and analyzed following the content analysis
    approach on the focus group interviews (See Supplementary Material). The themes
    analyzed were as per the research questions based on identifying, exploring and
    defining variable relationships related to cost, technical (power consumption,
    wireless communication, communication range), operational (data scalability, data
    latency) and data management (data storage, data processing, data interoperability)
    barriers. Figure 3. Frequency of text references identified in focus group interview
    transcripts. The emerging themes identified through content analysis in decreasing
    order of their reference frequency are as follows. Data latency—type of wireless
    communication (9), data latency—autonomous applications (8), data storage—type
    of precision application (8), data interoperability—type of wireless communication
    (6) and data storage—type of sensor (6) were the most recurring themes identified.
    Data latency—power consumption (4), data interoperability—data storage (4), data
    interoperability—type of precision application (4) and data latency—data processing
    (4) were the other recurring themes identified. The emerging themes were explored
    further for descriptive analysis, and findings are reported in the following section.
    4.2. Variable Relationships The variable relationships identified as themes through
    the content analysis approach were further explored. The participants’ quotations
    in the context of variable relationships are reported in Table 1, along with descriptive
    analysis findings. The Kappa value for each of the themes analyzed through content
    analysis shows the reliability of findings. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient is a statistical
    measure of inter-rater reliability, which many researchers regard as more useful
    than the percentage agreement since it considers the amount of agreement that
    could be expected to occur through chance [30]. NVivo calculates the Kappa coefficient
    individually for each combination of emerging themes [31]. If the two users are
    in complete agreement about which content of the source should be coded at the
    node, then the Kappa coefficient is 1. A value between 0 and 1 indicates the scale
    of agreement. The Kappa (k) value ≤0.40 means weak agreement, between 0.40–0.75
    means good agreement and above 0.75 means excellent agreement [31]. The average
    Kappa (k) value is calculated for each individual node by using the mean k value
    calculated for each comparison rating between individual raters (n = 3 raters)
    involved, as per the typical practice mentioned in the studies [30,31]. The descriptive
    analyses for the variable relationships are interpretations from the participants’
    quotes. For instance, data latency requirements tend to depend upon power consumption,
    type of wireless communication technology and type of precision application, which
    might be important to consider before designing an IoT-based data pipeline for
    precision agriculture applications. Similarly, data scalability depends upon power
    consumption and cost requirements, which might be critical to understand for cost-
    and energy-efficient IoT wireless sensors-based data pipeline design. 4.3. Operational
    Definitions The operational definitions of variables identified through the content
    analysis approach are highlighted in the table. The operational definitions are
    stated as findings of content analysis from focus group interviews. The supporting
    participant quotes are also mentioned in Table 2. Therefore, the subjective interpretations
    for operational definitions are limited in the context of this study. 5. Discussion
    The variable relationships in the contexts of technical and operational barriers
    identified through this research might help to inform precision agriculture practitioners,
    researchers and producers. The findings are based on potential dependency relationships
    between cost, data latency, data scalability, data storage, data interoperability,
    type of sensors, type of wireless communication, type of precision agriculture
    application and power consumption, which might help to understand barriers from
    an IoT systems perspective. The findings suggest that data latency requirements
    depend on the type of precision agriculture application. For autonomous applications,
    specifically farm machinery navigation, the latency requirements are lower (ms
    or s) as compared to monitoring applications (days or weeks). Data latency further
    depends upon power consumption as low latency means higher power consumption.
    This is an important finding as it suggests that Wi-Fi/5G/4G are the suitable
    wireless communication technologies for low-latency autonomous applications. This
    finding is supported by the studies [3,4,15] where a comparative analysis based
    on power consumption and communication range is conducted for different types
    of wireless communication technologies. Another key finding based on data interoperability
    depends upon the data storage requirements as data collected from different types
    of sensors require more cloud storage compatibility to interoperate and perform
    data processing for different types and structure of data [32,33,34]. This finding
    resonates with the studies conducted by [4,32,33] which highlights the compatibility
    of cloud data storage platforms to interoperate for different types and structures
    of data coming from different types of sensors [32,33,34]. In addition, the findings
    of the study suggests that monitoring row crop diseases applications require data
    from multiple type of sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, topography,
    satellite imagery data) which require more data interoperable cloud storage platforms
    [35,36]. The operational definitions for variables defined in Table 2, through
    descriptive analysis of interview data, are significant results to help digital
    agriculture practitioners, producers and researchers to understand the adoption
    barriers. Understanding the variable relationships highlighted in Table 1 might
    help to design cost- and energy-efficient solutions for IoT-based precision agriculture
    applications. 6. Conclusions The dependency of data latency requirements on power
    consumption, type of wireless communication and precision agriculture applications
    is an important finding to consider for designing IoT-based wireless sensors autonomous
    applications (i.e., smart irrigation, smart fertilization and farm machinery navigation)
    [34,35,36]. Low data latency requirements for autonomous applications and comparatively
    higher data latency for monitoring applications is an important takeaway which
    might help to design energy- and cost-efficient IoT systems [32,33,35]. Higher
    data latency means low power consumption, and therefore using low-power wider-coverage
    technology such as Lora WAN holds significance. Data interoperability depends
    upon compatibility of cloud storage to store and process different formats and
    structures of data collected from different types of sensors [36,37]. Data scalability
    depends on cost as large data require more storage and processing capabilities
    at the cloud end; the cost might be insignificant but the cost of more sensors
    collecting data is significant [37,38]. Further dependency of types of wireless
    communication on data latency, communication range and power consumption are another
    critical finding to inform stakeholders for cost- and energy-efficient wireless
    communication protocol technologies [32,34,35]. The decision variables identified
    and operationally defined through this study might be explored further for dependency
    relationships and to develop an empirically validated framework for sustainable
    IoT. Interpretation of research findings following qualitative content analysis
    approaches are subjective and have limitations in context generalizability. However,
    researchers have tried to reduce biases, keeping high rigor for reliability and
    validity of findings. The findings of this research define and describe potential
    relationships between variables which might help digital agriculture practitioners
    and researchers to develop cost- and energy-efficient IoT systems for adoption
    of precision agriculture practices. Supplementary Materials The following supporting

    Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes modern technologies to provide valuable insights,
    treatment, operation management and decisions for quality crop production. The
    combination of Internet of Things (IoT) with wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
    the enabler technologies that contributes in making precision agriculture a reality.
    Features such as cost-effective monitoring, collection and wireless transmission
    of real-time data to facilitate decision-making directives, makes IoT and WSN
    perfect candidates for precision agriculture. PA is characterized by the spatial
    variations and the incessant dynamic changes of the environmental aspects as it
    varies from one field to another. Aspects such as soil, temperature, drainage,
    humidity, water and vegetation strongly affect crop growth and production. Although
    farmers and agriculturists are always aware of these factors, they were not able
    to quantitatively measure these environmental variations, predict outcomes and
    proactively take the appropriate actions. Various measurements readings provide
    useful guidelines to avoid water stress by projecting irrigation schedules improve
    production efficiency, product quality, and reduce the environmental impact. It
    is noteworthy that in such environments, the need for context-sensitive assistance
    and support that can autonomously plan timely directive actions and pre-emptive
    guidelines becomes a real vital necessity. Within the PA domain the approach will
    make the most of the WSN technology to provide services, expertise guidelines
    and farming relevant-information and hence will radically transform the way agriculture-related
    services are conceived and delivered. This paper presents a novel architecture
    that provides efficient means and decision-making mechanisms geared towards maximizing
    production and profits while taking into consideration the optimal utilization
    of various natural and artificial farming resources in precision agriculture.
    The architecture models PA entities as autonomous agents that collaborate to monitor
    soil, crops and climate in a farm field, and hence, provide timely decisions to
    facilitate real-time agricultural activities such as irrigation, fertilizer and
    pesticide application, for specific parts of a field proactively and in real time.
    Given the open, non-deterministic, and the dynamic nature of the entities participating
    in PA activities require the ability to change configuration according to their
    roles such as agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and Arborists.
    Moreover, farmers and agricultural personnel need spontaneous answers to various
    questions that are usually susceptible to a conjecture and speculation and prone
    to very intuitive analysis. It is clear that the design and implementation of
    solutions within distributed, open and heterogenous milieus such as the PA environments
    require a new modeling paradigm, integration architectures, and reliable uninterrupted
    self-configurable services. Such paradigm must describe the organization of the
    entities within the PA environment and the interconnection among them. Moreover,
    it must implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate the various agriculture
    operations through managing the activities to enable the coordination amongst
    various PA entities and support the ad hoc and automated configurations. Given
    the aforementioned characteristics of the PA environment, agent-orientation is
    a suitable design paradigm as it provides the ability to monitor and coordinate
    PA tasks among services by providing adequate interaction mechanisms. Such paradigm
    enables modeling the nature of the PA environment being open, distributed, and
    heterogeneous environments in which an agent operates as part of a community of
    systems, as well as, human users. In this work, the notion of agent-hood is defined
    as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that captures, supports and implements
    features at a high level of abstraction (knowledge level), which is useful for
    the PA environment. These features are classified as primary features such as
    rationality and coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and
    learning. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2, presents the evolution of
    the agriculture domain with the evolvement of technology, Sect. 3, presents agriculture
    4.0 conceptual model, Sect. 4, provides a review of enabler technologies and existing
    related approaches, Sect. 5, presents details of the a multi-agent architecture
    for PA, Sect. 6, presents the architecture and the necessary means and decision-making
    mechanisms that are geared towards the optimal utilization of natural and artificial
    farming resources in precision agriculture, Sect. 7, presents a prototype implementation
    using JADE (Java Agent Development platform) to support monitoring and control
    capabilities in precision agriculture environments, Sect. 8, provides a conclusion
    and discussion. 1.1 Agriculture Evolution The practice of agriculture existed
    since ancient days where human nurtured lands and raised animals to survive. With
    the evolvement of technology, the agriculture domain has been adopting the existence
    of the current technology and evolved from manual processes to automated ones.
    Figure 1 presents the evolution of the Agriculture 1.0 to the current existence
    of Agriculture 4.0 based on the industrial evolution. Traditional agriculture1.0
    relied on simple tools, manpower, and animal forces with low productivity. In
    the 19th century, with industrial evolution of steam engines, the use of machinery
    that is operated by farmers in agriculture 2.0, as well as the use of chemicals.
    Fig. 1. Evolution of agriculture with the industrial evolution Full size image
    This allowed for an increase in productivity of farm operations, however, it brought
    to the agriculture domain other issues related to the field contaminations, destruction
    to the eco-environment, and waste of natural resources. In the 20th century, the
    evolution of computing with computer programs and robotics enabled the agricultural
    machines to perform farming operations efficiently and intelligently, and hence,
    the 3rd agricultural evolution (Agriculture 3.0). This allowed in the reduction
    of chemical usage by optimizing the use of machinery, as well as, the improvement
    in the precision of irrigation. Current technologies and techniques within the
    fourth industrial revolution such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT),
    Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) allowed
    for more improvements to the agriculture domain and the existence of Agriculture
    4.0. Such technologies and techniques provide significant improvements within
    the agriculture domain in relation to the operation and the production. The work
    in [1] utilized IoT and WSN to optimize the production efficiency through efficient
    use of energy and water, as well as on maximizing on the agriculture quality,
    minimizing the impact on the environment. Moreover, the use of machine learning
    techniques in [19] to provide rich recommendations and insights for farmers to
    make adequate decisions within the agriculture domain. Other works looked into
    the efficient use of water for irrigation by utilizing IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing
    [2, 20]. This paper explores the Agriculture 4.0 and the development of the smart
    system and devices using the multi-agent system paradigm with the support of the
    current existing technologies such the IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing. 1.2 Agriculture
    4.0 Conceptual Model The conceptual model presents the required layer to deliver
    on agriculture 4.0 which enables precision agriculture. Figure 2 shows the architecture
    with the essential layer. The following subsections elaborate on the main functionalities
    of each layer and its contributions to enable the current agriculture 4.0. Fig.
    2. Agriculture 4.0 conceptual model Full size image Physical Layer. The current
    Industry 4.0 requires the definition of any object into the physical space and
    the digital space. The physical layer consists of domain related sensors (such
    as moisture sensor), transducers, and micro controllers/servers. The sensors provide
    the electrical signal readings within the agriculture environment. The electrical
    signals with the transducers are then shifted, scaled, and/or amplified with the
    micro controller/server digital, analog, and serial communication ports. Some
    decisions could be made with the aid of the micro controller/server device at
    the edge. such decision could be related to the operation of some of the resources
    related to the agriculture environment such as the irrigation system. The collected
    data from the physical layer is transmitted through the agriculture communication
    network layer through the supported protocols for the purpose of data storage
    and processing. Communication Layer. This layer is to make use of the adequate
    communication protocols and technologies in the transmission of the collected
    data from the sensor devices within the agriculture domain. This is an essential
    layer that provides the ability to connect the physical resources (in the physical
    layer) into the digital space. The digital space usually does not exist within
    the same network as the physical location of the farm, and hence, this requires
    access to the Wide Area Network (WAN). This can be either wired or wireless. Wireless
    communication network has been around for decades and has evolved from the first-generation
    to the current fifth generation of mobile communication network. Data Collection
    and Storage Layer. This layer provides the ability to collect, aggregate, and
    model the data captured from the physical layer. This data provides the ability
    for the control layer to provide the adequate decisions based on the collected
    agriculture data from the farmlands. The aggregated data may involve current collected
    data, as well as, historical data, depending on the model generated. Data from
    the agriculture domain can be either structured or semi-structured. Control Layer.
    This layer provides the ability to manage and decide upon specific criteria within
    the agriculture domain such as increasing productivity, allocating resources effectively,
    adapting to climate changes, and avoid food wastage. the layer contains Decision
    Support Systems (DSS) that provides the ability to provide the right decision
    as the right time depending on the implemented criteria. The DSS may utilize specific
    design paradigm and techniques for the agriculture domain such as Agent Oriented
    (AO) design paradigm and machine learning approaches that utilized current and
    historical data from the data collection and storage layer. Application Layer.
    This Layer Provides the Ability for the End User Within the Precision Agriculture
    to Interact with the System. The Layer Provides the Web Portal with the Exposed
    Services and Functionalities. Security Layer. This is an Essential Layer Since
    Each of the Aforementioned Layer Can Be Vulnerable to Various Malicious Attacks.
    Agriculture 4.0 Solutions Must Implement Security Practices to Protect the Full
    Environment from Information Disclosure, as Well as from Unauthorized Access,
    Improper Usage, Modification, or Destruction of Resources and Services. The Goal
    of the Security Layer is to Safeguard the PA Assets from Any Vulnerability Risks,
    Provide Confidentiality and Ensure the Integrity and the Overall Intrinsic Service
    Availability. These Goals Are Supported Through the Use of Authentication, Authorization,
    and Auditing Processes. 2 Enabling Technologies for Precision Agriculture With
    the rapid advancement in information technology, tremendous effort was devoted
    to developing new technological venues and design paradigms such as cloud computing,
    ubiquitous computing, and the context-aware computing in many application domains.
    Traditional agricultural management and processing methods need to be complemented
    by innovative sensing and driving technologies and state of the art technologies.
    Current trends of Agriculture 4.0 adopted innovative design and modelling paradigms
    as well as AI-based technologies. Precision agriculture is one of the promising
    application domains in which several technologies such as adaptive planning and
    scheduling, pattern recognition, neuron networks and machine learning models and
    methods, big data and predictive analytics were proposed [3, 9, 14, 25, 35]. Although
    more complex definitions exist, it was claimed that term of PA was first coined
    in 1997 by the US House of Representatives, in which the PA was defined as “an
    integrated information- and production-based farming system that is designed to
    increase long term, site-specific and whole farm production efficiency, productivity
    and profitability while minimizing unintended impacts on wildlife and the environment”.
    Within this context, Precision Agriculture is viewed as a farming management concept
    based upon monitoring, computing and responding to variability either in crops
    and produces or in aspects of animal rearing and cultivation [6]. While the focus
    of some definitions was impacted by the modern technical approaches on climate
    change, such as climate smart agriculture, for which the definition of the PA
    was aimed to develop the structural policies and the proper techniques that will
    achieve sustainable agricultural development to achieve food security under climate
    change. Other definitions envisioned that PA was not only restricted to the cropping
    systems per-se, but to include the entire agricultural production system such
    as animal industries, fisheries and forestry. Other approaches were proposed in
    the context-aware computing and grid computing based architecture [7, 17]. However,
    the main focus of these paradigms was geared towards the automation of collaboration
    activities and computation on a global scale. Several solutions were proposed
    to support agricultural activities and domain services that use real-time sensing
    networks for site sprinkle irrigation and control of watering via Bluetooth wireless
    technology [5, 11, 12, 18, 23]. Other approaches proposed several ways of controlling
    infertility through sensing capabilities and hence, the increase of soil fertility
    [13, 16]. Some of the existing approaches provide decision-based monitoring architecture
    for pesticide control and disease monitoring prediction that address climate change
    and hence, predict rampant pest outbreaks and diseases [6, 29, 30]. Observing
    climate and soil relative parameters such as humidity, temperature and plants
    moisture are used as vital indicators to the development of the disease in potato
    fields was exhibited with the utilization of wireless sensors. Phenomena such
    as the Internet of Things [31] and Big Data as well as the utilization of Cloud
    Computing resources and Artificial Intelligence techniques are gaining a prominent
    acceptance and expected to leverage the development of various precision agriculture
    application [32]. Massive volumes of various data can be captured, analyzed and
    thus used for better automated control and decision-making. Wolfert provides a
    comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of big data applications in smart
    farming and identifies the related socio-economic challenges [34]. In spite of
    the prominent rapid development of computer technology, field measurements of
    agricultural environment parameters and spatial data collection still depend highly
    on human intervention, stationary sensors and very traditional data repositories
    such as data loggers, paper-based records and static storage sources which are
    labor-intensive and prone to very vital errors. In this work, Precision Agriculture
    is viewed as: an abstraction level at which the agricultural environment is viewed
    as a coherent universe that provides coordination solutions to a variety of agricultural
    entities in open distributed and heterogeneous settings. 3 Multi-agent Architecture
    for Precision Agriculture Farmers and agricultural personnel entities such as
    agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and arborists within a
    PA environment need spontaneous answers to various questions that are usually
    susceptible to a lot of conjecture and speculation and prone to very intuitive
    analysis. The main challenge in PA is how to adopt an adequate technology that
    provides means and mechanisms to improve field-level management with regards to,
    crop monitoring, farming practices and crop needs. Multi-agent design paradigm
    provides and improved integration architectures, and services for monitoring and
    control of the PA environment. Moreover, the multiagent design paradigm provides
    the ability to implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate various agriculture
    operations and thus enables the interaction amongst various PA entities and supports
    the ad hoc and automated configurations. In the traditional point-to-point interaction
    patterns, entities engage directly with each other to satisfy controlled and directed
    coordination. It is clearly obvious that in such configuration is both inflexible
    and computationally expensive. For instance, there is no separation of concerns
    and responsibilities between the computation elements and the incurred required
    interactions and coordination. The lack of a distinct medium that deals solely
    with the coordination activities, imposes a considerable overhead on the entities
    in which they have to carry out the “interaction work” themselves to satisfy common
    or local task, in addition to their fundamental computational responsibilities.
    As an alternative, a capability-based coordination approach for interaction is
    a favorable and effective choice in which entities does not need to be concerned
    with how the interaction is performed or done. In this work, we consider the agent
    technology as the applicable medium that supports the coordination approach that
    is based on the capabilities of the agents within the PA environment. The notion
    of agent-hood is defined as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that implements
    features within the PA environment at a high-level of abstraction at the knowledge
    level. These features are classified as primary features such as rationality and
    coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and learning. The multi-agent
    architecture for PA takes into consideration the creation of a smart environment
    with the ability to combine distributed information sources that may have different
    schemas. Furthermore, it provides a level of assistance to agriculturists through
    the ability to integrate distributed multi-modal sensors and actuators, and further
    analyze the integrated information. Such heterogeneity of the PA environment adds
    burden on fulfilling the interoperability among the different PA participants.
    Many semantic solutions were proposed in the literature in order to solve the
    problem of data heterogeneity and providing interoperability between the devices,
    sensors and relevant entities in PA, such as semantic annotations, linked sensor
    data, and ontologies. In addition, different information models might use different
    ontologies languages in terms of representations, which make the process of the
    semantic interoperability a complicated activity. Thus, our presented agent-based
    architecture defines an ontological view and representation that act as an explicit
    semantic ontology, which consequently provide meaningful integration processes
    such as matching, mapping, and aligning as well as enabling the interoperability
    among the PA entities. 3.1 Modeling the Precision Agriculture Smart Environment
    The architecture for a smart PA environment can be viewed as a multi-layered system.
    The nodes of a WSN are composed of sensors that collect data from the agriculture
    field. Sensors may also get data from other nodes by exchanging messages. The
    data obtained from the WSN describes how properties vary within agriculture fields.
    This information is then used to analyze and predict values that provide efficient
    control of important farming operations. The results of the interventions are
    monitored, recorded and used as a starting point to initiate the next crop cycle.
    From the collection and intelligent analysis of these parameters can then plan
    interventions such as fertilizers, irrigation and plant protection treatments
    tailored to the actual needs of the crop, which is implemented only when necessary.
    The positive effects of a site-specific management of agricultural practices affect
    not only the quantity and quality of products, but also a significant reduction
    in production costs and more effective action to protect the environment by reducing
    the use of pesticides. This approach also allows identifying and evaluating the
    risk indices plant pathology in order to implement appropriate strategies of “integrated
    pest management”. Figure 3 shows the proposed PA environment as a collection of
    software agents that interact autonomously and cooperatively analyze information,
    generate valuable decisions, and accordingly provide agricultural directives and
    guidelines. Fig. 3. Smart environment monitoring and control architecture for
    PA Full size image Agent-orientation provides the ability to develop entities
    that are able to detect and react to the nature of PA dynamic stimuli. Agent-hood
    features such as autonomy, reactivity and mobility drive certain desirable similarities
    with WSN. These similarities can be summarized as follow: Reactivity: Agents are
    able to detect and react to events, and external stimuli. Ability to work asynchronously:
    The agents come into operation, upon receipt of a stimulus. In PA, this feature
    favors the implementation of techniques to ensure that messages are asynchronously
    delivered and managed over the network. Autonomy: Agents have control over their
    actions and the various internal states without an intervention of humans. In
    a PA environment, this condition is very useful, since if any node in the network
    fails, the network must be able to meet its target objectives without impacting
    the overall common goals such as sustainability, availability and robustness.
    Communication capability: Agents need to interact and communicate to achieve their
    goals. The communication component defines the language and the set of protocols
    of exchanging messages. This ability is reflected in the distribution of information
    obtained from sensors or from other network nodes. Coordination and Cooperation.
    The agent must be able to perform tasks and coordinate their interaction through
    collaboration with other agents. The coordination defines both the system structure
    and the Interaction mechanism and the cooperation defines the policies that govern
    the interaction. Mobility: It is the ability of an agent to move around a specific
    network. The deployed node is in mobility to either track or get the data from
    a corresponding PA field. Agent Architecture. The agents of the PA environment
    are built on the foundation of Collaborative Intelligence Rational (CIR) agent
    architecture with the focus on utilizing the model to capture the participating
    agent’s behavior towards achieving the desirable goal. Each agent has two main
    components: 1) Knowledge Component, 2) Capability Component. Each component is
    designed according to the agent’s specific role [21]. The knowledge component
    consists of the following: The agent’s self-knowledge based on its role within
    the PA environment. The knowledge of the other agents within the PA environment.
    The specific goals to be satisfied within the PA environment. Possible solutions
    to satisfy each goal within the PA environment. The local history of the PA environment
    that consists of all possible local solutions for an agent at any given time.
    Agent’s desires commitments and intentions toward achieving each goal within the
    PA environment. The capability component consists of the following: The domain
    actions which contains the possible set of actions that impacts the state of the
    PA environment when executed. The communication where each agent within the PA
    environment sends and receives messages. The problem solver which consists of
    reasoning algorithms that are executed based on the role of the agent to satisfy
    its goal. The generated solution from the problem solver within the agent depends
    on the aforementioned knowledge component. From Fig. 3, we can observe the interdependency
    challenge among the Ontology Agent, Personal Assistant Agent, and the Gateway
    Agent. Interdependency is defined as a goal-relevant interrelationship between
    actions performed by various participating agents [22]. The coordination mechanisms
    reduce and resolve the issues associated with interdependencies. Furthermore,
    the agent’s interaction module identifies the type of interdependencies that exists
    within the PA environment and accordingly utilizes the suitable interaction device.
    The interaction devices are categorized as: Contract-based, includes the assignment
    device; Negotiation-based, includes resource scheduling, conflict resolution,
    synchronization, and redundancy avoidance devices [10]. The interdependency within
    the PA domain is classified as capability interdependency and the interaction
    device is the “assignment” device. The main function of the assignment device
    is to resolve problems associated with capability interdependencies. The basic
    characteristics of the assignment device are problem specifications and evaluation
    parameters. With reducing complexity in achieving a goal as the agent’s main objective,
    a solution can be selected based on the goal quality. The basic characteristics
    of the assignment device are problem specifications, evaluation parameters, and
    the sub-processes. The problem specifications might include, for example, the
    request, the desired-satisfying time, and the expiration time. A collection of
    basic components comprises the structure of the agent model and represents its
    capabilities. The proposed architecture defines three types of rational intelligent
    agents, namely: The Personal Assistant Agent (PAA), the Ontology Agent (OA) and
    the Gateway Agent (GA). Personal Assistant Agent (PAA): possesses the capability
    of three major components: 1) the communication component, 2) the analysis data
    component, and 3) the decision-making component. The role of the PAA is to formulate
    the agriculturists’ request and collects the various climates relevant readings
    obtained from the PA environment. Upon receiving these readings, the PAA analyses
    the information and determines the ideal settings and the possible recommended
    set of needed actions (for example, if the humidity or temperature exceeds/less
    than a predefined value, an action alert will be generated). In order for the
    PAA to capture the other agents’ model, it has to be able to communicate only
    about facts that can be represented and expressed in the defined ontology view
    and representation. In other words, agents need to adhere to the ontological semantic
    and structure. Moreover, in order for the PAA to fulfill this capability, it asks
    the Ontology Agent (OA) for the definitions and possibly requests translation
    of agricultural terms and concepts inherent is a specific request. Ontologies
    provide support for semantic data and semantic integration. However, there are
    many cases where organizational, cultural, or infrastructural constraints hide
    or even disallow the adoption of such semantic artifacts, in other words, there
    is a lack of explicit ontologies. Ontology Agent (OA): captures and defines the
    set of agriculture concepts, set of activities and domain events. It provides
    various abstract levels of domain knowledge within the PA related applications
    and hence derives the decision–making process. The corresponding ontology specifies
    a formal representation for the different agricultural concepts (semantic ans
    syntax) and the different relationships amongst these concepts. This ontology
    must be agreed and understood by the agent community that constitute the PA environment
    (or at least among its part) in order to enable each agent to understand messages
    from other participants. The formal precision agriculture ontology presented in
    this work adopts a similar structure defined by Goumopoulos [11] that can be formally
    represented as follows $$ PA_{Onto} = \\left( {Ont_{Des} , PA_{Concept} ,PA_{Relation}
    , Axioms} \\right) $$ The \\(Ont_{Des}\\) is a tuple that consists of the following
    elements: \\({ }Ont_{Des} \\equiv \\langle OntID,{ }DevId,{ }ver,{ }md{ }\\rangle\\),
    where \\({ }OntID\\) is the ontology name, \\(DevId\\) defines the device name,
    \\(ver\\) specifies the time of relevant to ontology creation and \\(md{ }\\)
    represents the source and the purpose of the ontology metadata information. The
    \\(PA_{Concept} { }\\) represents the PA set of concepts and terminologies; \\(PA_{Relation}\\)
    defines both the set of hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships between
    the PA concepts and \\(Axioms\\) are these assertions (including rules) in a logical
    form. The representation of the PA Ontology captures the knowledge of various
    agricultural resources in terms of their classifications and descriptions. In
    this work, the knowledge representation of ontology adheres to the five-elements
    ontology approach, which can be formally, represents as follows: $$ Ont \\equiv
    \\left\\{ {C, Attr^{c} , Rel^{c} , Attr^{Rel} , H^{c} } \\right\\} $$ The \\(C\\)
    defines the set of agricultural concepts and terminologies; \\(Attr^{c}\\) is
    the set of all the possible states defined by the attributes of each concept;
    \\(Rel^{c}\\) is the set of relationships among the ontological agricultural concepts;
    \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) defines the various attributes of specific relationship along
    with the applicable multiplicities. All dependencies can be further viewed in
    terms of a generalization (is-a) or aggregation (part-whole) relationships; \\(H^{c}\\)
    specifies the concept hierarchy and its sub-elements. For example, the potato’s
    insecticide control ontology shall adhere to the aforementioned representation
    in which the elements will be defined as follows: \\(C\\) = {Plant, Insects, Pests,
    Insecticide, potato, Blister beetle, Aphid, Grubs, Russell Potato, White Potato,
    moisture, hydrometer} \\(Attr^{c}\\) = {(Name, Plant), (Reading, Moisture), (Poisoning
    percentage, Insecticide), (Color, Grubs)} \\(Rel^{c}\\) = {Kill (Insecticide,
    Aphid)} \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) = {((Name, (is-a), Plant)), ((Nutrients, (is-composed-of),
    ingredients))} \\(H^{c} \\) = {(Potato, Solanaceae), (Blister beetle, Insect),
    (Aphid, pests), (Herbicides, Insecticide)}. The Gateway Agent (GA): has the role
    of information gathering that receives sensors’ readings based on pre-set sampling
    intervals. For each sensor set, the GA is assigned the task of retrieving readings
    from the underlying scattered sensors based on the defined ontology. The GA monitors
    the status of the sensors and performs checking operations and set the data collection
    frequency. It is noteworthy that the PA environment encompasses different kinds
    of sensors with various specifications. The GA supports on-demand reading delivery
    as well as the full pre-defined measurement lifecycle. The knowledge component
    of the GA includes the sensors model available in the PA environment starting
    from the registration of physical sensor nodes as well as the addition or removal
    of a physical sensor. The knowledge component also contains a description of the
    sensors measuring capability, the agricultural terms understood and the description
    of the relationship between the concepts. The domain knowledge provides mappings
    models for transforming a domain queries into a set of queries to the appropriate
    target sensors. All these models need to be stated in an expressive common language
    that can allow capturing all the relevant distinctions amongst various terms and
    concepts as per the aforementioned ontology view. The gateway agent’s capability
    component identifies, dynamically selects the appropriate sensor and accordingly
    retrieves the relevant readings. Query processing requires developing a plan for
    obtaining the requested data. It is noteworthy, that the gateway agent also acts
    as a firewall and a proxy server to prevent unauthorized access to the private
    agricultural field network. 4 Agent-Based PA Implementation Directives The proposed
    architecture is validated by implementing the system of the PA in a real environment.
    The implementation of the system is viewed as a collection of tiers and layers
    with various autonomous agents that can act independently and cooperate in providing
    services and synergize agricultural environmental and spatial data according to
    mutual interests. The model provides querying ability and coordination activities
    that enhance the overall connectivity of distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous
    WSN information sources in PA. In this work the Mote-View WSN package [4] was
    used as the “client tier” application interface for control and monitoring supervision
    for a specific topology of wireless sensors deployment [33]. 4.1 Hardware Specifications
    Two types of sensors were used; namely: the (MEP410) for microclimate and ambient
    light monitoring, and (MEP510) sensor, in addition to a gateway (MIP520) [33].
    The sensors and the gateway are installed with the distance between the nodes
    is 3.5 m. Each WSN package contains of the following: Radio Platform (PR2400CA):
    the platform is based on a low-power microcontroller (AtmelATmega128L) and runs
    MoteWorks [24] that is an end-to-end platform for the creation of wireless sensor
    networks applications and the processing of simultaneous radio communications.
    Data Acquisition Board (MDA300CA): a compliant data acquisition board that can
    adopt various types of sensors. The board contains standard environmental measurements
    sensors such as ambient temperature, humidity, soil moisture, leaf wetness and
    atmospheric pressure. Sensor Node: Each sensor node consists of 2.4 GHz MICAz
    mote, MDA300CA data acquisition board, Irrometer Soil moisture sensor, atmospheric
    pressure sensor MPX4115A, and leaf wetness sensor. The board is managed and controlled
    by an operating system (TinyOS). TinyOS is an open-source operating system designed
    for low-power wireless devices [28] and event-driven programming language [8].
    Sink Node: The Sensor –System interface is supported by MIB510, which provides
    data transfer and allows aggregation of sensor network data on different computer
    platforms via an RS-232 serial programming interface. Additionally, the sensor
    node (MICAz) acts as a base station when assembled with the MIB510 interface board
    [8]. 4.2 Software Specifications The Mote-View software framework is used for
    managing, monitoring, and visualizing sensor network deployments. The modules
    within the Mote-View client are conceptually viewed as a multi-tier-based architecture
    in which four layers provide dedicated services (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4. MOTE-VIEW
    client-tier abstraction of sensor network data Full size image A Data Access Abstraction
    Layer (data layer), comprises the PostgreSQL relational database [26] and captures
    various system data such sensors readings, and environment corresponding surroundings
    information as well as a real-time measurements’ readings. The Node Status and
    Configuration Layer (Node Layer) manages all the relevant sensor configuration
    and gets updates upon successful events that are sent from the data layer; Calibration
    and Conversion Layer which provides calibration and data conversion service to
    the measured parameters and uses calibration coefficients raw data readings. The
    Presentation layer provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for to provide users
    of wireless sensor networks an end-to-end management and supervision of a specific
    sensor’s deployment. Each layer includes a plug-in capability for providing modular
    extensions. The Mote-View package consists of the following modules. MoteViews:
    it is software used for collecting data from the nodes in different fields. XSniffer:
    Monitors the 802.15.4 wireless network packets. MoteConfig: it is a Windows-based
    GUI utility for programming Motes. This utility provides an interface for configuring
    and downloading pre-compiled XMesh/TinyOS firmware applications onto Motes. Cygwin:
    is a command-line interface. 4.3 Experiment Environment Setting The proposed architecture
    was tested under experimental conditions and was meant as a proof-of-concept.
    Two rows of shallow trenches, one meter apart was dug and seed potatoes half (½)
    meter apart were planted accordingly, each seed location is characterized by a
    soil moisture sensor. The temperature sensor was installed halfway between the
    two rows and mounds it against the plants, burying the stems halfway. A total
    of seven sensors (Mica2 motes) were organized in a parcel for monitoring the crop
    and recording the temperature and relative humidity. In order to maintain an effective
    network connectivity and reliable communication, the sensors were installed at
    a height of 50 cm. It is noteworthy that during the potatoes flowering, the radio
    range was dramatically affected and thus manual adjustments for the sensor’s heights
    were required. All the system settings, readings and corresponding sensors data
    were captured in multiple databases by using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The implementation
    utilizes the JADE platform [15]. JADE is a software framework geared towards developing
    agent applications in compliance with the FIPA specifications for multi-agent
    systems. JADE supports a distributed environment of agent containers and allow
    several agents to execute concurrently. The role of the PAA agent is to formulate
    the service requests, sends it out to all gateway agents and collects the required
    information, evaluates the received data, determines the applicable decision accordingly
    and notifies the corresponding agent about the outcomes. The knowledge component
    includes the agent’s self-model, model of gateway and ontology agents, and the
    local history. The main capabilities of the PAA agent include communication, reasoning
    and domain actions components. The PAA problem-solver component incorporates the
    Jade behavior classes (simpleBehaviors and cyclicBehaviors) that fulfill tasks
    such as registration with the directory facilitator (DF) service and to handle
    the various incoming messages and requests. The cyclic behavior class equips the
    PAA agent with ability to check for service results that have been sent by the
    gateway agents. The communication component inherits the jade.Core.Agent and jade.lang.acl.ACLMessage
    existing classes of the jade platform. These classes enable constructing ACL messages
    by utilizing the various FIPA performatives such as REQUEST, INFORM, INFORM-DONE,
    and QUERY-IF. The messages exchanged in the interaction contain a set of one or
    more message elements. The elements vary according to the coordination scenario;
    however, the only mandatory element in all the ACL messages is the performative.
    A message might additionally include the sender name or signature, the receiver
    and the possibly a content. Agents are able to get contents and set the content
    of a particular message by overriding the methods setContent and getContent. The
    coordination component uses the FipaContractNetBehaviour for the interaction and
    negotiation patterns based on the soliciting approach as in the case of the contract-net
    approach which depends on (1) the modeling approach for other agent’s capabilities,
    and (2) the solicitation approach for the local schedule and workload of other
    agents. To capture the PA ontology and to represent the domain knowledge, the
    Protégé [27] extendible framework is used in this work. The use of Protégé permits
    exporting the ontology in various formats such as OWL (Web Ontology Language)
    and RDF (Resource Description Framework). The JADE Abstract Ontology is implanted
    using the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology. For Frames ontologies, the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology
    is inherited and for the OWL ontologies, the OWLSimpleJADEAbstractOntoloigy package
    is imported. 5 Conclusions Precision agriculture is a new paradigm that is geared
    to accommodate the increasing demand for food and nutrient using state-of-the-art
    technologies. These technologies have emerged as a proper choice not only to make
    the agricultural activities simpler, but cheaper to collect and apply data, and
    to adapt to changing environmental conditions while using the resources most efficiently.
    The proposed agent-based monitoring and control architecture promotes innovative
    model that can protect field crops, manage and control real-time agricultural
    activities in a novel modern approach. The timely decisions exhibited by the modcel
    are very desirable fundamental directives for optimizing production activities
    of precision agriculture users. The architecture depicts a a promising trend in
    moving from an intensive-labor and time-consuming work to an automated, real-time,
    and cost-effective monitoring, control and decision-making architecture that can
    enhance the PA prospective and objectives. By utilizing the Agent-Oriented paradigm,
    the Precision Agriculture domain environment is modelled at a high level of abstraction
    and viewed collectively as a coherent universe of interacting and collaborative
    agents that provide high degree of decentralization of capabilities, which is
    the key to system scalability and extensibility. The ontology model specifies
    formal schemata and intelligent view for developing and representing efficient
    of agricultural knowledge across various agriculture information sources. It is
    noteworthy that the number of physical parameters that need to be observed and
    monitored can be captured by introducing relevant sensor types as long as these
    attached sensors are registered and initiated with the Gateway Agent (GA). Furthermore,
    the model can accommodate control-based sensors for actuators and motors which
    can be remotely switched on and off to perform automatic activities such as irrigation
    and pesticide spraying activities. The utilization of the WSN technology and the
    proposed model was realized and tested under lab conditions where physical parameters
    (such as soil temperature and soil moisture) can be easily captured and transmitted
    for further decision making. References Blackmore, S., Stout, B., Wang, M., Runov,

  description: 'It is needed to solve the problems such as relatively low input-output
    ratio and environmental pollution for Chinese agriculture, with the large amount
    of agricultural production and consumption. In the background of changing international
    situation and frequent natural disasters, transforming traditional agricultural
    production methods in China is an urgent. Driven by emerging technologies such
    as artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud platform, automatic control,
    and new generation communication and so on, precision agriculture came out and
    was undoubtedly an effective way. Precision agriculture has become a common choice
    for developing sustainable and high-yield agriculture around the world. In order
    to obtain the development orientation of precision agriculture and successful
    practices in the world, this paper reviews the studies on precision agriculture
    developing status. The aim of this paper is to refine the experiences of precision
    agriculture developing in the main developed countries and regions and take a
    look at the precision agriculture development in China. Adopting the method of
    systematic literature analyzing and summary, Section 1 studies the development
    status of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions, such
    as America, Japan, European Union and Israel. The idea of precision agriculture
    was first proposed in America. Until today, America has developed mature precision
    agriculture system, which benefits from the highly developed technologies. Considering
    the serious contradiction between large population and less farmland, during 1970s,
    Japan took measures of consolidating farmland on a large scale and building farmland
    infrastructure and so on to improve the agricultural production conditions. The
    agricultural community was also formed to operate collaboratively the agricultural
    production. The development of precision agriculture in European Union is driving
    by digital technologies. The water-saving agriculture represented by drip-irrigation
    and sprinkler-irrigation has made remarkable results in Israel. The development
    experiences of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions
    enlighten us that: 1) the leading by government is the key; 2) the informatization
    construction is the foundation; 3) the advanced technology is the core; 4) the
    cultivation of new type of farmers is the guarantee. Section 2 analyzed the basements
    and weaknesses for developing precision agriculture in China. The weaknesses are
    the emphasis in this section. First, the farmland in China is scattered and the
    infrastructure is not perfect. Taking the informatization perspective, even though
    number of agriculture related information systems exist, the data and information
    are not interoperable between these systems. Second, at the present stage, we
    cannot acquire the temporal and spatial continuous agricultural information due
    to the rarity domestic satellite data and ground sensors for agriculture monitoring.
    Third, automatic variable operating system and equipment are lacking since the
    technology integration of information technology, communication and agricultural
    machine has not been achieved. Fourth, insufficient high-quality agricultural
    talents. Facing these weakness and Chinese conditions, Section 3 provided five
    suggestions to develop precision agriculture in China. Firstly, our government
    should overall plan and give guarantee in police making, infrastructure construction
    and financial support, etc. Secondly, we should improve the agricultural production
    condition through expanding moderately the operating scale of farmland and constructing
    the field infrastructure net and the national agricultural information platform.
    Thirdly, the key technology research, such as the information retrieval using
    remote sensing and technology integration of communication, automatic controlling,
    spatial information and smart machinery must be focused. Fourthly, the new type
    of personnel in agricultural field can be cultivated. Fifthly, pilot demonstration
    can be carried out according to the regional difference.'

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The progress made in developing information and
    communication technologies (ICTs) and the fact that water resources are becoming
    increasingly scarce make precision agriculture a very valuable tool for efficient
    and sustainable crop management, particularly for irrigation and fertilisation.
    In line with this, the water balance estimate is considered one of the most accurate
    methods for estimating crops’ water requirements. The Agromotic Engineering and
    Sea Research Group of the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (Spain) has worked
    in this direction to obtain portable weighing lysimeters with improved functions
    compared to traditional measurement systems. This study analysed the most important
    vegetable crops in south-eastern Spain to standardise suitable dimensions so that
    these portable weighing lysimeters can monitor practically all of today’s vegetable
    and herbaceous crops in Mediterranean climates. The dimensions established for
    the cultivation tank are 150 cm long, 45 cm wide, and 50 cm deep, with an equipment
    resolution of up to 0.09 mm expressed as water lamina. The validation over seven
    irrigation events established that the structural system achieved here allows
    precise monitoring of the water exchanges produced in the cultivation tank, so
    this portable weighing lysimeter can be useful for the efficient management of
    fertigation. Keywords: vegetable crops; precision agriculture; water balance;
    weighing lysimeter; sustainable fertigation management 1. Introduction Agriculture
    is essential for the supply of food to society, especially with the production
    of fruits and vegetables. In Spain, fruit and vegetable production represents
    20% of the total European production (mean between 2013 and 2017 [1]), which certainly
    demonstrates how important Spanish agriculture is in this sector. The value of
    Spanish vegetable production is similar to that of fruit production, although
    the surface area employed for vegetable production is half that for fruit production
    [1]. These data show that Spanish vegetable crops are highly productive, and south-eastern
    (SE) Spain sends the biggest amounts of vegetables to Europe, with 70% of all
    vegetable exports coming from Spain [2]. Agricultural production will face certain
    challenges in the coming years that must be overcome to attend to the growing
    population, and there is no alternative but to be more productive in a scenario
    where natural resources become increasingly scarce and climate change takes place
    [3,4]. Hence, investments in the improvement of water control and management are
    being prioritised [5]. Many studies are being conducted to obtain tools that achieve
    water control in order to promote efficient water management, and these are mostly
    supported through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs).
    The use of ICTs to manage horticulture with precision agriculture techniques can
    help the sector to move towards long-standing sustainable management and to meet
    the coming environmental challenges [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Irrigation management
    is a complex activity that is influenced by many factors that are closely related
    to the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. Other factors are also important in deciding
    the irrigation criteria, such as the quality of the irrigation water or the crops’
    nutrition. Pressurized irrigation allows water control systems to be established
    for efficient management. Soil moisture sensors are used to obtain signals from
    the plant root zone that can be read by data acquisition equipment, and actuators
    are used to control the irrigation system based on the parameterized criteria
    [14]. Generally, with the exception of bottom fertilizer applications, fertilizers
    are applied to irrigation water regardless of the irrigation method used. Therefore,
    fertilization must be considered to manage irrigation. In light of the above,
    it follows that irrigation is directly related to the supply of nutrients to crops.
    Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that, to achieve efficient water management
    during irrigation, it is necessary to control the entire water and nutritional
    balance [15,16,17,18]. The objective of efficient irrigation control is twofold:
    (1) to supply the minimum dose of water necessary to satisfy the water needs of
    a crop without increasing the salinity of the soil; (2) to achieve the contribution
    of nutrients with minimal leaching to contain environmental pollution. Therefore,
    it is essential to monitor all components of the water balance and how the water
    quality evolves in both the nutrient solution and the leaching to deeper layers
    (drainage) [19,20]. The weighing lysimeter is a useful tool used by many researchers
    to accurately measure the use of water in crops [21,22,23,24,25,26]. A weighing
    lysimeter can quantify water inputs and losses, and it also quantifies losses
    due to drainage. Thus, by means of nutritional analysis of the water input and
    the drained water, a nutritional balance can be established [27]. In recent years,
    the Agromotic Engineering and Sea Research Group of the Universidad Politécnica
    de Cartagena (Spain) has worked on obtaining accurate, robust, practical, low-cost,
    and portable weighing lysimetry equipment by progressively adding functions that
    make it extremely useful for knowing how a crop develops in terms of water and
    nutritional uses [28,29,30,31]. The research objective is to obtain a useful and
    standard tool based on the weighing lysimeter in order to make the newly developed
    weighing lysimeter more versatile and commercial. For this purpose, this study
    was based on the analysis of the main vegetable crops (including herbaceous crops)
    in order to define the most suitable dimensions and functions. The portable nature
    of the weighing lysimeter is based on the fact that, with little investment, it
    can be relocated in order to monitor different parts of a farm after the end of
    a crop cycle. 2. Materials and Methods In order to obtain the dimensions of the
    proposed portable weighing lysimeter and to standardise a model for its commercial
    use on vegetable farms, a study was conducted on the most representative crops
    in SE Spain. The most relevant dimensional parameters for defining the equipment
    were established, and the weighing system’s features were analysed. 2.1. Crops
    under Study As vegetable crops are extremely important in Spain, especially in
    SE Spain, the production of the most important vegetables grown in the Murcia
    Region and neighbouring regions was analysed. Using the Regional Farming Statistics
    of the Regional Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fishing of the Spanish
    Murcia Region Autonomous Community (Spain) [32], data on the production of the
    10 most productive crops were collected for the 2011–2017 period (Table 1). The
    selected crops were, in order of greater to lesser importance: lettuce, tomato,
    watermelon, melon, broccoli, pepper, artichoke, celery, onion, and courgette.
    To confirm if the choice of crops was correct, the production of all 10 crops
    was compared to the total crop production for each year. The obtained results
    are found in Table 2. Table 1. Evolution of the production (in tonnes) of the
    main vegetable crops in the Murcia Region [32]. Table 2. Relative importance in
    relation to the production quantity of the main vegetable crops in the Murcia
    Region. After deciding which vegetable crops were the most important ones for
    the Murcia Region, the production of these 10 selected crops, which roughly represented
    95% of all vegetable production, was compared to corroborate if they were also
    important when consulting the statistical data from the neighbouring Regional
    Governments of the Valencian Community, Andalusia, and Castilla la Mancha (Spain).
    Table 3 shows the production data for these vegetable crops in relation to the
    total vegetable production in each region. Table 3. Relative importance in relation
    to the production quantity of the main vegetable crops in neighbouring regions.
    The intention of the crop choice was to learn both taxonomic and agronomic characteristics
    in order to know the suitable dimensions for a cultivation tank of a commercial
    portable weighing lysimeter. Therefore, the taxonomic and agronomic characteristics
    of all of the selected crops were studied [36,37,38,39,40,41]. According to the
    obtained information, Table 4 shows the main crop characteristics (average values)
    that can affect the dimensions of portable weighing lysimetry equipment. Table
    4. Main characteristics of the most important crops in south-eastern (SE) Spain
    (average values) [36,37,38,39,40,41]. To be installed, portable weighing lysimetry
    equipment is buried below a crop line and left on the farm. Therefore, its dimensions
    must allow it to be left and integrated with all of the selected crops. To this
    end, the mechanisation and production systems of the different crops, especially
    lettuce and melon, were analysed, but this can also be done with the other crops.
    Figure 1 illustrates the normal lettuce production system, which includes crop
    beds that are commonly known as “estrechas/narrow beds”. They measure 18 cm high
    and 55 cm wide (top), with a 90 cm distance between the two axes of two parallel
    consecutive beds. They are inclined in such a way that each slope is horizontally
    projected by 12.5 cm, and have a 10 cm wide bearing base. This production system
    is commonplace for lettuce, broccoli, and celery, and is sometimes used for onion.
    At the top, two rows of plants are arranged per bed, except for onion, which is
    laid in more rows. Figure 1. Scheme of the standardization of the mechanised production
    of lettuce in narrow crop beds. On the right, it is shown how the machine operates,
    leaving two complete narrow crop beds between its wheels; on the left are the
    details of the dimensions of a narrow crop bed. Figure 2 depicts the baby lettuce
    production system with crop beds that are frequently called “anchas/wide beds”.
    They are 18 cm high and 140 cm wide at the top, with a 180 cm distance between
    the axes of two parallel consecutive beds, and the slopes are inclined in such
    a way that each slope is horizontally projected by 15 cm, with a 10 cm wide bearing
    base. This production system is mainly used for baby lettuce, onion, or baby leaf.
    For baby lettuce, it is common to use six rows per bed, or between 8 and 12 rows
    for onion, while baby leaf is grown by being directly sown all over the surface.
    Figure 2. Scheme of the standardisation of the mechanised production of lettuce
    in wide crop beds. On the right, it is shown how the machinery circulates, leaving
    a complete wide crop bed between its wheels; on the left are the details of the
    dimensions of a wide crop bed. Figure 3 shows the melon production system, which
    is flat with no crop beds. A separation between crop lines of 180 cm is standard
    practice. Therefore, this production system can be extended to any crop that is
    grown flat without crop beds (tomato, watermelon, pepper, artichoke, courgette,
    etc.). Figure 3. Scheme of the standardization of the mechanised production of
    melon. On the right, it is shown how the machine operates, leaving a crop line—not
    a crop bed—between its wheels. The details of the dimensions of the plantation
    frames without a crop bed are shown on the left. All three figures reflect the
    mechanisation scheme so that, in depending on the production system, two narrow
    crop beds, one wide crop bed, or a row of crops can coincide below the tractor.
    2.2. Description of the Portable Weighing Lysimeter Having obtained all of the
    information about the characteristics of the plants and farming systems, the three
    characteristic dimensions of the cultivation tank for the portable weighing lysimeter
    (height, length, and depth) were defined. To this end, the main portable weighing
    lysimetry equipment structures were defined (Figure 4). Figure 4. Main portable
    weighing lysimeter structures. (a) Main structure (MS): The portable weighing
    lysimeter was designed to be buried and to support a portion of soil that is to
    be monitored. To do so, a structure is needed that can house all the components
    used to quantify the soil + water + plant set mass and drainage. This structure
    must be such that the earth surrounding it does not apply any force on the cultivation
    tank’s weighing system. This structure acts as a covering for all of the equipment,
    is made of stainless steel, and is totally airtight, so neither capillary rises
    nor high phreatic levels interfere. (b) Support structure (SS): This structure
    supports the weight of the cultivation tank with the four load cells that comprise
    it. It must also independently support deep percolation drainage, which is quantified
    by means of a tank that holds this volume and is supported by a load cell that
    is independent of the others. This structure is anchored to the interior of the
    MS, and was devised to independently hold the cultivation tank to ensure its manoeuvrability.
    All of the elements required for the portable weighting lysimetry equipment to
    work properly are considered in this structure. (c) Cultivation tank (CT): This
    structure houses the portion of soil to be monitored. The number of plants that
    it contains depends on the planting framework. Its dimensions must be big enough
    for it to hold any type of vegetable or herbaceous crop, and it is integrated
    into farms depending on the system that they have set up. It is designed with
    stainless steel. It has several reinforcements that can support the load, as well
    as a deep percolation drainage system. This system continues with the drainage
    tank, which is the part of the equipment that quantifies the drainage. (d) Drainage
    tank (DT): This quantifies the deep percolation drainage with a load cell and
    qualifies it with an electric conductivity sensor. (e) Electrical control panel:
    This allows the registration of the information from the two weighing systems
    (the cultivation tank and the drainage tank) in data acquisition equipment. The
    weighing system of the cultivation tank has four load cells that are connected
    in parallel in a summing box so that a shielded six-wire line leads to the first
    weighing indicator. The other weighing system, that of the drainage tank, has
    one load cell connected directly to the second weighing indicator. Both read the
    load cells with a resolution of 24 bits and are connected to the datalogger CAMPBELL
    SCI. CR300 by MODBUS RTU RS485. All of the operating cycle management algorithms
    of the complete lysimetry system are embedded in the datalogger in order to be
    able to accurately quantify both the variations that occur in the culture tank
    and those that occur in the drainage tank. 2.3. The Cultivation Tank’s Dimensional
    Characteristics Having determined the portable weighing lysimetry equipment’s
    MS, the CT’s dimensions, which are closely related to the dimensions of the complete
    equipment, were calculated: (a) Equipment width: The equipment must be able to
    fit inside any crop system and must be adapted to the production system. For this
    reason, the most limiting production system is the narrow crop bed type. To be
    able to fit the portable weighing lysimetry equipment in a narrow crop bed, the
    maximum width must be 55 cm so that it correctly fits inside its top. Thus, the
    main structure’s (external) width (outer dimensions) measures 55 cm. Bearing the
    portable weighing lysimeter’s structural features in mind, we find that: ▪ The
    MS’s thickness will be 2 cm all around its perimeter. ▪ The CT’s thickness will
    be 2 cm all around its perimeter. ▪ The required gap between the MS and the CT
    will be 1 cm all around its perimeter in order to avoid effects on readings from
    both elements rubbing against one another. Therefore, the CT’s width (inner dimensions)
    will be the difference between the MS’s width, less twice the sum of the thicknesses
    of the MS and the CT, plus the gap between both: ▪ Inner CT width = 55 − 2 × (2
    + 2 + 1) = 45 cm. (b) Equipment length: This distance must allow at least two
    plants to be planted inside the equipment. By considering the planting distance
    set out in Table 4, the planting distance of one crop tends to be 200 cm; for
    the established portable weighing lysimetry equipment design, increasing its length
    to 400 cm would not be technically or economically feasible. Thus, an exception
    was made for watermelon because only one plant would be monitored, and the following
    crops were considered, whose frames (75 cm) are the most separate: artichoke or
    courgette. In this way, the inner CT length would result from multiplying the
    minimum number of plants to be monitored (two plants) by the planting distance
    between both along one line (75 cm): ▪ Inner CT length = 75 × 2 = 150 cm. The
    total MS length (outer dimensions) is the sum of the inner CT length, plus twice
    the sum of the thicknesses of the MS and the CT, plus the gap between the two:
    ▪ Outer MS length = 150 + 2 × (2 + 2 + 1) = 160 cm. (c) Equipment depth: The CT
    must be able to house the root systems of crops with more root development. The
    literature offers many values for this parameter, and Table 4 summarises the mean
    depth values for each crop. According to this information, the maximum CT depth
    must be 50 cm. Performing deep percolation drainage towards the DT’s draining
    channels must take place at the bottom of the equipment. To this end, a 5 cm slope
    was considered so that the depth all along the CT’s perimeter would be the difference
    in the maximum depth, less the margin determined as the drainage slope: ▪ Maximum
    CT depth = 50 cm. ▪ Minimum CT depth = 50 − 5 = 45 cm. To determine the CT’s depth,
    the load cell dimensions were also taken into account to avoid compromising the
    solving data due to excess mass. 2.4. Weighing System Calculations The calculations
    that are performed to specify the CT’s depth and to define the weighing system
    of the equipment with the load cellsare then determined. (a) Estimating masses:
    The masses estimated to support the CT’s measurement system are: ▪ CT mass = 70
    kg. ▪ Established soil density = 2650 kg·m−3 [42]. A 30% reduction is applied
    to estimate the apparent density owing to porosity: 2650 × (1 − 0.3) = 1855 kg·m−3.
    ▪ Mean CT depth: This is calculated as the average between the maximum and minimum
    depths: (0.5 − 0.45)/2 = 0.475 m. ▪ CT volume: This is the product of the inner
    length, inner width, and the mean depth: 1.5 × 0.45 × 0.475 = 0.321 m3. ▪ Contained
    soil mass: This is the product of the CT’s volume and apparent density: 0.321
    × 1855 = 595 kg. ▪ Dead weight: This is the load that, despite it being measured
    by load cells, is not of any interest for the process. In this case, the dead
    weight is determined by the CT’s weight plus the contained soil mass because the
    values of interest are those of the interchange water mass and the plant material
    mass: 70 + 595 = 665 kg. ▪ Plant material mass: This depends on the crop that
    is used, but an initial baseline is taken at 50 kg. ▪ Soil water mass: The amount
    of water that soil can contain while keeping up to field capacity. Initially,
    field capacity is estimated as 25% of volumetric humidity, and the water density
    is taken as 1000 kg·m−3: 0.321 × 0.25 × 1000 = 80 kg. ▪ Interchange water mass:
    This is the additional mass that results from water from inputs such as precipitation,
    torrents, or irrigation, and it is initially estimated as 10 kg. ▪ Total water
    mass: This is the sum of the soil water mass and the interchange water mass: 80
    + 10 = 90 kg. ▪ Staking mass: For certain creeping crops, such as peppers and
    tomatoes, staking systems are required for separating growth due to the plant
    material inside the lysimeter. To avoid plants being staked in the equipment’s
    outer structures, a staking system is joined only to the CT: 15 kg. ▪ Accidental
    overload: Sometimes, the lysimeter may have to support a load that can overexert
    load cells. This must be taken into account by estimating the load to be 100 kg.
    Accidental overloads can be understood as the footfalls of workers and/or animals
    or farming practises, such as pruning, weeding, harvesting, fertilizer, fumigation,
    etc. (b) Scale definition: For scale calculations, the total mass and supporting
    mass are considered: ▪ Total mass for the scale: This is the sum of all of the
    previously estimated masses, which are the dead weight plus the plant material
    mass and the total water mass, as well as the staking mass and accidental overload:
    665 + 50 + 90 + 15 + 100 = 920 kg. ▪ Number of scale supports = four units. ▪
    Support mass: Theoretically, this is the mass that each support withstands, and
    it is equal if correctly levelled and fitted. It is the ratio between the total
    mass and the number of supports: 920/4 = 230 kg. (c) The cell’s minimum nominal
    capacity: This is the minimum nominal capacity that the load cell must have for
    readings to be correct. It is calculated by applying a safety coefficient to the
    previously calculated support mass, whose value lies between 1.25 and 2.5. The
    contemplated factor is 1.25 after considering the equipment’s accidental overloads
    and maximum possible resolution for quantifying the water balance: 230 × 1.25
    = 287 kg. (d) Choice of load cell: Albeit somewhat limited, a load cell with a
    300 kg nominal capacity can be placed to support the maximum possible resolution;
    nevertheless, a load cell with a 500 kg nominal capacity is suitable so that equipment
    is more robust and less sensitive to overload breakdowns. The following calculations
    were performed, and they show that the resolution is transferred to the water
    lamina unit to extrapolate the results to crops outside the weighing lysimeter.
    To obtain the parameter emin, which indicates the resolution that the scale is
    capable of offering, two forms of calculation were considered. Calculating the
    parameter emin with the fraction Vmin: ▪ Nominal capacity fractions: This is the
    number of fractions into which the cell load’s nominal capacity can be divided.
    ▪ Fraction Vmin: This is the minimum fraction value of a load cell, which is the
    ratio between its nominal capacity and the nominal capacity fractions. ▪ Scale
    division step: This is the product of the fraction Vmin and the square root of
    the number of supports, and is equivalent to the scale’s resolution. This parameter
    can be taken as emin (rep), which is obtained with the scale’s resolution. Calculating
    the emin parameter by means of linearity: We previously indicated that the scale
    has a dead weight that is used to quantify a load, and both magnitudes are supported
    by the set of load cells. This is a peculiar scale given the weighing lysimeter
    equipment’s features, as the proportion of dead weight is much higher than the
    load to be quantified. In this case, the dead weight is estimated as the CT’s
    mass plus the contained soil mass, which is much higher than the mass to be quantified
    for accurate irrigation management purposes, i.e., specifically, the interchange
    water mass (mostly irrigation or rainfall, drainage, and evapotranspiration).
    Thus, the scale is used to quantify less than 1% of its nominal capacity, and
    its resolution is also sufficient. ▪ The maximum load for exact quantification
    is equivalent to the interchange water mass = 10 kg. ▪ The nlc parameter value
    of the load cell is 3000. With these data, the emin parameter (lin) is the ratio
    between the maximum load to be quantified and the nlc value, irrespectively of
    the nominal capacity of the employed cell. ▪ emin (lin) = 10/3000 = 0.003 kg.
    iii The emin parameter’s value: This is the maximum value that results from the
    two calculation methods. Table 5 offers the results of the calculations performed
    for the two nominal capacities of the load cell to be chosen. Table 5. Calculations
    of characteristic scale parameters to choose the nominal capacity of the load
    cells. (e) The lysimeter’s resolution: This magnitude, which is expressed through
    water lamina, is interesting for validation of the potential of the tool developed
    by our research group. It relates the previously calculated resolution (emin parameter)
    to the lysimeter’s surface, specifically that of the CT. With this unit, data
    can be extrapolated to other plots. ▪ CT surface: This is the product of the CT’s
    inner length and width: 1.5 × 0.45 = 0.675 m2. Based on the density established
    for water, which was previously defined, and the equivalence of 1 mm water lamina
    = 1 L·m−2, the lysimeter’s resolution, which is expressed through the water lamina,
    is the ratio between the emin parameter (in kg) and the surface (in m2). Table
    6 shows the calculation of the lysimeter’s resolution according to the selected
    nominal capacity of the load cell. Table 6. Calculation of characteristic scale
    parameters to choose the nominal capacity of load cells. 2.5. Previous Experiences
    Studies published by the Agromotic Engineering and Sea Research Group (Universidad
    Politécnica de Cartagena, Spain) show that weighing lysimetry equipment is effective
    for monitoring the water balance of a crop [18,28]. The designs prior to the last
    development were able to adequately record variations in the cultivation tank
    and in the drainage tank; however, they lacked robustness and practicality. Hence
    came the idea of trying to improve the design to solve problems such as the integration
    of cultivation in different exploitation and mechanisation systems, facilitating
    maintenance work, or avoiding problems due to rising water tables. Then, starting
    from a system that was already capable of quantifying the water inlets and outlets
    of the cultivation tank and quantifying the drainage, the following structural
    changes were made: (a) A catchment tank for the water drained by the culture tank
    was incorporated with the aim of making it independent from its control solenoid
    valve, thus facilitating maintenance work. (b) The perimeter structure was waterproofed
    to avoid being affected by rises in the water table. (c) The dimensions were modified
    to be able to adapt to the majority of vegetable and herbaceous crops. Therefore,
    the validation of the standard equipment focused on recognising that the weighing
    system of the culture tank, which is the one that was finally modified, was able
    to adequately reflect small water exchanges inside the tank. 2.6. Validating the
    Weighing System In order to validate the prototype, a functional trial was considered
    with pepper crops grown in greenhouses. After approximately 40 post-transplant
    days, seven irrigation times without drainage were analysed. During each irrigation
    time, 10 min of verification were used halfway through the irrigation to ensure
    that the irrigation fitting’s water regime was stable. The final and initial CT
    weight values were compared to find the increase in quantity by taking the water
    density as 1000 g·L−1. Variations in weight on the days immediately before and
    after the sampling period, as well as at the same time, were analysed to check
    if evapotranspiration, albeit negligible, took place at these times. Even so,
    any variation in CT weight was taken as being due to irrigation. The following
    variables can be defined: CT weight at the start of the sampling period, CTi,
    expressed in g. CT weight at the end of the sampling period, CTf, expressed in
    g. Variation in CT weight during the sampling period, CTap, expressed in g, which
    is equivalent to the water volume given in mL. CTap = CTf − CTi (1) Transmitters
    were set at a 30 cm distance (with five transmitters along the weighing lysimeter’s
    150 cm length), with a theoretical flow rate of 3.00 L·h−1 (sandy clay loam soil).
    When transferring variations in weight to the flow released by drips, the irrigation
    time, the number of drips inside the lysimeter, and the water density were taken
    into account. The practical flow variable of drip, qp, is expressed in L·h−1.
    𝑞 𝑝 ( 𝐿 ℎ·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 )= 𝐶 𝑇 𝑎𝑝 (𝑔) 10(𝑚𝑖𝑛) · 1(𝐿) 1000(𝑔) · 60(𝑚𝑖𝑛) 1(ℎ) 5(𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)
    (2) In order to confirm that the flow that was estimated with the data obtained
    in the weighing lysimeter and adjusted to the theoretical transmitters’ flow corresponded
    to reality, a manual test on one transmitter was performed. This test provided
    a volume. To translate it into the transmitter’s flow, it was related to the time
    that the test lasted by defining the manual flow variable (qm), expressed in L·h−1.
    𝑞 𝑚 ( 𝐿 ℎ·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 )= 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒(𝐿) 25(𝑚𝑖𝑛) · 60(𝑚𝑖𝑛) 1(ℎ) 1(𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) (3) In
    order to validate that the redesigned structure is capable of quantifying the
    water balance, a function for which it was conceived, the results obtained in
    two tests were compared. Thus, first of all, the data were obtained in a test
    developed in Aguaderas, T.M. de Lorca (Murcia, Spain) with a Naxos-variety broccoli
    crop that was transplanted on 12 March 2020, and had its last harvest day on 1
    June 2020, obtaining a cultivation cycle of 82 days. The crop had plastic mulch.
    Data obtained with the weighing lysimeter (which offers the weight variation of
    the culture container) on several specific days were contrasted with the reference
    evapotranspiration offered through the network of meteorological stations of the
    SIAM (Agricultural Information System of Murcia) of IMIDA (Agrarian and Food Research
    and Development Institute of Murcia, Spain). The data of variations in the weight
    of the culture container on days in which there were no drainage or contributions
    of water by irrigation or precipitation were related to the lysimeter’s surface
    of influence. The surface of the cultivation tank was 150 cm long by 45 cm wide,
    while the culture had a separation between lines of 90 cm; thus, given that the
    lysimeter supported and monitored plants whose evaporative condition corresponded
    to 90 cm, it was considered that the lysimeter’s surface of influence (CIsurface)
    was 150 cm long by 90 cm wide, resulting in 1.35 m2. Since the soil was mulched,
    the evaporation component of the 45 cm not monitored through the lysimeter could
    be neglected. This surface was important for transferring the units of grams to
    the magnitude of the height of the water sheet. The data obtained in the weighing
    lysimeter correspond to the result of the following equation. 𝐸 𝑇 𝑎 =𝐸 𝑇 0 · 𝐾
    𝑐 (4) ET0: Reference evapotranspiration—obtained from the SIAM—which comes from
    the Penman–Monteith–FAO equation and is expressed in mm. Kc: Crop coefficient,
    which depends on specific edaphoclimatic conditions, cultural work, variety, phenological
    state, etc., and which corrects the reference evapotranspiration value to estimate
    the evapotranspiration of a given crop. As a result: ETa: This is the actual evapotranspiration
    according to Sánchez et al. [26]. The values relative to the weight variation
    of the culture container in a weighing lysimeter after considering the water inputs
    from irrigation or rain and the losses from deep percolation reflect the result
    of this actual evapotranspiration. Thus, if the weight variation in the culture
    container (expressed in mm of the water sheet) is compared with the reference
    evapotranspiration, the Kc coefficient is obtained: Δ𝐶𝑇( 𝐾𝑔 𝑑𝑎𝑦 )· 1 𝜌 ( 𝐿 𝐾𝑔
    )· 1 𝐶 𝐼 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 ( 1 𝑚 2 )· 1 1 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑚𝑚 𝐿 𝑚 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ 𝐸 𝑇 0 ( 𝑚𝑚 𝑑𝑎𝑦 )
    = 𝐾 𝑐 (5) ΔCT: Variation in the cultivation tank’s weight. ρ: Water density. CIsurface:
    Weighing lysimeter’s surface of influence. 3. Results 3.1. Dimensions Set for
    the Cultivation Tank With respect to production, the crops selected in this study
    are relative important, as they make up 95% of all the vegetable products grown
    in the Murcia Region (Spain). Although these crops are not so extensively grown
    in neighbouring regions, their production represents more than 60% of all of their
    vegetable production. So, our analysis, which aimed to suitably size the portable
    weighing lysimeter’s CT, is very useful because, in commercial terms, this equipment
    is extremely versatile for such crops and, by extension, for herbaceous crops.
    Moreover, this type of tool is widely accepted in the vegetable market. After
    considering the study and calculations that were performed, the dimensions set
    for the CT were defined as 45 cm inner width, 150 cm inner length, and a mean
    depth of 47.5 cm, with a minimum of 45 cm on its perimeter and a maximum of 50
    cm in the centre (the point where deep percolation drains to the DT) (Figure 5).
    Figure 5. Cultivation tank (CT) dimensions. 3.2. Validating the Weighing System
    The data obtained in order to calculate each transmitter’s practical flow on the
    seven study days with the pepper crops are shown in Table 7 and Table 8. Table

    manual transmitters’ flow using manual test data. Figure 6 shows the results for
    the Kc at different times during the broccoli crop cycle using the designed lysimeter
    (Kc lysimeter) in comparison with the theoretical values found using published
    data from the studies of Rubino et al. [43] and Villalobos-Reyes et al. [44] and
    with the FAO-56 data [45]. Figure 6. Comparison of the product of the Kc coefficient
    lysimeter with the theoretical cultivation Kc coefficient for broccoli found through
    weighing lysimetry, as well as from the studies of Rubino et al. [43] and Villalobos-Reyes
    et al. [44] and with the FAO-56 data [45]. 4. Discussion Table 4 summarises the
    taxonomic and agronomic characteristics of the studied crops. With planting frames,
    the frame choice depends on many factors, but, except for watermelon crops, two
    or more plants of the other crops can be grown inside a lysimeter, which allows
    suitable representativeness. Although the root depth varies according to the crop,
    the active zone is always in the upper soil layers [46]. Thus, the depth with
    which the CT was designed allows practically the whole root volume to be housed,
    and the crop inside is exposed to similar conditions to those outside the lysimeter.
    The standardization of production systems and their mechanisation allow the portable
    weighing lysimetry equipment to be set up similarly to the equipment developed
    by the Agromotic Engineering and Sea Research Group of the Universidad Politécnica
    de Cartagena (Spain). This is enabled by it being perfectly integrated into crop
    lines, on narrow crop beds (Figure 1) or wide crop beds (Figure 2), or when crops
    are grown flat (Figure 3). After analysing the loads that could support the equipment
    by means of the CT, it was deduced that increasing the depth was counterproductive
    because it limited the nominal capacity of the load cells to be used, which would
    reduce the equipment’s resolution. With the dimensions indicated herein for the
    CT, a crop surface of 0.675 m2 was obtained. Compared to any other water balance
    estimation method—for instance, with humidity sensors [47]—this surface area is
    large because sensors are only able to monitor a small volume around the point
    where they are fitted. In addition, portable weighing lysimetry equipment quantifies,
    rather than estimates, water balance components because it quantifies and qualifies
    deep percolation drainage. It also quantifies water inputs due to irrigation and
    precipitation as well as losses through evapotranspiration. Depending on the type
    of load cell being used, resolutions between 0.09 and 0.15 mm can be accomplished.
    End users can obtain the resolution that they are interested in at the same weighing
    lysimetry equipment cost. For example, if the equipment is to be used for research
    purposes, the load cell to be fitted can be one with 300 kg of nominal capacity,
    which gives a resolution of 0.09 mm. However, for commercial farming, the equipment
    management conditions are not the same because the personnel who perform cultivation
    tasks do not necessarily have to be specifically trained in handling this equipment,
    and they might sporadically apply loads that can harm 300 kg load cells. Therefore,
    for commercial farming, fitting 500 kg load cells will guarantee that the equipment
    lasts, but with a 0.15 mm resolution. Nonetheless, considering that the reference
    evapotranspiration can be of the order of 6–7 mm, accurate irrigation can be achieved
    at the obtained resolution. The resolution is conditioned by the sampling surface.
    Generally, for crops with limited growth habits, the calculated surface area of
    0.675 m2 is that which the weighing lysimeter actually monitors. However, for
    crops with more expansive growth habits or creeping crops, such as melon and even
    watermelon, which can cover a 4 m2 surface area, the measurements taken by the
    lysimeter do not only affect a surface area of 0.675 m2. The plant, which covers
    a much greater surface than that of the CT, draws water from inside the lysimeter.
    So, the resolution value is significantly reduced. In commercial terms, where
    the surface area used is important, the data obtained with the weighing lysimeter
    can provide irrigation recommendations. Instead of being expressed as water lamina,
    they are expressed as water volume per plant, which is more representative and
    can be perfectly extrapolated to the interior of the monitored farmland. For all
    these reasons, the dimensions of the portable weighing lysimetry equipment are
    suitable, and it accurately manages irrigation thanks to the high resolution that
    it offers. If we consider its fitted sensors for quantifying and qualifying deep
    percolation drainage (a load cell for the DT and an electric conductivity sensor
    inside it), nutrition can also be managed. By adding another conductivity sensor
    to the irrigation line, irrigation and fertilisation can also be managed to avoid
    saline concentration in the humid bulb. The equipment has a tank for taking samples
    to sporadically test irrigation water, drained water, and even soil and plant
    material in order to know and correct the nutrient balance [16]. After checking
    the weighing system by analysing a set of five transmitters that poured onto the
    lysimeter at a theoretical flow of 3.00 L·h−1, according to Table 7, we confirmed
    that the equipment recorded this pluviometry value for each transmitter at a mean
    rate of 3.01 L·h−1. To confirm that the measurement was correct, a manual test
    was performed, which, according to Table 8, gave a flow of 2.88 L·h−1. We should
    bear in mind that the accuracy of the measurements in terms of time and obtained
    volume was much lower in this manual test than for the data provided by the weighing
    lysimeter. So, the sampling time was prolonged to minimise the time measurement
    error and, thus, to increase the obtained volume to minimise mistakes in the measurements.
    Nonetheless, this lower precision may have led to the observed differences; thus,
    the weighing system is believed to operate suitably. On the other hand, the values
    of the Kc coefficient lysimeter in the broccoli test using the standard weighing
    lysimeter were compared with the theoretical Kc obtained for this crop with a
    weighing lysimeter in the studies of Rubino et al. [43] and Villalobos-Reyes et
    al. [44]. In general, the values obtained in our validation are similar to the
    values of these studies, which allows us to confirm that the measurements of the
    standard weighing lysimeter are valid for the main function for which it was designed,
    which is the control of the water balance of vegetable and herbaceous crops. The
    obtained results were also compared with the FAO-56 data [45], which show that
    the cultivation cycle proposed for broccoli (Table 11 of FAO-56 for these specific
    conditions) is 135 days. The cultivation cycle of the test carried out in this
    study was 82 days, so the cultivation stages proposed by FAO-56 were reduced proportionally.
    The Kc coefficients proposed by FAO-56 (Table 12 of FAO-56) were used, and they
    are similar to those obtained with the other two methods, which are reflected
    in Table 6 of FAO-56. These results can also confirm the validity of the measurements
    provided for the standard weighing lysimeter. In any case, in order to automate
    irrigation operations, it is more useful to derive the lysimeter data directly
    in litres per plant so that irrigation scheduling can be directly adjusted according
    to the real-time water use determinations without the need for separately computing
    the reference evapotranspiration. 5. Conclusions A weighing lysimeter that is
    supported by information and communication technologies can be an effective tool
    for achieving efficient water and nutrient management. The dimensions of the CT
    of the portable weighing lysimeter developed by the Agromotic Engineering and
    Sea Research Group (Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, Spain) allow it to be
    used for the monitoring of practically all vegetable crops and, by extension,
    herbaceous crops, as it adapts to a wide range of production and mechanisation
    systems. The possibilities of manufacturing it with different resolutions at the
    same cost allow adaptations to be made to lysimetry stations for research (0.09
    mm resolution with 300 kg load cells) or to commercial lysimetry stations (0.15
    mm resolution with 500 kg load cells). The possibility of quantifying and qualifying
    deep percolation drainage—and even of taking deep percolation drainage samples—allows
    accurate management of not only crop irrigation, but also crop fertilisation.
    After analysing the CT’s weighing system, its performance was found to be suitable,
    and its results corresponded to reality. Therefore, this portable weighing lysimeter
    is suitable for accurately measuring the use of water and nutrients in crops.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Jeju Island, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction
    The amount of electronic devices connected to the Internet worldwide has been
    growing tremendously in recent years. Gatner [1] predicted that by 2020, there
    will be approximately 5.8 billion of IoT devices, with 21.5% increase from 2019.
    The proliferation of IoT has seen an increased in precision agriculture application.
    One of the main characteristics of precision agriculture is machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communications between multiple devices such as sensors, robots and drones
    and IoT gateway. These devices are usually installed in isolated area with limited
    Internet connectivity. In such environment, packet loss rate will be high, making
    it a challenge for massive deployment. One of the aspects that deciding the M2M
    communication performance is the application layer protocol, that required to
    be customized for M2M communications within constrained IoT related applications.
    It is always a daunting and challenging task for any organization to decide on
    a standard and effective messaging protocol. Unlike the Web which can works by
    using a single standard HTTP protocol, each IoT applications have distinct requirements.
    No protocol that can satisfy all of these requirements [2]. As a consequences,
    various messaging protocols are introduced for developers to select for satisfying
    different types of requirements in IoT system. AMQP [3] was introduced as a corporate
    messaging protocol that designed for security, reliability, interoperability and
    provisioning [4]. AMQP provides flow control with quality of services (QoS). In
    AMQP, either the publisher or subscriber creates an “exchange” with a given name.
    Subsequently, the name is being broadcast. Publishers and subscribers are then
    use the given name to find each other. Next, a consumer is then create a queue
    and subsequently attaches the queue to the “exchange” simultaneously. Messages
    collected by the exchange is bind to the queue. AMQP is a connection-oriented
    protocol which runs on TCP as its transport protocol and TLS/SSL and SASL for
    security [5]. AMQP is lightweight with 8-bytes fixed header with no limit for
    the size of the message [6]. CoAP [7] was introduced by IETE CoRE (Constrained
    RESTful Environments) Working Group based on Representational State Transfer (REST)
    architecture to provide low power, low overhead interface in constrained network.
    CoAP supports request-response and publish-subscribe model using Universal Resource
    Identifier (URI) to send data from publisher to subscriber. When there is a publisher
    publishes a new data to the URI, all the subscribers will be notified about the
    new value as indicated by the URI. CoAP is a connectionless protocol that uses
    UDP as its transport protocol and DTLS for security [8]. CoAP supports content
    negotiation to express a preferred representation of a resource. This will isolate
    client with the server, so that they can evolve independently without affecting
    one another. MQTT [9] is a publish/subscribe based M2M messaging protocol that
    is used on top of the TCP/IP protocol stack. It was designed as a lightweight
    broker-based protocol with small packet size, low bandwidth and high latency connection.
    In MQTT, a message is published by a publisher into a channel, which is known
    as a ‘topic’. Whoever interested to a particular topic can subscribe to it. All
    subscribers subscribed to a topic will receive every messages that have been published
    to that topic. A centralised broker server handles the communication between publishers
    and subscribers and distributes messages between them. The centralised broker
    collects all the topics and handles all the message forwarding between publishers
    and subscribers. However, such centralised protocol suffers from poor scalability
    problem [10]. In addition, they hardly have any locality-awareness because the
    centralised broker needs to manage all the subscribers, and the location of this
    centralised broker cannot be changed [11]. In order to enhance the scalability
    of publish/subscribe messaging, there are various approaches with no centralised
    broker have been proposed. Several middlewares have been proposed to address the
    interoperability of IoT protocols. The common design patterns used in these protocols
    are service oriented, publish/subscribe oriented, software defined network-based
    and virtual machine based design. Cheng [12] proposed a lightweight IoT service
    mashup middleware based on REST-style architecture for IoT applications. The design
    comprises six components that connected in a pipeline to provision the IoT services.
    These components are namely physical sensor layer, uniform resource access framework
    layer, uniform message space layer, service mashup layer, open service interface
    layer and applications layer. The proposed middleware is able to dynamically manage
    the physical sensory devices and its corresponding protocols. In addition, a distributed
    publish/subscribe-based messages distribution service was shown to provide better
    response time with an increase of concurrent instances. Although it provides a
    way to create applications for IoT, it does not support data analytics [13], an
    important features required for precision agriculture. In addition, it does not
    address the communication protocols in the application layer for video streaming
    [14], which can be used to understand the growth rate of the crops. SECTION II.
    Related Work Application layer plays an important roles to provide services and
    ensures there is an effective communication between application programs within
    a network. Thus, the process of selecting an appropriate application layer protocol
    is a prerequisite to understand a specific IoT application based on its data-sharing
    demands. Traditionally, most of the web applications depends on HTTP. However,
    IoT applications cannot depend on a single protocol to meet all its use case’s
    requisites. In the past, many emerging protocols have been made available to developers
    which varies due to different needs of the IoT-based applications. Middlewares
    that allow integration of loosely coupled distribution systems with advanced message
    oriented approach have been proposed to provide versatility and modularity to
    IoT applications. Impala [15] implemented non virtual machine based middleware
    that allows functionality of application to be adaptable easily. It handles requests
    and responses asynchronously. Milan [16] filled in the gap in providing management
    tools required by different network applications. The middleware allows applications
    to specify the policy to manage and adjust the network characteristics. PRISMA
    [17] is proposed to address the needs of programminng abstraction through the
    use of RESTful APIs and QoS mechanisms to meet applications constraints. By providing
    an open RESTful APT for data access, PRISMA supports interoperability of the heterogeneous
    devices based on network technologies. In order to cope with the dynamic execution
    of IoT domain, PRISMA uses publish/subscribe paradigm to implement the asynchronous
    communication between devices. Although many protocols and middleware have been
    proposed in the past to ensure effective communication in IoT environment, most
    of the proposed work are not specific to precision agriculture. As such Farmbeats
    [18], an IoT platform for data-driven precision agriculture was developed. The
    platform was developed to collect data from various sensors and ensure that the
    system is available even during power outages. It was then transition to cloud
    platform built on top of Azure. Although the platforms offer web-based environments
    for precision agriculture, users need to subscribe to Azure cloud. In order to
    satisfy the protocol requirements, system designer should be taking accounts of
    the devices (which can be ranged from the resource-constrained IoT edge-nodes
    to the resourceful clouds), the data (which can be produced either at the IoT
    edge, fog, or cloud layers), and the communication architecture of the system.
    SECTION III. Lightweight Messaging Middleware (Lmm) In precision agriculture,
    it is important to couple IoT sensors for nutrient monitoring with image processing
    for disease and growth analysis. Thus, the system should be have the capability
    in supporting devices such as robots, sensors and cameras as shown in Fig. 1.
    Nevertheless, most of the proposed protocols are meant for IoT sensors only. The
    proposed lightweight messaging middleware (LMM) is designed so that the end nodes
    can be used to capture both images and sensor date in IoT gateway and send them
    to server for postprocessing. The main features of LMM are: Interconnections between
    connection-oriented and connectionless services and data streams. Provides authentication
    of data source and confidentiality of data. Small data overhead and ability to
    support multiple application layer protocols Able to deployed in large precision
    agriculture system. To integrate these features, LMM interconnect two (2) application
    layer protocols namely CoAP is used to stream video images to analyse growth rate
    and MQTT, which is used for sensor data as shown in Fig. 2. The reason CoAP is
    used to stream video images is because it is lightweight protocol stack. Besides,
    CoAP also conserves energy and save bandwidth. CoAP that relies on UDP as its
    transport protocol, which neither provides guarantee for message delivery nor
    congestion control mechanism is suitable for precision agriculture. Unlike IoT
    sensors that capture small size data, IoT camera produces a huge capacity of data
    packets before it can be process the image for disease detection or growth rate
    analysis. The streaming of video/image feed is time consuming as the transmission
    of many data packets, which is also consuming high bandwidth. Although the video/image
    compression techniques implemented has significantly reduced the required bandwidth,
    the MTU size and data rate is still high as compared to IoT sensor. As such IoT
    camera will require UDP whereas sensor will use publish/subscribe architecture
    with minimal bandwidth requirements, message data overhead and power consumption.
    MQTT is used as application layer protocol for IoT sensor because it has lower
    delay than CoAP messages at lower packet loss rate and the message size is very
    small. LMM will published messages to the broker via an address known as ‘topic’.
    The client that resides in server will then receive the published messages by
    subscribing to that topic. Fig. 1. Overview of precision agriculture system Show
    All Fig. 2. Lightweight Messaging Middleware (LMM) Show All LMM contains common
    API calls to support publish-subscribe model for MQTT and CoAP namely Connect(),
    ConnectAck(), publishMessage() and PublishAck. Connect() and ConnectAck() is used
    by LMM to request connection between IoT gateway and cloud server or broker. The
    connection will determine whether the IoT gateway has adequate access rights to
    publish messages over that specific topic to the server/broker. Connect() API
    call contains destination and secretkey as arguments. No additional information
    is added to simplify the connection authentication process so that the traffic
    overhead is small. The destination varies, depending on whether it is CoAP or
    MQTT message. Through Connect() and ConnectAck() API call, the precision agriculture
    system can ensure authentication of data source and confidentiality of data. publishMessage()
    API call contains arguments such as topic, destination and message. When LMM received
    sensor data from precision agriculture system, it will published the topic through
    the broker, which is the destination IP address. Similarly, LMM will published
    the topic through URI when LMM received video/image data from the system. PublishAck()
    contains acknowledgement message sent from server to client as shown in Fig. 3.
    Fig. 3. LMM sequence diagram Show All There are three (3) parts in LMM, publish/subscribe
    interface, middleware database and application functions. The publish/subscribe
    interface handles the incoming data, the topic it subscribed, published, cancelled
    or registered. Information such as message sets, that contains latest message
    related to the topics and topic subscription table are stored in middleware database.
    Each item in topic subscription table contains topic, destination and message.
    The data collected by middleware database is then processed by application functions
    to match the traffic type and route it accordingly. LMM will perform the route
    messages from sensor/camera to relevant API calls. In order to maintain the data
    distribution consistency, the application function will synchronize the information
    based on the message routing policy. Fig. 4 illustrates the LMM architecture.
    Fig. 4. LMM architecture Show All SECTION IV. Use Case: Precision Agriculture
    System LMM is built on Raspberry Pi 4 using node.js framework that are event-driven,
    allowing it to support high concurrency. The proof of concept (POC) is conducted
    on precision agriculture system that collects pH, temperature, electrical conductivity
    (EC), total dissolved solution (TDS) and camera images. Sensor/camera nodes will
    send/publish sensor data to LMM and LMM will aggregate these information before
    sending it to cloud services. Fig. 5 illustrates the proof of concept (POC) of
    the middleware in precision agriculture system. The web server subscribes to the
    camera feed using CoAP and sensor data using MQTT. Fig 6 shows the print out logs
    of the script running in Raspberry Pi. Fig. 5. Use case of LMM in precision agriculture
    system Show All Fig. 6. LMM PM2 logs Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper,
    a middleware for precision agriculture system is proposed to support multi-protocol
    implementation needed in the system. The integration of MQTT and CoAP as application
    layer protocol in the middleware support detailed analysis of impact of environment
    versus growth of the crops. As future work, the performance of LMM will be evaluated.

  description: Yield prediction is the primary process of predicting the plant’s growth.
    It can be determined by different parameters such as temperature/humidity, soil
    mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level, climatic conditions, moisture
    of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the optimum level to make a desirable
    environment to sustain productivity. Failure to provide the required condition
    from any of the parameters will lead the plant to stress and deteriorate, potentially
    leading to a loss in productivity. Laborious ways of monitoring the agricultural
    parameters are inefficient and time-consuming. An automated irrigation system
    is essential for the proper growth of crops. Excessive watering of crops and crop
    water dehydration can lead to stresses that affect the growth of plants. Supplying
    an optimum amount of water is essential for the healthy development of plants.
    The IoT and artificial intelligence technologies are the most viable alternative
    solution for traditional yield prediction and irrigation because of the remote
    accessibility, interoperability, cognitive capability, etc. These technologies
    aid the farmers in monitoring agricultural parameters remotely from embedded devices,

    Big Data ((SBD,volume 99)) Abstract Yield prediction is the primary process of
    predicting the plant’s growth. It can be determined by different parameters such
    as temperature/humidity, soil mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level,
    climatic conditions, moisture of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the
    optimum level to make a desirable environment to sustain productivity. Failure
    to provide the required condition from any of the parameters will lead the plant
    to stress and deteriorate, potentially leading to a loss in productivity. Laborious
    ways of monitoring the agricultural parameters are inefficient and time-consuming.
    An automated irrigation system is essential for the proper growth of crops. Excessive
    watering of crops and crop water dehydration can lead to stresses that affect
    the growth of plants. Supplying an optimum amount of water is essential for the
    healthy development of plants. The IoT and artificial intelligence technologies
    are the most viable alternative solution for traditional yield prediction and
    irrigation because of the remote accessibility, interoperability, cognitive capability,
    etc. These technologies aid the farmers in monitoring agricultural parameters
    remotely from embedded devices, drastically reducing human efforts. It makes farming
    much efficient and a smarter farming experience and also increases crop productivity

    PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture is the fundamental need for every human race that
    fulfills our basic requirements. It is the country’s economy setter that provides
    occupation for the farmers and workers. Every year, the population has increased
    in every country, which in turn increases the food demands. However, crop yields
    and production growth are not going par with the food demands for several factors.
    The increase in the population encourages deforestation for urbanization and city
    establishment due to land settlement. Deforestation is the primary cause of climate
    change, including human activities such as the emission of industrial gases, excessive
    carbon-oxide emission, dumping chemical wastes, etc. It, in turn, causes contamination
    to water and the air. It also increases the concentration of greenhouse gases
    and aerosols. These activities have a substantial negative impact on the vegetation
    and farming that hinders the growth of the yields and productivity. Because of
    these consequences, plants suffer from different stresses like heat stress, drought
    stress, mineral stress, chill stress, etc. Farmers are facing a massive problem
    in yielding enough crops for supplying human demands because of the environmental-driven
    stresses on the plants. Because of these problems, crop productivity is not getting
    improved over the years, instead, it is getting deteriorating gradually. Moreover,
    the environment has been consistently changing, and it could be worse in the future
    due to the continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Due to the inevitable
    climate change, it is crucial to sustain the increasing agricultural demands for
    the survival of the human race. Apparently, the laborious form of farming will
    no longer support the growing agricultural demands in the near future as it requires
    effort and is time-consuming. Moreover, due to the inconsistency of human force,
    it could drastically reduce the accuracy of the farming management system. Because
    of these challenges, it is crucial to introduce the technologies in the agricultural
    domain to elevate the farming management systems and sustain the increasing food
    demands despite climate change. The IoT technology is an emerging technology that
    has set foot on several domains and applications, including the agricultural domain.
    With the advancement of IoT technology, farmers can monitor and control all kinds
    of parameters remotely on the field in real-time. It allows the farmers to evaluate
    and predict the growth of the crop, which will significantly aid in the increase
    of crop productivity. Moreover, the IoT technology promotes interconnectivity
    and interoperability, allowing farmers from different places across the globe
    to share farming experiences to improve farming management systems. Along with
    the emergence of IoT technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also paved its
    path in this technological era. AI technology has practically transform manual
    systems into automated systems in which human intervention is dramatically reduced.
    There is a huge scope in incorporating the IoT and AI technologies, especially
    in the agricultural domain, for transforming traditional farming into automated
    farming to promote precision agriculture. 2 Literature Survey The estimation of
    crop yields before the harvest is challenging due to the continuous change in
    the climatic regime. Nowadays, the season has slightly shifted its pattern, making
    it difficult for farmers and agronomists to predict the upcoming agricultural
    yield. Since weather influences the plants’ growth, the farmers need to be resilient
    with the help of technologies to improve the quality of farming. Technological
    advancement helps solve current problems, such as weather prediction, water content
    monitoring, disease prediction, and precision irrigation systems. Machine learning
    is widely used in various application areas for solving nonlinear problems. It
    also would be an excellent tool for predicting crop yields, which would highly
    aid in farming. Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines are the algorithms
    commonly used in prediction and classification [2]. One of the primary concerns
    in agricultural farming is water scarcity. The continuous use of fertilizers has
    a significant impact on groundwater contamination, which affects the growth of
    crops and could be hazardous for human consumption. Water has been extensively
    wasted in farming, whopping 60% of the water used in agriculture into waterways
    and over-watering the crops. Water can be preserved by supplying an adequate amount
    of water at the right time and avoiding evapotranspiration. The advancement in
    technology, IoT sensors, and AI technology can monitor the water content, pH level,
    mineral content, and atmospheric temperature. These technologies provide better
    control for the farmers in watering the crops, predicting the weather, and giving
    adequate minerals for healthy plants’ growth [3]. The systematic irrigation system
    aids in watering plants with an optimum water content which provides crops and
    fibers a desirable condition for their proper growth. Global warming has affected
    the regime of precipitation and water sources. Since water is the vital source
    of growth in crops, it is essential to preserve water and utilize them smartly
    to promote a precision irrigation system. Pests and diseases also have significant
    impacts on crop yield. Early detection of water deficiency, stress, and invasion
    of pests could probably prevent the crops from being lesioned or deteriorating
    growth. An IoT system helps optimize the amount of water used and sends information
    to the edge node to process the data locally when the internet connection is limited
    [4]. The artificial neural network (ANN) and a multi regression model are the
    models to evaluate and estimate the seed yield of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.)
    using field data. The data includes the flowering time, the height of the plant,
    the capsule number per plant, the weight of the plant, and the number of seeds
    per capsule. It shows that artificial neural network performs much accurately
    in predicting the sources yield of sesame than the multi regression model [5].
    An experiment was conducted in Shahrood, Semnan province, Iran, to predict pepper
    fruit yields. An artificial neural network has been implemented to monitor the
    pepper fruit yield response by considering different parameters such as the growth
    of the pepper fruit seeds from initial stages to the harvest stage, the height
    of the plant, canopy width, number of fruit bears per plant, fruit water content,
    and reproduction stage duration. It has achieved 97% accuracy in predicting the
    growth of the seeds [6]. 3 Environment Impact on Agriculture Agriculture depends
    on the environmental condition associated with the biological cycle inside the
    ecosystem, just as any other living organism. According to the seasons, farmers
    and agronomists plan their farming and yielding strategies for the whole year.
    Biologically, every plant species have their traits and growing pattern in different
    seasons. Due to the significant variances in their characteristics, sustaining
    the food products for the whole year is challenging for the farmers. However,
    this farming system has also been threatened by the rapid growth of urbanization
    across the globe. Although the urban land provides development and sophistication
    to the human lifestyle, there are several adverse effects on Biodiversity. Urbanization
    is a primary cause of native species extinction, such as birds, wild animals,
    etc. Moreover, it is associated with deforestation, which reduces the tremendous
    amount of trees every year for the urban land. This human activity has led to
    an imbalance of the biological life cycle. The overwhelming growth of the population
    is changing the earth system’s biogeochemical cycles, pushing the nutrients and
    compounds out of balance with the usual climatic and biological feedback mechanisms.
    These imbalances contribute to ocean acidification, climate change, marine dead
    zones, and many other environmental problems. Urbanization is likely to widen
    its path even more to procure a sufficient amount of urban land for the people.
    Since the food demand has been increasing daily, the farmers and agronomists insist
    on using fertilizers and pesticides, which is the chemical composition to enhance
    soil fertility and significantly increase yield production to meet the increasing
    demands [7]. This process of sustaining yield production is not ideal since it
    possibly degrades soil fertility and affects the consumers because of the chemical
    components. Some of the environmental impact on agriculture are: Water pollution—Water
    is one of the vital sources of life for all living organisms. Water quality has
    been degraded gradually because of many factors such as urbanization, pollution,
    sanitation, and chemical outlets [8]. Dumping wastes and chemicals by industries,
    hospitals, water treatment systems, construction, laboratories, and poor sanitation
    systems leads to empoisoning the water on the river and any other water sources
    that can harm animals, people, and plants. The practice of using fertilizers and
    pesticides in agricultural fields is also a major pollutant of water sources.
    The chemicals in these fertilizers could be hazardous for humans and cause several
    diseases. Air pollution—Urbanization has brought economic prosperity to society
    and made us stay connected with people across the globe. It promotes accessibility
    and also provides portability. However, despite the advantages, there is a trade-off
    between urbanization and environmental sustainability. One of the primary reasons
    is deforestation that leads to global warming. The cutting of trees for urban
    land created an imbalance in the ecosystem and has dramatically changed the climate
    over time which causes the greenhouse effect. Among several sectors, agriculture
    is one of the most affected by climate change. The crop yields and harvest have
    become an enormous challenge for the farmers since the climatic cycle has also
    gradually changed. The atmospheric temperature has become extreme in summer, and
    winter temperatures have reached beyond the optimum level. Because of these consequences,
    the crops are stressing by heat, chilled, and humidity stress which falls beyond
    the optimum temperature. Agriculture is highly dependent on climate and the environment.
    The anticipation of feeding 9 billion people by the year 2050 would be an enormous
    challenge. 4 Scope of AI in Agriculture The current food production is insufficient
    to supply the requirements of food demands primarily because of the increasing
    population. The traditional farming practices could be limited and cannot sustain
    the supply of increasing food demand due to a lack of efficiency and cost. Nonetheless,
    machines and technologies perform a task much faster and accurately than a human
    force. Moreover, farmers and agronomists face a huge challenge in predicting the
    season as seasonal shifts affect the timing of many life cycle events due to global
    warming. The temperature of the summer has become higher, which potentially leads
    to thermal stress in plants, and monsoon rain is comparatively irregular nowadays.
    Monsoon water is the primary source of water for crop growth. Since agriculture
    is entirely dependent on the weather and rainwater, the weather and inconsistent
    routine of the monsoon could disrupt the farming procedure, which reduces food
    production. The advancement in technology over the years gradually steps into
    the agriculture domain that improves the farming system. Nowadays, technological
    devices can monitor plant health, pests/diseases, mineral contents and deploy
    automatic watering systems. The incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and AI have drastically improved the traditional practices of farming. It increases
    efficiency, productivity and reduces human intervention. IoT is the interconnection
    of several devices across the globe. It enables electronic devices such as agricultural
    devices and sensors to connect with the farmers through smartphones or tablets
    that allow the farmer to have complete control over the dedicated agricultural
    sensors and actuators and retrieve information about several parameters from the
    farming fields. Moreover, farming can be operated automatically by the machines
    as per instruction given by the agronomist or the farmers. Some of the examples
    are traditional drip irrigation, automatic water sprinkler, disease detection,
    etc. Artificial intelligence has paved a path toward several domains over the
    years, including agriculture. Since the global population grows extensively every
    year, food security has to go on par with the growth of the population to meet
    the need for livelihood. However, it cannot maintain the quantity and quality
    of crop yields because of environmental change, an increase in demands, lack of
    management, global warming, etc. Due to these circumstances, there are losses
    in productivity each year. Moreover, it also made the plants incur several stresses
    such as heat stress, water stress, mineral stress, salt stress, chill stress,
    etc., that hinder the growth of plants. Experts have anticipated that the environmental
    problem will probably worsen because of human activities, deforestation, and globalization,
    which will have a huge negative impact on the vegetation, which threatened food
    security. AI is widely adopted in the agricultural parameters to solve problems
    and optimize the production and operation processes in agriculture, food, and
    bio-system engineering. It is designed to mimic human intelligence to work on
    an appliance capable of differentiating and classifying variables. Some of the
    applications of artificial intelligence in agricultural parameters are: Plant
    Disease Prediction—Plants are exposed and vulnerable to pests and pathogens such
    as viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc. Plant pathogen has caused tremendous productivity
    loss globally every year [9]. In the olden days, farmers manually investigate
    plants individually to verify whether they got infected by any pathogens. The
    process became tedious, inaccurate, and time-consuming for a farmer to do it mechanically.
    Since the population of the plant pathogen are variable in time, space and genotype,
    it is difficult for the farmers to predict and control. Early detection of plant
    pathogen is essential to reduce the spread of disease and facilitates prior management
    practices. To improve the prediction of pathogens, DNA-based and serological methods
    had revolutionized plant disease prediction that facilitates essential apparatus
    for accurate and efficient disease prediction. However, DNA-based and serological
    techniques are not reliable for the early asymptomatic stages [10]. Over the past
    few decades, artificial intelligence helps with the automatic detection of pathogens
    in a much faster and precise manner. In theory, the systems contain datasets that
    include images of diseased and healthy images, and it is trained to classify the
    types of images. The device will then learn to classify the leaf images and be
    able to distinguish between the healthy and affected leaf images. The process
    of AI-based disease detection model can perform the operation at high speed with
    a higher accuracy rate that can detect diseases even on the asymptomatic stages.
    Livestock Monitoring—Animals are one of the sources of food provider for human
    consumption, where they provide meats, milk, eggs, etc. So, it is necessary to
    keep livestock animals healthy and maintain a hygienic environment for quality
    and healthy food production. Animals may be susceptible to diseases primarily
    because of their food habits. Early detection of animal diseases is mandatory
    to reduce the spread as they are highly contagious, and they could indirectly
    threaten human life. A farmer needs to monitor and understand the animal’s behavior,
    gesture, distress, and disease control to better nurture experience and better
    decisions [11]. However, it could be laborious for a farmer to monitor each animal
    to check whether they are in a good health state, especially in large-scale livestock.
    Fortunately, AI-based livestock monitoring can be promising in animal husbandry
    to monitor animals’ behavioral aspects individually, which helps them recognize
    facial features and hide patterns with the help of the Image processing technique.
    The AI-based monitoring system works around the clock in real-time. It better
    comprehends the multiple animals’ gestures and behavior much efficiently. Smart
    Irrigation—Water is a vital part of farming, and it is essential to make sure
    crops get enough water to have proper growth. The agriculture sector is most affected
    by water scarcity consuming a whopping 80% of the total water use [12]. So, it
    is crucial to preserve water and reuse it as much as possible to avoid water scarcity.
    The technological modernization brought devices to promote these water preservation
    models in which devices such as water sprinklers and drip irrigation systems are
    commonly used. These devices assist in saving a reasonable amount of water and
    even saves time for farmers. However, the mechanical devices require a partial
    human intervention to handle the machine, so there are challenges and room for
    improvement to transform farming to be completely automatic [13]. AI-based Smart
    Irrigation System is the way to move forward for more intelligent and efficient
    agriculture, which is environmentally friendly. Weather/Temperature Forecasting—Agriculture
    is highly dependent on the climate and the weather variability that could potentially
    influence productivity and food security [14]. Forecasting weather for several
    months ahead could help the farmer to anticipate and prepare for the process accordingly
    without wasting time and resources. The weather regime has changed its pattern
    because of several factors and no longer follows the regular trend. The weather
    pattern and atmosphere are highly nonlinear, which makes it difficult to predict
    and anticipate. AI-based prediction is known to be the most feasible solution
    to solve these types of nonlinear data problems [15]. Soil Health and Mineral
    Management—The fundamental factor for agricultural production sustainability relies
    on soil quality conservation [16]. Soil has contained several minerals that are
    nutritious and non-nutritious for the crops. Good soil management will help the
    farmers to ensure that the soil content does not incur mineral deficiency and
    contain harmful particles for the plants, which can indirectly intoxicate humans
    during consumption. Because of human activities and soil erosions, the soil has
    become contaminated and degraded, potentially harmful for human consumption. Despite
    the soil degradation, the sustenance of the productivity with nutritional products
    for our healthy diets, monitoring the soil health and mineral with sophisticated
    technologies like AI and IoT is essential to make it environmentally friendly,
    efficient, less-laborious, and cost-effective. The use of these technologies is
    the most feasible way to sustain productivity with healthy products without further
    intoxicating the soil. Plants Stress Monitoring—Climate change has a substantial
    adverse impact on the daily temperature by altering the precipitation’s intensification
    [17]. Because of these consequences, the plant tends to have several environmental
    stresses like heat stress, chill stress, salt stress, and mineral stress. Plants
    typically have severe inner damage when it develops visible symptoms due to the
    several environmental stresses [18]. Early detection of environmental stresses
    at the asymptomatic stages could save the plants from deterioration and complete
    leaf damage. The IoT and AI technology have been considered the primary viable
    solution to solve these problems and challenges. Image processing has become a
    powerful tool for monitoring and object detection, detecting plant stresses at
    a very early stage. It is a non-invasive form of technology and also environmentally
    friendly. Yield Prediction—Crop yield prediction is essential for sustaining food
    production. Depending on the prediction of the yields, it provides information
    about the feasibility of growing crops within a specified timespan. Since agriculture
    is the economy setter of the country, policymakers rely on the yield prediction
    that will highly impact the import and export of the country [19]. It also provides
    essential information for the farmers and agronomists to decide on the farming,
    harvestation, and management strategies. However, yield prediction is highly challenging
    as multiple factors and parameters are considered for the evaluation. AI technology
    is deemed to be the most powerful tool for plant stress prediction. It has been
    demonstrated in several articles [20,21,22]. Supply Chain Management—One of the
    most important things for the farmer is selling their end products. Without a
    proper middle man or a reseller, farmers could face a hard time dealing with the
    products and selling them into the market. Supply chain management involves location
    planning, purchasing, inventory management, routing/scheduling problems, and freight
    consolidation [23]. This process could be tedious and time-consuming for the farmer
    to do it manually. Artificial intelligence is powerful in evaluating the data
    and the correlation of different nodes on the supply chain. 5 Yield Prediction
    Crop yield prediction is essential for the farmers to know the reason behind the
    farming strategies and management. Prediction of yield could be a huge challenge
    as there are multiple parameters such as temperature, pesticides, rainfall, fertilizers,
    humidity, ph level, and other atmospheric conditions to predict crop yields. In
    the past, farmers observe and learn manually from their experiences during their
    farming days [24]. Apparently, they could sustain their products with their observation
    and occasions for quite a long time in the past. However, gradual climatic changes
    make it challenging to predict the timely seasonal crop yields. With the inconsistency
    and volatility of the current climatic conditions, the prediction of crop yields
    could be miserable with the traditional techniques. To mitigate these problems,
    sensor technology and artificial intelligence are rapidly emerging in the agricultural
    sector. Artificial intelligence is one of the most powerful tools for modeling
    and prediction. Datasets play a significant role in AI models. For many farmers,
    it might be challenging to adopt the technology into the agricultural land as
    it required knowledge for bridging the gap between agriculture and technology.
    So, awareness and workshops must be made mandatory for the farmers to promote
    farming practices and promote precision agriculture. Crop yield prediction comprises
    several parameters in which any one of these could not be less emphasized because
    they help to thrive the growth of the crops collectively. Some of the main parameters
    that are to emphasize for precision agriculture are: Temperature—The farmers must
    maintain the temperature of the growing environment to sustain crop growth. Because
    of the climatic regime variability, the temperature is becoming extreme, causing
    crops prone to encounter heat or chilling stress. So, controlling the temperature
    to the optimum level would sustain the growth of the plants. Minerals/Soil Health—Soil
    is the primary source of nutrients and minerals for the life of the crops. Smart
    soil management would drastically aid the farmer in ensuring healthy soil and
    non-toxicity for the plants’ growth [25]. Additionally, soil in a particular area
    might not necessarily have required minerals for the specific plants since the
    plants are variable in traits, characteristics, and morphologically different
    from one another. These parameters will allow a farmer to emphasize and treat
    particular plants according to the mineral and vitamin requirements. Humidity—There
    is a high correlation between humidity and temperature. Humidity is essential,
    just as the temperature, which impacts the growth of the plants. Some particular
    plants thrive in a specific area with higher humidity, where some plants have
    difficulties sprouting. Depending on the plants’ requirement, controlling the
    intensity of the humidity would help the farmers to grow desire particular plant
    species pretty much anywhere regardless of the suitability of the area of land.
    Water Intensity—Water is one of the vital sources of livelihood for the plants.
    The precipitation pattern is gradually changing because of climate change that
    affects water availability, which eventually causes drought in many arid and semi-arid
    areas and a lack of water sources for agriculture [26]. Sustenance of water for
    agriculture solely implies not wasting water simultaneously, supplying an adequate
    water source for the plants. Pests Control—Pests, weeds, and pathogens are the
    types of harmful organisms that have invaded crops in the field, causing significant
    losses in food production every year [27]. Early detection helps protect and prevent
    the deterioration of the plants attacked by several types of pests and diseases.
    Since it is variable in time, space, and genotype, it is a challenge for farmers
    to predict and respond whenever the invasion occurs. 6 Machine Learning-Based
    Yield Prediction Machine learning is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence inspired
    by the human intellect to solve real-world problems [28]. It is a process of training
    a system to make a decision depending on the circumstances and solve complex problems
    without human intervention. Unlike traditional programming, machine learning works
    with data from which it learns and provides relevant output. IoT and machine learning
    have been adopted in technology, science, and commerce streams such as banking,
    medical, traffic, autonomous vehicle, defense, agriculture, etc. [29]. Because
    of the vulnerability of agricultural productivity, machine learning has gradually
    emerged in the farming sector for sustainable food production. Precision Agriculture
    (PA) combines technologies, management strategies, and farming practices to solve
    agricultural problems [30]. With the help of sensor and IoT technology, wide ranges
    of data are generated from sensors such as temperature and humidity sensors, electrochemical
    sensors, soil moisture sensors, mechanical sensors, weather sensors, smart cameras,
    etc. Moreover, it also provides interoperability and the capability of controlling
    various devices remotely over the network. These sensors technologies can collect
    data from the sensors, such as soil condition and mineral content, temperature
    and humidity, visual representation, etc. Researchers are concentrating on improving
    the current farming strategies and techniques using machine learning and deep
    learning techniques. 6.1 Soil Health and Mineral Content The soil contains different
    mineral contents, pH levels, and salinity depending upon the geographical location.
    Due to this, some particular plants could grow in specific places. In order to
    make plants thrive despite the geographical location, the required minerals and
    vitamins must be provided to the plant in an adequate amount. Soil testing is
    the key to determine the soil contents and the availability of the required nutrients,
    which helps the farmer to evaluate the amount of nutrients needed for the specific
    plants. Suchithra et al. [31] presented an article in which the soil test results
    have been used to classify several significant soil features such as Phosphorus
    (P), Potassium (K), Boron (B), Organic carbon (OC), and Soil Reaction (pH). The
    classification and prediction of these minerals would help in reducing the fertilizers
    expenses, increase productivity, improve soil health, and environmental quality.
    Moreover, it will also reduce the expenditure and time for the experts to analyze
    the soil. Extreme learning machine is implemented for the classification of the
    soil parameters. Several activation functions such as sine-squared, Gaussian radial
    basis, hyperbolic tangent, triangular basis, and hard limit were tested; the Gaussian
    radial basis acquired the highest accuracy of 80%, and hyperbolic tangent attained
    the highest in the pH classification with the precision of 90%. Extreme learning
    machine is the feedforward neural network that uses Moore—Penrose generalized
    inverse instead of gradient-descent-based backpropagation. Soil salinity is one
    of the most common causes of soil degradation [32, 33]. It can degrade soil fertility
    and cause soil erosion which affects vegetation and decrease food productivity.
    Since water is attracted to salt and when the intensity of salt content is high
    in the soil, it can absorb the water and possibly cause dehydration for the plants.
    Habibi et al. [34] presented a detection of soil salinity using machine learning
    and hyperspectral data in Sharifabad-Saveh Plain, Iran. A 93 soil samples were
    collected with the electrical conductivity, which measures with the hypercube
    technique. The sample was taken from different geographical areas, and satellite
    images from Landsat 8 were taken at different parameters such as TWI, TCI, STP,
    DEM, and LS. Figure 1 illustrates how the intensity of saltiness of the soil with
    the electrical conductivity salinity sensor probe is connected to a micro-controller.
    Use ANN, neural network, genetic algorithm, ANN-GA, PSLR, and decision tree and
    compare these algorithms on the data generated for the model’s prediction. The
    datasets are split into 70% for training sets and 30% for validation sets. ANN-GA
    has the highest accuracy prediction rate compared to other algorithms and concludes
    that it shows two dS/m EC at alfalfa and cucurbits farmlands. In contrast, pistachio
    orchards have low salinity, and bare lands have moderate and high salinity. A
    pH value is a measure of water and soil acidity. Fig. 1 Detection of salinity

    soil is crucial for prepping for the crop plantation to ensure the soil is not
    acidic, i.e., pH level. Shabbir et al. [28] presented a classification model of
    pH value, alkalinity, and basicity using 40 soil images. These colored images
    were then classified using MLP, Naïve Bayes, Random forest, and Random tree algorithms
    to calculate the pH factor from the soil images. Prediction of soil moisture content
    help farmers for the proper management of water resources. It is crucial, especially
    in arid and semi-arid areas, as comparatively fewer water sources sustain agriculture.
    Cai et al. [35] proposed the deep learning regression network (DNNR) with big
    data fitting capability for constructing a soil moisture prediction model in the
    area of Beijing. The prediction results concluded that deep learning has high
    feasibility and is effective for soil moisture prediction. 6.2 Temperature and
    Humidity Prediction Temperature and humidity are some of the most significant
    factors for the propagation of the growth of plants. There is a high correlation
    between temperature and humidity, and there are high humidity chances when the
    temperature became higher. However, humidity does not necessarily increase when
    there is a temperature rise. It rather depends on the area of water mass present
    in the area, as humidity occurs due to the evaporation of the water mass. Depending
    upon the variety of crops, the changes in temperature and humidity have significant
    effects on their growth. For instance, sweet potatoes and hot peppers are likely
    to thrive in places with higher temperatures, whereas apple, barley, wheat, etc.,
    are adaptive toward places with cold temperatures. Technological advancement brought
    the ability to monitor these parameters and even control according to the optimum
    requirements of the plants with the help of sensors and artificial intelligence
    systems. Moreover, with the help of several experiments samples from across the
    globe in the form of datasets, we could predict the optimum parameters for sustaining
    the growth of specific plants despite the geographical areas and places. Taki
    et al. [36] presented a prediction of the environment variables inside the greenhouse.
    The traditional prediction model is not viable to solve the nonlinear problems
    as the atmosphere inside the greenhouse is a nonlinear system. Artificial neural
    networks and support vector machines are adopted to predict and evaluate greenhouse
    variables such as correlation and energy exchange, including the soil, air, and
    plant temperature. The environmental factors which influence the temperature inside
    and outside, such as wind speed, air temperature/humidity, and solar radiation,
    were collected for samples in datasets. Kim et al. [37] developed a prediction
    model for controlling the temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse. Machine
    learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks,
    and multiple regression were implemented for the prediction model and evaluated
    the information in the datasets. The datasets comprise different seasons, summer,
    monsoon, autumn, and winter, on given parameters. It has been concluded that an
    artificial neural network has the highest accuracy with the selected dataset,
    while the multiple regression model has acquired the highest accuracy with the
    complete datasets. Jung et al. [38] adopted nonlinear autoregressive exogenous
    model, NARX; and recurrent neural networks—Long Short-Term Memory, RNN-LSTM; artificial
    neural network (ANN) for the prediction model of the environmental changes and
    their impacts on plants growth within the greenhouse. This model helps to determine
    the optimum temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide for plant growth and management
    strategies. RNN-LSTM acquired the highest accuracy over any other algorithm staggering
    up to 96% accuracy. It has been proved that the potential capabilities of machine
    learning techniques in prediction model and effective management of greenhouse
    to sustain the optimum intensity of the parameters; temperature, humidity, and
    carbon dioxide for precision agriculture. 6.3 Plant Pest and Disease Prediction
    Plant’s pest and disease invasion is agitating the farmers since it is challenging
    to predict because of their time, space, and genotype variability. The evolution
    of machine learning has brought Image processing techniques into the benchmark,
    which has revolutionized conventional farming systems into smart farming. Image
    processing is the process of classification of image pixels and extracts significant
    information. It performed well as it is non-destructive and environment friendly.
    The biological test methods required apparatus and experts, which tends to be
    expensive and also inefficient. Additionally, although DNA-based and serological
    method of plant diseases detection has revolutionized disease diagnosis, it is
    inefficient during the asymptomatic stages as it required few days to process
    in the laboratory [39]. The image processing method has the advantages of early
    detection of the lesion or blight before it gets critically injured. The feasibility
    of adopting image-based plant disease detection is much higher than any other
    method because of its cost-effectiveness and significantly higher accuracy rate.
    Ferentinos [40] presented a plant disease detection model using a Convolutional
    Neural Network. Open datasets of 87,848 plant images consisting of 58 distinct
    classes were used for training the model. These images comprise healthy and diseased
    leaf images of a different variant. The prediction result acquired a 99.53% accuracy
    rate. A Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks
    specializing in processing imagery data. Additional layers are added called the
    “Convolution layer,” which is intended for feature extraction before feeding to
    the deep neural network. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the CNN model. In
    a nutshell, it is the combination of a convolution layer with a deep neural network.
    A filter known as the kernel is stridden across the pixels in the convolution
    layer, and the dot product is obtained. The activation function is then applied
    to the result, followed by pooling. This process is repeated many number of times.
    The convoluted pixels data are flattened and fed to the neural network for the
    prediction process. Fig. 2 The architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN)
    Full size image Saleem et al. [41] presented how machine learning and deep learning
    evolved over the years. The comparison between different algorithms in machine
    learning and deep learning for predicting several plant leaves has been described.
    Without visualization technique, the identification of tomato leaf disease achieved
    the best performance and accuracy rate with CNN-ResNet over AlexNet and GoogLeNet.
    For identifying disease in banana leaf, AlexNetOWTbn, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and
    VGG architectures in which VGG outperformed all the other models. Extreme learning
    machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) have
    been implemented with the deep learning models, namely ResNet-50, GoogLeNet, InceptionResNetv2,
    Inception-v3, ResNet-101, and SqueezeNet to predict the diseased leaf of a collection
    of eight different plants. Among all these models, SVM with ResNet-50 has the
    highest performance results. A traditional CNN and Super-Resolution Convolutional
    Neural Network (SRCNN) have been implemented to diagnose the cucumber disease
    and achieved 0.823 accuracies. SqueezeNet v1.1 and AlexNet models were implemented
    to detect tomato leaf diseased, and the AlexNet model happened to be higher in
    prediction accuracy than SqueezeNet v1.1. In several research works, deep learning
    (DL) models are employed with the visualization technique for the prediction of
    plant diseases. 13 types of different plant diseases were tested with the help
    of CaffeNet CNN architecture which has an accuracy rate of 96.39%, which is much
    higher than that of SVM. PlantVillage datasets are preprocessed with three parameters:
    color, grayscale, and segmented, which have been evaluated. AlexNet and GoogLeNet
    CNN are used and compared on the three parameters. It is concluded that GoogLeNet
    CNN achieved higher accuracy than AlexNet. LeNet has been used to detect the olive
    oil leaf disease. The leaf images are preprocessed with the segmentation and edge
    map technique for extracting features. Random Forest, support vector machines,
    and AlexNet models were employed to detect the four different cucumber leaf diseases.
    The leaf images were segmented to highlight the spot on the leaf. A comparative
    study was done on Faster- RCNN, RFCN, and SSD with GoogLeNet, ZFNet, VGG, ResNet-50,
    AlexNet, ResNet-101, and ResNetXt-101 for the plant disease prediction, and it
    is concluded that ResNet-50 with the detector RFCN achieved the highest accuracy.
    A plant disease prediction model has been implemented with three CNN models such
    as MobileNet-V1, ResNet-50, inception-V2 with the help of a detector SSD, and
    Faster-RCNN to diagnose banana leaf disease. AlexNet and GoogleNet were implemented
    for the tomato leaf disease prediction with the occlusion technique for extracting
    the region of the diseases. Between these comparisons, GoogleNet achieved better
    accuracy than AlexNet. A wheat disease prediction model was presented in which
    the VGG-FCN and VGG-CNN models were applied. VGG-CNN model was proposed for the
    detection of a disease in a radish called Fusarium wilt. K-means clustering is
    used for reducing the dimensionality of the diseased images. Arsenovic et al.
    [42] proposed traditional augmentation and a state-of-art Generative Adversarial
    Network (GAN) to improve the current limitation in the disease prediction model.
    The datasets have been generated, and they will mimic the real-world scenario.
    The leaf images have been generated in different weather conditions, illumination
    exposure, and different angles containing 79,265 leaf images. The augmented images
    are then fed in a novel-two-stages neural network which achieved a 93.67% accuracy
    rate. Golhani et al. [43] presented a review article on the implementation of
    an advanced neural network model with the hyperspectral imagery data. Research
    work on plant disease prediction implementing the major Neural Network types,
    models, and a classifier were discussed. Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP), Radial-Basis
    Function (RBF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial-Basis Function (RBF), Kohonen’s
    Self-Organising Map (SOM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) are some of the types of neural network adopted. The model-like
    feedforward neural network (FFNN), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), generalized
    regression neural network (GRNN have been discussed on how it performs on the
    hyperspectral image data. Hyperspectral image data is the information that is
    collected from across the electromagnetic spectrum. The human eye can see the
    electromagnetic waves ranging from 380 to 780 nm of visible light, and the human
    eye cannot see the electromagnetic spectrum waves outside this range. Some of
    the spectrum waves are radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays,
    and gamma rays. With the use of the specific camera for capturing the electromagnetic
    spectrum, wave could generate additional information that human cannot see within
    the leaf image.   Fig. 3 a Normal leaf b hyperspectral images Full size image
    The disease prediction model with hyperspectral images could be potent because
    it can extract more information that cannot be seen physically on the leaf surface
    and cannot be captured by the traditional camera. However, it might be a little
    costlier than the conventional image processing technique where traditional cameras
    are used. It required a special camera that could extract spectrum waves apart
    from the RGB image. So, there is a trade-off between the cost and the accuracy.
    One alternative to extract more information from the image data and improve machine
    learning and the deep learning prediction model is image preprocessing. Nowadays,
    researchers have spent a reasonable amount of time implementing the actual models.
    It is the process of enhancing the images so that more information could be extracted
    and removing irrelevant information. Some of the image preprocessing parameters
    includes: Color correction Noise reduction Geometric Transformations Brightness
    and contrast correction Segmentation Edge detection Augmentation Image orientation
    correction Thresholding. These are some of the primary preprocessing parameters
    that are used to tweak the input images to improve the accuracy of the machine
    learning prediction model. Image Segmentation, Canny Edge detector, K-Means, Binary
    thresholding, Otsu’s thresholding, and adaptive thresholding are the leading studies
    in the field of image-based prediction. Figure 4 illustrates the preprocessed
    images with several image preprocessing techniques on a plant leaf. Fig. 4 Image
    preprocessing techniques Full size image 7 Material and Method Sensors and actuators
    are the vital source of information for the prediction model. These devices are
    responsible for the accumulation of relevant information around the environment.
    There are different types of sensors such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 injection
    sensors. They have their respective unique capability of sensing and gathering
    information. Figure 5 illustrates the primary sensor in the market where (a) DHT
    11 is the temperature and humidity sensors and (b) CO2 sensor is used to evaluate
    the amount of CO2 content in the air. There are electronic products from basic
    quality to high-end products in the sensing technologies, so depending upon the
    size of the projects, the material can be implemented. A carbon dioxide generator
    is a device generally used for controlling the CO2 content inside the greenhouse
    to provide the optimum condition for the plants. It sucks the oxygen from the
    open environment and converts it to carbon dioxide gases. Fig. 5 a DHT 11 b CO2
    sensor Full size image Figure 6 illustrates the basic setup for generating information
    in the form of data to predict crop growth. Initially, several numbers of plants
    were placed inside the greenhouse. A temperature and humidity sensor and CO2 sensor
    were installed inside and outside the greenhouse for comparing the parameters
    in different environments. CO2 Generator is also installed to evaluate and generate
    carbon dioxide content for optimum CO2 level for the plants’ intake. These sensors
    and actuators are connected to the controller connected to the embedded device
    or desktop through the local server, wire cable, or wifi module, which can remotely
    control these sensors. These sensors generate real-time data, which can be used
    by machine learning and deep learning models. Fig. 6 Smart greenhouse Full size
    image 7.1 Remote Sensing The Internet of Things (IoT) has been extensively growing
    since the last few decades. The advancement in IoT has paved the way for traditional
    farming to the next level. There is a huge potential in increasing productivity
    and obtain a huge global market [44]. Because of the portability and interoperability
    of the IoT technology, many agricultural industries have adopted an effective
    farming experience, which is also environment friendly. Some of the advantages
    of the Internet of Things are: Interoperability of a variety of devices across
    the globe Minimization of human intervention Time complexity Compatibility Easy
    Access Speed. Different types of sensors and actuators are available in the market
    for generating data and information on various parameters. These sensors are generally
    connected to an autonomous controller that can be programmed and powered up with
    any power source. Arduino and Raspberry Pi are the most common controllers that
    are widely used in agriculture purposes. Figure 7 illustrates the controllers,
    Arduino setup for the temperature and humidity monitoring device. Arduino is the
    most common micro-controller which is widely used for several projects. Besides
    Arduino, Raspberry Pi is also commonly used for the same projects. There is a
    bunch of other versions on these devices available depends on the objective of
    the projects. The advantages of using these controllers are the flexibility and
    ability to work with any kinds of projects such as smart irrigation systems, soil
    monitoring systems, weather forecasting models, temperature, humidity monitoring
    systems, etc. Fig. 7 Temperature and humidity monitoring using Arduino micro-controller
    Full size image The wireless sensor network technology significantly reduces human
    efforts, yet it is efficient and accurate to perform a specific task remotely.
    However, the architecture is not designed for future prediction and decision-making,
    depending on different parameters such as temperature, humidity, and climatic
    condition. These parameters are highly complex which keep on changing each year.
    Artificial intelligence is the key answer to support complex variables. 7.2 Machine
    Learning Machine Learning is broadly classified into supervised, unsupervised,
    and reinforcement learning. The labeled datasets are used in supervised learning,
    and the unlabeled datasets are used in unsupervised learning. Reinforcement learning
    deals with sequential data for the prediction. It is crucial to know the datasets
    before feeding them to the machine learning model, as each algorithm is designed
    to solve problems on specific types of datasets. Figure 8 illustrates the architecture
    of the machine learning model. The total number of datasets is divided into training
    sets and test sets using cross-validation. Training sets are fed to the machine
    learning algorithm and train to classify variables according to their traits.
    The model is then tested with the test sets for validation of the prediction.

    8 Smart Irrigation Human and industrial wastes have extensively contaminated water.
    Water scarcity has become a global concern and affects agriculture and many other
    sectors [45]. Many research works have been going on to tackle this problem and
    sustain precision agriculture to increase productivity despite the water issues.
    Water sprinkler is helpful in industries, agriculture, and gardens for watering
    purposes. The conventional automatic water sprinkler automatically spreads and
    distributes the water in the designated area by spinning the nozzle. This system
    could sound helpful in the agricultural fields. However, there could be a massive
    amount of water loss because of the soil’s moisture and climate humidity variability.
    The amount of water distribution is entirely under the farmer’s control which
    can be inaccurate. Today, with the advancement of sensor technology, several improvements
    are made with the engineering and functionalities of the traditional water sprinkler
    [46]. Rainfall Shutoff Device—This device is designed to detect raindrops water
    during rainy days. So, when it is raining, this device will see and send information
    to the water sprinkler controller to turn off the water flow which helps to compensate
    the rainwater (Fig. 9c). Soil Moisture Sensors—This sensor can monitor the soil
    moisture condition. When the soil is dry, the water sprinkler will provide the
    optimum amount of water. Otherwise, it will stop supplying water (Fig. 9a). Watersense
    Labeled Controller—The device is weather-based humidity and moisture monitoring
    device that helps the sprinkler supply the optimum amount of water to the plants
    (Fig. 9b). Fig. 9 a Soil moisture sensors b watersense labeled controller c rainfall
    shutoff device Full size image Drip irrigation is the micro-irrigation system
    that supplies water by dripping slowly either to the soil’s surface or the plant’s
    root. The primary aim is to reduce wastage of water and minimize evapotranspiration.
    It is cost-effective and sustainable. Figure 10 illustrates the working architecture
    of drip irrigation. Initially, a water tank is set up for the supply of water
    which is connected to a valve or a controller for switching the water flow on
    and off. Several pipes are laid on the field that connects the outlet of the valve.
    These pipes have an emitter interval for the outlet drop of water directly to
    the soil surface or the plants’ root. Fig. 10 Drip irrigation Full size image
    Although drip irrigation helps to save a tremendous amount of water, it can be
    improved further with the help of the machine learning and deep learning model.
    Traditionally, the drop of water is continuous in every interval regardless of
    any parameters around the soil and environment. The ground and moisture level
    temperature are the primary parameters to identify whether the soil’s moisture
    level is high. This is when machine learning and deep learning model comes in
    handy. With these technologies, we can predict supplying an optimum amount of
    water concerning the temperature and moisture of the soil. Seyedzadeh et al. [47]
    presented an AI-based drip irrigation system with uniform emitter discharge regarding
    the temperature and pressure. The emitter outlet nozzle is simulated with the
    AI-based model on specific parameter settings with a temperature of 13–53 ℃ and
    operating pressure of 0–240 kPa variance. Least square support vector machine
    (LS-SVM), neuro-fuzzy c-Means clustering (NF-FCM), artificial neural network (ANN),
    and neuro-fuzzy sub-clustering (NF-SC) were adopted in which LS-SVM model achieved
    the lowest error followed by the NF-SC model. Goap et al. [48] presented an IoT-based
    irrigation management system using a Machine Learning model. Parameters like soil
    temperature, soil moisture, and environmental condition, UV radiation, and humidity
    of the field were taken as a medium of measurement for the prediction. An IoT
    sensor and actuators are implemented to generate information of several parameters
    and collected over the cloud using web services and web-based information visualization.
    K-means clustering methods and support vector regression are used to predict humidity,
    soil moisture, and weather forecasting based on the sensors data. Vij et al. [49]
    presented an IoT and machine learning-based automated field irrigation system.
    Distributed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is established on the farm to monitor
    and sense temperature and the weather parameters are connected to the standard
    server. The implementation of Machine Learning would support the prediction of
    irrigation management based on the parameters. This model helps in the supply
    and management of water much precisely and efficiently. Water infiltration of
    the soil is one of the most crucial parameters for irrigation in agriculture [50].
    Figure 11 shows the variability of water infiltration on several types of soil.
    For instance, some soil-like Sandy loam has bigger pores inside the ground, making
    the water infiltration much more accessible, while some other soils need more
    water. The variability in the water infiltration can significantly affect the
    plants’ growth since some plants have deeper roots. Moreover, there are limitations
    for the moisture sensor as the sensitivity frequency radiates within the upper
    layer of the soil, as shown in Fig. 11. To solve these challenges, an AI-based
    model is the most feasible model for predicting and evaluating soil infiltration
    despite the variance in soil type. Fig. 11 Water infiltration on different types
    of soil Full size image Sayari et al. [51] presented a water infiltration prediction
    model for a sustainable irrigation management system. Artificial intelligence
    models which include Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), artificial
    neural network (ANN), Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Group Method of Data
    Handling (GMDH), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Firefly Algorithm (FA) have
    been proposed for forecasting the water infiltration to sustain the irrigation
    system. The data are collected from published literature and field experiments
    conducted on researching farm at SBUK University, Kerman, Iran. Several parameters
    are used for the prediction model, which includes the inflow rate (Q), furrow
    length (L), cross-sectional area of inflow (Ao), advance time at the end of the
    furrow (TL), and infiltration opportunity time (To). For the evaluation of the
    prediction model, the mean absolute error (MAE), the correlation coefficient (R2),
    the root mean square (RMSE), the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency index (NSE), and the
    index of agreement (IA) were used for the proposed AI models. Groundwater is one
    of the resources for human consumption and the development of the country. The
    agricultural sector is the primary consumer of groundwater globally [52]. So,
    crop productivity is highly dependent on the groundwater in which any threat to
    sustainability could potentially have an adverse effect on vegetation. Groundwater
    is vulnerable because of the constant climate change and anthropogenic activities.
    This deterioration has made it unsuitable for drinking and vegetation. This problem
    has become a global concern as it could threaten the agricultural sector and,
    most importantly, human livelihood. Studies and researches have been concentrated
    to sustain the groundwater. Many material, methods, and AI-based models are also
    proposed to evaluate and improve the groundwater quality, in which the results
    tend to be promising. El Bilaliet al. [53] developed groundwater quality classification
    model using groundwater quality indexes which include Potential Salinity (PS),
    Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Sodium Percentage (ESP), Sodium Adsorption Ratio
    (SAR), Exchangeable Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), and the Residual Sodium
    Carbonate (RSC) parameters through electrical conductivity (EC), Temperature (T),
    and pH as inputs. For the evaluation, Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost),
    support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied.
    The sample data of 520 images were collected the groundwater quality parameters
    from fourteen different places in Morocco. It is concluded that the Adaptive Boosting
    (Adaboost) and Random Forest (RF) have achieved a higher accuracy rate in the
    prediction model. In agriculture, farmers’ experiences are valuable and essential
    for the sustenance of productivity. Their experiences and skills are difficult
    to share and pass on as it requires efforts. This type of traditional farming
    is laborious and consumes more time. To fix these challenges, Chang et al. [54]
    presented machine learning-based smart irrigation model LoRa P2P networks to automatically
    learn the parameters of irrigation experience inside the greenhouse. The models
    calculate the optimum water requirements depending upon the temperature/humidity
    of the air, soil, light intensity, and environmental conditions. This model will
    reduce time consumption as the optimum settings have been evaluated, and it is
    comprehensive for the farmers and agrarian to follow and carry on to sustain precision
    agriculture. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the agriculture industry
    is constantly growing, and it helps to monitor the field with high scalability,
    low cost, and efficiency. The modern smart UAV are generally equipped with imagery
    systems and electromagnetic sensors, generating multispectral and hyperspectral
    images. These images are the combination of RGB images and wavelength beyond the
    visible light, electromagnetic spectrum bands such as infrared rays, x-ray, radiation,
    and ultraviolet. Spectral imaging can extract more information from the wavelength
    that even a human eye cannot see. In agriculture, this technology could be significantly
    helpful in monitoring the fertility and water status in the soil on a large area
    of land. Romero et al. [55] presented an AI-based water status estimation model
    using the UAV platform. With the help of a UAV drone, the multispectral images
    of vegetation indices are captured to estimate grapevines’ midday stem water potential.
    The artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the water estimation model,
    and the result shows a high correlation between the two parameters, such as vegetation
    index and the water potential. Figure 12 illustrates the multispectral images
    captured from the UAV drones on the agricultural fields. From Fig. 12, the green
    and red colors are the electromagnetic spectrum waves that are invisible to the
    human eye. Depending on the parameters, the electromagnetic waves are captured.
    It is generally used in the vegetation index, dryness, and wetness of the field.
    In fact, it can scan the soil type of several areas, which can be significant
    information for an AI-based prediction model. Fig. 12 UAV multispectral imagery
    on agricultural field Full size image 9 Conclusion The sustenance of precision
    agriculture highly depends on the yield prediction and irrigation system. Crop
    productivity primarily depends on multiple factors such as temperature/humidity,
    water content, minerals, light, etc., and the growing plants need to meet the
    optimum environment for their proper growth. This chapter has discussed the potential
    deterioration of the climatic parameters caused by several human activities that
    can significantly affect crop productivity. It also discussed the general idea
    of how the IoT and artificial intelligence technologies have gradually developed
    in the farming sector and how it improves the efficiency and accuracy of prediction
    on several agricultural parameters. Since the unpredictability and variability
    of the weather make traditional farming vulnerable, the emergence of the technological
    model in the agricultural sector is broadly presented. IoT and artificial intelligence
    are some of the most feasible solutions for the challenges in farming practices
    and to sustain precision agriculture. However, there are several challenges in
    the implementation of the technological model and room to improve for higher accuracy
    and efficiency. In the future work, emphasis will be given to how AI technology
    can technically improve and support the prediction efficacy of remote sensing
    technology on different agriculture parameters. Also, the scope of image processing
    using several Imagery data such as hyperspectral images, chlorophyll fluorescence
    images, and spectrum images. References Chang, D., Kim, G.: The impact of climate

    Organization (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion people
    by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 [1]. To keep pace, food production must
    increase 70% by 2050. There are some obstacles to increase food production and
    produce such amount of food. Some of them are climate change; restricted availability
    of arable land; reduced productivity growth; water necessity; the impact of urbanization
    over agricultural labour; high price and low availability of energy, mainly from
    fossil fuels; among many others. Moreover, the average age of farmers is increasing
    because young people prefer going into the industry [2]. A report from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [3] enumerates all effects of climate change on
    agriculture. They are: 1) changes in extreme weather with severe flooding and
    acute water shortages areas will increase around the globe; 2) Since agriculture
    consumes 70% of the world''s fresh water supply, water management should be an
    adequate and controlled process. To mitigate these challenges, the FAO [4] recommends
    that all farming sectors should be equipped with new tools and techniques coming
    from the Information and Communications Technology (ICT). During the last decade,
    a new movement to implant digital technology on agriculture was born, which is
    known as precision agriculture [5]. It aims to optimize the yield per unit of
    farming land by using ICT tools and technologies [6]. The objective of precision
    agriculture is to achieve the best products concerning quality, quantity and economic
    conditions. Traditionally, precision agriculture makes use of sensors to monitor
    environmental conditions. To attain this objective, networks of these sensors
    are created to cover larger areas. Precision agriculture is not only attached
    to deploying on-site sensors but involving many areas related to robotics, computer
    science, and remote sensing. An example of this is the use of smartphones, which
    have been used to visualize on the field the data provided by sensors and offer
    the possibility to apply different strategies to improve productivity [7]. The
    works presented in [8], [9] exploit the use of advances in neural networks for
    weed detection and plant species identification with the purpose of optimizing
    the herbicide application. Finally, the review introduced in [10] showed the improvements
    of the spatial resolution in aerial and satellite imagery for precision agriculture
    since the late 80s, which now allows fine-grained analysis at the expense of high
    data storage and computational resources. In the last decade, a new approach to
    connect everything (sensors or actuators), as well as to monitor and act [11]
    using the Internet, was implanted in every aspect of our daily lives; this process
    has come to be called the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT describes how in the real
    world, physical things are integrated into the digital world of bits and bytes
    [12]. In general, it involves the integration of each object, such as a sensor
    or device that is connected via wired or wireless networks using the Internet.
    To connect things, the Internet Protocol (IP) is used, in which each device has
    an IP address. The IoT devices need a mechanism to communicate with the cloud
    side, which is called Machine to Machine (M2M) communications. M2M will work with
    new developments and contributes to the future of Internet [13]. Nowadays, the
    future of the Internet will not only consist of connecting people but also to
    the approach of a digital world where, ideally, everything will be connected.
    Every day farmers are producing large amounts of data that are published on the
    cloud, with the aim of delivering benefits concerning data access, synchronization
    storage and to apply some analysis, the so-called Cloud Computing (CC), to make
    decisions. New trends that appeared after CC move the computation towards the
    smart devices; the benefit is to distribute the computing between different things.
    This paradigm is called Edge Computing (EC) [14]. The connection between the IoT
    and M2M with precision agriculture have produced a new concept called “smart agriculture”
    following other M2M based implementations such as smart cities. One of the realms
    in which more great adaptation of such technologies has been incorporated is the
    viticulture. Viticulture has historically been characterized by obtaining a high-quality
    product. This has been made possible by many factors: the selection of suitable
    soil and climatic zones, the varietal vineyards and the work of the winegrowers
    in managing their vineyards. Many threats can affect quantity and quality of the
    wine. Concretely, there are some well-known plagues attacking vineyards, and they
    produce substantial losses. The vine is exposed to different types of diseases
    or harmful agents; these are classified into four types [15]. The first category,
    physiological damage or disorders in the vine that are not caused by pest and
    diseases, are generated by lack or excess of irrigation, extreme conditions due
    to meteorological factors, natural ageing, deficiencies or excesses of nutrients
    in the vine, lousy soil, irrigation with saline water, among many others. The
    second category, fungus, they can even grow in both wet and dry regions. Some
    examples of this disease are powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot and they
    can even grow well in both wet and dry regions. The third category, vine pests,
    and insects, the most damaging are those that feed on grapes, examples of them
    are: Tetranychus urticae, Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Ditylenchus, Lobesia botrana,
    Colomerus viti, Eriophyes vitis or Phylloxera vastatrix, among others. Finally,
    the last category is vine diseases generated by viruses and bacteria, like grapevine
    degeneration, grapevine decline, leafroll complex or rugose wood complex. All
    these diseases impoverish the quality of the grape, and as a result, they might
    cause severe economic losses to farmers and people related to the wine industry.
    Downy mildew is probably the most studied disease, as it produces critical economic
    losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries1 . Within this context, this
    paper introduces the SEnviro platform for vineyards, which integrates the downy
    mildew model [16] for detecting the most suitable moment to treat the downy mildew
    disease. In summary, the main contributions of this work are: 1. to apply a model
    to alert when would be the suitable moment to treat the downy mildew disease in
    the vineyard context; 2. to monitor vineyard fields through a new version of the
    SEnviro platform following the IoT paradigm and; 3. to follow the edge computing
    paradigm and to mitigate the communication between ends. The remainder of the
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the IoT in
    edge computing, open hardware and smart agriculture. Section 3 presents the SEnviro
    Platform. Section 4 details the Goidanich model used to detect the suitable moment
    to apply treatment for the downy mildew disease. Section 5 shows the experimentation
    done to test the platform. Section 6 reviews the related work. The paper concludes
    in Section 7 with conclusions and future work. 2. Background This section is devoted
    to showing the background of the IoT, Edge Computing, and Open Hardware paradigms.
    Also, their relation with precision agriculture through GIS is detailed. 2.1.
    IoT in the edge Cisco''s report anticipates that 50 million smart objects will
    be connected to the Internet by 2020 [17]. This situation will cause “data tsunami”
    which refers to the use of the IP to achieve connectivity between these smart
    objects. This trend produces streams of potential information, which challenge
    today''s data analysis systems in a centralized server in the Cloud [18], [19],
    [20]. IoT movement has been successfully applied in healthcare [21], [22], [23],
    [24] (ambient-assisted living and telemedicine), smart home and smart metering
    [25], [26] (devices that enable the automation of common in-house activities),
    video surveillance [?] (intelligent video systems), automotive and smart mobility
    [27], [28] (intelligent transportation systems) and smart energy and smart grid
    (intelligent management of energy distribution and consumption) [29]. All these
    applications have boosted up the popularity of “smart things” connected to the
    Internet, and the networks created with them. In this way, the traditional WSNs
    have been updated to follow an IP protocol to apply all the benefits that it entails.
    The new paradigm, namely cloud computing, has been added to improve and provide
    more advantages over the IoT [30]. The low bandwidth lacks between the producer
    (smart objects) and consumer parts (cloud server) and the improved performance
    at both computing and consumer of smart objects, has led to a new paradigm called
    edge computing. The main feature of edge computing is that data can be processed
    locally in smart devices, rather than being sent to the cloud for being processed.
    The edge computing essentially means that instead of staying and working from
    a centralized cloud, edge nodes work at the ends of the networks. Edge computing
    puts some of the transactions and resources on the edge of the cloud; instead
    of establishing channels for storage and use in the cloud, it reduces the need
    for bandwidth by not sending every bit of information through channels to the
    cloud and instead adds it in specific access points. By using this type of distributed
    strategy, we can reduce costs and increase efficiency and reduce bandwidth consumption.
    Edge computing arose from the need to address three issues: 1) being able to act
    in real-time with the incoming data; 2) working within the limits of available
    bandwidth; and 3) distributing the computing between the nodes, to relive the
    centralized server. Edge computing address applications and services that do not
    fit the paradigm of the cloud, such as applications that require very low latency

    distributed control systems on a large scale. Fig. 1 details the work-flow for
    connecting sensor nodes to users using a cloud and edge computing infrastructure.
    On the one hand, this figure divides the physical and cyber worlds and the IoT
    part with traditional IT. The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is used to pass
    the barrier between the IoT device cloud and the IT cloud [31]. It is responsible
    for the interworking between the GPRS network and Internet. On the other hand,
    the figure shows where the edge computing is located. The results offered by the
    edge computing can be sent to the cloud or directly to the clients without using
    any cloud infrastructure. Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download

    to make smart objects Nowadays, the open movement has gained attention [32]. Traditionally,
    this idea was applied with more acceptance over source code and provoked the open-source
    movement. More recently, the same idea has been applied to the hardware (open-hardware).
    This situation has permitted to offer complete open systems, where both source
    and hardware are open. The users can contribute to improve the system and propose
    improvements. One of these improvements is the ability to offer more interoperability
    between components because they can be adapted for each usage. In this way, it
    reduces compatibility issues. This advantage can establish a standard IoT approach.
    In this work, we apply different Geographic Information Systems (GIS) standards
    to communicate with each IoT device; these standards will be explained in following
    paragraphs. Another advantage is the low cost of these devices compared with commercial
    solutions. As concluded by [33], open initiatives are cheaper, but they have also
    shown that open hardware is more powerful and has better performance than commercial
    solutions. Also, the same work demonstrates that the open hardware project can
    be considered reliable. Currently, there are several different alternatives regarding
    the micro-controller based platform, and the most remarkable platforms are Arduino2,
    Raspberry Pi3, BeagleBone4 or MSP430 Launchpad5 . All these platforms can be expanded
    easily, and used for other applications. Using these platforms different applications
    have been developed thanks to the acceptance of the IoT movement above described.
    2.3. GIS role in smart agriculture As commented in the Section 1, one way to address
    these issues and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production
    is by using ICT to make farms more “intelligent” and more connected through the
    so-called “precision agriculture” also known as “smart agriculture”. Nowadays,
    there is a high quantity of proprietary IT solutions to help farmers manage their
    farms more effectively [34]. More advanced systems track geospatial zones, weather
    patterns and perform expert predictions [35]. These kinds of systems are called
    Farm Management Information Systems [36], and focus on specific tasks and use
    their specifications to implement the functionality provided. Currently, this
    field is slowly moving to use the Internet and is starting to use some of the
    networking solutions to improve what they offer to the end users. However, it
    is widely accepted that the Internet faces some shortcomings, especially in handling
    vast numbers of networked devices (IoT) or stakeholders. Moreover, there is still
    no standardized solution to enable cohesive and straightforward interoperability
    among services and stakeholders. To solve this issue, we look at GIScience. It
    can offer an excellent opportunity to standardize the ways of connecting different
    “things”, offering an interoperable connection; and it should help to deploy the
    new smart cities. GIScience can be defined as “the discipline that uses GIS as
    tools to understand the world” [37]. It can contribute by offering a crucial essential
    component for the IoT movement, which is interoperability using the use of standards.
    The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)6 is a non-profit international organization
    which develops open standards for the global geospatial community. OGC defines
    standards in a wide variety of domains including environment, defense, health,
    agriculture, meteorology, sustainable development, and smart cities. The OGC has
    standardized Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) as a set of specifications related to
    sensors, sensor data models, and sensor web services that will enable sensors
    to be accessible and controllable via the web [38]. It is composed of a set of
    standards; the most popular are: Observations and Measurements (O&M), SensorML,
    Sensor Observation Service (SOS), Transducer Model Language (TransducerML), Sensor
    Planning Service (SPS), Sensor Alert Service (SAS) or Web Notification Service
    (WNS). Another proposal is OGC SensorThings API7 . It is a new candidate standard
    that provides open access built on web protocols, based on the current SWE standard
    and following the architectural REST style. The aim is to provide a standardized
    a way to expose the IoT world to the real world, where things have limited resources.
    3. SEnviro platform This section presents the sensorized platform used in a smart
    agricultural context. As commented in the above sections, the platform Sense Our
    Environment (SEnviro) [39] follows the IoT and Web of Things (WoT) [40] paradigms
    by means of a low-cost, open-hardware and open-software, energetically efficient
    and autonomous and interoperable solution. The SEnviro platform uses the IP protocol
    to establish the connection. With these features, it can be considered that each
    SEnviro Thing is a smart object. A network is formed by joining several SEnviro
    Things. This platform makes use of standards when publishing data. It guarantees
    the interoperability of the services provided by the platform. Another important
    feature of this platform is that it is energetically efficient and autonomous
    through a battery cell, which is charged with the energy provided by a solar panel
    attached to it. To save as much energy as possible, we are using a sleep mode,
    in which during this period the micro-controller and connectivity module consume
    as little as possible. 3.1. How is SEnviro made of? At the hardware level, the
    sensorized platform has been designed to be a node acting as a smart object, which
    provides measures of environmental variables. Each SEnviro Thing is composed of
    different components, which are organized into four groups depending on their
    function: Core, Sensors, Power Supply and Communication. At the same time, the
    Core is formed by four parts: Micro-controller, Connectors, Clock, and Memory.
    For this work, we developed an enhanced SEnviro using the LinkIt One development
    board. The LinkIt ONE board is an open source, high performance, Arduino footprint
    board for prototyping IoT devices. The board is based around a powerful ARM7 EJ-S
    processor but has onboard GSM, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth BR/EDR/BLE, GPS, Audio codec,
    and SD card connector. Pin-out similar to Arduino boards, including Digital I/O,
    Analog I/O, PWM, I2C, SPI, UART and power supply, compatible with Grove 4-pin
    interface. In Section 5, we detail all components used to develop the SEnviro
    node for monitoring vineyards. 3.2. How does SEnviro work? At an operational level,
    SEnviro Thing can change its behaviour, updating the information about what sensor
    is active and the frequency at which measures are taken. The SEnviro Thing''s
    behaviour has two stages, initial and repetitive periodic. In the initial stage,
    a set of procedures are executed when it is initiated, for instance, one procedure
    could initialize the clock using the current time. The repetitive periodic stage
    defines the procedures that are repeated during the SEnviro Thing''s life cycle
    before going to sleep. Fig. 4 shows the design of the complete infrastructure
    with all of the system''s components, and describes each of them in different
    layers. If we analyze SEnviro from a GIS context and specify what is happening
    in each of its layers, we obtain Fig. 2, which we are going to detail below. In
    the content layer, there are different SEnviro Things to cover an area to measure
    the phenomena by the included sensors in each sensorized platform. In this figure,
    we can see the two functionalities mentioned above. Download : Download high-res
    image (253KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. General overview about
    the SEnviro work-flow following three layers architecture. As detailed in [39],
    different observations are periodically taken from the installed sensors to monitor
    the environment. When the SEnviro Thing takes a new observation, it invokes the
    Sensor Data Management (SDM) module. This component is implemented as a RESTful
    web service. The SDM module is responsible for publishing observations in different
    services that we want to offer, such as SensorThings API, SOS or others. Thus,
    it offers the same content using different interfaces; depending on the context
    it may be more or less appropriate. Different adapters for each of these services
    are offered. If we want to support new services/standards, we only need to add
    a new adapter for the service. We use the adapter software pattern to implement
    this feature. The service layer offers the services described above. One of the
    objectives of the SEnviro platform is to offer a standard service, to provide
    connectivity in an interoperable way. To meet this challenge, a candidate OGC
    standard, SensorThings API, has been used to offer an interoperable service to
    access the SEnviro platform. The most remarkable thing about this standard is
    that it breaks away from all “standard topics” [41] and offers access to restrictive
    devices, such as smartphones. Also, it offers the SOS interface to increase the
    interoperability, because this standard is widely used [42]. Finally, a lightweight
    RestFul service is created to connect this service in a more agile way [43]. The
    last layer, the application layer has been designed for different clients, mobile,
    web-based or desktop. The SEnviro Thing can adapt its behavior, updating the information
    about which sensor is active and the frequency at which measurements are taken.
    At regular intervals, the platform requests a new behavior to a server using a
    RestFul service. Then, the SEnviro Thing will get a new behavior following the
    new configuration received. The sensorized platform sends the taken observations
    to a server. A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this integration.
    Different operations are available to collect the observations measured. When
    one SEnviro Thing takes a new observation it invokes these operations to send
    data to the server using SDM module. When the SDM receives a new observation,
    it connects with the different adapters to send the data for each available service.
    To accomplish this objective, we have followed previous work [43], [39] to connect
    with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate standard SensorThings
    API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors access using RestFul
    interface used in [43]. To offer all these interfaces, we provide different adapters
    to publish the sensor data in different services or databases. To offer a SensorThings
    interface, we use an external server to test this API, which is offered by the
    SensorThings API candidate proposal. For SOS, the 52° North implementation (SOS
    version 2.0) is used. In this case, the server is deployed using an Apache Tomcat
    server and sensor data are stored in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database8 following
    the documented standard installation guides. Finally, for the last interface,
    a Lightweight RestFul service is implemented using JAX-RS9, Jersey 10 and one
    MongoDB database11 is used to store the observations. 4. Goidanich model to detect
    downy mildew disease Downy mildew is a fungal disease caused by the plasmopara
    viticola oomycete. It is one of the worst diseases of vine cultivation under specific
    weather conditions. Downy mildew is the most studied disease, as it produces critical
    economic losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries [44]. Downy mildew
    is the result of the presence of a fungus in the green elements of the vines,
    and its life cycle is well established [44]. Its biological cycle is developed
    in four phases: contamination, incubation, and sporulation and propagation phase.
    • Contamination phase: in spring, the oospores reach maturity and germinate as
    zoospores. These may be transported by rain and wind, reaching the vine green
    parts and colonizing them. The needed conditions for contamination are: an air
    temperature around 10 °C, a young plant of at least 10 cm, and a rain rate of
    at least 10 mm/day. • Incubation phase: it takes from 4 to 21 days, depending
    on the temperatures and relative humidity. • Sporulation phase: during this step,
    the fungus is propagated along the vine. • Propagation phase: dissemination to
    nearby plants with the help of rebounding raindrops and wind. The optimal condition
    for ambient temperature is between 20 and 25 °C, with the help of rain during
    the night. There are some models with more complexity and better precision than
    Goldanich [45] such as MILVIT [46], [47]. Some other works simulate only a particular
    phase of the epidemic cycle [48], [49]. Moreover, some other works simulate only
    the first date of primary infection followed by the second cycle with quantitative
    outputs [50], [51]. More recently, new models are presented which use exploratory
    simulations based on newly available computing power [52]. Our work, unlike the
    ones found in the bibliography, is the pioneer in using devices of IoT for monitoring
    this kind of models. Although Goldanich''s model has been improved over time,
    it is an ideal candidate for testing our platform. As a future work, we intend
    to use other more complete models to improve the predictions of this type of disease.
    The Goidanich model is used to follow the evolution of the downy mildew fungus
    [16]. It takes into account three different phenomena: relative humidity, temperature,
    and rainfall. The model starts when a traditional method is reached, the “rule
    of the three ten”, which predicts that primary infections will occur once the
    average temperature has exceeded 10 degrees, the sprouting exceed 10 cm and on
    a day when there is at least 10 mm of rainfall. This rule, though simple, gives
    a rough idea of when to start looking for these primary infections. To follow
    the evolution of the fungus, it is necessary to know the average temperature (Tm),
    the average relative humidity (Hm) and daily rainfall. Goidanich presents a daily
    table (Table 1) in which, for each temperature, the daily growth of the fungus
    is set according to whether the Hm is high or low. The author defines each Tm
    in two columns, one when the Hm is lower than 75% and the other when it is higher
    than 75%, providing, therefore, two numerical values of daily development for
    each case. Table 1. Daily cumulative percentage of downy mildew incubation. Tm(C)

    records 10 or more mm of rain, starting from the next day, the estimation of the
    daily growth is recorded, and the model is calculated by adding every day until
    reaching the value of 100. At this moment, the theoretical incubation period ends,
    and the fungus contamination is evident due to the appearance of stains of oil
    and the asexual fruiting. The model works in that if the sum of the daily development
    accumulated is over 70%, the risk is high, so treatment is needed as soon as possible.
    If a fungicide product is applied, the development of the fungus restarts and
    remains in suspension for a certain number of days, or until the product has been
    washed away by rain. 5. Case study: SEnviro for agriculture This section details
    how we have developed the sensorized platform in a smart agricultural context.
    5.1. Building a SEnviro Thing for Smart Agriculture For this work, we have developed
    a new version of the sensorized platform presented in [39]. For the current case
    study, we only need three different phenomenon sensors, such as temperature, humidity
    sensor and rain gauge (Fig. 3). Also, for this case, the new sensorized platform
    uses a GPRS connection to offer easy installation and wireless connection in the
    field. The LinkIt One board offers an integrated GPRS module. Table 2 shows a
    general description. Fig. 3 shows a SEnviro Thing assembled with all components
    used to follow the Goidanich model. Download : Download high-res image (166KB)

    Ion Battery 2200mAh 3.7V Empty Cell Solar panel 3W Solar Panel 138X160 To offer
    an energetically efficient and autonomous platform, we use a lithium battery of
    2200 mAh12 that supplies an output voltage of 3.7 V and is charged with the power
    generated with a 3W solar panel13 that supplies an output voltage of 5.2 V. Those
    two elements and the microcontroller are attached to a board (Lipo Rider V1.114)
    that handles the power ow between the various components. Finally, to protect
    all parts of the SEnviro Thing, two boxes have been used. A waterproof box15 to
    protect the Core, Communication and Power supply and a pagoda box to protect the
    sensors. 5.2. Applying Goidanich model This section describes the behavior that
    follows the developed SEnviro node for monitoring the downy mildew. The SEnviro
    has two different objectives: 1) to take and send observations at a defined rate,
    which by default is every ten minutes. 2) to calculate the Goidanich model, and
    if an alert state happens, the SEnviro node will send an alert via SMS. The Fig.
    4 shows these two functionalities as general overview following different layers.

    Fig. 4. On top) the figure gives information about the realization of the different
    components of the infrastructure and the sequence diagram of an exemplary usage
    to send SEnviro''s observations; on bottom) it gives a sequence diagram of an
    alarm. The first functionality was explained in [39], but in this work, some changes
    have been introduced. The first functionality has been the connectivity used.
    We have selected GPRS connectivity due to lack of other connectivity in the context
    in which it is experienced. The sensorized platform sends the observations to
    a server (Section 3). A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this
    integration. Different operations are available to collect the observations measured.
    When one SEnviro Thing catches a new observation, it invokes these operations
    and sends the data to the server using the SDM module. When the SDM receives a
    new observation, it connects with the different adapters to send the data for
    each service available. To accomplish this objective, we have followed our previous
    work [43], [39] to connect with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate
    standard SensorThings API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors
    access using RestFul interface used in [43]. To complete the SEnviro Thing integration,
    we proposed a SEnviro application to access sensor data provided by each SEnviro
    Thing. The SEnviro APP is a web-application in charge of integrating the sensor
    data provided by the installed SEnviro Things. Furthermore, the application is
    built using the mobile-first approach. In this way, it can be easily tested on
    a mobile device. The second functionality, which is of high importance for this
    work, is the possibility to apply the Goidanich model in each SEnviro node. We
    follow the fog computing paradigm to distribute the computation between the devices,
    in this case, SEnviro nodes. To calculate the Goidanich model, we need to know
    the temperature and humidity averages per day and the amount of rainfall accumulated.
    Each platform will have the capability to execute a method as depicted in Fig.
    5. The Pseudocode 1 shows how each SEnviro Thing can calculate the Goidanich model.

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Goidnich model workflow. Download
    : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size image The first
    step is to accumulate the rain gauge. When it starts to rain, the algorithm will
    calculate the rain quantitative uninterruptedly while it is raining. The accumulative
    value will be reset when in one-day rainfall has been recorded. When the accumulative
    rainfall exceeds 10 mm, the SEnviro starts to calculate the temperature and humidity
    means. To offer these means, we will add up all of the observations taken in one
    day and divide them by the number of observations. These means will be used to
    determine the percentage of downy mildew incubation, and the selected value will
    be accumulated. When this value reaches 100, an alarm will be sent to the farmer
    to inform him/her about the downy mildew incubation level, and the specialized
    treatment can begin. We have selected SMS-based services as the way to connect
    with the farmers. It is due to the high penetration of mobile phones used by the
    stakeholders. Also, using SMS notifications, we can guarantee that the notification
    will arrive at the farmer. Other mobile technologies that use Internet connection
    do not guarantee the notification delivery, because the receiver needs permanent
    Inter-net connection. It involves farmers having a smartphone with an Internet
    connection data plan that will also receive the alarm. It is important to remark
    the potential of the developed SEnviro node. Although this subsection has described
    the behavior that it followed for a particular disease, its development could
    be modified to follow other models using the meteorological data collected by
    the node. Therefore, we consider that the SEnviro node could also be useful for
    detecting different diseases in vineyards or other crops. 5.3. Results In a first
    phase, the platform has been tested in a lab environment. It was working correctly
    without huge losses. The sensors obtained measurements between predictable values.
    The rain gauge has also been tested with rain recreation, and it was working correctly.
    These tests were carried out both indoors and outdoors. In a second phase, we
    have been deployed within a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafamés
    (Castelló, Spain). The parcel has a 23633.4 m2. Fig. 6 shows the location of each
    SEnviro Thing. A SEnviro node was deployed in this vineyard parcel during May
    2016 (Fig. 7), the month when downy mildew can begin to arise at the chosen location.
    As mentioned, this platform is capable of measuring three different phenomena
    which are temperature, humidity and the amount of rainfall that are all involved
    in the Goidanich''s model. During this month, observations were taken every 10
    minutes and were sent to the central server. Each platform can calculate the temperature
    and minimum humidity, in addition to calculating cumulative rainfall every day.

    the platform registered correct observations. During this period, the rain gauge
    did not reach 10mm to activate the alert, so our system does not detect downy
    mildew. During the 30 days that is was running almost all observations (96,9%
    successful deliveries) have been measured and sent in real-time although there
    were some that were undetected due to the loss of the signal in the area. These
    lost observations were sent in following deliveries. 6. A comparative between
    some similar works In the literature, some approaches are similar to our proposal.
    The following items describe the works that have been analyzed. All of them talk
    about IoT in the smart agriculture context, more concretely on monitoring vineyards.
    • In [53], the authors propose a WSN where each node takes images from the field
    and internally uses image processing techniques to detect any unusual status in
    the leaves. • The paper [54] presents a smart embedded system that will aid vineyards
    and which is cost-effective and flexible. They monitor ambient temperature and
    humidity and send an SMS with the values. • Authors in [55] do not describe a
    single platform, they show a variety of sensor network configurations and applications
    that can address different priorities in the vineyard. • Authors in [56] present
    the results from an operational sensor network. The network is based on the Berkeley
    mote (Mica II mote). The basic sensor board is equipped with a temperature sensor.
    The network consisted of sixty-five motes distributed in a grid-like pattern ten
    to twenty meters apart covering about two acres. • Authors in [57] present a general
    sensor network designed to connect agriculture to the IoT. A customized sensor
    node and developed the application for agriculture on top of TinyOS 2.x are detailed.
    A common access interface of the sensor networks for agricultural applications
    was created to enable further integration of the sensor networks on the IoT. •
    A sensor network built using TelosB platforms is presented in [58]. They show
    the experience of maturated during the design and deployment of a prototypal WSN-based
    system for monitoring the productive cycle of high-quality wine in a Sicilian
    winery. They propose two networks, one for the vineyard, and another for the wine
    cellar. The objective is to provide some of the basic functionalities that may
    be extended to obtain complete product traceability, from the grapes to the bottle.
    To compare the formerly reviewed works, Table 3 shows a comparison between the
    detailed works. The following features to characterize each one have been proposed:
    • Platform: it refers to the microcontroller model that the system uses. • Real-Time:
    it indicates if the system works in real-time. Possible values: Yes/No. • Connection:

    works and our work using the characteristics listed at the beginning of this section,
    and the results are shown in Table 3. As indicated, most of the analyzed works
    use different platforms to build the different nodes. In our case, we use LinkIt
    ONE, because it has different ways to connect, GPRS, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It also
    includes useful operations to use the different features. Like some other works
    analyzed, our work offers sensor data in real-time. It is possible because our
    SEnviro node, to monitor vineyards, is provided with GPRS connection to the Internet.
    SEnviro, as we show in [39], it can include a huge variety of phenomena. For this
    proof of concept, to detect downy mildew disease, we adopt the nodes to offer
    only three phenomena: temperature, humidity and rain gauge. Only three analyzed
    projects [56], [57], [58] follow the IoT and WoT paradigms. SEnviro follows these
    paradigms and offers a RESTFul interface. Finally, our project aims to be interoperable,
    and for this purpose, an OGC standard has been chosen, such as the OGC SensorThings
    API. If you look at the works that apply some analysis over the observations from
    the sensors, only two works, apart from SEnviro, apply some analysis to increase
    the value of the observations and offer decision-making models. Our work, as we
    detailed in the previous work [39], provides a client to these paradigms and offers
    a RESTful interface using the OGC SensorThings API. 7. Conclusions The primary
    concern of this work is to apply the new improvements in the ICT area, within
    the smart agriculture context. In this way, the applied model to detect the suitable
    moment to treat downy mildew disease can help the farmer in different ways. The
    first improvement is the reduction of costs of chemical products. The proposed
    support system detects the best moment to apply the downy mildew control treatments,
    which are only applied when they are strictly necessary. At the same time, it
    reduces the chemicals in the soil. It redounds in less external elements in the
    environment, improving the ecological footprint of the crop. Also, it reduces
    costs concerning person-hours; each treatment that is not needed represents some
    working hours that could be used for other tasks. Consequently, the farmer does
    not need to visit the vineyards to know the status. Our work applied a sensorized
    platform called SEnviro detailed in [39], whose objective was to monitor vineyards.
    For this purpose, we have designed a new version of the sensorized platform to
    measure different phenomena to provide follow up models to detect the best moment
    to treat downy mildew. To achieve this, we propose an improved version of the
    SEnviro platform that follows different computer science paradigms, such as IoT
    or edge computing. In this way, our platform can process and apply short algorithms
    to compute the information at the same moment when the data are collected. The
    objective of the work is not to evaluate or validate the Goldanich model since
    there are different works in the bibliography related to that. Our work only shows
    a single experimentation to test the presented IoT platform. It has offered good
    results during the month that the SEnviro platform has been installed and has
    correctly reported the observations to the central server, the platform had some
    isolated losses caused by coverage problems to send the observation in real-time.
    Temperatures and humidities average for the monitoring of the Goidanich model
    have also been calculated. As future work, new fungal disease models in the field
    of viticulture could be included, such as Powdery mildew, Black rot or Botrytis.
    All of these diseases are based on meteorological phenomena, and they are included
    in the SEnviro node. New kinds of crop could be supported if the disease models
    are based on these meteorological phenomena. Support other crops with other phenomena
    require to add these sensors, in this case, more efforts are needed. Acknowledgments

  description: Nowadays, smart farming involves the integration of advanced technologies
    that incorporate low-cost robots to meet the required knowledge and maintain the
    health of plants in farming. Technologies like precision agriculture are also
    used to optimize resources based on the field condition. Internet of Green Things
    is also one of the technologies to integrate and share the information between
    people and healthy farm things. Internet of Green Things gives the information
    like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and nutrient level by means of respective
    sensors. Monitoring and information gathering in green houses with the help of
    robots is a tedious and expensive process. In this connection, information is
    shared among low-cost robots encouraging data availability of the current state
    of a plant with other robots. This will emphasize the monitoring of green houses
    in a well-organized way. In this article, a Flask-based framework through Raspberry

    Metrics and citations Figures and tables Abstract Nowadays, smart farming involves
    the integration of advanced technologies that incorporate low-cost robots to meet
    the required knowledge and maintain the health of plants in farming. Technologies
    like precision agriculture are also used to optimize resources based on the field
    condition. Internet of Green Things is also one of the technologies to integrate
    and share the information between people and healthy farm things. Internet of
    Green Things gives the information like soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and nutrient level by means of respective sensors. Monitoring and information
    gathering in green houses with the help of robots is a tedious and expensive process.
    In this connection, information is shared among low-cost robots encouraging data
    availability of the current state of a plant with other robots. This will emphasize
    the monitoring of green houses in a well-organized way. In this article, a Flask-based
    framework through Raspberry Pi is proposed for interoperability among the low-cost
    ESP8266 robots. Data gathering is performed by smart robots that are accessible
    through Message Queuing Telemetry Transport subscribes by means of Representational
    State Transfer Application Programming Interface. A cloud-like database server
    is provided to stock up the data. The integration of robotics with Internet of
    Green Things gains more advantage in gathering about spatial information data
    that are connected with the irrigation. Visualization techniques and perspectives
    based on Internet of Green Things for precision agriculture in the field of farming
    are highlighted. Introduction Recent advancement in the Internet and Web technologies
    has made availability of the pitch to users to create and use information as web
    services effectively. Web services incorporate much genuine data gathered by smart
    forms and provide the same to users. This stirring thought coined the term Internet
    of Green Things (IoGT). The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol1–6
    was invented by Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper in 1999. The properties such
    as bandwidth efficient, light weight, data agnostic, simple implementation, and
    session awareness are much helpful to implement this framework. JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON) is basically a syntax for serializing the objects such as strings,
    numbers, arrays, and so on and used for swapping data that are outlined to be
    perceived clearly by humans and parsed logically and effortlessly by machines.
    As JSON itself is entirely language independent, it is sought-after often for
    dispatching data through the RESTful Web Services.7–9 Since a public Web API is
    accessible, it provides a programmatic access to the developers. API is usually
    outlined as a collection of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for requested messages;
    it also receives alongside the response message structure in the context of Web
    development. This article scrutinizes the MQTT’s publish/subscribe services on
    low-cost smart robots, optimization of Representational State Transfer Application
    Programming Interface (REST API) and JSON data from sensors, and a simple Raspberry
    Pi–based cloud for green house. Furthermore, how far it is utilized to process
    the data from the Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is analyzed. A
    standard data pattern should be determined while creating an application to communicate
    with private and warehouse systems. There are ranges of public and standardized
    options available and the supreme choice and the ultimate selection depends on
    the vital demands and functionality of their applications. The data in an Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) payload are encapsulated to some extent of a Simple Object
    Access Protocol (SOAP)-based Web services.9–11 In many application frameworks,
    when XML performs professionally, it has some downsides that make it less than
    ideal for others. As a result, the creation of interactive web applications creates
    petulant user experience by its innumerable access. Ultimately, using JavaScript,
    these asynchronous calls originate on the end user and integrate formatting information,
    transfer it to a web server, parsing and processing with the actual response information.12–19
    JSON procures a standardized data exchange format, which is more appropriate for
    web applications, while many browsers are able to build, transfer, and parse XML.
    On the other side, JSON is an autonomous human-readable format with a broad range
    of implementation possibilities. Information will be intentionally formatted as
    per the JSON standard.20 It is now predominantly a format of data and is not limited
    to web applications virtually used in any framework where applications require
    the exchange or storage of structured information as text. Innumerable libraries
    for almost all programming languages grant simple parsing of JSON data, and most
    of the web frameworks currently reinforce generating JSON as response data.14,16
    In addition to the fact that JSON has a small-scale foot-print than XML, it is
    appropriate for situations where network speed is restricted. Evidently, mobile
    devices habitually have slower connections and hence welfare from a compact download.
    API is a group of procedures, conventions, and mechanisms for creating software
    applications.21–28 An API states how software elements communicate and are being
    exploited while programming the Graphical User Interface (GUI) components. In
    divergence to a private API, a public API is available widespread for all developers
    to fetch the green house data in gain access. They permit the developers to access
    data which can then be utilized to augment their own applications. Public APIs
    can remarkably enlarge income in the absence of the business to put money in recruiting
    brand new programmers who produce for them a very commercial software application.
    Nevertheless, it is essential to recall that opening the data from database to
    the public may result in a wide range of reliability and management challenges.
    For example, issuing public APIs can create rigidity for institutions to command
    experienced clients with their information benefits. Public API publishers cannot
    conclude that the client apps created on their APIs would provide a better user
    experience. The primary focus and usage of the MQTT protocol here are publishing
    and subscribing JSON-based data topics to open IoGT use cases.2,4,29–40 Low-cost
    android application (app) contained a smart home system prepared to remotely turn
    on/off a group of 208 devices using only four digital pins of an Arduino UNO board–based
    ATmega328microcontroller.41 The appliance-switching scheme requires approximately
    70% lower cable costs for real-life fitting in home correlation to the standard
    devices linked. The smart home system includes repeated alerts by light if it
    detects humans very near at night and the “exterior mode” will shut it down for
    each single machine connected to the system with a touch from the Android app
    when the user leaves. A smart security system is able to make an alarm, send a
    message, and call the user by Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) module
    to probe several intrusions in the house. Home energy management system (HEMS)
    is a decentralized structural design based on a multi-agent system.42 This intellectual
    energy management system is to be developed by IEEE- and FIPA-accommodating multi-agent
    platform. This enables agents to communicate, interact, as well as negotiate by
    energy sources plus devices of the smart home to give energy usage to reduce the
    cost of electricity bill. Multi-agent systems are used for implementing HEMSs
    to illustrate the communication of agents among devices for energy sources in
    sequence.43–50 Presently, no interacting low-cost and highly autonomous robots
    are found in the green houses. In particular, sensors are placed and data manipulation
    has been done manually or with the help of web interfaces. Besides, some tasks
    such as information gathering about current status and health of a plant have
    long been considered to be too complex to automate completely. In addition, green
    houses face the problem of labor shortages. As a consequence, the production process
    is progressively affected. In this context, we surveyed the above-said approaches
    and applications focused on improving the operational conditions, liveliness,
    effectiveness, protection, efficiency, and profitability of agricultural processes,
    in cases where physical labor will not be able to replaced by but can be complemented
    with proposed low-cost robots. In this article, we propose a set of Flask-MQTT-based
    autonomous wheel robots working under the control of Raspberry Pi on which the
    broker is installed. These low-cost ESP8266 robots are interacting with each other
    about data gathering and updating with one another. The accumulated data from
    the robots are stored in the database. The integration of robotics with IoGT gains
    more advantage in acquiring spatial information data connected with irrigation.
    Visualization techniques and perspectives based on IoGT for precision agriculture
    in the field of farming are highlighted. Table 1 describes the functionality metrics
    of MQTT over HTTP. From the observation of the table given, the key contribution
    of this proposed work can be viewed as the smart autonomous wireless robots controlling
    the green house from anywhere providing the green house’s data of flask server
    at the Raspberry Pi. The MQTT-based publishing/subscribing system for interoperability
    among smart robots and REST API has also been developed in Flask. In REST API,
    how the JSON data are manipulated with the MQTT protocol is described in the following
    section. Table 1. Functional comparison between MQTT and HTTP. Functionality MQTT
    HTTP Data transmission Pub/sub GET/POST Performance Light weightand simple Complex
    Methodology Data-centric Document-centric Upper layer Runs over TCP Over UDP Data
    distribution One to many One to one Content size Small Large TCP: transmission
    control protocol; UDP: user datagram protocol; MQTT: message queuing telemetry
    transport; HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol. The organization of this work starts
    with various related works. From the observations, the significance of API and
    background technologies such as JSON and MQTT is explored. Then, implementation
    of IoGT—A Flask-based python framework—and REST API for accessing low-cost ESP8266
    wheeled robots through MQTT publish–subscribe technique is discussed. The results
    from device interactions, round trip time (RTT), and performance are analyzed
    consequently. Proposed system MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol used frequently
    in the message interactions of Internet of Things. JSON is a self-describing and
    hierarchal structure. The syntax of JSON is predefined by two basic structures
    as name-value pairs described as ordered set of values.9 The value in the said
    structures can be any of the types listed such as number, array, object, string
    (unicode), Boolean (true or false), and null. These structures can be nested;
    nested arrays are the mostly used values in the JSON data interchange format.
    The JSON values cannot be a function. Since this flexible structure is used in
    RESTful Web services, we bring this on MQTT as topics while publishing or subscribing.
    Example of green things in JSON Listing 01 { “Title”: “Temperature”, “Description”:
    “DS18B20”, “Type”: “ONEWIRE”, “Properties”: { “Values”: { “ID”: “ESP-1”, “temp”:
    34.3445 } } } The values and keys are description of temperature sensor and respective
    values enclosed in double quotes. Double quotes are not necessary if the value
    is a number. If the JSON value is a number, it can be expressed as an integer
    or floating point. The file extension of the JSON data format is JSON. Both the
    JSON and the XML shall be exploited to measure the local and flexible objects
    in human-readable and text-based, data proxy format. Besides, these data exchange
    formats are more identical with the given text in any preferable format, and the
    same another one is grasped in the other format.9 Therefore, when determining
    an information exchange format, choosing one to the other is not a simple occurrence;
    instead, preferably, the format has the characteristics making it the appropriate
    choice for a particular implementation. JSON has preferably roots in programming
    languages and hence it yields a more accepted and readily accessible mapping to
    exchange the structured data whereas XML has its own style preferably for mapping.
    Formally, both JSON and XML both support internationalization since they are supporting
    Unicode. Finally, this convenient data format is more practical on the transactions
    between the smart house and the data center. Analysis of web API GUI provides
    simpler access for users to utilize programs and APIs create it easier for programmers
    to use precise technologies in creating applications. By extracting hidden implementations
    and disclosing objects or actions that only the developers require, an API minimizes
    the cognitive work on them. While a graphical interface for an email user might
    supply a user along with a button which exhibits all the procedures for extracting
    and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output will provide the programmer
    a function that duplicates a file from one location to another. Web APIs provide
    access for programmers to exploit remote data by underlying protocols and certain
    standards for interaction which allows various technologies to perform together,
    despite of platform or language. Consider an example of Java Database Connectivity
    API that permits developers to query various kinds of databases with the similar
    group of operations. Java Remote Procedure Call (RPC) API utilizes the protocol
    to permit invocation functions to operate remotely (Figure 1). Consequently, remote
    APIs are convenient in preserving the object encapsulation in object-oriented
    programming. Web APIs are the predefined interfaces across which communications
    occur between an enterprise and applications that utilize its benefits. An API
    perspective is an architectural outline which spins everywhere, assigning programmable
    interfaces to a group of services to a variety of applications serving widespread
    types of consumers. Figure 1. Accessing data center via APIs. The proposal of
    an API has outstanding influence on its performance. The concept of data encapsulation
    explains the task of programming interfaces by folding the implementation information
    of the modules by which the users of modules do not perceive the difficulties
    inside the modules. Hence, the design of an API tries to issue only the mechanisms
    a user would expect. The design of programming interfaces constitutes a significant
    part of software component. Public Web APIs are available for most of the data
    requirements for the developers and the programmers. APIs may include data of
    various areas like books, business, cloud storage and file sharing, health, music,
    news, science, sports/fitness, transportation, university, and so on.9 The OpenWeatherMap
    is a public Web API which provides weather data for variety of mobile and web
    applications. This API provides free access to its subscribed customers. To access
    this API, users shall create an account and API key is provided for the subscribed
    user for accessing the Web API. Data for Weather Web API are collected from the
    weather stations in different format including current weather information, historical
    weather data, days, and an hour forecast information and daily forecast information.
    The current weather information format gives weather data for different geographical
    locations all over the world. This API is often updated from the weather stations
    established in different locations. The data are available in XML, HTML, and JSON
    formats. The user shall request the data in any format according to their need.
    The next format for retrieving weather data is historical weather data. This format
    provides historical data of the weather in hours for any location from 1 month
    and may be up to 5 years according to the user’s subscription. The days and hour
    forecast information contribute weather data for about 5 days. For these 5 days,
    the weather data for every 3 h are provided. The next format for this API is the
    daily forecast information. This format yields weather data for about 16 days.
    The weather data for any requested unique location or city can be retrieved by
    the name of the city, ID, coordinates, and by postal code. The city name and the
    country code of the city can be added to the request message. Then, the corresponding
    weather data for the given city can be obtained. The API provides a list of cities
    with corresponding IDs in their website. The weather data can be accessed using
    the city ID. The weather data can also be accessed by the use of geographic coordinates
    like latitude and longitude and by the city’s zip code. Along with this, the API
    provides the weather data for multiple cities. The weather forecasting for the
    cities within a zone (specified by the latitude and longitude) and the cities
    within a circle defined by center point can be obtained. The responds of the API
    contain only the originally measured and calculated data. The responds comprise
    many parameters like coordinates (latitude and longitude), temperature, humidity,
    pressure in sea level and ground level, wind speed and direction, and rain and
    snow volume. If any parameter is not found in the respond, it implies that the
    particular phenomenon has not happened in the weather stations at the time of
    measurement. The value of the parameters is retrieved in the specific format defined
    in the API documentation. The formats have different units. For example, the value
    of the temperature shall be retrieved in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and in Kelvin units.
    The values can be retrieved in the users’ required formats. The values shall be
    retrieved in integer and float. The response of the API call shall be obtained
    in multiple languages supported by the Web API. The Web API supports numerous
    languages so as to draw attention from the users all over the world.9,11 The API
    produces the data in the user requested formats. Similar to the OpenWeather Map
    API, we bring our own API developed by Flask framework to control and maintain
    the smart home data. Sample API call and respond API request in JSON Listing 02:
    API respond in JSON {“coord”: {“lon”:-3.74,“lat”:5.2}, “weather”:[{“id”:801,“main”:“Clouds”,“description”:“few
    clouds”,“icon”:“02d”}],} … “id”:2288873, “name”:“France”, “cod”:200} Listing 03:
    API request in XML <city id=“2288873” name=“France”> <coord lon=“-3.74” lat=“5.2”/>
    <country>CI</country> <sun rise=“2019-07-01T06:06:03” set=“2019-07-01T18:31:08”/>
    </city> … <weather number=“801” value=“few clouds” icon=“02d”/> <lastupdate value=“2019-07-01T18:27:44”/>
    </current> As JSON is simple to handle, it has become the typical format. The
    optimization of JSON files plays an important role while parsing the same. There
    are some requirements for the optimal performance and features of JSON files.
    Multiple JSON files are needed for better performance. Many of the JSON parsing
    libraries can read them from a stream when compared with reading from the string.
    As this is more efficient, preference shall be given for stream reading wherever
    it is possible.9,21 For achieving better optimization, the JSON files can be compressed
    up to 90%. The JSON files can be compressed in Zip format while communicating
    to the corresponding web services. Parsing of JSON can be avoided if it is not
    needed. In case the web app receives the JSON and stores it to a database or any
    other storage, it is not necessary to parse them. The process of serialization
    should be given more importance for better JSON optimization. It is not necessary
    to serialize all data fields. Instead, the null values can be omitted. The use
    of shorter field names makes it more human-readable and gives 5–10 percentage
    boost in performance and parsing. It also allows smaller data packets to transfer
    along the web. The API requests will be handled by HTTP/GET and raw data in response
    can be serialized by means of any comfortable serialization methods available
    in some elegant scripting languages such as iOS swift, Python, Hypertext preprocessor
    (PHP), and so on. Obviously, the optimization may be sensed in between 3 and 5 Mbps
    by subtle variations with different service caching among XML (SOAP), REST XML,
    and REST JSON. Table 2 demonstrates the HTTP topics of Web API. Table 2. HTTP
    topics of web API. HTTP method Action Topic GET Acquire information about a resource

    HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol; API: application programming interface. Implementation
    of Flask API for ESP8266-MQTT wireless robot Flask is a lightweight python web
    framework to construct a flexible API. In order to build the API framework, there
    are two extensions in Flask that help build RESTful services. The clients of web
    service are low-cost NodeMCU robots that command requesting the service to add,
    remove, and modify tasks. This is what is needed to device a method to store independent
    tasks. An appropriate method is to build a flexible database. The HTTP topics
    are normally generated by accessing the smart robots as depicted in Table 2. Flask
    Framework for green house is depicted in Figure 2 in which publish–subscribe is
    event-driven and readily pushes messages to smart robots. This involves an additional
    and essential communication point usually known as the MQTT broker,6 where the
    Raspberry Pi is in charge of transmitting all messages between senders and rightful
    robot clients. Raspberry Pi is responsible for monitoring the publishers as well
    as subscribers in the same way for the sake of knowledge about how many publishers
    are live. Every client robot that publishes a message to the Raspberry Pi includes
    a JSON URI as a topic into the message. The topic is normally the routing information
    for the Pi, and hence the robot that wants to receive messages, subscribes to
    a firm topic about holding the smart house data. The Pi brings all messages with
    the corresponding JSON URI or topic to the client who may or may not have to be
    familiar with each other. They insist to communicate the topic only. This construction
    facilitates highly scalable solutions without numerable dependencies between data
    producers and consumers. Figure 2. MQTT—Flask framework for green house. Web application
    is firmly developed using HTML, Flask (Python) web server platform, and JQuery
    (Figure 3). A call back function in the MQTT protocol is used here to send and
    receive data to green house. Web interface is made for controlling the smart robot
    and to monitor ONEWIRE (DS18B20) sensors data and each location of the green house.
    One of the benefits for the use of these sensors is that it allows digital input
    to make a network of sensors with a single outlet (GPIO). Figure 3. Flask-controlled
    web page for accessing smart robots. Validation In the assessment, temperature
    data are gathered from DS18B20 (mounted on ESP8266 robots) through Raspberry Pi
    via APIs of publish–subscribe within every second. The following steps have been
    discussed to acquire benefits of above-said Flask API server-based interface for
    a smart robot: 1. A web interface is implemented with a JSON endpoint. A separate
    JSON host is constructed in Flask to develop a responsive interface. 2. A web
    repository with Flask API with database is roughly used to build an interface
    for control application for implementation without hard-coding the technology
    of a device. 3. The experimental results have shown that it is better to adapt
    a lesser response time consumes MQTT than HTTP. 4. For the sake of convenience,
    the transmitted message is used as an effortless JSON object that can hold a single
    key-value pair along the publishes on smart robots. 5. The key alternate options
    for JSON are the standard methods of HTTP, usually GET or POST.6 However, they
    are not preserved due to the problems raised in content caching while gathering
    the sensor readings. It is evident that when selecting MQTT over HTTP, the RTT
    as depicted in Figure 4 is mostly lesser than a standard HTTP. It is important
    to reclaim similar connection to some extent. The efficiency of communication
    against a smart robot gains is significant compared with the HTTP standards since
    MQTT is data agnostic and light weight. The ultimate guarantee of efficiency in
    MQTT protocol gives importance to density for each payload message. This technique
    ensures additional defiant ways to attain composition against gathered data from
    sensors. The connection status and delivery of messages to the smart robots are
    depicted in Figure 5. The response time per connection cycle is examined in Table
    3. The critical approach is employed to decrease the payload size where enormous
    data could be transmitted by sensors eventually. Figure 4. Round trips between
    devices and server. Figure 5. Connection status and messages delivery to robots.

    that the proposed method has used less amount of payload size. Figure 7 illustrates

    class and also the modified class for the proposed method MQTT. Figure 6. Payload

    an MQTT-based Flask API framework in the IoGT to monitor and control greenhouse
    system with Raspberry Pi cloud. The proposed architecture presents the frequent
    publish–subscribe messages among the low-cost ESP8266-attached smart robots. An
    access interface was developed as a Flask web page for users to access green house
    from anywhere. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format when compared with
    the traditional XML. The response messages conspicuously retrieved in the JSON
    format are cached in effective when the public APIs are requested by the programmers
    rather than using response in XML. This work determined the higher parsing efficiency
    of the JSON for accessing backend data through available public Flask Web API.
    An interface was developed in Python Flask to gather information from smart farm’s
    ambient data to manage people with various sensors connected in low-cost robots.
    The main contributions of this research are as follow: 1. IoGT: A Flask-based
    python framework and REST API was developed for accessing low-cost ESP8266 wheeled
    robots. 2. Data gathered from the robots through MQTT publish–subscribe technique
    and successfully transferred (also stored for future references) to REST API.
    3. The data integrated by robots with IoGT gains more advantage in gathering about
    spatial information data connected with the irrigation. 4. Visualization techniques
    and perspectives based on IoGT helped for precision agriculture in the field of
    farming are highlighted. 5. Adapting a lower response time consumes MQTT than
    HTTP from the experimental results. 6. Implemented framework insisted that the
    incredibly lightweight JSON object hold data between the publishers and subscribers
    (ESP8266 robots). Further studies will create an adapted and responsive web application
    with the help of MQTT and machine learning methods51–61 to allow users to interact
    by topics against smart wireless robots with minimal efforts. Declaration of conflicting

  description: Agriculture is back bone of world’s economy and human life to survive.
    Agricultural Industry has more or less remained dependent on conventional methods
    of farming. The farming conditions have changed significantly over last few decades.
    Soil Fertility, Amount of Water for Irrigation and other resources have become
    scarcer but the global population has increased immensely. This calls in need
    for implementation of better farming methods like precision farming which increase
    the overall yield. In recent years there had a gradual increase in the usage of
    such systems. WSNs tell us about some problems like interoperability, communications,
    scalability and connectivity. The main aim for precision farming (PA) is to increase
    the farming production by concerning climate, water quality, terrain, weather
    and crop status. In recent years farmers are using information systems for the
    improvement of crop management and to increase productivity. This leads to create
    a platform for managing farm activities and to improve biodiversity and to reduce
    the usage of water. Such new invention should be made to enhance and develop the
    farming. This paper analyses and reveals how IoT can lay a strong foundation towards
    sustainable development in agriculture.

  description: The fact that each technological concept comes from the advances in
    the research and development, Internet of Things (IoT) grows and touches virtually
    every area of human activities. This has yielded the possibility of analyzing
    various types of sensors-environment from any kind of IoT platform. The existing
    IoT platforms focuses more on the area related to urban infrastructure, smart
    cities, healthcare, smart industry, smart mobility and much more. In this paper,
    we are focusing on the architecture of designing the application of IoT based
    solution in agriculture with more specific to Cotton farming. Our specific approach
    on farming is relevant to cotton crops cultivation, irrigation and harvesting
    of yields. In the context of cotton crops cultivation, there are many factors
    that should be concerned which includes weather, legal regulation, market conditions
    and resource availability. As a result, this paper presents a cotton crops cultivation
    oriented semantic framework based on IoT smart farming application which supports
    smart reasoning over multiple heterogenous data streams associated with the sensors
    providing a comprehensive semantic pipeline. This framework will support large
    scale data analytic solution, rapid event recognition, seamless interoperability,
    operations, sensors and other relevant features covering online web based semantic
    ontological solution in an agriculture context.

  description: The recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and the proliferation
    of sensor platforms have allowed the implementation of different applications
    used to connect physical devices (Things) to the real world, enabling a multi
    cross domain and multidisciplinary data exchange. The agricultural sector is also
    greatly benefiting from this progress with several advantages, including the optimal
    management of resources and the improvement of human labour (i.e., crop growth
    monitoring and selection, irrigation decision support, fertilizers, pesticide
    and agrochemicals application, etc.). Moreover, advancements in mechanization
    and GPS-assisted vehicle guidance in agriculture has established the concept of
    precision agronomy and precision farming, as well as automation in food production
    chain. However, current systems still have significant drawbacks in areas such
    as flexibility, networking, standardization, robustness, skills' requirements
    and lack of real time data and actuation. A current trend is based on the interaction
    of machines and autonomous systems, in order to fit into cyber-physical production
    systems and enabling data collection and networked site-specific monitoring and
    control. This paper explores all the cutting-edge challenges and solutions required
    to implement the digital agriculture framework, intended as the evolution from
    Precision Farming to connected, knowledge-based farm production systems, in a
    context where digital technologies are first-class elements for the automation
    of sustainable processes in agriculture.

    is the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) as an enabler for sustainable
    agriculture. Rather than using the IoT in support of precision agriculture, which
    it is argued is a technology of the past that grew out of a system of industrial
    scale intensive agriculture, it is proposed that the IoT in agriculture should
    be used to better understand and support the management of biodiversity, as well
    as the management of other natural resources such as water used for irrigation.
    In this context, things are defined by zones, fields, farms, landscapes, and key
    parameters within these things. Through Internet enabled systems, a platform could
    be built for managing farm activities within the context of preserving and enhancing
    biodiversity (which is severely threatened by industrial scale intensive agriculture)
    as well as reducing water use. Such an IoT application will provide the basis
    for future sustainable intensification of agriculture to meet the projected growth
    in the demand for food, but in a way that respects natural constraints, and which
    delivers system-level benefits in terms of biodiversity at different levels (field,
    farm, and landscape). Such a system could also enable land-use management which
    could facilitate decisions to be made about where to intensify production and
    where to de-intensify, as it would provide data with extended timescales appropriate
    to that of ecological systems. Such data could be used in the medium to long term
    to establish exactly what effect agricultural practices and technologies are having
    upon factors such as biodiversity, helping to identify complex interrelationships.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chengdu, China SECTION 1. Introduction As
    one of the important parts of precision farming (PF) technical architecture, spatial
    decision support system (SDSS) for PF is a kind of software which can be used
    to meet the needs of quantitative analysis and intelligent decision-making support
    in precision farming production. Through farmland-related spatial information
    analysis, the SDSS for PF is able to provide decision-making services for agricultural
    production, and support intelligent farm machinery in practice. The research of
    SDSS for PF is very meaningful for popularizing and applying technologies of precision
    farming. Most of the current spatial decision support systems for PF are desktop
    based or website based soft wares[1], which would be difficult to maintain and
    update because the data and system functions are closely coupled. It is also hard
    to share information and achieve interoperability among these soft wares because
    they were established into isolated islands of information. The problems above
    have already lead the extraordinary waste of resource, and because of these problems,
    the current spatial decision support system for PF are not capable of responding
    the changes from the market based agricultural production. In short, the current
    SDSS for PA have restricted the development of PF because of their inherent shortcomings,
    it is urgently necessary to develop next generation SDSS for PF, which would be
    on-demand, much more open, and easy to maintain and update. In recent years, the
    rises of web service technology promote the development of software architecture
    from traditional mode (Host, Client/Server, Browser/Server style) to network interactive
    mode[2]. This web service based software architecture mode can cope with the inherent
    shortcomings of traditional systems, so it is possible to design and establish
    an open, loosely coupled SDSS for PF by using the architecture. The paper studied
    the suitable spatial analysis and decision-making methods for precision fertilization
    and irrigation. On this basis, the paper analyzed the possibility of the system
    construction, and provided blueprint and implementation solution of the SDSS for
    PF. The blueprint of web service components collection, which would be used to
    implement the analysis and decision-making functions of SDSS for PF were also
    been studied in the paper. At the end of the paper, several key technologies of
    the system construction were discussed. SECTION 2. GIS web service & its application
    As a new kind of software architecture, web service is composed of 3 participators
    and 3 basic operations. Three participators are: service provider; service requester
    and service agent, and three operations are publishing; finding and binding. The
    basic architecture of typical web service can be described as follows: a service
    were published onto a service agent menu by its provider, when service requester
    wants to call the service, it will firstly search this service from the menu provided
    by the service agent, so as to get the information of how to call the service,
    finally, the requester can call the service published by the provider through
    the service description information. It should be figured out that the service
    provider and the requester will communicate directly after the requester gets
    the service information from agent. Web service implements related functions by
    using a series of criterions and protocols. For a example: it uses WSDL (web service
    description language) to describe service, uses UDDI (universal description, discovery,
    integration) to publish and find service, and uses SOAP(simple object access protocol)
    to call service. Messages in XML format are transferred among web service components
    and component internal, because message in XML format is easy to read and understand,
    and it is accepted by most of the platforms, such as Microsoft windows, UNIX,
    Linux, etc. GIS web service is a combination of web service and GIS technology[3].
    It is designed specially for managing, analyzing and publishing geospatial information.
    Comparing to traditional GIS, GIS web service own characteristics of cross-platform,
    scalable, good maintainability, and high degree of standardization, it has obvious
    advantages in dealing with problems such as spatial data sharing, software reuse
    and reducing the cost of system integration. For example, through its standard
    interface, geospatial data web service helps user search and obtain geospatial
    data published by different providers from internet, so as to realize geospatial
    data sharing. Through reconstructing current GIS, building service components
    and providing regular interfaces, GIS web service can call each other to realize
    software reuse. While GIS web service provides new technique of system integration.
    Comparing to the object-oriented or message based system integration techniques;
    it can be much more efficiently in coping with the integration problems of heterogeneous
    systems. Many GIS web service applications have already appeared recently. ESRI,
    a leader of GIS companies, established “Arc Web Services” as a GIS web service
    architecture to provide a series of spatial information related services; further
    more, most of the services had been registered to the UDDI registration center.
    “ArcGIS Server”, as the first GIS web service product brought by ESRI, provides
    tools for users to customize and publish GIS web service, such as raster calculation,
    etc. “Map Point”, which was brought by Microsoft also provides several GIS web
    services, including location service, route selection service, etc. Besides, web
    service architecture recommended by OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) has already
    been successfully applied in the geospatial information infrastructure construction
    of Germany and Canadian in 2002, and the famous geospatial information gateway:
    www.geodata.gov is also a successful application of web service. Most of farmland-related
    information, such as soil, crop and weather information, has spatial relativity.
    Precision farming, including precision fertilization and irrigation, focuses on
    farmland-related information and its collecting, processing and analysis. While,
    agricultural production in different area is tremendous difference, so establishing
    region-suitable precision agriculture services based on GIS web service, and integrate
    into a loosely coupled application to share data and reuse function is an ideal
    solution to meet the needs of precision farming in different area. SECTION 3.
    GIS web service based SDSS of PF Through analyzing kinds of decision-making workflows
    of agricultural production and effectively using GIS web service to build decision-making
    services based on the demands of precision farming production. SDSS for PF was
    constructed based on the integration of decision-making services and farmland-related
    spatial information. System analysis of the SDSS, including system roles, system
    architecture, and workflows, were discussed as follows. 3.1 System roles of the
    SDSS System roles mainly include users, equipments, and soft wares. According
    to the difference of authorization, system roles were divided into 4 classes:
    junior role, senior role, data provider, and service provider. Junior role was
    authorized to download specific analysis and decision-making results to process
    corresponding practice, senior role was authorized to find decision-making service,
    spatial analysis service and spatial data based on the needs of specific job,
    then complete the workflow of modeling, deploying, and executing so as to get
    the result. Service provider was authorized to develop and publish kinds of web
    services of spatial decision-making for precision farming. Data provider was authorized
    to produce and publish spatial data in different area. 3.2 Architecture of the
    SDSS Web service-driven service-oriented architecture (SOA) was selected to establish
    the SDSS for PF in this paper. According to the regulations of service description,
    registration, finding and interoperability, the SDSS for PF separated service
    provider and service requester. Based on technologies of enterprise service business
    (ESB), including communication, message processing and security control, the SDSS
    for PF designed a series of tiers, including client tier, application tier, service
    tier, and data tier of the architecture. Interactive mechanism among tiers and
    security management was also been established, the whole architecture of SDSS
    for PF was shown in figure 1. Client tier is the entrance for junior role and
    senior role. Senior role are supported to operate the SDSS based on specific job
    and get the decision-making results. Junior role, which including intelligent
    farm machinery, client software, and outside web service, were supported to download
    the decision-making results for further processing, or directly apply to the agricultural
    production. Application tier provides tools for finding, matching, integrated
    modeling, and combination of services & data. According to the specific decision-making
    demand of precision fertilization or irrigation, application tier provides high
    efficiency service finding and matching tool based on service description. Visualized
    environment was also provided by application tier to complete service validation
    and integrated modeling. Besides, environment of service execution was built to
    call service and create service instance, and control the activation, hanging
    up, resuming, and termination of service instances. Service tier provides 4 web
    service collections: basic services collection, spatial analysis service collection,
    decision-making service collection, and assistant service collection, these services
    can call each other, and be called by application tier through ESB. Service tier
    is also the entrance for service provider to publish and manage services, service
    register center and a series of service manage tools are deployed in the service
    tier to help service provider complete the tasks of service registering, publishing
    and monitoring. Data tier stores all kinds of data which can be called by application
    tier. Besides, metadata management center, an environment for data providers to
    publish and manage all kinds of data of SDSS, was been deployed at data tier.
    Figure 1: Architecture of SDSS for PF Show All 3.3 Workflows of the SDSS SDSS
    for PF would respond and analyze the request of specific decision-making task
    of agricultural production, and then it would select a prepared workflow template
    which is suitable for the specific decision-making task. Based on the template,
    SDSS would establish a new workflow for the specific task using services combination
    modeling tool (SCMT). According to the workflow, corresponding GIS web services
    and spatial data would be found, and describing documents would be generated.
    The services combination execution tool (SCET) would startup the service execution
    engine. After receiving the task, the service execution engine would call corresponding
    web services and spatial data to execute the workflow according to the document.
    During the executing course, it would return status messages to monitoring tools,
    and give the result to user when the execution is complete. The whole workflow
    of SDSS for PF was shown in figure 2. Figure 2: Workflow of the PF SDSS Show All
    SECTION 4. Key technologies of constructing the PF SDSS There are several key
    technologies in constructing SDSS for PF, which including multi-source geospatial
    data based decision-making model creating, GIS web services implementation, and
    SOA based system designing, etc. 4.1 Geospatial decision-making models Spatial
    decision-making models can make decision on spatial related problems based on
    multi-source geospatial data and its analysis result. Through research on spatial
    analysis demand in precision agricultural decision-making process, spatial decision-making
    models of precision farming can be established based on the geospatial analysis
    methods, such as interpolation, buffer, and raster re-class, overlay, etc. Under
    the help of remote sense image, sampling data and high precision farm/field map,
    spatial decision-making models of agriculture is able to cope with problems of
    agricultural production analysis, simulation, explanation, and forecasting. For
    example, spatial decision-making models of precision fertilization are able to
    complete the diversity analysis of farm soil, dynamic requirement analysis of
    fertilizer and the analysis of balanced fertilization. Spatial decision-making
    models of precision irrigation are able to complete the diversity analysis of
    soil moisture, regionalization analysis of irrigation and balanced irrigation
    analysis which based on specific crop water-production model. 4.2 Coarse-grained
    business service modeling SOMA (Service Oriented Modeling Architecture) was used
    as a main tool of coarse-grained service modeling in the research to build models
    during 3 stages of service identification, specification, and realization[4].
    Domain decomposing, goal-service modeling and services allocation to components
    were used to identify and realize services from a spatial decision-making request.
    While, service and message operation and corresponding operation object, regulation
    and events were built to help complete modeling and optimize analysis of decision-making
    workflow[5]. The modeling flow of SDSS for PA was shown in figure 3. Figure 3:
    Web services modeling Show All 4.3 Implementation of spatial decision-making web
    service No matter how the service modeling works, services should be allocated
    to soft components ultimately. A common solution of service allocation is reflecting
    the operation scope directly to the service component or component collection,
    so as to realize the consistency between services and components[6]. Figure 4:
    GIS web service & its'' workflow in SDSS for PF Show All According to the decision-making
    requirements of precision fertilization and irrigation, we designed corresponding
    service components, and also established the interface criterion and accessing
    protocol for service components, which was shown in figure 4. On this basis, 4
    service components collection: basic information services, spatial analysis services,
    intelligent decision-making services and assistant services were developed on
    Microsoft. net 2.0 platform. SECTION 5. An instances of the PF SDSS As an instance
    of the PF SDSS, wheat remote diagnoses and decision-making system was shown as
    Figure 5. It is a web browser based application. The construction of this application
    was based on the methodology of component, which including component based analysis,
    design, development and deployment. According to the component design method of
    “Top-to-Down”, Wheat remote diagnoses and decision-making system was buildup by
    three levels from top to down, which include application system level, business
    composite level, and function component level. According to the component development
    and deployment method, Selecting existed function components and developing new
    components according to the system requirement was the first step of the system
    development, the second step was components arrangement and combination, so as
    to create business composites, these composites would be deployed onto the ESB.
    While complete the job of business composites construction, the following step
    was selecting suitable customized template and completing the job of user interface
    customization. After all these steps down, wheat remote diagnoses and decision-making
    system was created. It can help farmers make decision though internet in precision
    fertilization and irrigation. Figure 5: An instances of the PF SDSS Show All SECTION
    6. Conclusion GIS web service is able to effectively cope with the traditional
    GIS applications'' problems such as difficult to maintain, lacking of good interoperability
    and hard to integrate with other systems, etc. The paper gave the solution on
    how to establish a spatial decision-making support system for precision farming
    based on GIS web service, main components of the system and the spatial decision-making
    workflows were discussed in the paper. Precision fertilization and precision irrigation,
    as examples, were used to describe key technologies of GIS web service based SDSS
    for PF. The research result shows that GIS web service is suitable for developing
    Spatial decision-making Support System for PF, and GIS web service based applications
    has obvious advantages in dealing with problems such as sharing spatial data,
    software reuse and reducing the cost of system integration. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This

  description: A lack of real-time soil or plant status feedback and decision support
    systems has been a major stumbling block to the practical use of precision or
    site-specific irrigation and chemigation technologies. Data are needed on both
    a spatial and a temporal scale. It was hypothesized that an array of infrared
    thermometers, mounted on a center pivot, could provide this missing spatial and
    temporal feedback as they move over the entire field at regular intervals throughout
    the season. This was tested in a field of soybeans with varying degrees of induced
    water stresses in 2004 and 2005. Infrared thermometers were used to create canopy
    temperature maps of the underlying field every time the pivot moved over the field.
    These maps were standardized and combined into a single map for each year using
    an algorithm modeled after that used to combine multiple years of yield maps.
    These end-of-year maps for each year clearly showed stressed areas of the field.
    The combined, averaged, and standardized temperatures from the end-of-year maps
    were correlated with the end-of-year yield, biomass, and total water use in the
    different stressed plots for both years, resulting in r 2 values close to 0.8.
    These average, standardized temperatures were also significantly different across
    irrigation treatments in 2004. This demonstrates the method's ability to show
    spatial stress patterns in a field. To capture temporal variation and to highlight
    when temperature differences were caused by more than natural variation, statistical
    process control (SPC) charts were used to evaluate each point on the standardized
    temperature maps over time. Stress was deliberately introduced to a particular
    area of the field late in the 2005 season, and although the stress was not visible
    to the eye, this stressed area was clearly apparent in the SPC charts. These data
    demonstrate the ability of an array of infrared thermometers mounted on a center
    pivot to provide producers with feedback on both the spatial and temporal variability
    of a field during a growing season.

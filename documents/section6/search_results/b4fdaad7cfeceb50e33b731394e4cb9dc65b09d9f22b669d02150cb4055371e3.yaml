    1. Introduction\nThe farming community regularly focuses on minimizing agricultural\
    \ input costs to\nmaximize proﬁt. To reach this objective, farmers optimize the\
    \ crop yield using fertilizers,\nherbicides, and fungicides [1]. The current scenario\
    \ has led to a signiﬁcant tradeoff between\nhigher crop productivity and soil\
    \ and groundwater health due to the excessive use of\nagrochemicals. The world\
    \ has witnessed an unprecedented increase in farmland areas due\nto population\
    \ growth over the past few decades [2]. As the farmland area increases, so\ndoes\
    \ the use of agrochemicals, leading to enhanced soil, water, and air pollution.\
    \ The rising\nenvironmental pollution rate is compelling the scientiﬁc community\
    \ to develop advanced\nfarming technologies and methods to save the planet. Given\
    \ the global awareness of this\nissue, the farming community is under increasing\
    \ pressure to reduce agrochemical usage\nby adopting alternative farming practices\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is a suitable alternative\nfor farmers, which reduces\
    \ agrochemicals and provides site-speciﬁc and targeted reme-\ndies according to\
    \ the crop to increase economic returns. Precision agricultural practices\naim\
    \ to enhance crop productivity while reduce using fertilizers, pesticides, and\
    \ herbi-\ncides. Nanotechnology-based precision agriculture employs computers,\
    \ global positioning\nsystems (GPS), and remote sensing devices to measure crop-based\
    \ and environmental\nparameters [4]. Nanomaterials (NM), the nanotechnology component,\
    \ possess unique\ncharacteristics that distinguish them from their parent materials.\
    \ These materials typically\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2, 220–256. https://doi.org/10.3390/agrochemicals2020016\n\

    \ signiﬁcantly higher surface areas, cation exchangeability, and ion absorption\
    \ capa-\nbilities when compared to their bulk counterparts [5,6]. Precision agricultural\
    \ techniques\nminimize the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides by utilizing\
    \ effective monitoring\naids and procedures. This technology involves the controlled\
    \ release of agrochemicals\non targets for efﬁcient nutrient utilization and disease\
    \ resistance. Such products include\nnanoscale carriers, nanosensors, nanofertilizers\
    \ (NFs), nanoherbicides, and nanopesti-\ncides. By adopting nanotechnology-based\
    \ precision agricultural practices, the farming\ncommunity can reduce agrochemicals\
    \ while maintaining high crop productivity, protecting\nsoil and water health,\
    \ and contributing to a cleaner environment. The review explores\nnanotechnology’s\
    \ potential applications in precision agriculture while examining the ad-\nvantages\
    \ of nanoparticles (NPs) in agriculture, particularly fertilizer delivery. It\
    \ discusses\nnanotechnology-based nanodiagnostic systems and nanobiosensors for\
    \ monitoring soil\nquality, nutrients, humidity, plant diseases, and stress. The\
    \ review also examines various\ntechniques related to precision agriculture, such\
    \ as GPS, yield monitoring, and remote\nsensing. The review identiﬁes issues and\
    \ concerns related to precision agriculture in the\nIndian context. Additionally,\
    \ the review explores the potential of tagging, monitoring, and\ntracking agroproducts\
    \ using nanotechnology methods and devices, smartphone-based\nbiosensors in precision\
    \ agriculture, precision agriculture, and cloud computing, and the\neconomic,\
    \ legal, social, and risk implications of nanotechnology in agribusiness. The\
    \ review\nalso aims to emphasize the potential for nanotechnology to enhance the\
    \ productivity and\nefﬁciency of agricultural techniques while addressing issues\
    \ of food security, environmental\nsustainability, and socioeconomic development.\
    \ The implications of this review could be\nsigniﬁcant in terms of the future\
    \ development of nanotechnology in precision agriculture.\nUsing NPs to improve\
    \ seed germination, plant growth, micronutrient supply, and stress\nalleviation\
    \ can signiﬁcantly increase crop yields and reduce production costs. The delivery\n\
    of bio- and chemical fertilizers through nanotechnology can further reduce the\
    \ dosage of\nfertilizers and pesticides required, which can help mitigate environmental\
    \ concerns related\nto the excessive use of these chemicals. Employing nanobiosensors\
    \ in diagnostics and preci-\nsion agriculture aid in tracking various soil quality\
    \ parameters, concentrations of pesticides\nor herbicides, amounts of nutrients,\
    \ degrees of humidity, and plant stress and disease. This\nsophisticated technology\
    \ can guide farmers in making knowledgeable decisions about\nusing fertilizers,\
    \ pesticides, and other inputs. Using smartphone-based biosensors and\ncloud computing\
    \ can further facilitate real-time monitoring and decision-making. The\nreview\
    \ also highlights the potential of nanotechnology for reducing agro-waste and\
    \ synthe-\nsizing high-value products, which can signiﬁcantly impact sustainability\
    \ and proﬁtability\nin agriculture. However, the review also points out concerns\
    \ about implementing preci-\nsion agriculture in developing countries, such as\
    \ data management, ownership, privacy,\ninfrastructure, and socio-economic conditions.\
    \ Addressing these concerns will be crucial\nfor successfully adopting precision\
    \ agriculture in India and other developing countries.\n2. Synergies of Precision\
    \ Agriculture and Nanotechnology for Sustainable Crop Growth\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is an approach to farming that utilizes advanced tech-\nnologies that leverage\
    \ cutting-edge technology and data-driven decision-making tools to\nincrease crop\
    \ yields and optimize resource management (Figure 1). It aims to reduce waste,\n\
    improve efﬁciency, and increase proﬁtability. On the other hand, nanotechnology\
    \ is a ﬁeld\nof science and technology that deals with materials and structures\
    \ on a nanoscale level.\nNanotechnology can revolutionize the ﬁeld of precision\
    \ agriculture, offering farmers and\ngrowers new tools and techniques for enhancing\
    \ crop production. Although nanotechnol-\nogy and precision agriculture differ\
    \ in their focus, they share some interrelated aspects.\nNanotechnology can create\
    \ new materials and tools that can strengthen precision agricul-\nture practices.\
    \ For example, nanosensors can monitor soil and plant health in real-time,\nallowing\
    \ for more accurate and efﬁcient crop management. NPs can also improve the\ndelivery\
    \ of nutrients and pesticides to plants, reducing waste and increasing effectiveness.\n\

    \ materials and tools that can strengthen precision agricul-\nture practices.\
    \ For example, nanosensors can monitor soil and plant health in real-time, \n\
    allowing for more accurate and efficient crop management. NPs can also improve\
    \ the de-\nlivery of nutrients and pesticides to plants, reducing waste and increasing\
    \ effectiveness. \n \nFigure 1. Representation of nanosensor-based precision agriculture\
    \ in action. \nOn the other hand, PA uses advanced technologies and data-driven\
    \ decision-making tools \nto optimize crop yields and resource management. The\
    \ intersection between these two \nfields lies in applying nanotechnology to enhance\
    \ PA practices. PA enables farmers to \nassess and manage field variability using\
    \ remote sensing and global information system \n(GIS) based technologies, which\
    \ can create prescription maps for variable-rate application \nof inputs, thereby\
    \ reducing input costs and environmental impacts [7]. PA allows farmers \nto do\
    \ the right thing in the right place at the right time by monitoring crop growth,\
    \ soil \nmoisture, and other environmental factors using real-time sensor data,\
    \ leading to im-\nproved crop yields and reduced waste [8]. It can significantly\
    \ increase productivity by \noptimizing resource use and reducing input costs.\
    \ In addition, PA facilitates better deci-\nsion-making in agricultural management\
    \ by consolidating farmers’ experience and in-\nsights, enhancing control over\
    \ time. Additionally, it can help farmers maximize the use of \nminimum land units\
    \ by using precision planting and management techniques, thereby \nreducing the\
    \ need for additional land. In addition, PA facilitates better decision-making\
    \ \nin agricultural management and accumulates farmers’ knowledge for better control\
    \ over \ntime. \nIn precision agriculture, nanotechnology improves crop yields,\
    \ reduces waste, and \nminimizes environmental impacts. The nanoscale modification\
    \ of materials enables \nunique characteristics and benefits over conventional\
    \ farming procedures. Using na-\nnosensors for real-time soil and plant health\
    \ monitoring may help farmers get a better \nhandle on their crops by giving them\
    \ more accurate data on where and how much water \nand fertilizer they need. NPs\
    \ can be used as delivery vehicles for pesticides and fertilizers, \nreducing\
    \ their environmental impact [9]. Nanotechnology can also enhance the properties\
    \ \nof agricultural materials, such as plant fibers and seeds, making them more\
    \ resistant to \npests and weathering [9]. However, research is needed to understand\
    \ potential risks and \nenvironmental impacts on soil, water, and human health.\
    \ Nanotechnology in PA can rev-\nolutionize crop growth by improving efficiency\
    \ and sustainability while reducing waste \nand environmental impacts. The following\
    \ points elucidate the integrative potential of \nnanotechnology in conjunction\
    \ with precision agriculture. \nFigure 1. Representation of nanosensor-based precision\
    \ agriculture in action.\nOn the other hand, PA uses advanced technologies and\
    \ data-driven decision-making\ntools to optimize crop yields and resource management.\
    \ The intersection between these\ntwo ﬁelds lies in applying nanotechnology to\
    \ enhance PA practices. PA enables farmers to\nassess and manage ﬁeld variability\
    \ using remote sensing and global information system\n(GIS) based technologies,\
    \ which can create prescription maps for variable-rate application\nof inputs,\
    \ thereby reducing input costs and environmental impacts [7]. PA allows farmers\n\
    to do the right thing in the right place at the right time by monitoring crop\
    \ growth, soil\nmoisture, and other environmental factors using real-time sensor\
    \ data, leading to improved\ncrop yields and reduced waste [8]. It can signiﬁcantly\
    \ increase productivity by optimizing\nresource use and reducing input costs.\
    \ In addition, PA facilitates better decision-making in\nagricultural management\
    \ by consolidating farmers’ experience and insights, enhancing\ncontrol over time.\
    \ Additionally, it can help farmers maximize the use of minimum land\nunits by\
    \ using precision planting and management techniques, thereby reducing the need\n\
    for additional land. In addition, PA facilitates better decision-making in agricultural\n\
    management and accumulates farmers’ knowledge for better control over time.\n\
    In precision agriculture, nanotechnology improves crop yields, reduces waste,\
    \ and\nminimizes environmental impacts. The nanoscale modiﬁcation of materials\
    \ enables unique\ncharacteristics and beneﬁts over conventional farming procedures.\
    \ Using nanosensors for\nreal-time soil and plant health monitoring may help farmers\
    \ get a better handle on their\ncrops by giving them more accurate data on where\
    \ and how much water and fertilizer they\nneed. NPs can be used as delivery vehicles\
    \ for pesticides and fertilizers, reducing their\nenvironmental impact [9]. Nanotechnology\
    \ can also enhance the properties of agricultural\nmaterials, such as plant ﬁbers\
    \ and seeds, making them more resistant to pests and weath-\nering [9]. However,\
    \ research is needed to understand potential risks and environmental\nimpacts\
    \ on soil, water, and human health. Nanotechnology in PA can revolutionize crop\n\
    growth by improving efﬁciency and sustainability while reducing waste and environmental\n\
    impacts. The following points elucidate the integrative potential of nanotechnology\
    \ in\nconjunction with precision agriculture.\n2.1. Improved Nutrient Utilization\n\
    The global demand for increased food production continues to rise, necessitating\n\
    innovative approaches in agriculture that could enhance crop productivity while\
    \ min-\nimizing environmental impacts. Applying nano-scale materials, particularly\
    \ NFs, has\ndemonstrated the ability to improve crop nutrient utilization efﬁciency\
    \ while reducing\nthe adverse effects of over-fertilization [10]. Nanotechnology\
    \ can signiﬁcantly enhance\nthe efﬁciency of nutrient delivery to crops by encapsulating\
    \ nutrients in NPs, allowing\nfor targeted and controlled release [11]. NFs are\
    \ typically synthesized by encapsulating\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n223\nnutrients\
    \ within nano-scale carriers, such as metal oxide NPs or polymeric nanocapsules,\n\
    which allow for the controlled release of nutrients, minimizing nutrient losses\
    \ due to\nleaching or volatilization [12]. Studies have shown that the application\
    \ of NFs can result in\nsigniﬁcant improvements in nutrient uptake efﬁciency in\
    \ plants. For example, wheat grain\nyield was increased by 51% in a study when\
    \ ZnO NP-coated urea was applied compared\nto the control group [13]. Similarly,\
    \ zinc oxide NPs were reported to increase the zinc\nuptake efﬁciency in rice\
    \ plants, resulting in higher grain zinc content and improved plant\ngrowth [14].\
    \ In addition to enhancing nutrient utilization efﬁciency, nanotechnology-based\n\
    PA can also contribute to developing more targeted and sustainable nutrient management\n\
    practices. For instance, nano-sensors have been designed to monitor soil nutrient\
    \ levels,\nallowing farmers to optimize nutrient application rates and timings\
    \ based on real-time\ndata [15]. This approach not only improves nutrient utilization\
    \ in crops but also reduces\nthe environmental impacts of agriculture, such as\
    \ eutrophication and greenhouse gas\nemissions [4].\n2.2. Enhanced Pest Control\n\
    Nanotechnology-based PA offers a promising alternative to traditional pest control\n\
    methods, addressing challenges such as efﬁcacy, environmental impact, and safety\
    \ [16].\nIt enables the development of materials and devices at the nanoscale\
    \ level, allowing for\ntargeted and efﬁcient delivery of pesticides and other\
    \ pest control agents. Nanopesticides,\nfor instance, can improve the solubility\
    \ and stability of active ingredients, allowing for\ntargeted delivery and controlled\
    \ release, thus reducing the amount of pesticide needed\nand minimizing non-target\
    \ effects and environmental contamination [17]. Integrating\nnanopesticides with\
    \ PA enhances pest control by optimizing pesticide application based\non real-time\
    \ monitoring of pest populations and environmental conditions [18]. For exam-\n\
    ple, NPs can be engineered to target speciﬁc pests or plant structures, ensuring\
    \ efﬁcient\npesticide delivery and the development of new types of pesticides\
    \ that are effective at\nlower doses [19]. Nanotechnology-based PA also reduces\
    \ environmental impact, as NPs\nallow for more targeted delivery of pesticides,\
    \ minimizing the amount of pesticide re-\nleased into the environment. Examples\
    \ include the use of NPs to deliver RNA interference\n(RNAi) molecules for highly\
    \ targeted and effective pest control [19] and the use of nanocap-\nsules for\
    \ targeted pesticide delivery, improving efﬁcacy and reducing environmental re-\n\
    lease [20].\nFurthermore, nanotechnology-based PA improves safety for farmers\
    \ and consumers by\nminimizing direct pesticide exposure by developing less toxic\
    \ pesticides. Using nanobiosen-\nsors to detect pests and diseases early reduces\
    \ the need for large-scale pesticide applications\nand improves safety for farmers\
    \ and consumers [21].\nIn addition to the beneﬁts mentioned above, nanotechnology-based\
    \ PA promotes sus-\ntainable agriculture practices and contributes to increased\
    \ crop yields. The targeted delivery\nof pesticides and pest control agents using\
    \ NPs reduces the chemicals applied and helps\nprevent the development of pesticide-resistant\
    \ pests, which in turn ensures the long-term\neffectiveness of pest control measures\
    \ and contributes to overall agricultural sustainability.\nNanotechnology-based\
    \ PA also facilitates the development of innovative pest-control\nmethods. For\
    \ instance, researchers use nano-formulations by combining multiple pest\ncontrol\
    \ agents, such as biopesticides and chemical pesticides, to provide a synergistic\n\
    effect for improved pest control [22]. This approach can lead to better pest management\n\
    while reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Moreover, nanotechnology can\
    \ aid\nin monitoring and managing pest populations through advanced sensing and\
    \ diagnostic\ntechniques. Integrating nanobiosensors and remote sensing technologies\
    \ can provide\nreal-time data on pest populations, crop health, and environmental\
    \ conditions, enabling\nfarmers to make informed decisions regarding the optimal\
    \ timing and location of pesticide\napplication [21].\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n\
    224\n2.3. Advanced Environmental Monitoring\nNanotechnology stands as a transformative\
    \ force in advanced environmental moni-\ntoring within precision agriculture.\
    \ Its primary application lies in employing nanosensors\ncapable of continually\
    \ monitoring soil, water, and plant parameters. Such nanosensor-based\nmonitoring\
    \ provides indispensable data to optimize agricultural management practices [23].\n\
    Notably, these nanosensors can detect changes in soil parameters, including moisture,\
    \ nu-\ntrient levels, and pH. A prime instance of this utility is the deployment\
    \ of zinc oxide\nnanoparticles as nanosensors, which are particularly adept at\
    \ detecting phosphorus levels\nin the soil [24]. The precise detection abilities\
    \ of these nanosensors permit an optimal\napplication of water and fertilizers,\
    \ consequently preventing over- or under-fertilization\nand fostering healthier\
    \ crop growth. When integrated with precision agricultural technolo-\ngies, these\
    \ nanosensors signiﬁcantly enhance decision-making accuracy and efﬁciency [25],\n\
    boosting crop productivity and sustainability. Additionally, such a synergistic\
    \ integra-\ntion of nanosensors and precision agricultural technologies reduces\
    \ nutrient runoff and\nconserves water.\n2.4. Variable Rate Technology (VRT)\n\
    Variable rate technology (VRT) is a critical component of PA that allows for the\
    \ precise\ndelivery of inputs, such as fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides,\
    \ based on variations in soil\ntype and crop health. Farmers can reduce waste,\
    \ optimize crop growth, and maximize\nyields by applying inputs only where needed.\
    \ NPs can further enhance the effectiveness\nof VRT by serving as carriers for\
    \ these inputs. VRT-based NPs can be used as carriers\nfor fertilizers, herbicides,\
    \ and pesticides, allowing for precise delivery of these inputs to\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld\
    \ areas, which is particularly useful in situations where there are variations\
    \ in\nsoil type or crop health, as NPs can be targeted to areas where inputs are\
    \ needed most [26].\nIn addition, VRT can adapt the appropriate seeding rate for\
    \ each ﬁeld type [27]. The use of\nnanocarriers in VRT has several advantages.\
    \ First, using nanocarriers allows for the precise\ndelivery of inputs, reducing\
    \ waste and minimizing the risk of environmental damage.\nSecond, nanocarriers\
    \ can protect inputs from degradation, increasing their effectiveness\nand reducing\
    \ the need for reapplication. Nanocarriers can help optimize crop growth by\n\
    delivering inputs only where needed (Figure 2).\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2, FOR PEER\

    \ Nanosensors are tiny sensors designed\nto detect speciﬁc compounds or environmental\

    \ efﬁciency in various ways in automated machinery. For example, nanosensors\n\
    can monitor soil moisture levels, allowing automated irrigation systems to adjust\
    \ water\ndelivery rates in real-time. By providing accurate and timely feedback\
    \ on soil moisture\nlevels, nanosensors can help prevent overwatering or underwatering,\
    \ which can negatively\nimpact crop growth.\nIn addition to soil moisture, nanosensors\
    \ can detect various environmental conditions,\nsuch as temperature, humidity,\
    \ and nutrient levels [24]. This information can then be\nused by automated machinery\
    \ to adjust operations in real-time, optimizing crop growth\nand minimizing waste.\
    \ The integration of nanosensors with automated machinery has\nseveral advantages.\
    \ First, it allows for more precise and efﬁcient operations, reducing\nwaste and\
    \ optimizing crop growth. Second, it reduces the need for human intervention,\n\
    freeing up labor resources for other tasks. Also, it can provide farmers with\
    \ real-time\nfeedback on environmental conditions, allowing them to make informed\
    \ decisions about\ncrop management.\n2.6. Data Analytics\nData analytics is critical\
    \ in PA, allowing farmers to make informed decisions about\nplanting, fertilizing,\
    \ and harvesting crops. NPs can improve the accuracy and precision of\ndata collection,\
    \ leading to more reliable analytics. For instance, farmers may employ NPs\nto\
    \ better understand the state of their crops by testing for the presence of certain\
    \ chemicals\nor diseases in soil or water samples.\nNanoparticles (NPs) can serve\
    \ as sensors to identify contaminants in water and soil.\nFor example, gold NPs\
    \ can be used to detect the presence of heavy metals in soil samples.\nIn a study,\
    \ researchers developed a sensor based on rGO/AuNPs/tetraphenyl porphyrin\nnanoconjugate-based\
    \ electrochemical sensors that could detect cadmium ions in food and\nsoil samples\
    \ with high sensitivity and selectivity [28]. Similarly, magnetic NPs can be used\n\
    to detect the presence of bacteria or viruses in water samples and successfully\
    \ remove\nthem [29]. In a study, researchers developed a magnetic nanoparticle-based\
    \ biosensor that\ncould detect Escherichia coli in water samples with high sensitivity\
    \ and speciﬁcity [30].\n2.7. Nanomaterials Use in Plant Growth\nThe application\
    \ of nanomaterials in agriculture has gained increasing attention due\nto their\
    \ potential to enhance plant growth and productivity. Among the different types\n\
    of nanomaterials, nanocarbon, nanocellulose, and nanolignocellulose have been\
    \ reported\nto have promising effects on plant growth. Nanocarbons, including\
    \ carbon nanotubes\n(CNTs), graphene, and fullerenes, have shown great potential\
    \ for improving plant growth.\nFor example, a study showed that applying CNTs\
    \ to tomato plants signiﬁcantly increased\ngrowth [31]. Similarly, graphene oxide\
    \ (GO) application can enhance plant growth. A\nstudy found that applying GO to\
    \ wheat seedlings increased plant height, root length,\nand dry weight [32]. Nanocellulose,\
    \ including cellulose nanoﬁbrils (CNFs) and cellulose\nnanocrystals (CNCs), has\
    \ been shown to stimulate plant development [33,34]. CNFs have\nbeen shown to\
    \ enhance root growth and increase the absorption of water and nutrients\nby plants.\
    \ In addition, cellulose anionic hydrogel-based nanoﬁbers beneﬁt sesame seed\n\
    germination [35].\nNanolignocellulose, a combination of lignin and cellulose NPs,\
    \ has also been reported\nto affect plant growth positively. Nanolignocellulose\
    \ is known to enhance the absorption of\nwater and nutrients by plants and promote\
    \ the development of root hairs. A study found\ncellulose nanoﬁbre application\
    \ can change soybean leaf surface hydrophobicity, conferring\nresistance against\
    \ Phakopsora pachyrhizi, an obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen [36].\n2.8. Summary\
    \ of Synergies between Precision Agriculture and Nanotechnology\nThe synergies\
    \ between precision agriculture (PA) and nanotechnology can revolution-\nize sustainable\
    \ crop growth by improving efﬁciency and sustainability. Key sectors such as\n\
    nutrient supply, pest management, environmental monitoring, variable rate technology,\n\
    Agrochemicals 2023, 2\n226\nautomated machinery, and data analytics can beneﬁt\
    \ from integrating modern technolo-\ngies and data-driven decision-making tools\
    \ with nanoscale materials and devices. The\nintegration can lead to better nutrient\
    \ utilization, targeted and efﬁcient pesticide delivery,\nreal-time monitoring\
    \ of soil and plant parameters, and precise input delivery, ultimately\noptimizing\
    \ crop yields, reducing waste, and minimizing environmental impacts.\n3. Advantages\
    \ of Nanotechnology in the Agriculture Systems\n3.1. Improved Seed Germination\
    \ and Plant Growth\nThe need for increased crop production necessitates a higher\
    \ seed germination rate or\npercentage. However, environmental contamination and\
    \ several abiotic stressors deleteri-\nously affect seed germination and seedling\
    \ vitality [37]. Low seed viability is a signiﬁcant\nissue in arid and semiarid\
    \ regions because abiotic variables are known to delay seed ger-\nmination. In\
    \ addition, laboratory-tested seeds with higher germination rates frequently\n\
    fail ﬁeld tests. [38]. Such problems require a deliberate strategy for resolution.\
    \ There are\nvarious methods to improve a low seed germination rate. The technique\
    \ of priming such\nseeds with NPs has recently attracted the scientiﬁc community’s\
    \ interest. In recent years,\nthe inﬂuence of NM on seed germination has been\
    \ scrutinized to increase the germination\nrate. In a study, TiO2 NPs enhanced\
    \ spinach germination, dry weight, and chlorophyll\ncontent [39]. Biopriming with\
    \ plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) improves seed\ngermination and crop\
    \ development through several mechanisms. Priming using metal\noxide NPs with\
    \ PGPR for “bionanoseed” has been tried, but it requires additional research\n\
    to identify a reliable approach for enhancing germination [40].\nContrarily, several\
    \ NPs have been shown to inhibit seed germination due to toxicity\neffects [41–43].\
    \ Recent developments have assessed the toxicity of NPs in vitro, in vivo,\nand\
    \ at the biomolecular level [44,45]. The toxicity of NP to seeds depends on NP\
    \ size, seed\nsize, and the capacity of the seed surface to absorb NP. Consequently,\
    \ research is necessary\nto identify plant-speciﬁc NPs and their application rates\
    \ [40]. Table 1 shows the effect of\nsome NPs on plant seed germination.\nTable\

    \ in minute amounts for growth. Contrarily, most of the\nagricultural land is\
    \ deﬁcient in many micronutrients. The crops grown in such regions\nsuffer from\
    \ yield loss due to micronutrient deﬁciency. The consumption of micronutrient-\n\
    Agrochemicals 2023, 2\n227\ndeﬁcient foods affects human health, thus causing\
    \ anemia, growth reduction, reduced\nreproduction capabilities, and decreased\
    \ mental and physical ability [59]. The Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA, Silver\
    \ Spring, MD, USA) of the USA approves healthy and\nnutritious food for a healthy\
    \ and long life [60]. Such soils, therefore, need fortiﬁcation\nin the form of\
    \ fertilizers. The fraction of micronutrients added as fertilizer reaches the\n\
    plant. Excess micronutrients get washed off with rain into local water bodies.\
    \ In addition,\nmicronutrients present in the soil gradually chelate and become\
    \ unavailable to the plant.\nOf the total micronutrient-based fertilizer applied\
    \ to the soil, less than 5% is used by plants\ndue to the supply-demand gap between\
    \ micronutrient fertilizer and plants [61].\nUsing NPs loaded with micronutrients\
    \ could strategically solve the problem of mi-\ncronutrient wastage through targeted\
    \ delivery to the nutrient demand sites. Due to their\nsmaller dimensions and\
    \ higher surface area, certain NPs can act as nutrient carriers. Mi-\ncronutrients\
    \ attached to NPs are released slowly into the soil to ensure constant availability.\n\
    The NF has a smaller size and a high speciﬁc surface, increasing solubility, diffusion,\
    \ and\navailability of nutrients in plants. Through the slow release of micronutrients\
    \ from fertilizer\ngranules, NF can control nutrient release from fertilizers,\
    \ thus improving plant nutrient use\nefﬁciency, which restricts nutrients from\
    \ getting ﬁxed in the soil and thus preventing their\nrelease into the environment\
    \ [62]. Micronutrients enclosed inside NP microcapsules are\nquickly absorbed\
    \ and translocated within the plant, effectively nourishing it. NFs are highly\n\
    water-soluble structures, remain stable for longer durations, hold higher effectiveness\
    \ after\nﬁeld application, can be controlled for timely release, are highly speciﬁc,\
    \ less eco-toxic, and\npossess simple delivery and disposal modes [63]. NPs deliver\
    \ nutrients to target sites in\nplant root systems. Nutrients are loaded on NPs\
    \ by adsorption, and further attachment of\nNPs is mediated with ligands, followed\
    \ by encapsulation in a nanoparticulate polymeric\nshell and entrapment in the\
    \ polymer [63].\n3.3. Biotic and Abiotic Plant Stress Alleviation\nBiotic stress\
    \ refers to stress caused by living organisms, such as pests and diseases, while\n\
    non-living factors like drought, salinity, and heavy metal toxicity cause abiotic\
    \ stress [64].\nSeveral NPs are reported to alleviate biotic and abiotic stress\
    \ in plants (Table 2) [65]. NPs\nhave been shown to improve plant growth, yield,\
    \ and quality by enhancing photosynthesis,\nnitrogen absorption, and stress tolerance\
    \ [66]. NPs can also help manage biotic stress by\nacting as natural pesticides\
    \ and herbicides or inducing plant systemic resistance [67–69].\nSimilarly, NPs\
    \ can alleviate abiotic stress by reducing oxidative damage and enhancing\nplant\
    \ antioxidant defense systems. Different types of NPs, such as metal-based, metal\n\
    oxide-based, carbon-based, and polymer-based, have been investigated for their\
    \ potential\nin plant stress alleviation. For example, soil application of silver\
    \ NPs enhanced plant\ngrowth and reduced biotic stress due to Aspergillus in rice\
    \ by inhibiting the growth of\npathogens [70]. Similarly, zinc oxide NPs based\
    \ sprays alleviated abiotic stress in tomato\nplants by reducing oxidative plant\
    \ damage [71].\nTable 2. Alleviation of various types of abiotic and biotic plant\

    \ agricultural input that requires a substantial quantity of land and\nwater.\
    \ Due to the uncontrolled use of pesticides, fertilizers, and other agrochemicals\
    \ on\nfarms, the local water bodies, underground water, rivers, and canals become\
    \ increasingly\npolluted [86]. Recent advances in agricultural technology aid\
    \ in preventing soil and water\ncontamination on agricultural property. In addition,\
    \ the solutions are accessible in the\nform of impervious materials capable of\
    \ retaining water and releasing it slowly as needed.\nTogether with wireless nanosensors,\
    \ this technique could cut water intake and aid in\ndrought mitigation. In addition,\
    \ nanotechnology could assist in mitigating multiple types\nof stress to increase\
    \ plant yield and promote sustainable agriculture.\n3.4. Improved Plant Fertilization\
    \ in Lower Dosage\nResearch studies have demonstrated that applying NPs can improve\
    \ plant growth and\nproductivity. Various types of NPs, such as those prepared\
    \ by polymerization, emulsiﬁca-\ntion, oxide reduction, and ionic gelation, effectively\
    \ enhance crop yields [87]. The majority\nof such types of NPs are comprised of\
    \ TIO2 and CNTs. Additionally, NPs of Au, SiO2, and\nZnO help plant growth by\
    \ boosting their ability to absorb nutrients [88].\nNFs have a greater surface\
    \ area for facilitating various plant metabolic reactions,\nincreasing the photosynthesis\
    \ rate to yield higher dry matter and crop yield. NF possesses\ndifferent physical\
    \ and chemical properties than bulk materials. For example, when applied\nin nanoform,\
    \ rock phosphate increases phosphorus availability in the plant since the\nnanorock\
    \ phosphate’s direct application prevents ﬁxation by soil [89]. The chief reason\
    \ for\nthe great attention on NF in the agricultural scientiﬁc community is its\
    \ high penetration\ncapacity, smaller size, and higher surface area. This material\
    \ is unique due to speciﬁc\nproperties that set it apart from comparable bulk\
    \ materials. NF, in particular, is either\nsynthesized from chemical fertilizers\
    \ or derived from plants using nanotechnology. The\nspeciﬁc production method\
    \ enhances its capacity to improve soil fertility and boost crop\nproductivity.\
    \ NF can aid PA by improving crop yield and quality with optimum nutrient\nAgrochemicals\
    \ 2023, 2\n229\nuptake and reducing fertilizer waste. They can manage nutrient\
    \ availability that matches\ncrop growth and could be able to provide nutrients\
    \ throughout the growth period of the\nplant. NFs can increase soil fertility\
    \ and are non-toxic and cost-effective as they are required\nin lesser amounts.\
    \ Developing nanocomposites could facilitate the requirement of all\nessential\
    \ nutrients through an intelligent delivery system.\nFurther studies on nanonutrient\
    \ delivery in plant systems are needed to understand\nthe effects on soil bacteria\
    \ better. In addition, the fate of delivered NPs is required to be\nstudied for\
    \ optimized dose concentrations for PA. The NF holds a high surface area due\n\
    to its small particle size, facilitating high reactivity with other compounds.\
    \ Additionally,\nsuch NPs readily solubilize in water and other solvents. The\
    \ particle size of less than\n100 nm facilitates seamless penetration of NPs on\
    \ plant-applied surfaces, such as leaves.\nThe NP-encapsulated fertilizers enhance\
    \ the availability of nutrients to crop plants. For\nexample, NF developed from\
    \ zeolite releases nutrients slowly, preventing nutrient loss\ndue to denitriﬁcation,\
    \ volatilization, and leaching in soil, mainly nitrate and ammonia [90].\nThe\
    \ effect of NF on seed germination and plant growth is well documented [91–94].\
    \ NPs\ncould penetrate directly inside seeds through the seed coat and alter the\
    \ state of seed\ndormancy. The seed germination effect of NPs could be negative\
    \ or positive, depending on\nthe NP property [95]. For example, ZnO NPs impart\
    \ toxicity to the root growth of garlic\n(Allium sativum L.) [96]. However, higher\
    \ than the optimum concentration of NPs could\nalso reduce instances of seed germination.\
    \ In one study, the ZnO-based NPs application\nyielded higher peanut seed germination\
    \ and root growth [97].\nMedical science employs nanotechnology for targeted drug\
    \ delivery. Similarly, in\nagriculture, nanotechnology has been repurposed to\
    \ enhance the uptake and delivery of\nnutrients to plants. Nanometric transport\
    \ platforms allow improved nutrient penetration\ninto plant cells, increasing\
    \ plant growth, yield, and quality. NPs can be engineered to en-\ncapsulate nutrients\
    \ such as fertilizers, micronutrients, and pesticides, allowing for targeted\n\
    delivery of these substances to plant roots or leaves.\nThe following types of\
    \ fertilizers can be delivered to plants using NPs:\n3.4.1. Delivery of Biofertilizers\n\
    Biofertilizers include live microorganisms that improve plant growth. Microorganisms\n\
    like mycorrhizal fungi, Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Pseudomonas, and\
    \ blue-green\nalgae are common biofertilizers used in agricultural practices [97].\
    \ These microorganisms\nconvert complex organic matter into simpler compounds\
    \ readily usable by plants. These\ncompounds increase crop productivity. However,\
    \ biofertilizers often fail to produce sat-\nisfactory results in the ﬁeld due\
    \ to storage issues, temperature sensitivity, and shorter\nshelf life [98]. Liquid\
    \ biofertilizers containing water-in-oil emulsions and additives are\nused to\
    \ remove the effects of desiccation. However, prolonged storage of living organisms\n\
    in liquid biofertilizers still diminishes their vitality. Coating biofertilizer\
    \ with polymeric\nNPs improves the desiccation resistance of the biofertilizer\
    \ inoculum. Also, incorporating\nhydrophobic silica NPs in liquid formulations\
    \ improves cellular viability by thickening the\noil phase during storage [99].\
    \ Certain NPs, when applied with PGPRs like Pseudomonas\nﬂuorescens, Bacillus\
    \ subtilis, and Paenibacillus elgii demonstrate plant growth promotion\nin vitro.\
    \ In addition, NPs are needed in minute quantities compared to chemical fertilizers.\n\
    One liter of nanobiofertilizer can fertilize many hectares of crops. Among NPs,\
    \ gold and\nsilver have been studied extensively. The application of gold NPs\
    \ in conjunction with\nP. ﬂuorescens, P. elgii, and B. subtilis has shown appreciable\
    \ plant growth promotion [100].\n3.4.2. Delivery of Chemical Fertilizers\nChemical\
    \ fertilizers are applied to arable land to meet the soil’s N, P, and K shortages.\n\
    Using ammonia, urea, nitrate, and phosphate-based fertilizers has considerably\
    \ enhanced\ncrop production [101]. However, their application is not free from\
    \ harmful effects. Usually,\nchemical fertilizers are applied to the soil in excess.\
    \ The estimate shows that 40–70% N,\n80–90% P, and 50–70% K-based fertilizers\
    \ are lost in the environment, causing environ-\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n230\n\
    mental pollution [102]. The nanomaterials can mitigate water pollution and algal\
    \ blooms\ncaused by the plant’s discharge of unused fertilizer runoff into nearby\
    \ water bodies and\nrivers. Nanomaterials have a higher surface tension than conventional\
    \ materials, allowing\nthem to sustain the release of fertilizers more effectively.\
    \ For instance, nano-hydroxyapatite,\na nanoscale phosphate fertilizer, has signiﬁcantly\
    \ enhanced phosphorus use efﬁciency\ncompared to conventional phosphate fertilizers\
    \ [103].\nNMs can also be used as a coating material to limit fertilizers’ environmental\
    \ re-\nlease [104]. For example, urea particles coated with zinc oxide nanoparticles\
    \ have been\nreported to demonstrate a slower nutrient release rate, thus minimizing\
    \ nutrient leaching\ninto the environment [105,106]. This approach allows plants\
    \ to use the applied fertilizers\nmore efﬁciently, reducing their environmental\
    \ footprint (Figure 3). By coating NM on\nfertilizer crystals, the excessive release\
    \ of fertilizers into water bodies and rivers can be\nlowered, reducing pollution\
    \ and mitigating the risks of algal blooms (Figure 3).\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2,\

    \ population explosion has led to a steep rise in demand for food, \nwhich has\
    \ subsequently driven an unprecedented increase in the worldwide pesticide mar-\n\
    ket. Unfortunately, many of these agrochemicals are finding their way into the\
    \ human food \nchain, causing harm to both human and animal health, agriculture,\
    \ and the ecosystem as a \nwhole. The application of higher doses of pesticides\
    \ is often necessary due to the develop-\nment of pest resistance resulting from\
    \ increased pesticide application rates [107]. In addi-\ntion, the use of pesticides\
    \ has substantially reduced the number of non-target insects, such \nas honey\
    \ bees [108]. Unfortunately, these chemicals are not limited to agricultural areas\
    \ and \nare present in the air, water, and soil, ultimately poisoning our environment\
    \ [109]. Reducing \npesticide use is crucial for mitigating environmental pollution\
    \ and decreasing crop pro-\nduction costs.  \nSeveral studies have demonstrated\
    \ the impact of metal NPs on insects and fungi. \nModified approaches for pesticide\
    \ delivery can help achieve this goal. NPs facilitate the \ntransfer of pesticides\
    \ or genes into plant cells and tissues to protect plants from pests [110]. \n\
    Nanocapsules can deliver nanoencapsulation. Unlike bigger particles, nanoencapsulation\
    \ \nallows targeted distribution, reduced dosage, and environmental protection\
    \ [111]. Nano-\ntechnology can contribute to the more efficient use of pesticides.\
    \ For instance, nanoferti-\nlizers and nanopesticides have been developed to be\
    \ applied directly to plant surfaces or \nroots [112]. These materials have a\
    \ higher surface area-to-volume ratio, resulting in better \nplant uptake and\
    \ utilization, reducing the need for excessive chemical application, and \nminimizing\
    \ the environmental impact and potential harm to human health. Another ap-\nplication\
    \ involves using nanomaterials for smart delivery systems, such as hydrogels or\
    \ \nnanocapsules, that release nutrients or pesticides slowly and in a controlled\
    \ manner [113]. \nThese systems help ensure plants receive the right resources\

    \ The application of higher doses of pesticides is often necessary due to the\n\
    development of pest resistance resulting from increased pesticide application\
    \ rates [107]. In\naddition, the use of pesticides has substantially reduced the\
    \ number of non-target insects,\nsuch as honey bees [108]. Unfortunately, these\

    \ help ensure plants receive the right resources at the right time, reducing\n\
    waste and environmental pollution.\nThe persistence of chemical pesticides in\
    \ the soil is harming the environment. Using\nnanopesticides can retain their\
    \ efﬁcacy for longer durations within plant tissues, potentially\nreducing the\
    \ need for repeated chemical pesticides [114]. Nanopesticide use may mitigate\n\
    pesticide persistence by sustaining lower insect populations for longer durations,\
    \ requiring\nless pesticide overall [114]. The “controlled release” approach is\
    \ an effective way to reduce\npesticide input and mitigate environmental issues.\

    \ plants\n[133]\nThe following sub-section describes the various types of available\
    \ nanoparticle-based\npesticides that have been experimented.\n3.5.1. Use as Nanoinsecticides\n\
    Several NM, notably Ag, have insecticidal effects against most plant insects [134].\
    \ The\nNM system activated by the environment is already being utilized in medicine\
    \ [135]. How-\never, its agricultural applicability is modest. In agriculture,\
    \ numerous nanoformulations\nwith delayed release have been created. However,\
    \ few NPs employ an environmental\ntrigger to release nanoinsecticides [136].\
    \ In addition, it is challenging to develop such\ninsecticides due to the dynamic\
    \ character of pest occurrences. However, if applied to\npesticides, the most\
    \ anticipated method might alter the nature of agriculture by remov-\ning the\
    \ harmful effects of agrochemical applications by drastically lowering application\n\
    rates. Such agents should respond to the external environment by releasing intelligent\
    \ and\neffective pesticides. Microcapsule-based pesticide formulations exemplify\
    \ the potential\nof nanopesticide technology, which might result in reduced insecticide\
    \ use and tailored\ndelivery to lessen environmental impacts, resulting in low\
    \ toxicity. In addition, the shelf\nlife of these substances is typically longer\
    \ than that of chemical pesticides.\nSeveral nanoparticle formulations were made\
    \ against phytopathogens and insect\npests [20,67–69,114,137]. For example, ZnO–TiO2–Ag\
    \ NPs were efﬁcient against Frankliniella\noccidentalis Pergande, while Ag–Zn\
    \ NPs were beneﬁcial against Aphis nerii [138]. Nanosilica\noffers unique insecticidal\
    \ characteristics. Nanosilica absorbs insect cuticular lipids and\nkills the insects.\
    \ The surface-charged nanosilica is effective against various agriculturally\n\
    signiﬁcant insect pests [139].\n3.5.2. Use as Nanofungicides\nPhytopathogenic\
    \ fungi account for around $45 billion yearly in crop losses world-\nwide [140].\
    \ Annually, the globe consumes 2.5 million tons of pesticides, resulting in about\n\
    $100 billion in expenditures [141]. Chemical treatments for fungus control have\
    \ harmed the\nenvironment and slowed economic growth since 90 percent of applied\
    \ agrochemicals are\nlost in open ﬁelds owing to overland ﬂow, damaging the ecosystem\
    \ and raising farmers’\ncosts [140].\nNanopesticides are the future of conventional\
    \ pesticides, which have a higher pest\nfatality rate, are long-lasting, and need\
    \ minimal treatment [88]. Nanofungicides reportedly\neliminate fungal diseases\
    \ from crops grown in irrigated ﬁelds or hydroponics, providing\nno environmental\
    \ risks [142,143]. NPs eliminate fungal phytopathogens that attach to S\nprotein\
    \ groups of the cytosolic membrane by modifying cell permeability, damaging DNA,\n\
    interfering with protein oxidation and the electron transport chain of the cell,\
    \ creating reac-\ntive oxygen species, and inhibiting nutrient intake [144]. They\
    \ are applied as foliar sprays\nto combat phytopathogens, which can also promote\
    \ plant development [145]. Metallic\nNP-containing agrochemicals ﬁnd widespread\
    \ application as nanofungicides.\n3.5.3. Use as Nanoherbicides\nHerbicides serve\
    \ a signiﬁcant role in crop protection via weed management. How-\never, its extensive\
    \ use has caused environmental and economic issues. Large volumes\nof herbicides\
    \ are applied to crops since their absorption rates in plants are less than one\n\
    Agrochemicals 2023, 2\n233\npercent [146]. Frequently, farmers use herbicides\
    \ at higher concentrations than recom-\nmended to promote crop development [147].\
    \ These practices foster the emergence of\nherbicide-resistant weeds. Herbicide\
    \ resistance is a severe problem in agriculture, and new\nchemicals and strategies\
    \ are needed to address it. One major goal of nanotechnology-based\nprecision\
    \ agriculture is reducing the need for and the environmental damage caused by\n\
    pesticides. Nanotechnology interventions in the agricultural herbicide business\
    \ might solve\nthe chemical residue problem in an environmentally responsible\
    \ manner without leaving\nany residues in the environment.\nIn such methods, herbicides\
    \ are charged with NM before application to promote plant\nbioavailability and\
    \ enhance weed elimination. Nanoherbicide development hinges on the\nselection\
    \ of NM. The herbicidal chemical must ﬁt the dimensions of the to-be-used NM and,\n\
    preferably, interact with NM via chemical bonds. In one study, the application\
    \ of ten times\ndiluted poly (-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocapsules containing atrazine\
    \ to Amaranthus viridis\n(slender amaranth) and Bidens pilosa (hairy beggarticks)\
    \ inhibited fungal growth similar\nto a commercial formulation containing conventional\
    \ atrazine doses [148]. In another\nstudy, nanoencapsulation of the herbicides\
    \ imazapic and imazapyr effectively reduced\ntheir toxicity, potentially minimizing\
    \ the impact on non-target organisms and the wider\nenvironment [149].\n3.6. Summary\
    \ of Advantages of Nanotechnology in the Agriculture Systems\nThis section highlighted\
    \ the advantages of nanotechnology in agriculture, including\nimproved seed germination\
    \ and plant growth, enhanced micronutrient supply, alleviation\nof biotic and\
    \ abiotic plant stress, and the ability to use lower dosages of fertilizers and\n\
    pesticides through efﬁcient delivery methods. Nanotechnology can assist in delivering\
    \ both\nbiofertilizers and chemical fertilizers and can also be used to formulate\

    \ in Agriculture Systems\nNanotechnology has been hailed as a revolutionary technology\
    \ with the potential to\ntransform various industries, including agriculture.\
    \ While nanotechnology has promising\napplications in agriculture, it also poses\
    \ several potential drawbacks and risks that cannot\nbe overlooked.\nNPs are tiny\
    \ and can be easily carried by air or water currents, making them difﬁcult\nto\
    \ contain. When released into the environment, NPs can accumulate in the soil,\
    \ water,\nand air, leading to potential ecological risks. For example, NPs can\
    \ disrupt the soil’s\nbalance of macro and microorganisms, causing a decline in\
    \ fertility [167–169]. They can\nalso accumulate in plants and animals, potentially\
    \ leading to adverse health effects [170].\nThe use of nanotechnology in agriculture\
    \ raises concerns about human health. Expo-\nsure to NPs can have adverse health\
    \ effects, such as respiratory problems, cardiovascular\ndisease, and neurological\
    \ damage [171]. Workers involved in producing and applying\nnanomaterials in agriculture\
    \ are at a higher risk of nanoparticle exposure, which can\nhave long-term health\
    \ implications. In addition, nanotechnology in agriculture requires\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ investment in research and development, which can be costly. Additionally,\n\
    nanotechnology in agriculture may not be accessible to small-scale farmers who\
    \ cannot\nafford the high costs of nanomaterials and related technologies, leading\
    \ to an imbalance in\nthe distribution of beneﬁts from nanotechnology.\nUsing\
    \ nanotechnology in agriculture raises ethical concerns about food safety and\n\
    security [172]. There is a fear that nanomaterials in food may pose a risk to\
    \ human health\nand safety, and limited research on the long-term effects of NPs\
    \ exposure is available [173].\nAdditionally, using nanotechnology in agriculture\
    \ may result in genetically modiﬁed\norganisms (GMOs) that raise ethical concerns\
    \ for some people [174].\nSummary of Disadvantages of Nanotechnology in Agriculture\n\
    Nanotechnology in agriculture is a relatively new technology, and there is limited\n\
    regulation and oversight to ensure its safe and responsible use (Table 5). The\
    \ lack of\nregulation raises concerns about the potential risks of using nanotechnology\
    \ in agriculture\nand the need for robust regulations to protect human health\
    \ and the environment [175,176].\nTable 5. Disadvantages of nanotechnology in\
    \ agriculture.\nDisadvantage\nDescription\nReference\nEcological risks\nAccumulate\
    \ in soil, water, and air, disturbing soil microbes and lowering soil fertility\n\

    \ and\napplying nanomaterials.\n[171]\nHigh costs\nCostly and could lead to an\

    \ able to afford it.\n[178]\nEthical concerns\nRaises concerns about food safety\
    \ and security, with limited research on the long-term\neffects of consuming NPs\
    \ and ethical concerns about GMOs.\n[179]\nLack of regulation\nLimited regulation\
    \ and oversight raise concerns about potential risks and the need for\nrobust\
    \ regulations to protect human health and the environment.\n[176]\nAgrochemicals\
    \ 2023, 2\n235\n5. Types of Nanotechnology Based Nanodiagnostic Systems\nPlant\
    \ pathology studies plant diseases, their causes, and prevention and control\n\
    methods. Nanodiagnostic systems are an emerging ﬁeld in plant pathology where\
    \ nan-\notechnology is used for the early and accurate detection of plant diseases.\
    \ These systems\nuse nanoscale materials, such as metal NPs, quantum dots, and\
    \ nanobarcodes, to detect\nphytopathogens early.\nThe following subsections discuss\
    \ various available nanodiagnostic systems under\nprecision agriculture.\n5.1.\
    \ Metal Nanoparticle-Based Systems\nMetal nanoparticle-based systems are widely\
    \ used in detecting phytopathogens. These\nsystems are based on metal NPs, such\
    \ as gold, silver, and magnetic NPs, which are func-\ntionalized with speciﬁc\
    \ probes that recognize the target pathogen. Metal NPs have unique\noptical and\
    \ magnetic properties that can be used to detect phytopathogens. For example,\n\
    gold NPs can be functionalized with DNA probes to detect plant viruses [180].\n\
    5.2. Functional Quantum Dots\nFunctional quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor\
    \ nanocrystals that can be used to\ndetect phytopathogens. QDs emit light at speciﬁc\
    \ wavelengths when excited by a light\nsource. They are highly sensitive, have\
    \ a broad range of excitation wavelengths, and exhibit\nhigh photostability. These\
    \ nanocrystals have unique optical properties, such as ﬂuorescence,\nwhich can\
    \ be used to detect phytopathogens [181]. In phytopathogen detection, QDs are\n\
    often functionalized with speciﬁc biomolecules, such as antibodies or nucleic\
    \ acids that\nbind to pathogen-speciﬁc molecules. As a result, infections can\
    \ be found selectively in very\ncomplex biological matrices. For example, functional\
    \ quantum dots can detect bacterial\npathogens in plants [182]. QDs can detect\
    \ pathogens at very low concentrations, enabling\nearly disease detection. Additionally,\
    \ QDs are highly stable, allowing them to be used over\nmultiple detection cycles,\
    \ making them a cost-effective option.\nMoreover, QDs are highly versatile, as\
    \ they can be designed to detect a wide range\nof phytopathogens, including viruses,\
    \ bacteria, and fungi, allowing for a comprehensive\napproach to disease detection\
    \ and management [182]. QDs possess signiﬁcant potential for\nintegration with\
    \ other advanced technologies, including microﬂuidics and lab-on-a-chip\nsystems,\
    \ facilitating the development of highly sensitive, portable diagnostic instruments.\n\
    Such synergistic technological combinations may prove exceptionally beneﬁcial\
    \ in ﬁeld-\nwork scenarios where swift, precise pathogen detection is integral\
    \ to effective disease\nmanagement. However, the use of QDs in phytopathogen detection\
    \ is still relatively new.\nFurther research is needed to fully understand their\
    \ potential and limitations, including\nconcerns about their toxicity and environmental\
    \ impact.\n5.3. Nanofabrication Imaging\nNanofabrication imaging uses nanofabrication\
    \ technology to produce high-resolution\nphotographs of plant diseases. This technique\
    \ can detect phytopathogens early, which can\nhelp prevent the spread of the disease.\
    \ For example, nanofabrication imaging can detect\nfungal pathogens in plants\
    \ [182].\nNanofabrication techniques, such as electron beam lithography and nanoimprinting,\n\
    create high-resolution nanostructures that speciﬁcally bind to target pathogens.\
    \ These\nstructures can be designed to amplify the signal produced by the target\
    \ pathogen, resulting\nin increased detection sensitivity. For example, nanofabricated\
    \ biosensors can sensitively\ndetect speciﬁc biomolecules, such as DNA or proteins,\
    \ from phytopathogens [183]. In\naddition, the nanopillars functionalized with\
    \ speciﬁc antibodies bound to the virus cause\nchanges in the optical properties\
    \ of the nanopillars that could be detected using a micro-\nscope [184]. The researchers\
    \ detected the virus at concentrations as low as 42–48 picograms\nper liter, demonstrating\
    \ the technique’s high sensitivity [185].\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n236\n5.4. Nanopore\
    \ System\nThe nanopore system is a real-time DNA sequencing technology that identiﬁes\
    \ phy-\ntopathogens. The system consists of a handheld device connected to a laptop\
    \ or smartphone,\nmaking it easy to use and highly portable. Nanopore systems\
    \ use nanopores, which are tiny\npores in a membrane, to detect phytopathogens.\
    \ These systems work by passing a sample\nthrough the nanopore, and the changes\
    \ in electrical current caused by the interaction of\nthe sample with the nanopore\
    \ are measured. One of the main advantages of the nanopore\nsystem is its portability.\
    \ The system can be used in the ﬁeld to rapidly diagnose phy-\ntopathogens, especially\
    \ in remote areas or places with limited access to laboratory facilities.\nIn\
    \ the nanopore system, DNA or RNA sequence of the pathogen is matched with\nthe\
    \ public databases of nucleotides. The system detects a wide range of phytopathogens.\n\
    For example, the system can detect viruses in plants [186]. Unlike traditional\
    \ diagnostic\ntechniques that require prior knowledge of the pathogen, such as\
    \ bacteria, fungi, viruses,\nviroids, and phytoplasmas, the nanopore system can\
    \ detect any pathogen sequence and\nmatch it with DNA sequence available in public\
    \ databases. In addition, the nanopore\nsystem provides real-time results, which\
    \ can help make immediate decisions about disease\nmanagement strategies. The\
    \ system can also monitor disease progression and evaluate the\neffectiveness\
    \ of disease control measures. The technology allows for the sequencing of long\n\
    reads in a short time and with high-throughput data analysis in real-time, thus\
    \ enabling\nthe identiﬁcation of putative pathogens in samples with unidentiﬁed\
    \ disease agents by\nDNA or RNA sequencing, which conventional diagnostic procedures\
    \ can validate.\n5.5. Nanobarcodes\nNanobarcodes are unique codes attached to\
    \ NPs and can be used to identify phy-\ntopathogens. These codes can be read using\
    \ specialized equipment to identify the speciﬁc\npathogen. For example, nanobarcodes\
    \ can identify bacterial phytopathogens [187]. Nano-\nbarcodes consist of a unique\
    \ combination of NPs that act as barcodes and can be used to\nidentify speciﬁc\
    \ pathogens. Nanobarcodes detect very low concentrations of pathogens and\nare\
    \ designed to detect a wide range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and\
    \ fungi.\nNanobarcodes may be utilized in various detection techniques, including\
    \ lateral ﬂow\nassays, which are simple and quick ﬁeld-based examinations [188].\
    \ Nanobarcode usage in\nthese tests can improve their sensitivity and speciﬁcity,\
    \ yielding more accurate and reliable\nresults [189]. Nanobarcodes can also be\
    \ used in other detection methods, such as microar-\nrays and biosensors, which\
    \ can provide more comprehensive information on the presence\nand identity of\
    \ pathogens [190]. Nanobarcodes offer a signiﬁcant advantage in their poten-\n\
    tial for multiplexing, enabling the detection of multiple pathogens in a single\
    \ assay. This\ncapability not only saves time and resources but also enhances\
    \ detection accuracy.\n5.6. Kit-Based Systems\nKit-based systems use commercially\
    \ available diagnostic kits for detecting phytopathogens.\nThe kits typically\
    \ contain pre-prepared reagents and protocols for quickly and easily de-\ntecting\
    \ phytopathogens. Using such kits eliminates the need for specialized equipment\n\
    and expertise, making it possible for farmers and other stakeholders to quickly\
    \ and ac-\ncurately identify phytopathogens. These kits contain speciﬁc probes\
    \ that recognize the\ntarget pathogen and are designed for use in the ﬁeld. Virus\
    \ detection in plants is one\nuse of kit-based methods [182]. Commercially available\
    \ kit-based systems provide a\nquick, cost-effective, reliable, and easy-to-use\
    \ method for detecting phytopathogens. Non-\nspecialists can use these kits for\
    \ rapid detection of phytopathogens, often providing a\nmore cost-effective option\
    \ than hiring specialized equipment or experts. Kit-based systems\nare designed\
    \ to be highly sensitive and speciﬁc, providing accurate results in detecting\n\
    phytopathogens. Additionally, many kit-based systems are designed to be portable\
    \ and\neasy to use, making them ideal for use in the ﬁeld.\nAgrochemicals 2023,\
    \ 2\n237\n5.7. Summary of Nanotechnology Based Nanodiagnostic Systems\nThe nanodiagnostics\
    \ demonstrates the promising future of nanotechnology in agri-\nculture. Nanodiagnostic\
    \ systems such as nanosensors, quantum dots, gold NPs, magnetic\nNPs, nanobarcodes,\
    \ carbon nanotubes are leveraged for diverse applications. These include\nsoil\
    \ nutrient and heavy metal monitoring, plant disease and pest detection, genetically\n\
    modiﬁed organism (GMOs) identiﬁcation, plant growth monitoring, and irrigation\
    \ control.\nNanotechnology also provides solutions for tracing and identifying\
    \ plant species and\nensuring the traceability of agri-food products (Table 6).\n\

    6. Nanobiosensors in Diagnostics and Precision Agriculture\nThe unprecedented\
    \ increase in the use of agrochemicals and fertilizers has led to\nan accumulation\
    \ of nutrients and toxins in ground and surface waters. These toxic con-\ncentrations\
    \ are responsible for higher costs of water puriﬁcation, reduced ﬁsheries, and\n\
    decreased recreational activities [198]. Conventional agricultural practices are\
    \ deteriorating\nsoil quality and are responsible for the eutrophication of water\
    \ bodies. In addition, bad\nfarming practices damage the ecosystems of beneﬁcial\
    \ insects and other wild organisms\nand, therefore, must be replaced by precision\
    \ agricultural methods.\nPrecision agriculture includes wireless ﬁeld networking\
    \ and nanosensors for observ-\ning and controlling farming practices. It manages\
    \ site-speciﬁc crops and pre- and post-\nharvesting aspects [199]. Under precision\
    \ agriculture, exploring the fascinating properties\nof functional materials from\
    \ which nanobiosensors are built could help accurately analyze\nsoil humidity,\
    \ water, nutrients, and phytopathogens [200] (Figure 4). Biosensors are now\n\
    available for detecting odors in food spoilage, and such sensors [201] are called\
    \ “electronic\nnoses”, followed by the development of other sensor types. The\
    \ electronic nose uses an\narray of gas sensors to identify various kinds of odors.\
    \ The gas sensors are composed of\nNPs like ZnO nanowires [202] and nanorods [203],\
    \ which could detect impurities in vapor\nmixtures [204]. Such sensors work on\
    \ the principle of change in their resistance with the\npassage of different gases\
    \ resulting in variation in the generated electrical signals, which\nare used\
    \ as a ﬁngerprint for gas detection. A typical biosensor consists of four units:\
    \ (1) a\nsensor, (2) a signal conditioning block, (3) a microprocessor chip, and\
    \ (4) a radio module\nfor wireless communications between the sensor and the monitoring\
    \ station [187].\nRecent nanotechnological leaps have enabled us to study biochemical\
    \ interactions\nin plant cells and tissues due to various pathogens. The method\
    \ uses a probe inserted in\nthe xylem vessel at the root base. The probe measures\
    \ xylem pressure, radial electrical\ngradients, and ionic activity [205,206].\
    \ Such tools help better understand pathogenicity\nmechanisms to improve crop\
    \ disease treatment strategies [207,208]. However, the previ-\nous approach relied\
    \ on the destructive sampling of pathogenic bacteria colonizing the\nxylem, which\
    \ failed to provide helpful information about colorization patterns, bioﬁlm\n\
    development, movement, and re-colonization of bacterial pathogens in new tissues.\
    \ How-\never, implementing microfabricated xylem vessels containing nano-sized\
    \ features lets us\nunderstand the features that were impossible with conventional\
    \ methods [209].\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n238\np\np\n[\n]\np\np\ng\nin their resistance\
    \ with the passage of different gases resulting in variation in the \ngenerated\
    \ electrical signals, which are used as a fingerprint for gas detection. A typical\
    \ \nbiosensor consists of four units: (1) a sensor, (2) a signal conditioning\
    \ block, (3) a \nmicroprocessor chip, and (4) a radio module for wireless communications\
    \ between the \nsensor and the monitoring station [187]. \n \nFigure 4. Functional\
    \ representation of nanosensors in precision agriculture. \nFigure 4. Functional\
    \ representation of nanosensors in precision agriculture.\n6.1. Monitoring of\
    \ Soil Quality Parameters\nBiomonitoring is a technique used to collect and analyze\
    \ organisms, tissues, or ﬂuids\nto determine their exposure to natural and synthetic\
    \ chemicals. The information gleaned\nfrom these observations is valuable, as\
    \ it provides insight into the number of chemicals\nthat have entered the organism\
    \ and led to corresponding changes. Biomonitoring is also an\neffective method\
    \ for estimating the total dose absorbed by the organism, which can provide\n\
    indirect access to monitor target site concentrations. The advancement of sensor\
    \ technology\nhas improved its sensitivity and reduced its size compared to conventional\
    \ biosensors. Such\nbiosensors are used to monitor fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides,\
    \ insecticides, pathogens,\nsoil moisture, and pH [210]. An ideal nanobiosensor\
    \ should be stable over long storage\nperiods and possess a lower reaction time.\
    \ In addition, it should be small, biocompatible,\nnon-toxic, non-antigenic, inexpensive,\
    \ portable, accurate, and capable of producing repeat-\nable ﬁndings [211]. Nanobiosensors\
    \ are ultrasensitive devices and can detect viruses at\nultra-low concentrations\
    \ as they operate at the atomic scale with the highest efﬁciency\nand accuracy.\n\
    6.2. Monitoring Soil Pesticides/Herbicides\nThe insects are cosmopolitan in distribution\
    \ and hold the highest population among\npests. They infest all plants and products\
    \ by injuring their parts or attack storage products\nto incur heavy crop losses.\
    \ The regular use of pesticides in ﬁelds to combat pests can\nlead to the development\
    \ of resistance among pest groups [212]. Additionally, pesticide\nchemicals degrade\
    \ in the environment over time, which reduces their effectiveness for\nagricultural\
    \ use. NM use in pesticide formulations could aid in reducing usage and\nattaining\
    \ agricultural sustainability. NM includes C nanotubes, quantum dots, gold NPs,\n\
    carbon black, and nanocomposites. Many nanostructured biosensors have been developed\n\
    for pesticide detection in water and food [213]. Based on consumption rates, toxicological\n\
    information, and environmental residual levels, the U.S. Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n239\n(EPA) proposed a limit of 0.9 mg/L glyphosate\
    \ in drinking water and an acceptable daily\nintake of 0.3 mg/kg/day [214].\n\
    6.3. Monitoring Soil Nutrients\nNanosensors are being developed as a promising\
    \ real-time technology for monitor-\ning soil nutrients. These sensors detect\
    \ and quantify nutrients such as nitrogen, phos-\nphorus, and potassium in soil\
    \ samples. They use nanomaterials, such as carbon nan-\notubes, graphene, and\
    \ nanoclays, to detect and bind with speciﬁc nutrients in the soil [215].\nNanosensors\
    \ can provide farmers with accurate and timely information about soil nutrient\n\
    levels, which can help them make more informed decisions about fertilizer application\
    \ and\ncrop management. This technology can assist in decreasing fertilizer waste,\
    \ boost fertilizer\nefﬁciency, and lessen the potentially negative environmental\
    \ implications of typical fertil-\nizer application methods. One example of a\
    \ nanosensor for soil nutrient monitoring is a\ngraphene-based sensor that can\
    \ detect nitrogen levels in soil [216]. The sensor is designed\nto be integrated\
    \ into a wireless sensor network that can provide real-time data on soil\nnutrient\
    \ levels to farmers.\n6.4. Monitoring Soil Humidity\nTo ensure successful crop\
    \ production, it is necessary to regularly analyze soil texture\nand moisture\
    \ content. Relative humidity measurements determine the amount of water\nvapor\
    \ in a gas mixture at a speciﬁed temperature. Standard-level deviations in soil\
    \ moisture\ncan signiﬁcantly impact agricultural yields since these parameters\
    \ vary spatially and\ntemporally. Although conventional methods are available\
    \ for estimating soil moisture\nlevels, their accuracy is often low. Such methods\
    \ require frequent calibration, reducing\ntheir stability and making them less\
    \ preferable for use in agricultural settings.\nHumidity-based nanosensors are\
    \ increasingly replacing conventional methods for\nmeasuring soil moisture [217].\
    \ These sensors utilize electrical transduction with a hygro-\nscopic probe, which\
    \ changes its dielectric properties upon water absorption. Nanosensors\nfabricated\
    \ from polymers, ceramics, and composites provide several beneﬁts, such as in-\n\
    creased stability, prolonged chemical and thermal durability, and enhanced environmental\n\
    adaptability [218]. The widespread use of nanosensors in agriculture could signiﬁcantly\n\
    improve the precision of soil temperature and moisture measurements. Many of these\n\
    devices are equipped with wireless communications systems that are economical,\
    \ user-\nfriendly, and can provide real-time data. Examples of nanosensors commonly\
    \ used for\nsoil measurements include carbon nanotube and graphene-based nanosensors\
    \ [219]. For\ninstance, a graphene oxide-based sensor is a type of humidity-based\
    \ nanosensor that can\ndetect changes in humidity levels from 0.1% to 90% [220].\n\
    6.5. Monitoring Plant Disease and Stress\nPlant stress and nutrient deﬁciency\
    \ are detected by monitoring plant physiology\nthrough imaging, spectroscopy,\
    \ and ﬂuorescence [221,222]. The described remote sensing\nmethods provide vital\
    \ information about leaf area, chlorophyll content, stomatal con-\nductance [223],\
    \ transpiration rate [224], water potential [225], and leaf temperature [226].\n\
    However, the methods are not helpful for the early diagnosis of plant stress and\
    \ nutrient\ndeﬁciency and are not economical for installation in individual plants\
    \ [221]. NPs-based\nsensors are now being utilized to monitor plant disease and\
    \ stress by providing an early\ndetection system for plants. These systems measure\
    \ the volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\nreleased by plants during biotic and\
    \ abiotic stress or disease conditions. Nanoparticle\nbased sensors can detect\
    \ these VOCs by analyzing their physical and chemical properties,\nallowing for\
    \ the identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc stress or disease affecting the plant.\nOne\
    \ example of a nanoparticle-based system for plant disease detection is a gold\n\
    nanoparticle-based sensor that can detect the presence of bacterial pathogens\
    \ in plants [227].\nThe sensor works by detecting the VOCs released by the bacteria,\
    \ allowing for early\ndetection of the disease before visible symptoms appear.\
    \ Similarly, NPs have been used\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n240\nto monitor abiotic\
    \ stress in plants, such as drought stress, by detecting changes in VOC\nemissions.\
    \ Carbon nanotubes have been utilized in a sensor that can detect changes in\n\
    VOCs associated with drought stress in plants [228,229]. The sensor can detect\
    \ VOCs with\nhigh sensitivity and speciﬁcity, allowing for early detection of\
    \ drought stress in plants.\n6.6. Monitoring Irrigation\nDue to the uncertainties\
    \ posed by climate change, land water availability has reduced\nglobally, and\
    \ droughts and erratic monsoon patterns are becoming more frequent [230].\nThe\
    \ current decade is facing a challenge in getting clean and needed water for human\
    \ use,\nindustrial purposes, and agriculture. The escalating use of agrochemicals\
    \ in agriculture has\nexacerbated groundwater pollution. Our water resources are\
    \ getting contaminated with\nmicrobial pathogens, salts, metals, agrochemicals,\
    \ pharmaceutical compounds, personal\ncare products, and radioactive elements\
    \ [187]. A speciﬁc type of contaminant in water\nbodies is primarily due to anthropogenic\
    \ activities like oil and gas production, mining,\nor natural processes like leaching\
    \ [231], which require thorough treatment procedures\nfor water recycling. Water\
    \ treatment requires novel and sustainable technologies for\nrecycling purposes.\n\
    Precision and site-speciﬁc irrigation management have emerged as potential solutions\n\
    to enhance crop productivity under adverse climate change conditions [232]. The\
    \ concept\nhas appeared as a possible solution for improved crop productivity\
    \ under adverse climate\nchange. The method uses advanced technologies such as\
    \ GPS, GIS, and automated machine\nguidance to apply water judiciously. This approach\
    \ can be complemented with low-ﬂying\ndrones or sensitive satellites with high-resolution\
    \ imaging capabilities to determine the wa-\nter content of soil or plants and\
    \ induce precise irrigation at the site of need. As a result, water\nconsumption\
    \ for irrigation can be reduced. However, several bottlenecks, such as cloud\n\
    interference and high data processing requirements, still need to be addressed.\
    \ Integration\nof crop simulation models with remote sensing technology enhances\
    \ the efﬁcacy of agricul-\ntural management and decision-making processes. The\
    \ application of nanotechnology to\nmicroirrigation can enhance water quality\
    \ and ﬁltering techniques. Nanoparticle-based\nbiosensors can detect and measure\
    \ water-based contaminants in real-time and remove them\nusing nanoﬁltration membranes\
    \ [233]. Nanoparticle-based membranes can also desalinate\nwater, reducing the\
    \ likelihood of clogging on the ﬁlters and membranes.\n6.7. Summary of Biosensors\
    \ in Precision Agriculture\nThe section discussed the role of nanobiosensors in\
    \ diagnostics and precision agri-\nculture. These sensors monitor soil parameters\
    \ such as quality, pesticide/herbicide levels,\nnutrient content, and humidity.\
    \ They also play a crucial role in monitoring plant disease\nand stress and managing\
    \ irrigation. The summary of biosensors’ application in precision\nagriculture\
    \ is also mentioned, highlighting their importance in achieving more efﬁcient\n\

    7. Nanotechnological Applications to Reduce Agro-Waste and for Synthesizing\n\
    High-Value Products\nAgricultural residues are produced from harvesting and processing\
    \ crops, fruits,\nvegetables, and trees in bulk during agricultural practices.\
    \ Agro-waste mainly includes\nplant parts unusable for human consumption, including\
    \ stems, leaves, shells, bark, seeds,\npods, husks, etc. [244]. Agricultural waste\
    \ is rich in lignocellulosic materials and could\nbe exploited for economic and\
    \ environmental beneﬁts to produce organic acids, biofuels,\nprotein-rich animal\
    \ feed, microbe-based pigments, mushrooms, and enzymes [245,246].\nDespite the\
    \ large volume of agro-waste generated worldwide, only a small fraction is\nrecycled.\
    \ The majority is burned or used as animal feed [247].\nNevertheless, the issue\
    \ of agro-waste burning is linked to environmental pollution and\nis restricted\
    \ in several countries or provinces [248]. Agro-waste can be dealt innovatively\n\
    through composting, producing bioactive compounds, nanomaterials, and bioreﬁnery\n\
    tools [249]. In addition, NPs can be used to encapsulate nutrients and other bioactive\n\
    compounds, protecting them from degradation and increasing their bioavailability\
    \ [250].\nThis technology can reduce the amount of agro-waste by allowing farmers\
    \ to use fewer\ninputs while increasing the efﬁcacy of their crops.\n8. Tagging,\
    \ Monitoring, and Tracking the Agroproducts Using Nanotechnology\nMethods and\
    \ Devices\nThe wide variety and large volume of generated agroproducts need efﬁcient\
    \ tagging.\nPreviously, laser-scannable barcodes with the Universal Product Code\
    \ (UPC) were used\nfor tagging agro-products [251]. They have been replaced in\
    \ several countries by radio-\nfrequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags, which consist\
    \ of a wireless integrated radio circuit\nand an embedded identiﬁcation code [252].\
    \ RFID provides several advantages over its pre-\ndecessor, like more information\
    \ storage at a sizeable scannable distance with simultaneous\nscanning of products\
    \ [252]. RFID tags are also used in food packaging for tagging and\ntallying customer\
    \ purchases.\nA newer “nanobarcode” method that functions like UPC on nano-scalar\
    \ levels has\nbeen introduced. Nanoplex technology-based nanoparticle-containing\
    \ strips are used for\nencoding information. Nanoplex labels the device using\
    \ platinum, palladium, nickel, and\ncobalt [253]. The nanoplex technology has\
    \ developed “Sensor” tags (Silicon Enhanced NPs\nfor surface-enhanced Raman Scattering),\
    \ a 50 nm metal nanoparticle with unique codes\nthat can be read from a meter\
    \ length. Nanotags can be used to track agroproducts from\nfarm to consumer. They\
    \ can be incorporated into the packaging to track the temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and other environmental conditions during shipping and storage [254].\nThese\
    \ nanotechnology-based tracking methods offer a range of beneﬁts for the agricul-\n\
    ture industry. By using nanotechnology to tag, monitor, and track agroproducts,\
    \ farmers\nand food manufacturers can ensure the quality and safety of their products,\
    \ reduce waste by\nidentifying issues early, improve efﬁciency by tracking products\
    \ through the supply chain,\nincrease transparency, and build trust with consumers\
    \ by providing information about the\norigin and safety of their products. PA\
    \ practices have been adopted in the vineyards of\nNakhon Ratchasima [255]. Similar\
    \ kinds of methods are also adopted in Thailand [255],\nthe USA [256], and Brazil\
    \ [257].\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n242\n9. Smartphone-Based Biosensors in Precision\
    \ Agriculture\nTraditional biosensing equipment are cumbersome, costly, and require\
    \ cautious han-\ndling, which limits their utility in agricultural regions. Recent\
    \ advances in lab-on-a-chip\n(LOC) technology have resulted in the miniaturization\
    \ of standard biosensing devices [258].\nWhen connected with smartphones, these\
    \ devices have the potential to transform the\nprocess of agricultural data collection\
    \ (Figure 5). Smartphones have great promise in smart\nfarming due to their portability,\
    \ affordability, and ease of access, particularly in rural areas.\nSmartphones\
    \ are transforming our daily information consumption habits. The use of smart-\n\
    phones in agriculture as detectors or instrument interfaces has the potential\
    \ to revolutionize\nhow we obtain information. Furthermore, they possess considerable\
    \ processing power\nto support agriculture-based applications and can be equipped\
    \ with sensors for smart\nfarming. These biosensors use the camera and other sensors\
    \ on a smartphone to analyze\ndata collected from plants, soil, and other agricultural\
    \ samples, allowing farmers to make\ndata-driven decisions about their crops.\
    \ Among the primary beneﬁts of smartphone-based\nbiosensors are their affordability\
    \ and portability. Moreover, they are readily accessible to\nfarmers in developed\
    \ and developing countries, allowing for widespread adoption and use.\nAdditionally,\
    \ they can be easily integrated with other PA technologies, such as unmanned\n\
    aerial vehicles and remote sensing, to provide a more comprehensive approach to\
    \ crop\nmonitoring and management.\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2, FOR PEER REVIEW \n\

    \ in agribusiness.\n12. Economic, Legal, Social, and Risk Implications of Nanotechnology\n\
    Agriculture-based information on soil nutrients, crop growth, and yield is gathered\n\
    through surveys, ﬁeld sampling, and laboratory analysis. However, the collected\
    \ data\nremains incomplete, inaccurate, and delayed, thus unable to provide a\
    \ complete pic-\nture of farmland. Precision agriculture seems intuitively appealing\
    \ to many agricultural\nproducers and professionals in agribusiness. However,\
    \ a proﬁtability study of the nano-\nagro farm model is necessary to determine\
    \ if the intuitive appeal translates into actual\nproﬁtability. The literature\
    \ reports the low to moderate toxicity of NPs to plants and\nhumans [43,171,267,268].\
    \ However, most NP exposure studies were done for a short dura-\ntion and in high\
    \ dosage under model media, which is inadequate for understanding the\ncurrent\
    \ risk posed to agricultural systems and humans [269,270]. From 2000 to 2018,\
    \ the\nUnited States, China, India, Brazil, and Iran were the top ﬁve countries\
    \ in the publication\nintensity of agro-based nanoparticle research [271]. A subsequent\
    \ investigation indicated\nthat between 2009 and 2021, the United States, China,\
    \ and India were the predominant\nnations in nanotechnology research [272]. This\
    \ conclusion was substantiated by the volume\nof their scientiﬁc publications\
    \ in the ﬁeld.\nNanotechnology has signiﬁcant economic, legal, social, and risk\
    \ implications that\nneed careful consideration. From a ﬁnancial perspective,\
    \ nanotechnology can revolutionize\nvarious industries, from healthcare to energy\
    \ to agriculture. It can improve efﬁciency, lower\nproduction costs, and provide\
    \ new materials with unique properties. However, the high\ncosts of research and\
    \ development, as well as potential liability risks, must also be taken\ninto\
    \ account.\nFrom a legal perspective, nanotechnology raises essential questions\
    \ about intellectual\nproperty, product liability, and regulatory oversight. The\
    \ novelty of nanotechnology means\nthat traditional regulatory frameworks may\
    \ not be sufﬁcient to address the unique risks\nassociated with these materials.\
    \ As such, governments and regulatory agencies must work\nto create appropriate\
    \ legal frameworks to ensure the safe and responsible development\nand use of\
    \ nanotechnology [273].\nThe societal beneﬁts of nanotechnology must be weighed\
    \ against potential drawbacks,\nincluding potential impacts on human health, the\
    \ environment, and ethical considerations.\nThe potential for unintended consequences,\
    \ such as releasing NPs into the environment or\nunforeseen health risks, must\
    \ be carefully considered. Additionally, questions about equity,\naccess, and\
    \ the distribution of beneﬁts and harms associated with nanotechnology must\n\
    be addressed.\nIn addition, the risks associated with nanotechnology must be carefully\
    \ evaluated and\nmitigated, which includes assessing potential health risks, environmental\
    \ impacts, and\nsocietal implications and developing appropriate risk management\
    \ strategies. Ongoing\nresearch and development, along with transparent communication\
    \ and collaboration be-\nAgrochemicals 2023, 2\n245\ntween stakeholders, will\
    \ be critical in addressing these risks and ensuring the safe and\nresponsible\
    \ development and use of nanotechnology.\n13. Conclusions\nNanotechnology is a\
    \ promising technology that can signiﬁcantly impact food and\nagriculture systems.\
    \ However, the risk assessment of nanoparticle use needs evaluation.\nNanotechnology-based\
    \ precision agriculture could increase crop production through better\nmanagement\
    \ and conservation inputs. Precision agriculture is poised to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by accelerating the green revolution. Smart agriculture can aid in\
    \ minimizing\nagricultural waste, thus reducing environmental pollution. Additionally,\
    \ nanotechnology\ncould protect the environment by employing alternative energy\
    \ supplies to reduce pollution\nand help clean up existing pollutants.\nThe use\
    \ of sensor-based technology would have a signiﬁcant impact on future farming.\n\
    These methods can enhance crop productivity by providing vital information about\
    \ crop\ngrowth, thus helping farmers make better decisions. Advances in nanotechnology\
    \ can\nrevolutionize various agricultural sectors with the latest tools for rapid\
    \ disease diagnosis\nand treatment and enhancing plants’ ability to absorb nutrients.\
    \ Several companies have\nformulated nanopesticides with particle sizes ranging\
    \ from 100–250 nm that exhibit high\nwater solubility, which translates into higher\
    \ formulation activity. In addition, suspensions\nof oil-based NPs have been formulated\
    \ in the range of 200–400 nm that can prevent or\ntreat disease instances. Such\
    \ formulations could apply to disease prevention in crops and\nharvested products.\n\
    Agricultural scientists regularly publish new recommendations and technological\n\
    changes in farm practices in local magazines and newspapers to beneﬁt the farming\
    \ com-\nmunity. However, the adoption percentage of those recommendations or technologies\n\
    among farming communities is primarily unknown. Moreover, there’s a need for the\n\
    development of data prediction methodologies to measure farmers’ adoption rates\
    \ of new\ntechnologies. Therefore, governmental policy adjustments are required\
    \ to fund farmer-\ncentric studies on adopting new technologies.\nThe interaction\
    \ of NPs with soil is partially understood, and additional research\nis required\
    \ to determine their impact on plant nutrition under ﬁeld conditions. Like\nother\
    \ elements, the effect of NPs on soil must be governed by the physical and chemical\n\
    properties of soil particles. Further research is needed to observe the response\
    \ of the\nterrestrial ecosystem to metal NPs, the interaction of pollutants under\
    \ various climatic\nconditions, and their effect on the rhizosphere region, besides\
    \ keeping their properties\nunder multiple soil types and plant species.\nAuthor\

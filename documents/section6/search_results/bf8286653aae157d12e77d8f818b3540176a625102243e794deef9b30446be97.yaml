    years have witnessed a booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and
    services, spanning from personal assistant to recommendation systems to video/audio
    surveillance. More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet
    of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet,
    generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend,
    there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to
    fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing,
    an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network
    core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution.
    The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning
    to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in
    its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of
    EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end,
    we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically,
    we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge.
    We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and
    emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at
    the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI. We
    believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful
    discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI. Published in: Proceedings

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction We are living in an unprecedented
    booming era of artificial intelligence (AI). Driving by the recent advancements
    of algorithm, computing power, and big data, deep learning [1]—the most dazzling
    sector of AI—has made substantial breakthroughs in a wide spectrum of fields,
    ranging from computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing
    to chess playing (e.g., AlphaGo) and robotics [2]. Benefiting from these breakthroughs,
    a set of intelligent applications, as exemplified by intelligent personal assistants,
    personalized shopping recommendation, video surveillance, and smart home appliances
    have quickly ascended to the spotlight and gained enormous popularity. It is widely
    recognized that these intelligent applications are significantly enriching people’s
    lifestyle, improving human productivity, and enhancing social efficiency. As a
    key driver that boosts AI development, big data have recently gone through a radical
    shift of data source from the megascale cloud datacenters to the increasingly
    widespread end devices, e.g., mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.
    Traditionally, big data, such as online shopping records, social media contents,
    and business informatics, were mainly born and stored at megascale datacenters.
    However, with the proliferation of mobile computing and IoT, the trend is reversing
    now. Specifically, Cisco estimates that nearly 850 ZB will be generated by all
    people, machines, and things at the network edge by 2021 [3]. In sharp contrast,
    the global datacenter traffic will only reach 20.6 ZB by 2021. Clearly, via bringing
    the huge volumes of data to AI, the edge ecosystem will present many novel application
    scenarios for AI and fuel the continuous booming of AI. Pushing the AI frontier
    to the edge ecosystem that resides at the last mile of the Internet, however,
    is highly nontrivial, due to the concerns on performance, cost, and privacy. Toward
    this goal, the conventional wisdom is to transport the data bulks from the IoT
    devices to the cloud datacenters for analytics [4]. However, when moving a tremendous
    amount of data across the wide area network (WAN), both monetary cost and transmission
    delay can be prohibitively high, and the privacy leakage can also be a major concern
    [5]. An alternative is on-device analytics that run AI applications on the device
    to process the IoT data locally, which, however, may suffer from poor performance
    and energy efficiency. This is because many AI applications require high computational
    power that greatly outweighs the capacity of resource- and energy-constrained
    IoT devices. To address the above-mentioned challenges, edge computing [6] has
    recently been proposed, which pushes cloud services from the network core to the
    network edges that are in closer proximity to IoT devices and data sources. As
    shown in Fig. 1, here an edge node can be nearby end-device connectable by device-to-device
    (D2D) communications [7], a server attached to an access point (e.g., WiFi, router,
    and base station), a network gateway, or even a microdatacenter available for
    use by nearby devices. While edge nodes can be varied in size: ranging from a
    credit-card-sized computer to a microdatacenter with several server racks, physical
    proximity to the information-generation sources is the most crucial characteristic
    emphasized by edge computing. Essentially, the physical proximity between the
    computing and information-generation sources promises several benefits compared
    to the traditional cloud-based computing paradigm, including low latency, energy
    efficiency, privacy protection, reduced bandwidth consumption, on-premises, and
    context awareness [6], [8]. Fig. 1. Illustration of edge computing. Show All Indeed,
    the marriage of edge computing and AI has given rise to a new research area, namely,
    “edge intelligence (EI)” or “edge AI” [9], [10]. Instead of entirely relying on
    the cloud, EI makes the most of the widespread edge resources to gain AI insight.
    Notably, EI has garnered much attention from both the industry and academia. For
    example, the celebrated Gartner hype cycle has incorporated EI as an emerging
    technology that will reach a plateau of productivity in the following five to
    ten years [11]. Major enterprises, including Google, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM,
    have put forth pilot projects to demonstrate the advantages of edge computing
    in paving the last mile of AI. These efforts have boosted a wide spectrum of AI
    applications, spanning from live video analytics [12], cognitive assistance [13]
    to precision agriculture, smart home [14], and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
    [15]. Notably, research and practice on this emerging interdiscipline—EI—are still
    in a very early stage. There is, in general, a lack of venue dedicated for summarizing,
    discussing, and disseminating the recent advances of EI, in both industrial and
    academia. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and concrete
    survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we will first review
    the background of AI. We will then discuss the motivation, definition, and rating
    of EI. Next, we will further review and taxonomically summarize the emerging computing
    architectures and enabling technologies for EI model training and inference. Finally,
    we will discuss some open research challenges and opportunities for EI. This paper
    is organized as follows. Section II gives an overview of the basic concepts of
    AI, with a focus on deep learning—the most popular sector of AI. Section III discusses
    the motivation, definition, and rating of EI. Section IV reviews the architectures,
    enabling techniques, systems, and frameworks for training EI models. Section V
    reviews the architectures, enabling techniques, systems, and frameworks for EI
    model inference. Section VI discusses future directions and challenges of EI.
    For this survey, we hope it can elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful
    discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI. SECTION II. Primer on Artificial
    Intelligence In this section, we review the concepts, models, and methods for
    AI, with a particular focus on deep learning—the most popular sector of AI. A.
    Artificial Intelligence While AI has recently ascended to the spotlight and gained
    tremendous attention, it is not a new term and it was first coined in 1956. Simply
    put, AI is an approach to build intelligent machines capable of carrying out tasks
    as humans do. This is obviously a very broad definition, and it can refer from
    Apple Siri to Google AlphaGo and too powerful technologies yet to be invented.
    In simulating human intelligence, AI systems typically demonstrate at least some
    of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence: planning, learning,
    reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and
    manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence, and creativity. During
    the past 60 year’s development, AI has experienced rise, fall, and again rise
    and fall. The latest rise of AI after 2010s was partially due to the breakthroughs
    made by deep learning, a method that has achieved human-level accuracy in some
    interesting areas. B. Deep Learning and Deep Neural Networks Machine learning
    (ML) is an effective method to achieve the goal of AI. Many ML methodologies as
    exemplified by decision tree, K -means clustering, and Bayesian network have been
    developed to train the machine to make classifications and predictions, based
    on the data obtained from the real world. Among the existing ML methods, deep
    learning, by leveraging artificial neural networks (ANNs) [16] to learn the deep
    representation of the data, has resulted in an amazing performance in multiple
    tasks, including image classification, face recognition, and so on. Since the
    ANN adopted by deep learning model typically consists of a series of layers, the
    model is called a deep neural network (DNN). As shown in Fig. 2, each layer of
    a DNN is composed of neurons that are able to generate the nonlinear outputs based
    on the data from the input of the neuron. Fig. 2. Standard composition of DL model.
    (a) Layers in a DL model. (b) Architecture of a neuron. Show All The neurons in
    the input layer receive the data and propagate them to the middle layer (also
    known as the hidden layer). Then, the neurons in the middle layer generate the
    weighted sums of the input data and output the weighted sums using the specific
    activation functions (e.g., tanh), and the outputs are then propagated to the
    output layer. The final results are presented at the output layer. With more complex
    and abstract layers than a typical model, DNNs are able to learn the high-level
    features, enabling high precision inference in tasks. Fig. 3 presents three popular
    structures of DNNs: multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), convolution neural networks
    (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Fig. 3. Three typical structures
    of DL models. (a) MLPs. (b) CNNs. (c) RNNs. Show All MLP models are the most basic
    DNN, which is composed of a series of fully connected layers [17]. Different from
    fully connected layers in MLPs, in CNN models, the convolution layers extract
    the simple features from input by executing convolution operations. Applying various
    convolutional filters, CNN models can capture the high-level representation of
    the input data, making it most popular for computer vision tasks, e.g., image
    classification (e.g., AlexNet [18], VGG network [19], ResNet [20], and MobileNet
    [21]) and object detection (e.g., Fast R-CNN [22], YOLO [23], and SSD [24]). RNN
    models are another type of DNNs, which use sequential data feeding. As shown in
    Fig. 3(c), the basic unit of RNN is called cell, and further, each cell consists
    of layers and a series of cells enables the sequential processing of RNN models.
    RNN models are widely used in the task of natural language processing, e.g., language
    modeling, machine translation, question answering, and document classification.
    Deep learning represents the state-of-the-art AI technology as well as a highly
    resource-demanding workload that naturally suits for edge computing. Therefore,
    due to space limitation, in the remaining of this paper, we will focus on the
    interaction between deep learning and edge computing. We believe that the techniques
    discussed can also have meaningful implications for other AI models and methods,
    i.e., stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular training method for many
    AI/ML algorithms (e.g., k -means, support vector machine, and lasso regression)
    [25], and the optimization techniques of SGD training introduced in this paper
    can be also deployed on other AI models training process. C. From Deep Learning
    to Model Training and Inference For each neuron in a DNN layer, it has a vector
    of weights associated with the input data size of the layer. Needless to say,
    the weights in a deep learning model need to be optimized through a training process.
    In a training process for a deep learning model, the values of weights in the
    model are often randomly assigned initially. Then, the output of the last layer
    represents the task result, and a loss function is set to evaluate the correctness
    of the results by calculating the error rate (e.g., root-mean-squared error) between
    the results and the true label. To adjust the weights of each neuron in the model,
    an optimization algorithm, such as SGD [25], is used and the gradient of the loss
    function is calculated. Leveraging the backpropagation mechanism [26], [27], the
    error rate is propagated back across the whole neural network, and the weights
    are updated based on the gradient and the learning rate. By feeding a large number
    of training samples and repeating this process until the error rate is below a
    predefined threshold, a deep learning model with high precision is obtained. DNN
    model inference happens after training. For instance, for an image classification
    task, with the feeding of a large number of training samples, the DNN is trained
    to learn how to recognize an image, and then, inference takes real-world images
    as inputs and quickly draws the predictions/classifications of them. The training
    procedure consists of the feed-forward process and the backpropagation process.
    Note that the inference involves the feedforward process only, i.e., the input
    from the real world is passed through the whole neural network and the model outputs
    the prediction. D. Popular Deep Learning Models For a better understanding of
    the deep learning and their applications, in this section, we give an overview
    of various popular deep learning models. 1) Convolution Neural Network: For image
    classification, as the first CNN to win the ImageNet Challenge in 2012, AlexNet
    [18] consists of five convolution layers and three fully connected layers. AlexNet
    requires 61 million weights and 724 million MACs (multiply-add computation) to
    classify the image with a size of 227×227 . To achieve higher accuracy, VGG-16
    [19] is trained to a deeper structure of 16 layers consisting of 13 convolution
    layers and three fully connected layers, requiring 138 million weights and 15.5G
    MACs to classify the image with a size of 224×224 . To improve accuracy while
    reducing the computation of DNN inference, GoogleNet [28] introduces an inception
    module composed of different sized filters. GoogleNet achieves a better accuracy
    performance than VGG-16, while only requiring seven million weights and 1.43G
    MACs to process the image with the same size. ResNet [20], the state-of-the-art
    effort, uses the “shortcut” structure to reach a human-level accuracy with a top-5
    error rate below 5%. The “shortcut” module is used to solve the gradient vanishing
    problem during the training process, making it possible to train a DNN model with
    deeper structure. CNN is typically employed in computer vision. Given a series
    of images or video from the real world, with the utilization of CNN, the AI system
    learns to automatically extract the features of these inputs to complete a specific
    task, e.g., image classification, face authentication, and image semantic segmentation.
    2) Recurrent Neural Network: For sequential input data, RNNs have been developed
    to address the time-series problem. The input of RNN consists of the current input
    and the previous samples. Each neuron in an RNN owns an internal memory that keeps
    the information of the computation from the previous samples. The training of
    RNN is based on backpropagation through time (BPTT) [29]. Long short-term memory
    (LSTM) [30] is an extended version of RNNs. In LSTM, the gate is used to represents
    the basic unit of a neuron. As shown in Fig. 4, each neuron in LSTM is called
    memory cell and includes a multiplicative forget gate, input gate, and output
    gate. These gates are used to control the access to memory cells and to prevent
    them from perturbation by irrelevant inputs. Information is added or removed through
    the gate to the memory cell. Gates are different neural networks that determine
    what information is allowed on the memory cell. The forget gate can learn what
    information is kept or forgotten during training. RNN has been widely used in
    natural language processing due to the superiority of processing the data with
    an input length that is not fixed. The task of the AI here is to build a system
    that can comprehend natural language spoken by humans, e.g., natural language
    modeling, word embedding, and machine translation. Fig. 4. Structure of an LSTM
    memory cell. Show All 3) Generative Adversarial Network: As shown in Fig. 5, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs) [31] consists of two main components, namely, the
    generative and discriminator networks (i.e., generator and discriminator). The
    generator is responsible for generating new data after it learns the data distribution
    from a training data set of real data. The discriminator is in charge of classifying
    the real data from the fake data generated by the generator. GAN is often deployed
    in image generation, image transformation, image synthesis, image superresolution,
    and other applications. Fig. 5. Composition of a GAN. Show All 4) Deep Reinforcement
    Learning: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is composed of DNNs and RL. As illustrated
    in Fig. 6, the goal of DRL is to create an intelligent agent that can perform
    efficient policies to maximize the rewards of long-term tasks with controllable
    actions. The typical application of DRL is to solve various scheduling problems,
    such as decision problems in games, rate selection of video transmission, and
    so on. Fig. 6. Concept of a DRL model. Show All In the DRL approach, the RL searches
    for the optimal policy of actions over states from the environment, and the DNN
    is in charge of representing a large number of states and approximating the action
    values to estimate the quality of the action in the given states. The reward is
    a function to represent the distance between the predefined requirement and the
    performance of an action. Through continuous learning, the agent of DRL model
    can be used for various tasks, e.g., gaming [32]. SECTION III. Edge Intelligence
    The marriage of edge computing and AI gives the birth of EI. In this section,
    we discuss the motivation, benefits, and definition of EI. A. Motivation and Benefits
    of Edge Intelligence The fusion of AI and edge computing is natural since there
    is a clear intersection between them. Specifically, edge computing aims at coordinating
    a multitude of collaborative edge devices and servers to process the generated
    data in proximity, and AI strives for simulating intelligent human behavior in
    devices/machines by learning from data. Besides enjoying the general benefits
    of edge computing (e.g., low latency and reduced bandwidth consumption), pushing
    AI to the edge further benefits each other in the following aspects. 1) Data Generated
    at the Network Edge Need AI to Fully Unlock Their Potential: As a result of the
    proliferation of the skyrocketing number and types of mobile and IoT devices,
    large volumes of multimodal data (e.g., audio, picture, and video) of physical
    surroundings are continuously sensed at the device side. In this context, AI will
    be functionally necessary due to its ability to quickly analyze those huge data
    volumes and extract insights from them for high-quality decision making. As one
    of the most popular AI techniques, deep learning brings the ability to automatically
    identify patterns and detect anomalies in the data sensed by the edge device,
    as exemplified by population distribution, traffic flow, humidity, temperature,
    pressure, and air quality. The insights extracted from the sensed data are then
    fed to the real-time predictive decision-making (e.g., public transportation planning,
    traffic control, and driving alert) in response to the fast-changing environments,
    increasing the operational efficiency. As forecast by Gartner [33], more than
    80% of enterprise IoT projects will include an AI component by 2022, up from only
    10% today. 2) Edge Computing is Able to Prosper AI With Richer Data and Application
    Scenarios: It is widely recognized that the driving force behind the recent booming
    of deep learning is fourfold: algorithm, hardware, data, and application scenarios.
    While the effect of algorithm and hardware on the development of deep learning
    is intuitive, the role of data and application scenarios has been mostly overlooked.
    Specifically, to improve the performance of a deep learning algorithm, the most
    commonly adopted approach is to refine the DNN with more layers of neurons. By
    doing this, we need to learn more parameters in the DNN and so does the data required
    for training increase. This definitely demonstrates the importance of data on
    the development of AI. Having recognized the importance of data, the next problem
    is where are the data from. Traditionally, data are mostly born and stored in
    the megascale datacenters. Nevertheless, with the rapid development of IoT, the
    trend is reversing now. According to Cisco’s report [3], in the near future, massive
    IoT data will be generated at the edge side. If these data are processed by AI
    algorithms at the cloud data center, it will consume a lot of bandwidth resources
    and bring great pressure to the cloud data center. To address these challenges,
    edge computing is proposed to achieve low-latency data processing by sinking the
    computing capability from the cloud data center to the edge side, i.e., data generation
    source, which may enable AI processing with high performance. While edge computing
    and AI complement each other from a technical perspective, their application and
    popularization are also mutually beneficial. 3) AI Democratization Requires Edge
    Computing as a Key Infrastructure: AI technologies have witnessed great success
    in many digital products or services in our daily life, e.g., online shopping,
    service recommendation, video surveillance, smart home devices, and so on. AI
    is also a key driving force behind emerging innovative frontiers, such as self-driving
    cars, intelligent finance, cancer diagnosis, and medicine discovery. Beyond the
    above-mentioned examples, to enable a richer set of applications and push the
    boundaries of what is possible, AI democratization or ubiquitous AI [34] has been
    declared by major IT companies, with the vision of “making AI for every person
    and every organization at everywhere.” To this end, AI should go “closer” to the
    people, data, and end devices. Clearly, edge computing is more competent than
    cloud computing in achieving this goal. First, compared to the cloud datacenter,
    edge servers are in closer proximity to people, data source, and devices. Second,
    compared to cloud computing, edge computing is also more affordable and accessible.
    Finally, edge computing has the potential to provide more diverse application
    scenarios of AI than cloud computing. Due to these advantages, edge computing
    is naturally a key enabler for ubiquitous AI. 4) Edge Computing Can Be Popularized
    With AI Applications: During the early development of edge computing, there has
    always been the concern in the cloud computing community with which high-demand
    applications edge computing could take to the next level that cloud computing
    could not, and what are the killer applications of edge computing. To clear up
    the doubt, Microsoft has conducted continuous exploration on what kinds should
    be moved from the cloud to the edge since 2009 [35], ranging from voice command
    recognition, AR/VR, and interactive cloud gaming [36] to real-time video analytics.
    By comparison, real-time video analytics is envisioned to be a killer application
    for edge computing [12], [37], [38]. As an emerging application built on top of
    computer vision, real-time video analytics continuously pulls high-definition
    videos from surveillance cameras and requires high computation, high bandwidth,
    high privacy, and low latency to analyze the videos. The one viable approach that
    can meet these strict requirements is edge computing. Looking back to the above
    evolution of edge computing, it can be foreseen that novel AI applications emerged
    from the sectors such as IIoT, intelligent robots, smart cities, and smart home
    will play a crucial role in the popularization of edge computing. This is mainly
    due to the fact that many mobile and IoT related AI applications represent a family
    of practical applications that are computation- and energy-intensive, privacy-
    and delay- sensitive, and thus naturally align well with edge computing. Due to
    the superiority and necessity of running AI application on the edge, edge AI has
    recently received great attention. In December 2017, in a white paper, “A Berkeley
    View of Systems Challenges for AI” [39] published by the University of California
    Berkeley, the cloud–edge AI system is envisioned as an important research direction
    to achieve the goal of mission-critical and personalized AI. In August 2018, edge
    AI emerges in the Gartner Hype Cycle for the first time [40]. According to Gartners
    prediction, edge AI is still in the innovation trigger phase, and it will reach
    a plateau of productivity in the following five to ten years. In the industry,
    many pilot projects have also been carried out toward edge AI. Specifically, on
    the edge AI service platform, the traditional cloud providers, such as Google,
    Amazon, and Microsoft, have launched service platforms to bring the intelligence
    to the edge, through enabling end devices to run ML inferences with pretrained
    models locally. On edge AI chips, various high-end chips designated for running
    ML models have been made commercially available on the market, as exemplified
    by Google Edge TPU, Intel Nervana NNP, and Huawei Ascend 910 and Ascend 310. B.
    Scope and Rating of Edge Intelligence While the term edge AI or EI is brand new,
    explorations and practices in this direction have begun early. As aforementioned,
    in 2009, to demonstrate the benefits of edge computing, Microsoft has built an
    edge-based prototype to support mobile voice command recognition, an AI application.
    Albeit the early begin of exploration, there is still not a formal definition
    for EI. Currently, most organizations [41], [42] and presses [43] refer to EI
    as the paradigm of running AI algorithms locally on an end device, with data (sensor
    data or signals) that are created on the device. While this represents the current
    most common approach (e.g., with high-end AI chips) toward EI in the real world,
    it is crucial to note that this definition greatly narrows down the solution scope
    of EI. Running computation intensive algorithms as exemplified by DNN models locally
    is very resource-intensive, requiring high-end processors to be equipped in the
    device. Such a stringent requirement not only increases the cost of EI but is
    also incompatible and unfriendly to existing legacy end devices that have limited
    computing capacities. In this paper, we submit that the scope of EI should not
    be restricted to running AI models solely on the edge server or device. In fact,
    as demonstrated by a dozen recent studies, for DNN models, running them with edge-cloud
    synergy can reduce both the end-to-end latency and energy consumption when compared
    to the local execution approach. Due to these practical advantages, we believe
    that such collaborative hierarchy should be integrated into the design of efficient
    EI solutions. Furthermore, existing thoughts on EI mainly focus on the inference
    phase (i.e., running the AI model), assuming that the training of the AI model
    is performed in the power cloud datacenters since the resource consumption of
    the training phase significantly overweights the inference phase. However, this
    means that the enormous amount of training data should be shipped from devices
    or edges to the cloud, incurring prohibitive communication overhead as well as
    the concern on data privacy. Instead, we believe that EI should be the paradigm
    that fully exploits the available data and resources across the hierarchy of end
    devices, edge nodes, and cloud datacenters to optimize the overall performance
    of training and inferencing a DNN model. This indicates that EI does not necessarily
    mean that the DNN model is fully trained or inferenced at the edge but can work
    in a cloud–edge-device coordination manner via data offloading. Specifically,
    according to the amount and path length of data offloading, we rate EI into six
    levels, as shown in Fig. 7. Specifically, the definition of various levels of
    EI is given as follows. Cloud Intelligence: Training and inferencing the DNN model
    fully in the cloud. Level 1—Cloud–Edge Coinference and Cloud Training: Training
    the DNN model in the cloud, but inferencing the DNN model in an edge-cloud cooperation
    manner. Here edge-cloud cooperation means that data are partially offloaded to
    the cloud. Level 2—In-Edge Coinference and Cloud Training: Training the DNN model
    in the cloud, but inferencing the DNN model in an in-edge manner. Here in-edge
    means that the model inference is carried out within the network edge, which can
    be realized by fully or partially offloading the data to the edge nodes or nearby
    devices (via D2D communication). Level 3—On-Device Inference and Cloud Training:
    Training the DNN model in the cloud, but inferencing the DNN model in a fully
    local on-device manner. Here on-device means that no data would be offloaded.
    Level 4—Cloud–Edge Cotraining and Inference: Training and inferencing the DNN
    model both in the edge-cloud cooperation manner. Level 5—All In-Edge: Training
    and inferencing the DNN model both in the in-edge manner. Level 6—All On-Device:
    Training and inferencing the DNN model both in the on-device manner. Fig. 7. Six-level
    rating for EI. Show All As the level of EI goes higher, the amount and path length
    of data offloading reduce. As a result, the transmission latency of data offloading
    decreases, the data privacy increases, and the WAN bandwidth cost reduces. However,
    this is achieved at the cost of increased computational latency and energy consumption.
    This conflict indicates that there is no “best-level” in general; instead, the
    “best-level” EI is application-dependent and it should be determined by jointly
    considering multicriteria such as latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and WAN
    bandwidth cost. In the later sections, we will review enabling techniques as well
    as existing solutions for different levels of EI. SECTION IV. Edge Intelligence
    Model Training With the proliferation of mobile and IoT devices, data, which are
    essential for AI model training, are increasingly generated at the network edge.
    In this section, we focus on distributed training of DNN at the edge, including
    the architectures, key performance indicators, enabling techniques, and existing
    systems and frameworks. A. Architectures The architectures of distributed DNN
    training at the edge can be divided into three modes: centralized, decentralized,
    and hybrid (cloud–edge device). Fig. 8 shows the three architectures, illustrated
    in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. The cloud refers to the central datacenter,
    whereas the end devices are represented by mobile phones, cars, and surveillance
    cameras, which are also data sources. For the edge server, we use base stations
    as the legend. Fig. 8. Architecture modes of distributed training. (a) Centralized.
    (b) Decentralized. (c) Hybrid. Show All 1) Centralized: Fig. 8(a) describes a
    centralized DNN training, where the DNN model is trained in the cloud datacenter.
    The data for training are generated and gathered from distributed end devices
    such as mobile phones, cars, and surveillance cameras. Once the data are arrived,
    the cloud datacenter will perform DNN training using these data. Therefore, the
    system based on the centralized architecture can be identified in cloud intelligence,
    level 1, level 2, or ;evel 3 in Fig. 7 according to the specific inference mode
    that the system employs. 2) Decentralized: Under the decentralized mode as shown
    in Fig. 8(b), each computing node trains its own DNN model locally with local
    data, which preserves private information locally. To obtain the global DNN model
    by sharing local training improvement, nodes in the network will communicate with
    each other to exchange the local model updates. In this mode, the global DNN model
    can be trained without the intervention of the cloud datacenter, corresponding
    to the level 5 EI defined in Fig. 7. 3) Hybrid: The hybrid mode combines the centralized
    mode and the decentralized mode. As shown in Fig. 8(c), as the hub of the architecture,
    the edge servers may train the DNN model by either decentralized updates with
    each other or centralized training with the cloud datacenter; thus, the hybrid
    architecture covers level 4 and level 5 as shown in Fig. 7. The hybrid architecture
    is also called as cloud–edge device training due to the involved roles. B. Key
    Performance Indicators To better assess a distributed training method, there are
    six key performance indicators. 1) Training Loss: Essentially, the DNN training
    process solves an optimization problem that seeks to minimize the training loss.
    Since the training loss captures the gap between the learned (e.g., predicted)
    value and the labeled data, it indicates how well the trained DNN model fits the
    training data. Therefore, it is expected that the training loss can be minimized.
    Training loss is mainly affected by training samples and training methods. 2)
    Convergence: The convergence indicator is specialized for the decentralized methods.
    Intuitively, a decentralized method works only if the distributed training processes
    converge to a consensus, which is the training result of the method. The term
    convergence measures whether and how fast a decentralized method converges to
    such a consensus. Under the decentralized training mode, the convergence value
    depends on the way the gradient is synchronized and updated. 3) Privacy: When
    training the DNN model by using the data originated at a massive of end devices,
    the raw data or intermediate data should be transferred out of the end devices.
    Obviously, it is inevitable to deal with privacy issues in this scenario. To preserve
    privacy, it is expected that less privacy-sensitive data is transferred out of
    the end devices. Whether privacy protection is implemented depends on whether
    the raw data is offloaded to the edge. 4) Communication Cost: Training the DNN
    model is data-intensive since the raw data or intermediate data should be transferred
    across the nodes. Intuitively, this communication overhead increases the training
    latency, energy, and bandwidth consumption. Communication overhead is affected
    by the size of the original input data, the way of transmission, and the available
    bandwidth. 5) Latency: Arguably, latency is one of the most fundamental performance
    indicators of distributed DNN model training since it directly influences when
    the trained model is available for use. The latency of the distributed training
    process typically consists of the computation latency and the communication latency.
    The computation latency is tightly dependent on the capability of the edge nodes.
    The communication latency may vary from the size of transmitted raw or intermediate
    data and the bandwidth of network connection. 6) Energy Efficiency: When training
    the DNN model in a decentralized manner, both the computation and communication
    processes consume enormous energy. However, for most end devices, they are energy-constrained.
    As a result, it is highly desirable that the DNN model training is energy-efficient.
    Energy efficiency is mainly affected by the size of the target training model
    and resources of the used devices. It is worth noting that the performance indicators,
    training loss and convergence, are common objectives, and thus they may not be
    explicitly claimed by some literature on DNN training. C. Enabling Technologies
    In this section, we review the enabling technologies for improving one or more
    of the aforementioned key performance indicators when training the EI model. Table
    1 summarizes the highlights of each enabling technology. Table 1 Technologies
    for Distributed DNN Training at the Edge 1) Federated Learning: Federated learning
    is dedicated to optimizing privacy issue in the above-mentioned key performance
    indicators. Federated learning is an emerging yet promising approach to preserve
    privacy when training the DNN model based on data originated by multiple clients.
    Rather than aggregating the raw data to a centralized datacenter for training,
    federated learning [45] leaves the raw data distributed on the clients (e.g.,
    mobile devices) and trains a shared model on the server by aggregating locally
    computed updates. The main challenges of federated learning are optimization and
    communication. For the optimization problem, the challenge is to optimize the
    gradient of a shared model by the distributed gradient updates on mobile devices.
    On this issue, federated learning adopts SGD. SGD updates the gradient over extremely
    small subsets (minibatch) of the whole data set, which is a simple but widely
    used gradient descent method. Shokri and Shmatikov [46] design a selective SGD
    (SSGD) protocol, allowing the clients to train independently on their own data
    sets and selectively share small subsets of their model’s key parameters to the
    centralized aggregator. Since SGD is easy to be parallelized as well as asynchronously
    executed, SSGD targets both privacy and training loss. Specifically, while preserving
    client’s own privacy, the training loss can be reduced by sharing the models among
    clients, comparing to training solely on their own inputs. A flaw of [46] is that
    it does not consider unbalanced and nonindependent identical distribution (non-IID)
    data. As an extension, McMahan et al. [45] advocate a decentralized approach,
    termed as federated learning, and present FedAvg method for federated learning
    with the DNN based on iterative model averaging. Here, the iterative model averaging
    means that the clients update the model locally with one-step SGD and then the
    server averages the resulting models with weights. The optimization in [45] emphasizes
    the properties of unbalanced and non-IID since the distributed data may come from
    various sources. For the communication problem, it is the unreliable and unpredictable
    network that poses the challenge of communication efficiency. In federated learning,
    each client sends a full model or a full model update back to the server in a
    typical round. For large models, this step is likely to be the bottleneck due
    to the unreliable network connections. To decrease the number of rounds for training,
    McMahan et al. [45] propose to increase the computation of local updates on clients.
    However, it is impractical when the clients are under severe computation resources
    constraint. In response to this issue, Konečný et al. [47] propose to reduce communication
    cost with two new update schemes, namely, structured update and sketched update.
    In a structured update, the model directly learns an update from a restricted
    space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g., either low-rank
    or a random mask. If using a sketched update, the model first learns a full model
    update and then compressed the update using a combination of quantization, random
    rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server. Though the federated
    learning technique exploits a new decentralized deep learning architecture, it
    is built upon a central server for aggregating local updates. Considering the
    scenario of training a DNN model over a fully decentralized network, i.e., a network
    without a central server, Lalitha et al. [48] propose a Bayesian-based distributed
    algorithm, in which each device updates its belief by aggregating information
    from its one-hop neighbors to train a model that best fits the observations over
    the entire network. Furthermore, with the emerging blockchain technique, Kim et
    al. [49] propose blockchain federated learning (BlockFL) with the devices model
    update exchanged and verified by leveraging blockchain. BlockFL also works for
    a fully decentralized network, where the ML model can be trained without any central
    coordination even when some devices lack their own training data samples. 2) Aggregation
    Frequency Control: This method focuses on the optimization of communication overhead
    during the DNN model training. On training deep learning model in edge computing
    environment, a commonly adopted idea (e.g., federated learning) is to train distributed
    models locally first and then aggregate updates centrally. In this case, the control
    of updates aggregation frequency significantly influences the communication overhead.
    Thus, the aggregation process, including aggregation content as well as aggregation
    frequency, should be controlled carefully. Based on the above insight, Hsieh et
    al. [50] develop the Gaia system and the approximate synchronous parallel (ASP)
    model for geodistributed DNN model training. The basic idea of Gaia is to decouple
    the communication within a datacenter from the communication between datacenters,
    enabling different communication and consistency models for each. To this end,
    the ASP model is developed to dynamically eliminate insignificant communication
    between datacenters, where the aggregation frequency is controlled by the preset
    significance threshold. However, Gaia focuses on geodistributed datacenters that
    are capacity-unlimited, making it is not generally applicable to edge computing
    nodes whose capacity is highly constrained. To incorporate the capacity constraint
    of edge nodes, Wang et al. [51] propose a control algorithm that determines the
    best tradeoff between the local update and global parameter aggregation under
    a given resource budget. The algorithm is based on the convergence analysis of
    distributed gradient descent and can be applied to federated learning in edge
    computing with provable convergence. To implement federated learning in the capacity-limited
    edge computing environment, Nishio and Yonetani [52] study the client selection
    problem with resource constraints. In particular, an update aggregation protocol
    named FedCS is developed to allow the centralized server to aggregate as many
    client updates as possible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models.
    An illustration of FedCS is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9. Overview of the FedCS protocol.
    Show All 3) Gradient Compression: To reduce the communication overhead incurred
    by decentralized training, gradient compression is another intuitive approach
    to compress the model update (i.e., gradient information). To this end, gradient
    quantization and gradient sparsification have been advocated. Specifically, gradient
    quantization performs lossy compression of the gradient vectors by quantizing
    each of their elements to a finite-bit low precision value. Gradient sparsification
    reduces the communication overhead by transmitting part of the gradient vectors.
    Lin et al. [53] observe that 99.9% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD
    (DSGD) are redundant, which demonstrates the power of gradient compression. Based
    on this observation, Lin et al. propose deep gradient compression (DGC), which
    compresses the gradient by 270−600× for a wide range of CNNs and RNNs. To preserve
    accuracy during this compression, DGC employs four methods: momentum correction,
    local gradient clipping, momentum factor masking, and warm-up training. Inspired
    by [53], Tao and Li [54] propose edge SGD (eSGD), a family of sparse schemes with
    both convergence and practical performance guarantees. To improve the first-order
    gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions in edge computing,
    eSGD includes two mechanisms: 1) determine which gradient coordinates are important
    and only transmits these coordinates and 2) design momentum residual accumulation
    for tracking out-of-date residual gradient coordinates in order to avoid low convergence
    rate caused by sparse updates. A concise convergence analysis of sparsified SGD
    is given in [55], where SGD is analyzed with k -sparsification or compression
    (e.g., top- k or random- k ). The analysis shows that this scheme converges at
    the same rate as vanilla SGD when equipped with error compensation (keeping track
    of accumulated errors in memory). In other words, communication can be reduced
    by a factor of the dimension of the problem (sometimes even more) while still
    converging at the same rate. Quantizing the gradients to low-precision values
    can also reduce the communication bandwidth. In this regard, Tang et al. [56]
    develop a framework of compressed, decentralized training and propose two different
    algorithms, called extrapolation compression and difference compression, respectively.
    The analysis on the two algorithms proves that both converge at the rate of O(1/
    nT − − − √ ) , where n is the number of clients and T is the number of iterations,
    matching the convergence rate for full precision, centralized training. Amiri
    and Gunduz [57] implement DSGD at the wireless edge with the help of a remote
    parameter server and further develop DSGD in digital and analog schemes, respectively.
    Digital DSGD (D-DSGD) assumes that the clients operate on the boundary of the
    multiple-access channel (MAC) capacity region at each iteration of the DSGD algorithm
    and employs gradient quantization and error accumulation to transmit their gradient
    estimates within the bit budget allowed by the employed power allocation. In analog
    DSGD (A-DSGD), the clients first sparsify their gradient estimates with error
    accumulation and then project them to a lower dimensional space imposed by the
    available channel bandwidth. These projections are transmitted directly over the
    MAC without employing any digital code. 4) DNN Splitting: The aim of DNN splitting
    is to protect privacy. DNN splitting protects user privacy by transmitting partially
    processed data rather than transmitting raw data. To enable a privacy-preserving
    edge-based training of DNN models, DNN splitting is conducted between the end
    devices and the edge server. This is based on the important observation that a
    DNN model can be split inside between two successive layers with two partitions
    deployed on different locations without losing accuracy. An inevitable problem
    on DNN splitting is how to select the splitting point such that distributed DNN
    training is still under the latency requirement. On this problem, Mao et al. [58]
    utilize the differentially private mechanism and partitions DNN after the first
    convolutional layer to minimize the cost of mobile devices. The proof in [58]
    guarantees that applying differentially private mechanism on activations is feasible
    for outsourcing training tasks to untrusted edge servers. Wang et al. [59] consider
    this problem across mobile devices and cloud datacenters. To benefit from the
    computation power of cloud datacenters without privacy risks, Wang et al. [59]
    design Arden (privAte infeRence framework based on Deep nEural Networks), a framework
    that partitions the DNN model with a lightweight privacy-preserving mechanism.
    By arbitrary data nullification and random noise addition, Arden achieves privacy
    protection. Considering the negative impact of private perturbation to the original
    data, Wang et al. [59] use a noisy training method to enhance the cloud-side network
    robustness to perturbed data. Osia et al. [60] introduce a hybrid user-cloud framework
    on the privacy issue, which utilizes a private-feature extractor as its core component
    and breaking down large, complex deep models for cooperative, privacy-preserving
    analytics. In this framework, the feature extractor module is properly designed
    to output the private feature constrained to keep the primary information while
    discarding all the other sensitive information. Three different techniques are
    employed to make sensitive measures unpredictable: dimensionality reduction, noise
    addition, and Siamese fine-tuning. When applying DNN splitting for privacy-preserving,
    it is remarkable that this technique also works for dealing with the tremendous
    computation of DNN. Exploiting the fact that edge computing usually involves a
    large number of devices, parallelization approaches are usually employed to manage
    DNN computation. DNN training in parallel includes two kinds of parallelism: data
    parallelism and model parallelism. However, data parallelism may bring heavy overhead
    of communication, while model parallelism usually leads to severe underutilization
    of computation resources. To address these problems, Harlap et al. [61] propose
    pipeline parallelism, an enhancement to model parallelism, where multiple minibatches
    are injected into the system at once to ensure efficient and concurrent use of
    computation resources. Based on pipeline parallelism, Harlap et al. [61] design
    PipeDream, a system that supports pipelined training and automatically determines
    how to systematically split a given model across the available computing nodes.
    PipeDream shows the advantage of reducing communication overhead and utilizing
    computing resource efficiently. The overview of PipeDream’s automated mechanism
    is shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10. PipeDreams automated mechanism. Show All 5) Knowledge
    Transfer Learning: Knowledge transfer learning, or transfer learning for simplicity,
    is closely connected with DNN splitting technique. In transfer learning, for the
    purpose of reducing DNN model training energy cost on edge devices, we first train
    a base network (teacher network) on a base data set, and then, we repurpose the
    learned features, i.e., transfer them to the second target network (student network)
    to be trained on a target data set. This process will tend to work if the features
    are general (i.e., suitable to both base and target tasks) instead of specific
    to the base task. The transition involves a process from generality to specificity.
    The approach of transfer learning seems to be promising for learning on edge devices
    since it has greatly reduced resource demand, but a thorough investigation on
    its effectiveness is lacking. To bridge this gap, Sharma et al. [62] and Chen
    et al. [44] provide extensive studies on the performance (in both accuracy and
    convergence speed) of transfer learning, considering different student network
    architectures and different techniques for transferring knowledge from teacher
    to student. The result varies with architectures and transfer techniques. A good
    performance improvement is obtained by transferring knowledge from both the intermediate
    layers and last layer of the teacher to a shallower student while other architectures
    and transfer techniques do not fare so well and some of them even lead to negative
    performance impact. Transfer learning technique regards the shallow layers of
    a pretrained DNN on one data set as a generic feature extractor that can be applied
    to other target tasks or data sets. With this feature, transfer learning is employed
    in many pieces of research and inspires the design of some frameworks. Osia et
    al. [60], which we have mentioned in Section IVC4, use transfer learning to determine
    the degree of generality and particularity of a private feature. Arden, proposed
    in [59], partitions a DNN across the mobile device and the cloud data center,
    where the raw data are transformed by the shallow portions of the DNN on the mobile
    device side. As [59] referred, the design of DNN splitting in Arden is inspired
    by transfer learning. 6) Gossip Training: Aiming at shortening the training latency,
    gossip training is a new decentralized training method, which is built on randomized
    gossip algorithms. The early work on random gossip algorithms is gossip averaging
    [63], which can fast converge toward a consensus among nodes by exchanging information
    peer to peer. The gossip distributed algorithms enjoy the advantage of full asynchronization
    and total decentralization as they have no requirement on centralized nodes or
    variables. Inspired by this, Gossip SGD (GoSGD) [64] is proposed to train DNN
    models in an asynchronous and decentralized way. GoSGD manages a group of independent
    nodes, where each of them hosts a DNN model and iteratively proceeds two steps:
    gradient update and mixing update. Specifically, each node updates its hosted
    DNN model locally in gradient update step and then shares its information with
    another randomly selected node in mixing update step, as shown in Fig. 11. The
    steps repeat until all the DNN converge on a consensus. Fig. 11. Communication
    with randomly selected partner in gossip manner. Show All The aim of GoSGD is
    to address the issue of speeding up the training of convolutional networks. Instead,
    another gossip-based algorithm, gossiping SGD [65], is designed to retain the
    positive features of both synchronous and asynchronous SGD methods. Gossiping
    SGD replaces the all-reduce collective operation of synchronous training with
    a gossip aggregation algorithm, achieving an asynchronous manner. Both Blot et
    al. [64] and Jin et al. [65] apply gossip algorithms on the updates of SGD, but
    neither of them has performance convergence degradation at large scale. By deployment
    on large-scale systems, Daily et al. [66] show that the trivial gossip-based algorithms
    at scale lead to a communication imbalance, poor convergence, and heavy communication
    overhead. To mitigate these issues, Daily et al. [66] introduce GossipGraD, a
    gossip communication protocol-based SGD algorithm that is practical for scaling
    deep learning algorithms on large-scale systems. GossipGrad reduces the overall
    communication complexity from Θ(log(p)) to O(1) and considers diffusion such that
    computing nodes exchange their updates (gradients) indirectly after every log(p)
    steps. It also considers the rotation of communication partners for facilitating
    direct diffusion of gradients and asynchronous distributed sample shuffling during
    the feedforward phase in SGD to prevent overfitting. D. Summary of Existing Systems
    and Frameworks In this section, we summary the systems and framework for distributed
    EI model training on the edge. An overview of the above-mentioned existing systems
    and frameworks is given in Table 2, including the architecture, EI level, objectives,
    employed technologies, and effectiveness. Table 2 Overview of Systems and Frameworks
    on EI Model Training In general, a key challenge for distributed EI model training
    is the data privacy issue. It is because the distributed data sources may originate
    from individual persons and different organizations. For users, they may be sensitive
    to their own private data, not allowing any private information to be shared.
    For companies, they have to consider the privacy policy to avoid legal subpoenas
    and extrajudicial surveillance. Therefore, the design of distributed training
    systems needs to carefully consider privacy preservation. Systems considering
    privacy issue in Table 2 include FedAvg, BlockFL, GossipGraD, and so on. The decentralized
    architecture is naturally friendly to user’s privacy, for which the systems that
    are based on the decentralized architecture such as BlockFL and GossipGraD typically
    preserve privacy better. By contrast, the centralized architecture involves a
    centralized data collection operation, and the hybrid architecture requires a
    data transmission operation. For this reason, the systems based on these two architectures
    would implement more extra efforts in data privacy protection. Compared with the
    DNN training under the cloud-based framework, the DNN training under edge-based
    framework pays more attention to protecting users’ privacy and training an available
    deep learning model faster. Under cloud-based training, a large amount of raw
    data generated at the client side is directly transmitted to the cloud data center
    through the long WAN, which not only causes hidden dangers of user privacy leakage
    but also consumes huge bandwidth resources. Moreover, in some scenarios such as
    military and disaster applications when access to the cloud center is impossible,
    the edge-based training will be highly desirable. On the other hand, the cloud
    data center can collect a larger amount of data and train an AI model with more
    powerful resources, and hence, the advantage of cloud intelligence is that it
    can train a much larger-scale and more accurate model. SECTION V. Edge Intelligence
    Model Inference After the distributed training of deep learning model, the efficient
    implementation of model inference at the edge will be critical for enabling high-quality
    EI service deployment. In this section, we discuss the DNN model inference at
    the edge, including the architectures, key performance indicators, enabling techniques,
    and existing systems and frameworks. A. Architectures Besides the common cloud-based
    and device-cloud inference architectures, we further define several major edge-centric
    inference architectures and classify them into four DNN model inference modes,
    namely, edge-based, device-based, edge-device, and edge-cloud modes, which are
    illustrated in Fig. 12(a)–(d), respectively. We describe the main workflow of
    each mode as follows. Fig. 12. Major edge-centric inference modes. (a) Edge-based
    mode. (b) Device-based mode. (c) Edge-device mode. (d) Edge-cloud mode. Show All
    1) Edge-Based Mode: In Fig. 12(a), device A is in the edge-based mode, which means
    that the device receives the input data then send them to the edge server. When
    the DNN model inference is done at the edge server, the prediction results will
    be returned to the device. In this inference mode, since the DNN model is on the
    edge server, it is easy to implement the application on different mobile platforms.
    However, the main disadvantage is that the inference performance depends on network
    bandwidth between the device and the edge server. 2) Device-Based Mode: In Fig.
    12(b), device B is in the device-based mode. The mobile device obtains the DNN
    model from the edge server and performs the model inference locally. During the
    inference process, the mobile device does not communicate with the edge server.
    Therefore, the inference is reliable, but it requires a large amount of resources
    such as CPU, GPU, and RAM on the mobile device. The performance depends on the
    local device itself. 3) Edge-Device Mode: In Fig. 12(c), device C is in the edge-device
    mode. In the edge-device mode, the device first partitions the DNN model into
    multiple parts according to the current system environmental factors such as network
    bandwidth, device resource, and edge server workload. Then, the device will execute
    the DNN model up to a specific layer and send the intermediate data to the edge
    server. The edge server will execute the remaining layers and sends the prediction
    results to the device. Compared to the edge-based and device-based modes, the
    edge-device mode is more reliable and flexible. It may also require huge resource
    on the mobile device because the convolution layers at the front position of a
    DNN model are computational-intensive generally. 4) Edge-Cloud Mode: In Fig. 12(d),
    device D is in the edge-cloud mode. It is similar to the edge-device mode and
    is suitable for the case that the device is highly resource constrained. In this
    mode, the device is responsible for input data collection, and the DNN model is
    executed through edge-cloud synergy. The performance of this model heavily depends
    on the network connection quality. We should emphasize that the above-mentioned
    four edge-centric inference modes can be adopted in a system simultaneously to
    carry out complex AI model inference tasks (e.g., cloud–edge-device hierarchy),
    by efficiently pooing heterogeneous resources across a multitude of end devices,
    edge nodes, and clouds. B. Key Performance Indicators To describe the service
    quality of the EI model inference, we introduce the following five metrics. 1)
    Latency: Latency refers to the time spent in the whole inference process, including
    preprocessing, model inference, data transmission, and postprocessing. For some
    real-time intelligent mobile applications (e.g., AR/VR mobile gaming and intelligent
    robots), they usually have stringent deadline requirement such as 100-ms latency.
    Latency indicator is affected by many factors, including the resources on edge
    devices, the way of data transmission, and the way to execute the DNN model. 2)
    Accuracy: Accuracy refers to the ratio of the number of the input samples that
    get the correct predictions from inference to the total number of input samples,
    reflecting the performance of the DNN models. For some mobile applications requiring
    a high level of reliability, such as self-driving car and face authentication,
    they demand the ultrahigh accuracy on the DNN model inference. Besides the DNN
    model’s own inference capability, the inference accuracy depends on the speed
    of feeding the input data to the DNN model. For a video analytics application,
    under a fast feeding rate, some input samples may be skipped due to the edge device’s
    constraint resources, causing a drop in accuracy. 3) Energy: To execute a DNN
    model, compared with the edge server and the cloud data center, the end devices
    are usually battery-limited. The computation and communication overheads of DNN
    model inference bring a large amount of energy consumption. For an EI application,
    energy efficiency is of great importance and is affected by the size of the DNN
    model and the resources on edge devices. 4) Privacy: IoT and mobile devices generate
    a huge amount of data, which could be privacy sensitive. Thus, it is also important
    to protect privacy and data security near the data source for an EI application
    during the model inference stage. Privacy protection depends on the way of processing
    the original data. 5) Communication Overhead: Except for the device-based mode,
    the communication overhead affects the inference performance of the other modes
    greatly. It is necessary to minimize the overhead during the DNN model inference
    in an EI application, particularly the expensive WAN bandwidth usage for the cloud.
    Communication overhead here mainly depends on the mode of DNN inference and the
    available bandwidth. 6) Memory Footprint: Optimizing the memory footprint of performing
    DNN model inference on mobile devices is very necessary. On the one hand, typically,
    a high-precision DNN model is accompanied by millions of parameters, which is
    very hungry for the hardware resources of mobile devices. On the other hand, unlike
    high-performance discrete GPUs on the cloud data center, there is no dedicated
    high-bandwidth memory for mobile GPUs on mobile devices [69]. Moreover, mobile
    CPUs and GPUs typically compete for shared and scarce memory bandwidths. For the
    optimization of the DNN inference at the edge side, the memory footprint is a
    nonnegligible indicator. Memory footprint is mainly affected by the size of the
    original DNN model and the way of loading the tremendous DNN parameters. C. Enabling
    Technologies In this section, we review the enabling technologies for improving
    one or more of the aforementioned key performance indicators for EI model inference.
    Table 3 summarizes the highlights of each enabling technology. Table 3 Technologies
    for Distributed DNN inference at the Edge 1) Model Compression: To alleviate the
    tension between resource-hungry DNNs and resource-poor end devices, DNN compression
    has been commonly adopted to reduce the model complexity and resource requirement,
    enabling local, on-device inference that, in turn, reduces the response latency
    and has fewer privacy concerns. That is, the model compression method optimizes
    the above four indicators; latency, energy, privacy, and memory footprint. Various
    DNN compression techniques have been proposed, including weight pruning, data
    quantization, and compact architecture design. Weight pruning represents the most
    widely adopted technique of model compression. This technique removes redundant
    weights (i.e., connections between neurons) from a trained DNN. Specifically,
    it first ranks the neurons in the DNN according to how much the neuron contributes
    and then removes the low-ranking neurons to reduce the model size. Since removing
    neurons damages the accuracy of the DNN, then how to reduce the network size meanwhile
    preserving the accuracy is the key challenge. For modern large-scale DNNs, a pilot
    research in [70] tackled this challenge by applying a magnitude-based weight pruning
    method. The basic idea of this method is as follows: first, remove small weights
    whose magnitudes are below a threshold (e.g., 0.001) and then fine-tune the model
    to restore the accuracy. For AlexNet and VGG-16, this method can reduce the number
    of weights by 9× and 13× with no loss of accuracy on ImageNet. The follow-up work
    deep compression [71], which blends the advantages of pruning, weight sharing,
    and Huffman coding to compress DNNs, further pushes the compression ratio to 35–
    49× . However, for energy-constrained end devices, the above magnitude-based weight
    pruning method may not be directly applicable since empirical measurements show
    that the reduction in the number of weights does not necessarily translate into
    significant energy saving [72]. This is because for DNNs as exemplified by AlexNet,
    the energy of the convolutional layers dominates the total energy cost, while
    the number in the fully connected layers contributes most of the total number
    of weights in the DNN. This suggests that the number of weights may not be a good
    indicator for energy, and the weight pruning should be directly energy-aware for
    end devices. As the first step toward this end, an online DNN energy estimation
    tool (https://energyestimation.mit.edu/) has been developed by MIT to enable fast
    and easy DNN energy estimation. This fine-grained tool profiles the energy for
    the data movement from different levels of the memory hierarchy, the number of
    MACs, and the data sparsity at the granularity of the DNN layer. Based on this
    energy estimation tool, an energy-aware pruning method called EAP [73] is proposed.
    Another mainstream technique for model compression is data quantization. Instead
    of adopting the 32-bit floating point format, this technique uses a more compact
    format to represent layer inputs, weights, or both. Since representing a number
    with fewer bits reduces memory footprint and accelerates computation, data quantization
    improves the overall computation and energy efficiency. Most of the prior proposals
    for quantization tune the bit-width only for a fixed number type in an ad hoc
    manner, which may lead to a suboptimal result. To address this issue, the recent
    work [76] investigated the problem of optimal number representations at the layer
    granularity, in terms of finding the optimal bit-width for the canonical format
    based on the IEEE 754 Standard. This problem is challenging due to the combinatorial
    explosion of feasible number formats. In response, the authors developed a portable
    API called number abstract data type (ADT). It enables users to declare the data
    to be quantized in a layer (e.g., inputs, weights, or both) as number type. By
    doing so, ADT encapsulates the internal representation of a number, thus separating
    the concern for developing an effective DNN from the concern of optimizing the
    number representation at a bit level. While most existing efforts use a single
    compression technique, they may not suffice to meet the diverse requirements and
    constraints on accuracy, latency, storage, and energy imposed by some IoT devices.
    Emerging studies have shown how different compression techniques can be coordinated
    to maximally compress DNN models. For example, both deep compression [71] and
    Minerva [74] combine weight pruning and data quantization to enable fast, low-power,
    and highly accurate DNN inference. More recently, researchers argue that for a
    given DNN, the combination of compression techniques should be selected on demand,
    i.e., adapting to the application-driven system performance (e.g., accuracy, latency,
    and energy) and the varying resource availability across platforms (e.g., storage
    and processing capability). To this end, the proposed automatic optimization framework
    AdaDeep [75] systematically formulates the goals and constraints on accuracy,
    latency, storage, and energy into a unified optimization problem and leverages
    DRL to effectively find a good combination of compression techniques. 2) Model
    Partition: To alleviate the pressure of the EI application execution on end devices,
    as shown in Fig. 13, one intuitive idea is the model partition, offloading the
    computational-intensive part to the edge server or the nearby mobile devices,
    obtaining a better model inference performance. Model partition mainly cares about
    the issues of latency, energy, and privacy. Fig. 13. Illustration for model partition
    between devices and edge server. Show All The model partition can be divided into
    two types: partition between server and device and partition between devices.
    For the model partition between the server and the device, Neurosurgeon [79] represents
    an iconic effort. In Neurosurgeon, the DNN model is partitioned between the device
    and the server, and the key challenge is to figure out one suitable partition
    point to get the optimal model inference performance. Considering latency aspect
    and energy efficiency aspect, respectively, the authors propose a regression-based
    method to estimate the latency of each layer in the DNN model and return an optimal
    partition point that makes the model inference meet latency requirement or energy
    requirement. Hereafter, Ko et al. [83] propose an edge-host partitioning method,
    which combines model partition with lossy feature encoding. That is, the intermediate
    data after model partition will be compressed using lossy feature encoding before
    transmission. Also, jointly leveraging model partition and lossy feature encoding,
    the JALAD [81] framework formulates the model partition as an integer linear programming
    (ILP) problem to minimize the model inference latency under a guaranteed accuracy
    constraint. For DNNs those are characterized by a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
    rather than a chain, optimizing the model partition to minimize the latency is
    proven to be NP-hard in general. In response, Hu et al. [80] propose an approximation
    algorithm that provides the worst case performance guarantee, based on the graph
    min-cut method. The above-mentioned frameworks all have an assumption that the
    server has the DNN model of the EI application. IONN [82] propose an incremental
    offloading technique for EI application. IONN partitions the DNN layers and incrementally
    uploads them to allow collaborative DNN model inference by mobile devices and
    the edge server. Compared to the approach that uploads the entire model, IONN
    significantly improves query performance and energy consumption during DNN model
    uploading. Another type of model partition is the partition between devices. As
    the pioneering effort of model partition between devices, MoDNN [85] introduces
    a WiFi direct technique to build a microscale computing cluster in WLAN with multiple
    authorized WiFi-enabled mobile devices for partitioned DNN model inference. The
    mobile device that carries the DNN task will be the group owner and the others
    act as the worker nodes. Two partition schemes are proposed in MoDNN to accelerate
    DNN layer execution. The experiment shows that with two to four worker nodes,
    MoDNN accelerates the DNN model inference by 2.17–4.28 × . In the follow-up work
    MeDNN [84], greedy 2-D partition is proposed to adaptively partition the DNN model
    into multiple mobile devices and utilize a structured sparsity pruning technique
    to compress the DNN model. MeDNN improves the DNN model inference by 1.86–2.44
    × with two to four worker nodes and saves 26.5% of additional computing time and
    14.2% of extra communication time. Note that DNN layers are partitioned horizontally
    in MoDNN and MeDNN, whereas DeepThings [86] employs a fused tile partitioning
    method that partitions the DNN layers vertically to reduce the memory footprint.
    DeepX [77] also tries to partition DNN models but it only partitions the DNN model
    into several submodels and distributes them on local processors. DeepX proposes
    two schemes: runtime layer compression (RLC) and deep architecture decomposition
    (DAD). The layer after compression will be executed by specific local processors
    (CPU, GPU, and DSP). An additional note is that when we have multiple tasks of
    model partition, we need to make optimization for the scheduler. LEO [113] is
    a novel sensing algorithm scheduler that maximizes the performance for multiple
    continuous mobile sensor applications by partitioning the sensing algorithm execution
    and distributing tasks on CPU, coprocessor, GPU and the cloud. 3) Model Early
    Exit: A DNN model with a high accuracy usually has a deep structure. It consumes
    a large number of resources to execute such a DNN model on the end device. To
    accelerate model inference, the model early-exit method leverages output data
    of early layer to get the classification result, which means that the inference
    process is finished by using the partial DNN model. Latency is the optimization
    target of model early exit. BranchyNet [87] is a programming framework that implements
    the model early-exit mechanism. With BranchyNet, the standard DNN model structure
    is modified by adding exit branches at certain layer locations. Each exit branch
    is an exit point and shares part of DNN layers with the standard DNN model. Fig.
    14 shows a CNN model with three five points. The input data can be classified
    at these diverse early-exit points. Fig. 14. CNN model with five exit points.
    Show All Based on BranchyNet, a framework named DDNNs [88] for distributed DNNs
    across the cloud, edge, and devices is proposed. DDNNs have a three-layer structure
    framework, including device layer, edge server layer, and cloud layer. Each layer
    represents an exit point of BranchyNet. Three aggregation methods, including max
    pooling (MP), average pooling (AP), and concatenation (CC), are proposed. The
    aggregation methods work when multiple mobile devices send intermediate to an
    edge server or when multiple edge servers send intermediate data to the cloud
    data center. MP aggregates the data vectors by taking the maximum of each component.
    AP aggregates the data vectors by taking the average of each component. CC just
    simply concatenates the data vectors as one vector. Also, built on top of BranchyNet,
    Edgent [10] is proposed to navigate the accuracy-latency tradeoff when jointly
    applying model early-exit and model partition. The basic idea of Edgent is to
    maximize the accuracy under a given latency requirement via the regression-based
    layer latency prediction model. In addition to BranchyNet, there are different
    methods to implement model early exit. For example, the cascading network [91]
    simply adds the MP layer and fully connected layer to the standard DNN model and
    achieves a speedup of 20%. DeepIns [15] proposes a manufacture inspection system
    for the smart industry using DNN model early exit. In DeepIns, edge devices are
    responsible for data collection, the edge server acts as the first exit point,
    and the cloud data center acts as the second exit point. Then, Lo et al. [90]
    propose adding an authentic operation (AO) unit to the basic BranchyNet model.
    The AO unit determines whether an input has to be transferred to the edge server
    or cloud data center for further execution by setting different threshold criteria
    of a confidence level for different DNN model output classes. Bolukbasi et al.
    [89] train a policy that determines whether the current samples should proceed
    to the next layer by adding regularization to the evaluation latency of the DNN
    model. 4) Edge Caching: Edge caching is a new kind of method used to accelerate
    DNN model inference, i.e., optimizing the latency issue by caching the DNN inference
    results. The core idea of edge caching is to cache and reuse the task results
    such as the prediction of image classification at the network edge, reducing the
    querying latency of EI application. Fig. 15 shows the basic process of the semantic
    cache technique; if the request from mobile devices hits the cached results stored
    in the edge server, the edge server will return the result, otherwise, the request
    will be transferred to the cloud data center for inference with the model of full
    precision. Fig. 15. Process of the semantic cache technique. Show All Glimpse
    [92] is a pioneering effort to introduce cache technique to DNN inference task.
    For an object detection application, Glimpse proposes to reuse the stale detection
    result to detect the object on current frames. The results of the detected object
    of the stale frames are cached on the mobile devices, and then, Glimpse extracts
    a subset of these cached results and computes the optical flow of features between
    the processed frames and the current frame. The computing results of optical flow
    will guide us to move the bounding box to the right location in the current frame.
    Glimpse achieves an acceleration of 1.6–5.5 × . However, caching results locally
    do not scale beyond tens of images, then Cachier [93] is proposed to achieve recognition
    of thousands of objects. In Cachier, results of EI application are cached in the
    edge server, storing the features of input (e.g., image) and the corresponding
    task results. Then, Cachier uses the least frequently used (LFS) as the cache
    replacement strategy. If the input cannot hit the cache, the edge server will
    transfer the input to the cloud data center. Cachier can increase responsiveness
    by 3× or more. Precog [94] is the extension of Cachier. In Precog, the cached
    data are not only stored in the edge server but also in the mobile device. Precog
    uses predictions of Markov chains to prefetch data onto the mobile device and
    reach a speedup of 5× . In addition, Precog also proposes to dynamically adjust
    the cached feature extraction model on the mobile device according to the environment
    information. Shadow Puppets is another improved version of Cachier. Cachier extracts
    features from the input using the standard feature extraction like locality-sensitive
    hashing (LSH), but these features may not reflect the similarity as precise as
    the human dose. Then, in Shadow Puppets [96], it uses a small-footprint DNN to
    generate hash codes to represent the input data and get a remarkable latency improvement
    of 5– 10× . Considering the application scenario that the same application runs
    on multiple devices in close proximity and the DNN model often processes similar
    input data, FoggyCache [95] is proposed to minimize these redundant computations.
    There are two challenges in FoggyCache: one is that the input data distribution
    is unknown so the problem is how to index the input data with a constant lookup
    quality and the other is how to represent the similarity of the input data. To
    address these two challenges, FoggyCache proposes adaptive LSH (A-LSH) and homogenized
    kNN (H-kNN) schemes, respectively. FoggyCache reduces computation latency and
    energy consumption by a factor of 3× to 10× . 5) Input Filtering: Input filtering
    is an efficient method to accelerate DNN model inference, especially for the video
    analytics. As shown in Fig. 16, the key idea of input filtering is to remove the
    nontarget-object frames of input data, avoiding redundant computation of the DNN
    model inference, thus improving inference accuracy, shortening inference latency,
    and reducing energy cost. Fig. 16. Workflow of input filtering. Show All NoScope
    [97] is proposed to accelerate video analysis by skipping the frames that have
    little change. To this end, NoScope implements a difference detector that highlights
    temporal differences across frames, for example, the detector monitors the frames
    to check whether cars appear in the frames and the frame with cars will be processed
    in the DNN model inference. The difference is detected by using lightweight binary
    classifiers. In a scenario of continuous video transmission from a swarm of drones,
    Wang et al. [98] optimize for the first hop wireless bandwidth of DNN inference.
    In particular, four strategies are proposed to reduce total transmission: EarlyDiscard,
    Just-in-Time-Learning (JITL), Reachback, and Context-Aware. FFS-VA [100] is a
    pipelined system for multistage video analytics. There are three stages to build
    the filtering system of FFS-VA. The first is a stream-specialized different detector
    (SDD) that is used to remove the frames only containing a background. The second
    is a stream-specialized network model (SNM) to identify target-object frames.
    The third is a Tiny-YOLO-Voc (T-YOLO) model to remove the frames whose target
    objects are fewer than a threshold. Canel et al. [101] propose a two-stage filtering
    system for video analytics. It first extracts the semantic content of the frames
    by outputting the intermediate data of DNN, and then, these output features are
    accumulated in a frame buffer. The buffer is viewed as a DAG, and the filtering
    system uses the Euclidean distance as the similarity metric to figure out top-
    k interesting frames. The above-mentioned frameworks focus on filtering uninteresting
    frames of a video stream for a single camera. ReXCam [99] accelerates DNN model
    inference on cross-camera analytics. The ReXCam leverages a learned spatiotemporal
    model to filter video frames. ReXCam reduces computation workload by 4.6 × and
    improves DNN model inference accuracy by 27%. 6) Model Selection: Model selection
    method is proposed to optimize the DNN inference issue of latency, accuracy, and
    energy. The main idea of model selection is that we can first train a set of DNN
    models for the same task with various model sizes offline and then adaptively
    select the model for inference online. Model selection is similar to the model
    early exit, and the exit point of the model early-exit mechanism can be viewed
    as a DNN model. However, the key difference is that the exit point shares part
    of DNN layers with the main branch model, and the models in the model selection
    mechanism are independent. Park et al. [102] propose a big/little DNN model selection
    framework. That is, a little and fast model is used to try to classify the input
    data and the big model is only used when the confidence of the little model is
    less than a predefined threshold. Taylor et al. [103] point out that different
    DNN models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet, and Inception) reach the lowest inference
    latency or highest accuracy on different evaluation metrics (top-1 or top-5) for
    different images. Then, they propose a framework for selecting the best DNN in
    terms of latency and accuracy. In this framework, a model selector is trained
    to select the best DNN for different input images. Similarly, IF-CNN [105] also
    trains a model selector called the recognition predictor (RP) to change the model
    used in the task. RP is a DNN model of multitask, meaning that RP has multiple
    outputs. The output of RP represents the probability of top-1 label of each candidate
    DNN model. The input of RP is the image and if the output of RP is over the predefined
    threshold, the corresponding DNN model will be selected. Besides the optimization
    for DNN model inference latency, aiming at energy saving, Stamoulis et al. [106]
    cast the adaptive DNN model selection issue as a hyperparameter optimization problem
    by taking into account the accuracy and communication constraints imposed by the
    devices. Then, a Bayesian optimization (BO) is adopted to solve this problem,
    achieving an improvement by up to 6× in terms of minimum energy per image under
    accuracy constraints. 7) Support for Multitenancy: In practice, an end or edge
    device typically runs more than one DNN applications concurrently. For example,
    the advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) for Internet vehicles simultaneously
    runs DNN programs for vehicle detection, pedestrian detection, traffic sign recognition,
    and lane line detection. In this case, multiple DNN applications would compete
    for limited resource. Without careful support for multitenancy, i.e., resource
    allocation and task scheduling for those concurrent applications, the global efficiency
    would be greatly deteriorated. The support for multitenancy focuses on the optimization
    of energy and memory footprint. Taking the dynamics of runtime resources into
    consideration, NestDNN [107] is proposed to offering flexible resource–accuracy
    tradeoffs for each DNN model. NestDNN implements a new model pruning and recovery
    scheme, transforming the DNN model into a single compact multicapacity model that
    consists of a set of descendent models. Each descendent model offers a unique
    resource–accuracy tradeoff. For each concurrent descendent model, NestDNN encodes
    its accuracy and latency into a cost function and then builds a resource–accuracy
    runtime scheduler to make the optimal tradeoff for each concurrent descendent
    model. Also, addressing the challenge of enabling flexible tradeoffs, Mainstream
    [110] uses the popular transfer-learning DNN training method to train multiple
    DNN models with different degrees of accuracy and implements a greedy approach
    to find the optimal scheduler that fits the cost budget. For multiple DNN model
    executions on one single device, HiveMind [111] is proposed to improve the GPU
    utilization for these concurrent workloads. HiveMind consists of two key components:
    a compiler and a runtime module. The compiler optimizes the data transmission,
    data preprocessing, and computation across the workloads, and then, the runtime
    module transforms the optimized models into an execution DAG, which will be executed
    on the GPU while trying to extract as much concurrency as possible. At a finer
    granularity, DeepEye [108] is proposed to optimize the inference of multitask
    on the mobile device by scheduling the executions of heterogeneous DNN layers.
    DeepEye first segregates DNN layers of all tasks into two pools: convolution layers
    and fully connected layers. For the convolution layers, a first-in(endash)first-out
    (FIFO) queue-based execution strategy is employed. For the fully connected layers,
    DeepEye adopts a greedy approach for caching the parameters of the fully connected
    layers to maximize memory utilization. 8) Application-Specific Optimization: While
    the above-mentioned optimizing techniques are generally applicable to EI applications,
    application-specific optimization can be exploited to further optimize the performance
    of EI applications, i.e., accuracy, latency, energy, and memory footprint. For
    example, for video-based applications, two knobs, i.e., frame rate and resolution,
    can be flexibly adjusted to reduce resource demand. However, since such resource-sensitive
    knobs also deteriorate the inference accuracy, they naturally incur a cost-accuracy
    tradeoff. This requires us to strike a good balance between the resource cost
    and inference accuracy when tuning the video frame rate and resolution. Toward
    the above goal, Chameleon [104] adjusts the knobs for each video analytic task
    by sharing the best top- k configuration between each task. In Chameleon, the
    video tasks are grouped according to the spatial correlation, and then, the leader
    of the group will search for the best top- k configurations and share them with
    the followers. DeepDecision [112] formulates the knob-tunning problem as a multiple-choice
    multiple-constraint knapsack program and solves it with an improved brute-force
    search method. It is also worth noting that, in the computer architecture community,
    hardware acceleration for efficient DNN inference has been a very hot topic and
    gathered extensive research efforts. Interested readers are encouraged to refer
    to the recent monograph [114] for more comprehensive discussions about recent
    advancements on hardware acceleration for DNN processing. D. Summary of Existing
    Systems and Frameworks To showcase the application of the above enabling techniques
    for EI model inference, the relevant systems and frameworks are summarized in
    Table 4, including the perspectives of target applications, architecture and EI
    level, optimization objectives and adopted techniques, as well as effectiveness.
    Table 4 Overview of Systems and Frameworks on EI Model Inference Clearly, the
    existing systems and frameworks have adopted different subsets of enabling techniques
    tailored to specific EI applications and requirements. To maximize the overall
    performance of a generic EI system, comprehensive enabling techniques and various
    optimization methods should work in a cooperative manner to provide rich design
    flexibility. Nevertheless, we would face a high-dimensional configuration problem
    that is required to determine a large number of performance-critical configuration
    parameters in real time. Taking video analytics, for example, the high-dimensional
    configuration parameters can include video frame rate, resolution, model selection,
    and model early exit. Due to the combinatorial nature, the high-dimensional configuration
    problem involves a huge search space of parameters and is very challenging to
    tackle. SECTION VI. Future Research Directions Based on the comprehensive discussions
    above on existing efforts, we now articulate the key open challenges and future
    research directions for EI. A. Programming and Software Platforms Currently, many
    companies around the world focus on the AI cloud computing service provisioning.
    Some leading companies are also starting to provide programming/software platforms
    to deliver edge computing services, such as Amazon’s Greengrass, Microsoft’s Azure
    IoT Edge, and Google’s Cloud IoT Edge. Nevertheless, currently, most of these
    platforms mainly serve as relays for connecting to the powerful cloud data centers.
    As more and more AI-driven computation-intensive mobile and IoT applications are
    emerging, EI as a service (EIaaS) can become a pervasive paradigm and EI platforms
    with powerful edge AI functionalities will be developed and deployed. This is
    substantially different from ML as a service (MLaaS) provided by public clouds.
    Essentially, MLaaS belongs to cloud intelligence and it focuses on selecting the
    proper server configuration and ML framework to train model in the cloud in a
    cost-efficient manner. While in a sharp contrast, EIaaS concerns more about how
    to perform model training and inference in resource-constrained and privacy-sensitive
    edge computing environments. To fully realize the potential of EI services, there
    are several key challenges to overcome. First, the EI platforms should be heterogeneity-compatible.
    In the future, there are many dispersive EI service providers/vendors, and the
    common open standard should be set such that users can enjoy seamless and smooth
    services across heterogeneous EI platforms anywhere and anytime. Second, there
    are many AI programming frameworks available (e.g., Tensorflow, Torch, and Caffe).
    In the future, the portability of the edge AI models trained by different programming
    frameworks across heterogeneously distributed edge nodes should be supported.
    Third, there are many programming frameworks designed specifically for edge devices
    (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, Caffe2, CoreML, and MXNet); however, empirical measurements
    [115] show that there is no single winner that can outperform other frameworks
    in all metrics. A framework that performs efficiently on more metrics can be expected
    in the future. Last but not least, lightweight virtualization and computing techniques
    such as container and function computing should be further explored to enable
    efficient EI service placement and migration over resource-constrained edge environments.
    B. Resource-Friendly Edge AI Model Design Many existing AI models such as CNN
    and LSTM were originally designed for applications such as computer vision and
    natural language processing. Most of the deep learning-based AI models are highly
    resource-intensive, which means that powerful computing capability supported by
    abundant hardware resources (e.g., GPU, field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
    and TPU) is important to boost the performance of these AI models. Therefore,
    as mentioned above, there are many studies to exploit model compression techniques
    (e.g., weight pruning) to resize the AI models, making them more resource-friendly
    for edge deployment. Along with a different line, we can promote a resource-aware
    edge AI model design. Instead of utilizing the existing resource-intensive AI
    models, we can leverage the AutoML idea [116] and the neural architecture search
    (NAS) techniques [117] to devise resource-efficient edge AI models tailored to
    the hardware resource constraints of the underlying edge devices and servers.
    For example, methods such as RL, genetic algorithm, and BO can be adopted to efficiently
    search over the AI model design parameter space (i.e., AI model components and
    their connections) by taking into account the impact of hardware resource (e.g.,
    CPU and memory) constraints on the performance metrics such as execution latency
    and energy overhead. C. Computation-Aware Networking Techniques For EI, computation-intensive
    AI-based applications are typically run on the distributed edge computing environment.
    As a result, advanced networking solutions with computation awareness are highly
    desirable, such that the computation results and data can be efficiently shared
    across different edge nodes. For the future 5G networks, the ultrareliable low-latency
    communication (URLLC) has been defined for mission-critical application scenarios
    that demand low delay and high reliability. Therefore, it will be promising to
    integrate the 5G URLLC capability with edge computing to provide ultrareliable
    low-latency EI (URLL-EI) services. Also, advanced techniques such as software-defined
    network and network function virtualization will be adopted in 5G. These techniques
    will enable flexible control over the network resources for supporting on-demand
    interconnections across different edge nodes for computation-intensive AI applications.
    On the other hand, autonomous networking mechanism design is important to achieve
    efficient EI service provisioning under dynamic heterogeneous network coexistence
    (e.g., LTE/5G/WiFi/LoRa), allowing newly added edge nodes and devices to self-configure
    in the plug and play manner. Also, the computation-aware communication techniques
    are starting to draw attention, such as gradient coding [118] to mitigate straggler
    effect in distributed learning and over-the-air computation for DSGD [119], which
    can be useful for edge AI model training acceleration. D. Tradeoff Design With
    Various DNN Performance Metrics For an EI application with a specific mission,
    there is usually a series of DNN model candidates that are capable of finishing
    the task. However, it is difficult for software developers to choose an appropriate
    DNN model for the EI application because the standard performance indicators such
    as top- k accuracy or mean average precision fail to reflect the runtime performance
    of DNN model inference on edge devices. For instance, during the EI application
    deployment phase, beside accuracy, inference speed and resource usage are also
    critical metrics. We need to explore the tradeoffs between these metrics and identify
    the factors that affect them. For the object recognition application, Huang et
    al. [120] investigate the influence of the main factors, e.g., number of proposals,
    input image size, and the selection of feature extractor, on inference speed and
    accuracy. Based on their experiment results, a new combination of these factors
    is found to outperform the state-of-the-art method. Therefore, it is necessary
    to explore the tradeoffs between different metrics, helping in improving the efficiency
    of deploying EI application. E. Smart Service and Resource Management By the distributed
    nature of edge computing, edge devices and nodes that offer EI functionality are
    dispersive across diverse geolocations and regions. Different edge devices and
    nodes may run different AI models and deploy different specific AI tasks. Therefore,
    it is important to design efficient service discovery protocols such that users
    can identify and locate the relevant EI service providers to fulfill their need
    in a timely manner. Also, to fully exploit the dispersive resource across edge
    nodes and devices, the partition of complex edge AI models into small subtasks
    and efficiently offloading these tasks among the edge nodes and devices for collaborative
    executions are essential. Since for many EI application scenarios (e.g., smart
    cities), the service environments are of high dynamics and it is hard to accurately
    predict future events. As a result, it would require the outstanding capability
    of online edge resource orchestration and provisioning to continuously accommodate
    massive EI tasks. Real-time joint optimization of heterogeneous computation, communication,
    and cache resource allocations and the high-dimensional system parameter configuration
    (e.g., choosing the proper model training and inference techniques) tailored to
    diverse task demands are critical. To tackle the algorithm design complexity,
    an emerging research direction is to leverage the AI techniques such as DRL to
    adapt efficient resource allocation policy in a data-driven self-learning way.
    F. Security and Privacy Issues The open nature of edge computing imposes that
    the decentralized trust is required such that the EI services provided by different
    entities are trustworthy [121]. Thus, lightweight and distributed security mechanism
    designs are critical to ensure user authentication and access control, model and
    data integrity, and mutual platform verification for EI. Also, it is important
    to study novel secure routing schemes and trust network topologies for EI service
    delivery when considering the coexistence of trusted edge nodes with malicious
    ones. On the other hand, the end users and devices would generate a massive volume
    of data at the network edge, and these data can be privacy sensitive since they
    may contain user’s location data, health or activities records, or manufacturing
    information, among many others. Subject to the privacy protection requirement,
    e.g., EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), directly sharing the original
    data sets among multiple edge nodes can have a high risk of privacy leakage. Thus,
    federated learning can be a feasible paradigm for privacy-friendly distributed
    data training such that the original data sets are kept in their generated devices/nodes
    and the edge AI model parameters are shared. To further enhance the data privacy,
    more and more research efforts are devoted to using the tools of differential
    privacy and homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation for designing
    privacy-preserving AI model parameter-sharing schemes [122]. G. Incentive and
    Business Models EI ecosystem will be a grand open consortium that consists of
    EI service providers and users, which can include but not limited to: platform
    providers (e.g., Amazon), AI software providers (e.g., SenseTime), edge device
    providers (e.g., Hikvision), network operators (e.g., AT&T), data generators (e.g.,
    IoT and mobile device owners), and service consumers (i.e., EI users). The high-efficiency
    operation of EI services may require close collaboration and integration across
    different service providers, e.g., for implementing expanded resource sharing
    and smooth service handover. Thus, proper incentive mechanism and business model
    are essential to stimulate effective and efficient cooperation among all members
    of the EI ecosystem. Also, for EI service, a user can be a service consumer and,
    meanwhile, a data generator as well. In this case, a novel smart pricing scheme
    is needed to factorize user’s service consumption and the value of its data contribution.
    As a means for decentralized collaboration, blockchain with a smart contract may
    be integrated into EI service by running on decentralized edge servers. It is
    worthwhile to do research on how to smartly charge the price and properly distribute
    the revenue among the members in the EI ecosystem according to their proof of
    work. Also, designing resource-friendly lightweight blockchain consensus protocol
    for EI is highly desirable. SECTION VII. Conclusion Driving by flourishing of
    both AI and IoT, there is a stringent need to pushing the AI frontier from the
    cloud to the network edge. To fulfill this trend, edge computing has been widely
    recognized as a promising solution to support computation-intensive AI applications
    in resource-constrained environments. The nexus between edge computing and AI
    gives birth to the novel paradigm of EI. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive
    survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first reviewed the
    background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provided
    an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies
    for the deep learning model toward training and inference at the network edge.
    Finally, we discussed the open challenges and future research directions on EI.
    We hope this survey is able to elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful
    discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI. Authors Figures References

    computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans.
    IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination
    just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such
    as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and
    Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices
    are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies
    are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil
    moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide
    spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce
    a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming
    environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of
    countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present
    a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper
    outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain
    and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed
    cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber
    attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

    According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected to exceed
    9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that makes people''s
    lives smart by conquering a plethora of diverse application and service areas.
    In near future, the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks provide the connectivity
    for this IoT ecosystem. It has been carefully designed to facilitate the exponential
    growth in the IoT field. Network slicing is one of the key technologies in the
    5G architecture that has the ability to divide the physical network into multiple
    logical networks (i.e., slices) with different network characteristics. Therefore,
    network slicing is also a key enabler of realisation of IoT in 5G. Network slicing
    can satisfy the various networking demands by heterogeneous IoT applications via
    dedicated slices. In this survey, we present a comprehensive analysis of the exploitation
    of network slicing in IoT realisation. We discuss network slicing utilisation
    in different IoT application scenarios, along with the technical challenges that
    can be solved via network slicing. Furthermore, integration challenges and open
    research problems related to the network slicing in the IoT realisation are also
    discussed in this paper. Finally, we discuss the role of other emerging technologies
    and concepts, such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
    (AI/ML) in network slicing and IoT integration. Published in: IEEE Communications

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\
    \ interoperability; security and\nprivacy; reliability; scalability\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [1],\
    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n2 of 18\n\
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\
    \ reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability\n\
    in terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;\
    \ real-time\ndata processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection\
    \ of infrastructure\nand smart farming assets (privacy and security); and ﬁnally,\
    \ compliance with policies and\nregulation. The proposed approach facilitates\
    \ cooperation among different parties in smart\nfarming ecosystems and enables\
    \ these actors to make the most use of available data sources.\nThe rest of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data\nprocessing\
    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\
    \ processing functions can be assigned to both layers.\nThe data processing layer\
    \ components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical\nmodeling, statistical\
    \ methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge\nfrom farm\
    \ data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to\
    \ make\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n4 of 18\nautomated decisions with limited human\
    \ involvement. Machine learning can perform\nrapid optimizations, classiﬁcations\
    \ [30], predictions, and recommendations and add value\nto the entire system [31].\
    \ For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes machine\nlearning\
    \ for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors the cows to detect\n\
    disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at milking stations on dairy\
    \ farms.\nAs another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an open-source analytic platform\
    \ that uses machine\nlearning to categorize iceberg lettuces to improve the actual\
    \ yield and crop marketability\nbefore harvesting [32]. Model deployment in the\
    \ context of machine learning refers to\nthe application of generalizing a model\
    \ to predict new items in the system. Prediction is\naccording to estimating the\
    \ outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.\nFor example,\
    \ the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest time\n\
    and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction about\
    \ the future\nusing time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming\
    \ is weather forecasting\nusing temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].\n\

    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\

    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\

    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    rights and content Highlights • Data sharing in agri-food is hindered by several
    real-world challenges. • Technology has a pivotal role to play when it comes to
    data sharing pipelines. • Data Trusts could be employed to allow data sharing
    to be adopted in agri-food. • Sharing trained machine learning models could allow
    for knowledge exchange. • This is definitely the case when sharing data is not
    possible. Abstract Data sharing is often hindered by a number of real word challenges
    caused by a mixture of technological and social factors. To date, the agri-food
    sector significantly lags behind other sectors in overcoming these challenges.
    However, the benefits of data sharing are too great to be ignored as they have
    a potential to address many historical failings such as issues related to food
    safety, traceability and transparency, and must be carefully considered as the
    sector is undergoing a widespread digitalisation. In this article, we explore
    the potential of different technologies in addressing the challenges presented
    by data sharing in the agri-food sector, and how the use of these technologies
    in the narrative of a Data Trust may address many of these obstacles. We argue
    the importance of utilising semantic web technologies, distributed ledger technologies,
    machine learning, and privacy preserving technologies to enable future transformative
    data sharing infrastructures in the agri-food sector. The utilisation of holistic
    statistical analysis of the shared data is also discussed, vital in supporting
    many of the sectors optimisation and sustainability goals. Previous article in

    supply chains 1. Introduction Data sharing poses many opportunities to address
    the historical failings impacting the agri-food supply chain, such as traceability
    and transparency in cases of food fraud (Sarpong, 2014, O’mahony, 2013). Many
    domains have seen great success from data sharing, notably genomic research, which
    for the last two decades have shared large quantities of data enabling extensive
    analysis of rare diseases, only possible through collaborative sharing (Taroni
    et al., 2019, Byrd et al., 2020). Other domains, in particular ones that have
    a more sensitive commercial component, such as drug discovery and pharmaceuticals,
    could also benefit from data sharing (e.g. in the need for rapid solutions to
    the Covid-19 pandemic); however, in such commercial settings, where intellectual
    property might be worth hundred of millions of pounds, sharing data might be seen
    as a less attractive aspect, resulting in reluctance to adopt data sharing principles.
    In addition, data sharing mechanisms are easily impeded by technical issues related
    to e.g. data quality, transparency and privacy protection concerns, and interoperability
    issues, as well as a host of social considerations including inequality and complex
    power dynamics (Stalla-Bourdillon et al., 2020, Open Data Insitute, 2019, van
    der Burg et al., 2020). Data sharing therefore presents both a challenge and an
    opportunity to the agri-food sector. Opportunities include increased transparency
    and traceability (whether to address food safety concerns or to meet consumer
    demand) (Feng et al., 2020), the potential for increased overall system efficiency
    via data science insights (Pham and Stack, 2018), and a general increase in cooperation
    and decrease in administrative friction. Beyond the technical challenges, which
    are the focus of this article, there are other major blockers in understanding
    ownership of data and correctly incentivising sharing by providing significant
    benefits. For example, reluctant partners can easily stymie data sharing, particularly
    if they are powerful actors in the food system (Open Data Insitute, 2020a). The
    primary gains possible from data sharing depend on the style and purpose of the
    sharing. One model to help support sharing is that of a Data Trust, in which independent,
    fiduciary stewardship of data is provided (Open Data Insitute, 2020b). In a regulatory
    setting where data sharing is required for compliance purposes, Data Trusts could
    remove some data maintenance and storage burden from industrial actors. However,
    perhaps more importantly Data Trusts could increase the speed of traceability
    for food safety related incidents and product recalls. In a wider setting of sharing
    production or pre-competitive data, there is significant potential for improved
    efficiency and profit, both for the sector as a whole and for individual operators.
    To focus our discussion more concretely and meet our objectives, we consider two
    particular use-cases for data sharing within agri-food, aligning with these two
    example types of gains, and outline some associated challenges and opportunities.
    Finally, the objectives of this article are (a) to explore the potential of different
    technologies – some established and others emerging – in addressing the challenges
    presented by data sharing in the agri-food sector; and (b) to discuss how these
    technologies, within the context of a Data Trust, can be used in practice to overcome
    the obstacles associated with data sharing. 1.1. Food and drink sector The UK
    Food and Drink sector is the largest manufacturing sector in the whole country,
    valued at about £100bn (Food and Drink federation and Santader Food and Industry
    Report, 2020); it is larger than automotive and aerospace combined. In 2018, total
    food and drink export figures were worth more than £23bn, with the top three export
    markets being Ireland, USA and France. The food supply chain employs about 4 million
    people and generated over £121bn of added value for the economy each year. It
    is largely a small and medium enterprises (SME) sector, as 97% of food and drink
    businesses are SMEs (Food and Drink federation and Santader Food and Industry
    Report, 2020). Although the effect of Brexit is still unclear, it is estimated
    that more than 100,000 new recruits will be needed by 2024 to feed the ever-growing
    population and meet market demand. UK Food and Drink sector includes several sub-sectors,
    e.g. animal feeds, bakery, confectionary, dairy, fish, fruit and vegetables, meat,
    etc., with the top 10 export products being whisky, salmon, chocolate, wine, cheese,
    gin, beef, pork, breakfast cereals and beer. Such is the growth of the sector
    that several of these products have seen more than a 10% increase on export demand
    in the last couple of years (Food and Drink federation and Santader Food and Industry
    Report, 2020). 1.2. Use Case 1: Traceability beyond one-up and one-down Traceability
    of goods within the food system is desireable from a number of perspectives, including
    regulatory requirements (e.g. in the case of bovine livestock in Europe (Council
    of European Union, 1992)), for food safety monitoring, and to satisfy consumer
    demand. Currently, apart from systems where central government reporting is required,
    a system of ‘one-up-one-down’ traceability is the norm (Wallace and Manning, 2020):
    here each actor in a supply chain will know the source and the destination of
    their products or goods, but will not know the next eventual destination or the
    original source. While this system does preserve the necessary information to
    reconstruct a product history through contacting all actors in the chain, it is
    cumbersome and may be too slow in a food safety emergency. 1.3. Use Case 2: Sharing
    data for production optimisation Insights leading to improved production efficiency
    may be possible from data analytic approaches on production data either from learned
    insights from the overall data or by an actor comparing their efficiency directly
    to their peers in an effort to identify areas of possible improvement (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Both of these would naively seem to require direct pooling of data
    between competitors, which data holders may be uncomfortable with. However, as
    we expand on below, there are a number of technological approaches that may allow
    some of this advantage to be gained while protecting individual commercial sensitivities.
    1.4. Challenges to data sharing Several social challenges to data sharing are
    reported in an Open Data Institute report describing a pilot study of a Data Trust
    for reducing food waste (Open Data Insitute, 2019). In particular, they report
    that businesses feared that sharing data might reveal commercially sensitive information
    to competitors, or that it might result in bad publicity for the sharer, and hence
    pose a reputational risk. Overall, they noted that manufacturers and retailers
    saw little value in sharing data about food waste, feeling that the benefits were
    insufficient to justify the competitive and reputational risks and the effort
    required to prepare the data. Trust and power between actors play a significant
    role in the uptake and ethical value of data sharing, even where legislation designed
    to support equitable sharing is in place (van der Burg et al., 2020). Where legislation
    is limited or absent, the situation may be even more untenable — agricultural
    actors have sometimes been reluctant to share data over a lack of trust with those
    who are gathering, collating, and sharing the data, and uncertainty about how
    data will be used and shared eventually (Wiseman et al., 2019, Jakku et al., 2019).
    It is clear that if actors in agri-food systems are to willingly participate in
    data sharing (via Data Trusts or otherwise) we must mitigate these concern, and
    the benefits of the sharing must be sufficient to overcome these social challenges.
    In addition to critical social challenges, there are a variety of technological
    challenges to effective data sharing (Feng et al., 2020, Chawinga and Zinn, 2019,
    Grabus and Greenberg, 2019). These span the entire data lifecycle and relate to
    the data format and encryption levels used by Data Trusts, security and transparency
    of data access, and ultimately the utilisation of data assets through analysis
    and as evidence. A pre-agreed data sharing system for traceability could significantly
    improve the efficiency and reliability of product tracing, regardless of whether
    the data required resided in a central location or locally with actors under careful
    federated agreements. However, widespread adoption of digital technologies including
    data sharing in sectors such as Agri-Food have yet to materialise; indeed almost
    60% of UK farm data are paper-based (Agrimetrics, 2020). In this paper, we expand
    on opportunities and challenges of Data Trusts, in particular discussing how Data
    Trusts and various technological approaches to data integration might address
    them. 2. Related work on data trusts and data sharing Data sharing has been largely
    enabled through the advent of cloud-based technologies, with the competition between
    large players pushing the limits in infrastructural capabilities and costs. Across
    Microsoft Azure,2 Amazon Web Services,3 and Google Cloud Computing4 one can find
    a plethora of cloud-based solutions spanning end-to-end pipelines, i.e. from data
    input and aggregation to model development and business intelligence. Such pipelines
    allow for a streamlined process of keeping data in remote locations – in a fault
    tolerant manner – enabling companies to rely less on local infrastructure. Along
    the lines of automation and cloud computing, cloud manufacturing has become popular
    over the past few years, as a resource sharing paradigm (Mourad and Nassehi, 2020).
    Through cloud manufacturing, businesses can have remote access to a pool of manufacturing
    resources and capabilities, akin to other cloud-based resources. This new paradigm
    enables businesses to leverage the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and its
    underlying infrastructure as a service including architecture models, and data
    and information exchange protocols. In this process, interoperability is a key
    component as it allows the implementation of vertically or horizontally integrated
    cyber–physical systems for production engineering (Mourad and Nassehi, 2020).
    In 2018, the EU launched the EU code of conduct for agricultural data sharing
    by contractual agreement, which encourages transparency about data use (van der
    Burg et al., 2020). The scope of this EU code has been to enable trust through
    the establishment of contractual agreements between the parties concerned with
    the data exchange process. In such cases, fostering trust goes beyond contractual
    agreements, whereby power relationships might be influencing the direction these
    agreements might take, as argued in van der Burg et al. (2020). Therefore contractual
    agreements are only one small component of the processes needed to accommodate
    data sharing. ODI (Open Data Insitute, 2020b) have made significant progress in
    standardising concepts and processes around Data Trusts through their engagement
    with various stakeholders and UK universities. For example, the UK Biobank (UK
    Biobank, 2014) has collected and maintained data since 2006; stewardship is achieved
    via its status as a charitable company with a board of directors that “act as
    charity trustees under UK charity law and company directors under UK company law”
    (Open Data Insitute, 2020b). Other similar examples provided by ODI revolve around
    data stewardship within the context of a Trust: an independent legal entity requiring
    a careful framework of agreements. For small enterprises in particular the complexity
    of the legal framework required can be daunting, and discourage involvement. Within
    agri-food, many of the efforts in organised data sharing have included only an
    informal Data Trust, often within one organisation or company and focusing around
    one product or chain e.g. multi-IoT based sensor data aggregation as a systems
    approach (Chen et al., 2017, Gunasekaran et al., 2016), with (Elijah et al., 2018)
    providing a comprehensive overview of how modern IoT and data analytics approaches
    can enable smart agriculture towards boosting productivity and sustainability.
    Blockchain technologies have contributed to a number of agri-food data sharing
    systems (Pearson et al., 2019), and have shown potential value when coupled with
    other technologies such as IoTs (Torky and Hassanein, 2020) and machine learning
    (Khan et al., 2020). Machine learning approaches and ontologies have been primarily
    used in the context of agri-food data analytics for precision agriculture (Morota
    et al., 2018, Alhnaity et al., 2019, Chukkapalli et al., 2020, Aydin and Aydin,
    2020). In this diverse technological landscape, privacy preserving approaches
    have started gaining momentum as components of larger pipelines that might also
    include blockchain (Makhdoom et al., 2020) or machine learning (Arachchige et
    al., 2020). The appeal of privacy preserving technologies is clear: they enable
    computation despite the fact that raw data are obscured, hence any data exchange
    occurs with encrypted data. This could be invaluable in overcoming concerns about
    data privacy, competitiveness, and reputational risk. Despite existing and emerging
    technologies, we are still far from converging on an established model of a Data
    Trust — either legally or technologically. Some reasons that might have led to
    this are touched upon in Delacroix and Lawrence (2019), where among others, the
    concept about “one size fits all” in data governance is considered as a hindering
    factor, going on to suggest that a “plurarity of Trusts” could be a way forward.
    Regulatory concerns and how personal data can be protected within a Data Trust
    are essential to their adoption, where Stalla-Bourdillon et al. (2020) identifies
    the necessity of legal and social foundations implementing a ’data protection
    by design’ philosophy into Data Trusts. This is also considered in Delacroix and
    Lawrence (2019), which builds upon the “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry
    in the UK” report published by the UK Government in 2017 (UK Gov, 2017). Another
    direction to Data Trust in agri-food revolves around approaches that increase
    transparency and availability of information as a means to increase trust (Probst,
    2020, Jakku et al., 2019). In particular, the concept around transparency is considered
    in the context of sociotechnical factors and conditions that influence the development
    of smart farming (Jakku et al., 2019), touching upon issues around use of data,
    scepticism about the value of smart technologies and balancing expectations within
    the farming industry. It becomes evident that data sharing quickly becomes a very
    complex problem when considering all factors involved, let alone in the context
    of Data Trusts. Regarding adoption issues and lack of a universally accepted Data
    Trust system, we speculate that the complexity of data collected across sectors,
    interoperability issues, analytics as a knowledge extraction process, and business
    intelligence as a decision making mechanism for improving performance, could mean
    that multiple Data Trusts might need to be proposed to accommodate the specific
    needs found within individual sectors, along the lines discussed in Delacroix
    and Lawrence (2019). As data control processes become more and more complex, Data
    Trust systems could be developed and tailored to a sub-sector level, adopting
    some components and/or implementing new ones. 3. Role of technology A wide variety
    of technological approaches may be useful in overcoming the aforementioned challenges
    to data sharing previously outlined, thus allowing the agri-food sector to best
    take advantage of the opportunities available. Below we mention a number of technologies
    that we believe have potential to address a spectrum of technological and social
    complexities at various stages of the data lifecycle. At the most basic level,
    data interoperability and reuse will require agreement on data formats and reproducible
    data pipelines. A suitable format for incoming data is crucial; while this point
    may seem very straightforward, it really is critical to enable value-adding data
    processing or inference to occur. Machine-readable data that can be accessed by
    a programmatic interface will allow best value: that is, a structured filetype
    (e.g. YAML, JSON, HDF5) with an agreed format will allow smoother updates and
    quicker use of new data than a non-readable or changing format (e.g. a scanned
    pdf or a spreadsheet with a non-agreed format). Semantic web technologies can
    take the description of machine-readable data even further. Data is represented
    in a form of a graph described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
    (Patel-Schneider and Hayes, 2014) and ontology languages such as OWL (W3C OWL
    Working Group, 2012) are used to produce formal models of semantic annotations
    for a specific domain. Applying such annotations to raw data will produce semantic
    metadata that can formally describe the types of individual data elements and
    their relationships to other data represented within the same or any other dataset,
    thus forming a knowledge graph. Data described using standard semantic frameworks
    may be further processed using automated pipelines to infer new knowledge, to
    integrate with other datasets, or to validate for missing information. For example,
    SPARQL query language (Harris and Seaborne, 2013) can be used to query and transform
    data stored in multiple distributed repositories and recently developed standards
    such as SHACL (Kontokostas and Knublauch, 2017) can be used to define data quality
    rules to support management of knowledge graphs. Recently, distributed ledger
    technologies (DLTs) have been gaining traction in agrifood through both commercial
    platforms (e.g. Food Trust from IBM5 ) and proposed research prototypes and pilot
    systems (Caro et al., 2018, Sylvester, 2019, Kamilaris et al., 2019). Key characteristics
    of DLT solutions include the immutability of stored records (i.e., records cannot
    in retrospect be falsified), transparency of data operations, and decentralised
    data access and storage. These characteristics make DLTs a strong candidate for
    applications where data availability is crucial and data is contributed by a range
    of third parties with varying levels of trust (e.g. within a traceability scenario
    where there is risk of retrospective record fraud). However, it is important to
    note that DLTs on their own are not a complete solution to data sharing challenges,
    which is further discussed in Section 4.4. In the presence of ingested and structured
    data, machine learning approaches can be very good candidates to perform analyses
    and extract knowledge. Such analyses have shown much success in agri-food, ranging
    from yield prediction (Alhnaity et al., 2019) to disease detection (Shruthi et
    al., 2019). Federated computing and federated machine learning address one of
    the resulting challenges from the holistic view of data analysis, seeing vast
    adoption in big data to maintain local ownership (Bonawitz et al., 2019). Under
    such federated computing models, standard data analysis methodologies can be undertaken,
    sharing only model updates of the training procedure rather than the raw data
    itself. Additionally, machine learning can assist in the earlier and fundamental
    stage of interoperability. Outlier detection (Domingues et al., 2018) and imputation
    (Liu and Gopalakrishnan, 2017) are a few proven machine learning methodologies
    modelling high-dimensional data input to provide high quality and error free data
    for further analysis. Privacy preserving technologies (PPT) are emerging technologies
    that have gained momentum recently and which have the ability to allow knowledge
    extraction and machine learning without compromising privacy. Various cryptographic
    schemes have been developed that can accommodate the analysis of data even without
    revealing information about the raw data at the individual level. Techniques such
    as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) (Gentry and Halevi, 2011), secure multiparty
    computation (SMPC) (Wang et al., 2017), order preserving encryption (OPE) (Agrawal
    et al., 2004) and differential privacy (Abadi et al., 2016) can be used as part
    of machine learning end-to-end pipelines, albeit carrying a large overhead. While
    many of these techniques are still in their early days of application and so the
    technological barriers could be significant, their potential to contribute to
    data sharing is very high: they provide a way in which any party in the trust
    or federation could share encrypted data and compute functions on aggregated data
    without anyone ever holding enough information to infer any other party’s individual
    data. 4. A call for technologically-mediated data sharing in agri-food We believe
    that the advantages of data sharing across a variety of use cases within agri-food
    justify pursuing Data Trusts for data sharing within the sector, and that technologies
    can help overcome the challenges associated with trust, data formatting and understanding,
    and data privacy. As examples of possible systems, we refer back to our two use-cases.
    Within our traceability use case, we can imagine the use of a number of different
    technologies depending on the regulatory framework and the motivation for tracing.
    Our production optimisation would benefit from a variety of technologies, with
    the focus depending on the preferences of data sharers and the sensitivity of
    the data. In the following sections we expand on the potential of several different
    approaches and technologies, making reference to our use cases throughout. 4.1.
    From data sharing to model sharing? In the context of Data Trusts, the data shared
    typically takes the form of raw or pre-processed data (transformed, aggregated,
    cleansed, etc.), but not models derived from those data. If our goal is not the
    data sharing in itself but instead the use case of production optimisation (Section
    1.3) via collective intelligence to improve productivity, performance, sustainability,
    etc., one wonders whether this can be achieved via means other than data sharing,
    e.g. sharing trained models instead. This process is akin to sharing physical
    models of a system that describes its behaviour and can be used as a data generation
    mechanism (simulation systems, see (APSIM, 2020)). Along these lines machine learning
    approaches and particularly a sub-domain called Deep Learning, have enabled the
    transfer of knowledge between and within domains through the exchange of trained
    models. As Deep Learning approaches are based on Artificial Neural Networks, which
    are high dimensional non-linear models, there has been an abundance of approaches
    concerning transfer learning and domain adaptation that allow the transfer of
    knowledge through sharing learned parameters (Thota et al., 2020, Wilson and Cook,
    2020). In various real-life problems, there exist many high level concepts that
    are consistent across various domains, e.g. shapes, texture, spatial distribution,
    etc. Therefore, extracting representations for such concepts from domain X can
    be very relevant to a cognate domain Y. This line of thinking can be extrapolated
    to our specific use cases, investigating production optimisation via crop yield
    data. In this case, data from Farm X can be used to develop a machine learning-based
    yield forecasting model for Farm X. This high dimensional complex system can be
    used as a surrogate model, which upon fine-tuning it with data from Farm Y (hence
    incorporating knowledge from Farm X as well), Farm Y can gain an advantage over
    Farm X, which has only used its own data (Farm X’s data). At no point in this
    process has Farm Y seen any of the raw data used by Farm X to develop the initial
    model, which was shared with Farm Y. This process is visually depicted in Fig.
    1. In addition, given the non-linearities involved along with extensive hyperparametrisation,
    it becomes a non-trivial problem to reconstruct the exact raw data given that
    the parameters one is sharing (model sharing) are highly sensitive to hyperparametrisation.

    Fig. 1. Visual depiction of the model sharing methodology. Model Y is trained
    with data Y, but its parameters are initialised with those of model X. Black lines
    represent the statistical model, black crosses represent local data. We believe
    model sharing to be another exciting possibility, that when thinking of Data Trusts
    as a more holistic approach, could actually be one direction that organisations
    can take to accommodate knowledge exchange rather than solely focusing on data
    sharing. That aligns with our earlier statement that “one size fits all” approach
    might not be the way forward and that agri-food organisations should be aware
    of the various ways available that can allow for a step-change to occur within
    this industry. Besides going from 0% to 100% (with 0% being no data/Knowledge
    sharing/exchange at all, and 100% being fully open data) is a continuum, in that
    step-wise improvement can take various shapes and make use of the whole spectrum
    of possible adoption levels that can suit the organisational needs. 4.2. Federated
    learning for decentralised analysis Following from model sharing, yet maintaining
    the concept of our production optimisation for actors across the supply chain
    via a holistic view of data, we return to the notion of more traditional and alternative
    view of data analytics from a collection of data. We therefore ponder the idea
    of performing machine learning training to produce one model on a number of independent
    and decentralised datasets simultaneously, without the exchange of raw data. On
    the contrary to model sharing, it is simpler to gain a holistic analysis of data
    when presented with all available data during training, so we ask, can we leverage
    multiple independent, distributed datasets in the training procedure to produce
    one model encapsulating data from multiple sources at scale? This approach, commonly
    known as federated learning, have shown vast success in large scale industry applications,
    trained with highly sensitive data, most notably powering predictive texting in
    our phones (Bonawitz et al., 2019). Conceptually, rather than data being centralised,
    data analysis is performed across all decentralised data stores/ nodes simultaneously
    via aggregation and dissemination of model updates. Such a technological implementation
    fits hand-in-hand with the proposition of decentralised models of Data Trusts,
    providing holistic analysis that leverages data across sources whilst maintaining
    privacy and eliminating raw data sharing. The previous example of production optimisation
    via crop yield forecast (Fig. 1) can be also be applied to here, where Farm X
    and Farm Y each have their own data, we follow the regime presented in Yang et
    al. (2019) and represented in Fig. 2. To train the model, a central node which
    we will call C, controls the communication and computes the model updates. For
    each step in the training procedure, C will send a copy of the model parameters
    to each of the Farm nodes X and Y, each farm node will then perform a forward
    step on the model (each node has identical models) and the resulting variables
    are sent to back to C. The C node will aggregate these variables and compute a
    set of updates based on the data from X and Y, the updates are sent back to each
    node X and Y to update each model. This entire procedure eliminates raw data sharing,
    and allows a single model to be developed leveraging data from all participating
    datastores. Privacy has been at the forefront of the design and implementation
    of federated learning, differential privacy and encryption has played a key role
    in securing individual’s data (Lim et al., 2020), the former of which is elaborated
    on in Section 4.3. Additionally, the introduction of blockchain technologies have
    allowed for improved accountability reducing the effectiveness of malicious attacks
    (Desai et al., 2020). Furthermore, scalability is a driving factor, where continuous
    and low compute updates to the model are trivial, essential in sectors that record
    frequently. Consequently, this opens the possibility of Internet of Things (IoT)
    devices (the collection, processing and analysis of data from interconnected devices
    within a system, for the provision of smart solutions in the argi-food supply
    chain (Kamilaris et al., 2016)) being integrated into the federated network seamlessly.

    Fig. 2. Depiction of centralised federated learning in which no access or sharing
    of data between nodes is undertaken. The temporal process moves left to right
    (a–d). Black lines represent the statistical model, and black crosses the local
    data on each node (Wikimedia Commons and Jeromemetronome, 2019). Federated learning
    and federated computing in general could power the data analytics behind decentralised
    Data Trusts, operating across all participating organisations and even on IoT
    devices directly, potentially reducing management impacts on actors (Brewster
    et al., 2017). The scalability and adaptability of federated models lends itself
    to the advancements in technology, not only providing solutions to data sharing
    issues that have arisen now, but providing a proven platform for expansion as
    the adoption of data acquisition increases and subsequent technological challenges
    arise. Additionally, leading from the belief that the “one size fits all” approach
    may not be the ideal solution, federated learning can be implemented into the
    argi-food supply chain one step and one model at a time, expanding to new organisational
    challenges as trust in the Data Trust develops. 4.3. Privacy preserving technologies
    Regardless of which technologies help achieve traceability and transparency, or
    improve product optimisation, all beneficiaries gain from increased privacy to
    help develop trust within data sharing. Simply ensuring that data privacy is maintained
    addresses the most apparent social implication of commercial sensitivity (Open
    Data Insitute, 2019), both between actors within a data sharing environment, but
    also from malicious actors outside. Previous technologies in Sections 4.1 From
    data sharing to model sharing?, 4.2 Federated learning for decentralised analysis
    can be seen as privacy preserving technologies (PPT), following a more implicit
    approach decoupling data analysis from traditional data centralisation. Yet it
    is common for more explicit methodologies to preserve privacy to be blended alongside.
    Differential privacy operates under the notion that the addition of noise to a
    statistical model of data inhibits an adversary to exactly reverse-engineer sensitive
    data of an individual (Dwork et al., 2014, Abadi et al., 2016). This concept has
    seen a recent re-emergence in deep learning (Arachchige et al., 2019), while it
    has been commonplace and the forefront of development of federated learning algorithms
    (Choudhury et al., 2019, Wei et al., 2020), where the process defining federated
    learning lends itself to the implementation of differential privacy (Geyer et
    al., 2017). As such, the implementation of differential privacy is not only achievable
    but practical in terms of computational overhead, yet the benefits to ensuring
    trust in knowledge sharing can be significant. Extending the concept of privacy
    preserving statistical data analysis to the most complete case, Fully Homomorphic
    Encryption (FHE) aims to extract knowledge through statistical models like the
    former, yet doing so on fully encrypted data without decryption the data first.
    This maintains privacy throughout the entire process of knowledge extraction,
    data to result. Successful implementations have shown the potential applicability
    of FHE in industrial settings (Masters et al., 2019), with a recent toolkit by
    IBM providing a platform for development.6 However, FHE for complex tasks comes
    with large computational overhead, and subsequent loss of performance due to the
    necessity of approximation (Domingo-Ferrer et al., 2019), reducing the attractiveness
    of an approach in its current state. Although the applicability of FHE is non-trivial
    and still a major research topic, the fundamental principle is very attractive
    for our propositions, all whilst being easily explainable, assisting in knowledge
    dissemination and understanding, therefore eliciting trust between actors within
    a data sharing model. PPT are not only essential in building trust for data sharing,
    but also a necessary precaution in a modern world of data sensitivity and regulatory
    obligations. As such, we believe that PPT lies at the heart of all data sharing,
    where privacy can be maintained between individuals data whilst holistic and novel
    knowledge extraction can be achieved assisting in our ongoing challenges related
    to traceability and product optimisation. 4.4. Leveraging semantic technologies
    and blockchain to facilitate centralised and federated data sharing Whether it
    is raw data or data models that are to be shared, a suitable underlining data
    sharing infrastructure must exist. Following from our earlier discussions such
    infrastructure should support automation based on machine-readable data formats,
    and secure and trusted data assessment mechanisms. Blockchain networks (a type
    of DLT) can be formed to hold data about arbitrary domains (Zheng et al., 2018).
    For example, a single transaction recorded on a blockchain can describe an exchange
    of money between two parties trading an item, but it can also record results of
    sensor readings such as location of an animal. Blockchain networks have gained
    popularity for their ability to deliver immutability of shared data, transparency
    of data transactions, and high data availability due to data duplication across
    multiple nodes. Certain blockchains such as Ethereum7 and Hyperledger8 also allow
    for deployment of decentralised applications (DApps) where data input and retrieval
    is managed via so called smart contracts (Nærland et al., 2017), which is an implementation
    of an idea originally proposed by Nick Szabo in 1997.9 Smart contracts are programs
    that can execute on the blockchain network and define, for example, the structure
    of transactions that participating entities can complete on the network (e.g.
    to record purchase and sale of assets as they are moving through a supply chain).
    Business blockchain networks also provide functionalities for permissioned data
    access where actors can be restricted from accessing different parts of the blockchain
    functionalities and the data it stores. Given our traceability use case scenario,
    blockchain technologies possess an obvious advantage over the existing systems.
    For example, in case of an outbreak of a food borne disease such as that caused
    by E. coli, the real-time availability of data across the whole supply chain is
    important in order to identify potentially contaminated products and issue recalls.
    Transparent records of transactions between different food supply actors and the
    immutability of records may be also useful for regulators in aiding discovery
    of potential cases of food fraud. However, several challenges relating to the
    use of blockchain have been highlighted to date, including scalability and negative
    environmental impact due to high carbon footprint (Pearson et al., 2019, Zheng
    et al., 2018, Karame, 2016, Stoll et al., 2019). In addition, the blockchains
    technologies typically operate with only simple data types such as string, integer,
    date, etc. As such, it may be difficult to integrate data represented by different
    blockchain data models without further knowledge that is not captured in a machine-understandable
    form, hence hindering an effective automation of such processes. Given such limitations,
    it is therefore unfeasible to expect that, for example, a very complex description
    of a product and the full context in which such product was produced, transported,
    or stored would be stored on a blockchain. This may prevent traceability systems
    from realising their full potential by aiding investigations, for example, through
    discovery of common factors (e.g. use of river water) in processing workflows
    of the entities affected by an outbreak. Similar challenges will apply in case
    of model sharing and federated learning discussed in previous sections. The shared
    models and data may be too large to be shared via blockchain networks as well
    as additional metadata descriptions (e.g., model limitations, biases, algorithms
    used, etc.) which are required for effective reuse. However, such information
    may still exist within company records, possibly in a proprietary format and requiring
    a human expert to be retrieved. On the other hand, semantic web technologies that
    exist today stemmed from the idea of the Semantic Web which envisioned a globally
    interconnected web of data where much of the meaning is machine-readable (Berners-Lee
    and Fischetti, 2001). This resulted in creation of data sharing protocols for
    RDF graphs, distributed graph repositories, and standards for federated data querying
    (Pan et al., 2017), paving a way towards generic data sharing infrastructures
    based on web technologies. Such technology could then support the traceability
    scenario in both directions: as a centralised repository where all data is stored
    within a single knowledge graph; and also as a collection of distributed repositories,
    each under the control of individual data owners and publishing only a portion
    of a knowledge graph. Many semantic resources such as vocabularies, ontologies,
    and taxonomies already exist for different parts of the agri-food sector (Drury
    et al., 2019, Dooley et al., 2018, Markovic et al., 2020, Markovic et al., 2016).
    However, these are currently mostly used by the research community while the industry
    actors are influenced by, for example, GS1 family of standards.10 While data sharing
    systems based on distributed semantic repositories and federated queries for traceability
    in food supply chains have been proposed in the past (Solanki and Brewster, 2013),
    such approaches, on their own, do not address challenges related to trust, transparent
    data access, and performance including data availability from remote repositories.
    We believe that Data Trust solutions for agri-food sector may benefit from both
    blockchain and semantic technologies. In fact, as we outlined in this sub-section,
    a certain level of symbiosis between these technologies will be required to deliver
    effective data sharing mechanisms in the agri-food domain. Immutability of blockchain
    records may support trust in data sharing mechanisms while semantic web technologies
    are used to describe the data in machine-understandable form. In order to reduce
    the amount of data stored on blockchain networks to address scaleability challenges,
    semantically annotated raw data may be automatically abstracted to form more concise
    reports (Markovic et al., 2020, Markovic and Edwards, 2016), or the data may include
    only digital signatures required to validate less critical data stored as external
    resources (e.g., large RDF datasets accessed from distributed repositories) (Dai
    et al., 2018). For example, a traceability system may store the most critical
    information regarding the product on a blockchain to enable basic traceability
    functionality and also provide information to discover and validate more elaborate
    description of a production context stored in a third party semantic repository.
    Blockchains could also store information relating to data access for external
    semantic repositories and thus increasing transparency of data sharing in agri-food
    domain. 5. Conclusion Given the central importance of food systems to global heath,
    economy, and culture, it is no surprise that vast quantities of data are meticulously
    collected and collated by a wide variety of actors within these systems. While
    the volume of data collection within food systems is extensive, data sharing and
    integration has lagged behind, limiting the added-value that could be made available.
    Both social and technological challenges have contributed to this lag, and we
    have discussed the potential for technological approaches to overcome these obstacles.
    In addition, given the inherent structure of food supply chains with multiple
    actors present, then the various challenges mean that it is unlikely that physical
    data will ever be conveniently co-located and that whatever the overarching legal
    structure, one would still need technologies to address sharing and interoperability
    considerations. While the potential is clear, much work remains to be done to
    allow the agri-food sector to unlock the value of its collective data. This work
    will include further investigations into the drivers of data sharing and the key
    benefits within particular systems, as well as engineering work in building systems
    that trial data sharing via appropriate technologies. The most exciting future
    work may combine these two strands of research and involve both study of the actors
    in these systems and the regulatory frameworks in which they operate, alongside
    implemented prototypes of systems allowing these actors to understand the benefits
    of data sharing and contribute to design that fits their needs and priorities.
    As argued in this article, data sharing is a complex technical and social challenge
    and each of the technologies discussed in this article has a potential to contribute
    towards solving only part of this challenge. Therefore, it is very likely that
    any future data sharing solutions will utilise a combination of multiple technologies
    resulting in complex socio-technical systems requiring interdisciplinary expertise
    from various disciplines including computer science, social sciences, and business.

    \ of things\n1. Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic shifted the general public’s\
    \ attention to digital solutions\nand brought immense demand to the telecommunications\
    \ market. The convergence of 5G\ntechnology and the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]\
    \ is the next natural step for two advanced\ntechnologies developed to make the\
    \ lives of their users more accessible, more comfortable,\nand more productive\
    \ [2]. One of the most standard technologies to be brought into the\nmainstream\
    \ area is 5G, which will allow for new business opportunities by being comple-\n\
    mented with Industry 4.0, IoT devices, and Smart Cities and improve overall connectivity\n\
    around the globe [3]. The Internet of Things is an ecosystem of increasing complexity:\
    \ a\nuniverse of connected things capable of capturing critical data and carrying\
    \ out advanced\nanalysis using cloud-based functionalities to extract valuable\
    \ information. This technology\nposes a great opportunity for a multitude of actors\
    \ in all sectors of activity [4]. Many\ncompanies are organizing to focus on IoT\
    \ and connectivity when developing their products\nand services of the future.\n\
    Deployment costs, range, interference, and capabilities of Internet of Things\
    \ devices\nare all factors in identifying the right primary or complementary connectivity\
    \ option for\nan IoT deployment. Wi-Fi 6 or Zigbee is adequate for some elements\
    \ of smart building\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23083876\n\

    \ but useless for highly mobile wide-area use [5]. Additionally, endpoints such\
    \ as\nBluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, or Wi-Fi can be signiﬁcantly more cost effective\
    \ in scenarios where\n5G may be available but has not yet reached a signiﬁcant\
    \ market scale to do competitive\nendpoints or network services [6]. Technical\
    \ studies [7] show that 5G and other services can\ncoexist in speciﬁc frequency\
    \ bands. The technical conditions must be adequately adapted\nand not excessively\
    \ restrictive; otherwise, there is a risk of affecting the costs, coverage,\n\
    and quality of operation of 5G services.\nThere is great interest in the new applications\
    \ of mobile technology merging 5G and\nthe Internet of Things technologies. In\
    \ the design of new applications or technological\naccessories using 5G and the\
    \ Internet of Things, compliance with the permitted exposure\nlimits are contemplated.\
    \ International exposure guidelines have been developed due to\nextensive research\
    \ carried out over many decades. All the analyses carried out by indepen-\ndent\
    \ public health authorities, expert groups, and the World Health Organization\
    \ (WHO)\nagree that these guidelines guarantee protection for all people against\
    \ any health danger [8].\nAs with all technological generations, 5G dramatically\
    \ improves energy efﬁciency depart-\nment and speed rates. However, this technology\
    \ has recently been in the public eye for its\nimplementation challenges.\nIoT\
    \ technologies are now being widely used in the consumer-grade market, primarily\n\
    targeted toward home automation and security. This rise in consumer adoption has\
    \ led to\nproposals to incorporate IoT devices to bring these types of improvements\
    \ to a metropolitan\nscale [9]. These improvements are speculated to improve security\
    \ and automation tasks\nand tackle long-lasting difﬁculties such as trafﬁc control,\
    \ waste management, and so on.\nHowever, IoT does not depend solely on the electronics\
    \ being deployed and installed;\nthey rely on efﬁcient and resilient transmission\
    \ technology being used. The convergence\nof networks and services is an essential\
    \ aspect of the modern internet. The internet has\nevolved from a simple means\
    \ of communication to a complex and multifaceted ecosystem\nthat is integrated\
    \ into nearly every aspect of our daily lives. The advent of 5G technology\nhas\
    \ further pushed the convergence of networks and services, providing users with\
    \ faster\nand more reliable internet connections, enabling a range of new and\
    \ innovative applications\nand services [10].\nOne of the most signiﬁcant ways\
    \ that the convergence of networks and services\nimpacts internet services is\
    \ by increasing the availability and speed of access to the internet.\n5G technology\
    \ offers faster speeds and greater bandwidth, allowing users to access high-\n\
    quality video, audio, and other media content in real-time [11]. This means that\
    \ internet\nservice providers can offer a range of new services and applications\
    \ that were previously\nimpossible, such as virtual and augmented reality experiences\
    \ and immersive gaming.\nCellular connectivity will enable key IoT goals to be\
    \ achieved, in particular, reduced\ndevice complexity and cost and increased coverage\
    \ to support challenging and remote\napplications, deployment ﬂexibility, high\
    \ capacity, and long battery life. 3GPP wireless\ntechnologies offer compelling\
    \ technology advantages that will continue to increase the\ncapacity of Long Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) infrastructure to address the vast IoT market in\nthe long term,\
    \ and 5G will add to the IoT landscape soon. In Releases 14, 15, and beyond\n\
    of the 3GPP (Third-Generation Partnership Project), the standards solve all commercial\n\
    bottlenecks to facilitate the vision of 5G and the huge IoT Market [12]. This\
    \ can lead\nto the explosion of billions of devices and sensors that show digital\
    \ representations of\nour real world powered by low-cost devices, long battery\
    \ life, ubiquitous coverage, and\ninnovative business applications. 5G promises\
    \ that it will be possible to achieve critical\nIoT applications, which require\
    \ real-time dynamic process control and automation in\nvarious ﬁelds, such as\
    \ vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), high-speed\nmotion,\
    \ and trafﬁc control. Critical parameters to enable the required performance are\n\
    sub-millisecond network latency and ultra-high reliability. Both are intrinsic\
    \ components of\nthe 3GPP work to deﬁne the new radio interface for 5G [13]. The\
    \ 5G network architecture\nis being designed to address both IoT scenarios.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n3 of 41\nThe success of the IoT services on 5G networks\
    \ depends on the ability of these networks\nto manage interference effectively.\
    \ Interference can occur when different IoT devices operate\nin the same area,\
    \ and their signals overlap, causing lower throughput, higher latency, and\ndecreased\
    \ reliability [14]. This is a signiﬁcant challenge for 5G networks and IoT services,\
    \ as\nthey are designed to support a vast number of devices and applications,\
    \ each with unique\nconnectivity and latency requirements.\nFigure 1 shows the\
    \ comparison between 5G and IoT, which is a topic of interest\nin the technology\
    \ world. To implement 5G, there are speciﬁc requirements, including\ninfrastructure\
    \ and specialized hardware, while the evolution of wireless networks has led to\n\
    faster and more reliable data transfer rates. The evolution of IoT has enabled\
    \ the creation of\nlow-power, low-cost devices that can be connected to the internet.\
    \ Wireless communication\ntechnologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LoRa\
    \ are suitable for different types of\nIoT applications, and cloud-based solutions\
    \ are used to store and process vast amounts\nof data generated by IoT devices.\
    \ 5G applications include autonomous vehicles, remote\nsurgery, and virtual and\
    \ augmented reality, and these require high bandwidth, low latency,\nand reliable\
    \ connectivity. However, there are challenges associated with 5G networks,\nsuch\
    \ as interference and network optimization difﬁculties. The coexistence of 5G\
    \ networks\nand IoT applications is a concern, and optimization challenges in\
    \ 5G networks need to be\naddressed to enable efﬁcient and effective implementation.\n\
    Figure 1. Summary of conceptual schemes that addresses the present work.\nMotivation\n\
    The motivation of this work is to compile the impact of interference on the leading\
    \ 5G\ntechnologies that will inﬂuence the communications of IoT devices.\nIoT\
    \ services are used in various industries, including healthcare, manufacturing,\n\
    and transportation, where reliable and efﬁcient connectivity is essential for\
    \ the proper\nfunctioning of IoT devices and the smooth operation of business\
    \ processes. If interference\nand network performance issues are not addressed,\
    \ businesses may experience reduced\nproductivity, increased downtime, and decreased\
    \ customer satisfaction. Consequently,\naddressing the interference and optimization\
    \ of 5G networks in IoT services is essential to\nensure reliable and efﬁcient\
    \ connectivity for IoT devices and allow businesses to take full\nadvantage of\
    \ the beneﬁts of 5G networks and IoT services. For this reason, the motivation\n\
    of this work is to review the state of the art of the work to address the interference\
    \ and\noptimization of 5G technologies in IoT services.\nInterference and optimization\

    \ management techniques and\noptimizing network performance, businesses can take\
    \ full advantage of the beneﬁts of 5G\nnetworks and IoT services.\nThe main contribution\
    \ of this review is to present the idea that the convergence\nof 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services represents a technological revolution that promises to\nchange\
    \ how we interact with the world around us. However, this union has its challenges,\n\
    and only by overcoming them can we unlock the full potential of these groundbreaking\n\
    technologies. By bridging the gap between 5G and IoT, we pave the way for a new\
    \ era\nof innovation: every device is connected, and every experience is seamless.\
    \ This work\ndescribes the main challenges between 5G networks and IoT services\
    \ and highlights the\nneed for seamless integration of these technologies to achieve\
    \ their full potential. This\npaper reinforces the idea that IoT technologies\
    \ power 5G services, and their compatibility\nis crucial for offering high-speed\
    \ and low-latency services to consumers. Furthermore, it\nunderscores that interference\
    \ is one of the biggest problems facing manufacturers, and they\nmust consider\
    \ it to offer compatible and reliable services. Ultimately, this article guides\n\
    the industry to ensure that 5G and IoT technologies work together seamlessly,\
    \ opening up\nendless possibilities for innovation and progress.\nFigure 2 describes\
    \ how the IoT and 5G technology can work together to enable a range\nof applications\
    \ in different ﬁelds. In the ﬁrst application, smart cities, IoT devices can\n\
    be used to collect real-time data on trafﬁc patterns, air quality, and energy\
    \ usage. These\ndata can be used to optimize city operations and improve quality\
    \ of life. 5G networks\ncan support these applications by providing the necessary\
    \ bandwidth and low latency.\nIn industrial automation, IoT devices can be used\
    \ to monitor and control manufacturing\nprocesses and equipment in real time.\
    \ This can help to improve efﬁciency and reduce\ndowntime. 5G networks can provide\
    \ the necessary bandwidth, reliability, and low latency\nto support these applications.\
    \ In healthcare, IoT devices can be used for remote patient\nmonitoring and real-time\
    \ communication between healthcare providers. This can help\nto improve patient\
    \ outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. 5G networks can provide\nthe necessary\
    \ bandwidth, low latency, and reliability to support these applications. In\n\
    transportation, IoT devices can provide real-time data on trafﬁc patterns and\
    \ vehicle\nperformance, which can be used to optimize trafﬁc ﬂow and improve safety.\
    \ 5G networks\ncan support these applications by providing the necessary bandwidth,\
    \ low latency, and\nreliability. In agriculture, IoT devices can be used to monitor\
    \ crops and livestock in real-time,\nwhich can help to optimize production and\
    \ reduce waste. 5G networks can support these\napplications by providing the necessary\
    \ bandwidth, reliability, and low latency. In retail,\nIoT devices can be used\
    \ to collect real-time data on customer behavior and inventory levels,\nwhich\
    \ can be used to optimize store operations and improve the customer experience.\
    \ 5G\nnetworks can provide the necessary bandwidth, reliability, and low latency\
    \ to support\nthese applications. Overall, the text shows how IoT and 5G technology\
    \ can work together\nto enable a range of applications in different ﬁelds. By\

    \ Work\nThe radio signal characteristics of new wireless applications are similar\
    \ to those of\nexisting mobile technologies [5]. This is where the interest of\
    \ this work lies in considering in\ndetail the impact and types of interference\
    \ of 5G technologies that coexist with IoT devices.\nThe new applications use\
    \ similar transmit powers and operate in the same frequency ranges.\nTo mitigate\
    \ interference, we can synchronize or coordinate all networks or implement\nlarge\
    \ guard bands that waste valuable spectrum [15]. In practice, close cooperation\
    \ is\nrequired between all operators in each frequency band, and not all usage\
    \ modes and\nall types of 5G deployments can likely be supported simultaneously.\
    \ Regulators need\nto consider these technical issues and their implications when\
    \ deciding how to arrange\nfrequencies in these bands.\nVarious interference management\
    \ techniques, such as power control, channel allo-\ncation, and beamforming, can\
    \ be implemented to ensure that IoT devices on the same\nnetwork do not interfere\
    \ with each other. However, these techniques can be complicated\nand may require\
    \ signiﬁcant changes to the network infrastructure [16]. Additionally, new\ninterference\
    \ management techniques may be required as IoT devices continue to evolve\nand\
    \ become more sophisticated.\nAnother signiﬁcant challenge in managing interference\
    \ in 5G networks is the diversity\nof devices and applications that use these\
    \ networks. IoT services can be used in various\nindustries, including healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, and transportation, each with unique\nconnectivity and latency\
    \ requirements [17]. For instance, in healthcare, IoT devices, such as\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n6 of 41\nwearable monitors and remote patient monitoring systems,\
    \ require low latency and reliable\nconnectivity to provide accurate data and\
    \ alerts. In contrast, IoT devices used in industrial\nautomation require high\
    \ bandwidth and low latency to operate effectively [18]. Therefore,\nmanaging\
    \ interference in 5G networks requires a comprehensive approach that considers\n\
    the diverse connectivity and latency requirements of different IoT devices and\
    \ applications.\nAnother important challenge is the potential for external interference;\
    \ while interfer-\nence management techniques can ensure that IoT devices on the\
    \ same network do not\ninterfere with each other, external interference can occur\
    \ when IoT devices operate in areas\nwith other wireless devices, such as Wi-Fi\
    \ routers, Bluetooth devices, and other cellular\nnetworks. This can lead to signal\
    \ degradation, reduced throughput, and decreased reliabil-\nity of the network\
    \ [19]. As a result, it is essential to consider external interference when\n\
    designing and implementing 5G networks for IoT services, and to use techniques\
    \ such as\nfrequency coordination and spectrum sharing to manage external interference\
    \ effectively.\nTo provide better insights for the 5G interference topic, we follow\
    \ the structure detailed\nin Figure 3.\nFigure 3. 5G and IoT technologies’ impact\
    \ scheme.\nThe impact of 5G network interference on IoT services is an active\
    \ research area. Sev-\neral studies have investigated the effects of interference\
    \ on the performance of IoT devices\nand applications. One recent study by Chandra\
    \ et al. analyzed the impact of interference\non the reliability of 5G networks\
    \ for IoT services [20]. The study found that interference\ncan signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ the reliability of 5G networks for IoT services, especially in dense\ndeployments\
    \ where multiple devices operate in the same area. The study recommended\nusing\
    \ advanced interference management techniques such as dynamic channel allocation\n\
    and power control to mitigate interference effects and improve network reliability.\n\
    Another recent study by Azari et al. [21] investigated the impact of interference\
    \ on\nthe performance of 5G networks for IoT applications. The study found that\
    \ interference\ncan cause signiﬁcant degradation of network performance, especially\
    \ for applications\nthat require low latency and high bandwidth. The study recommended\
    \ using adaptive\nbeamforming and dynamic channel allocation to reduce interference\
    \ and improve the\nperformance of 5G networks for IoT applications. Additionally,\
    \ the study highlighted\nthe need for more research into interference management\
    \ techniques that can effectively\nmitigate the impact of interference on 5G networks\
    \ for IoT services.\nSeveral research studies have also investigated the impact\
    \ of interference on the\nenergy consumption of IoT devices connected to 5G networks.\
    \ One recent study by\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n7 of 41\nAl-Turjman et al. [22]\
    \ found that interference can cause IoT devices to consume more energy\nto maintain\
    \ connectivity, leading to reduced battery life and increased maintenance costs.\n\
    The study recommended the use of interference management techniques, such as energy-\n\
    efﬁcient channel allocation and scheduling to reduce interference and improve\
    \ the energy\nefﬁciency of IoT devices on 5G networks. The study concluded that\
    \ effective interference\nmanagement techniques are crucial for ensuring the sustainability\
    \ and economic viability\nof IoT services on 5G networks.\nAnother critical area\
    \ of research related to 5G network interference in IoT services is\nthe security\
    \ and privacy implications of interference management techniques. Interference\n\
    management techniques, such as beamforming and channel allocation, require the\
    \ ex-\nchange of information between IoT devices and the network, which can potentially\
    \ expose\nsensitive information to eavesdroppers and attackers. A recent study\
    \ by Hasan et al. [23]\ninvestigated the security and privacy risks associated\
    \ with beamforming and proposed a\nsecure beamforming scheme that uses encryption\
    \ and authentication to protect sensitive\ninformation. The study concluded that\
    \ the security and privacy implications of interference\nmanagement techniques\
    \ must be carefully considered when designing 5G networks for\nIoT services. Effective\
    \ security and privacy measures can help mitigate the risks associated\nwith interference\
    \ management techniques and ensure the integrity and conﬁdentiality of\nIoT data\
    \ on 5G networks.\nOverall, the current state of the art and related work on the\
    \ impact of 5G network\ninterference on IoT services highlight the importance\
    \ of effective interference management\ntechniques to ensure the reliability and\
    \ performance of 5G networks for IoT applications.\nThe studies recommend the\
    \ use of advanced interference management techniques, such as\ndynamic channel\
    \ allocation, power control, adaptive beamforming, and spectrum sharing,\nto mitigate\
    \ the effects of interference and improve network performance. However, more\n\
    research is needed to develop new and more effective interference management techniques\n\
    that can address the unique challenges of 5G networks and IoT services.\nTable\

    \ operate: This metric indicates whether the IoT service can operate\nwith multiple\
    \ devices. This is an important factor to consider since many IoT services\ninvolve\
    \ the connection of multiple devices, and the network needs to support the\nsimultaneous\
    \ communication of these devices.\n4.\nLatency: This parameter measures the amount\
    \ of delay or lag time in transmitting data\nbetween the IoT devices and the network.\
    \ Latency is an important metric to consider\nfor real-time IoT services, such\
    \ as connected vehicles and healthcare monitoring. The\nvalues in this column\
    \ range from low to ultra-low.\n5.\nInterference management techniques: This parameter\
    \ lists the various techniques that\ncan be used to manage interference in the\
    \ network. Interference management is crucial\nto maintain high performance in\
    \ the presence of other devices and networks that\nmay use the same frequency\
    \ bands. The techniques listed in this column include dy-\nnamic frequency selection,\
    \ channel hopping, beamforming, coordinated multi-point\ntransmission, dynamic\
    \ power control, interference avoidance, MIMO (multiple-input,\nmultiple-output)\
    \ [24], cognitive radio, massive MIMO, and interference alignment.\n6.\nEnergy\
    \ consumption: This metric indicates the amount of energy consumed by the\nIoT\
    \ devices and the network. Energy consumption is an important consideration for\n\
    IoT services, especially for those that operate in remote locations or rely on\
    \ battery-\npowered devices. The values in this column range from low to high.\n\

    Medium\n3. Materials and Methods\n4G networks are based on LTE technology, which\
    \ uses a frequency spectrum of around\n700 MHz to 2600 MHz. These frequencies\
    \ are divided into different bands that are used for\ndifferent purposes, such\
    \ as voice and data communication. 4G networks use a combination\nof Frequency\
    \ Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) techniques to\ntransmit\
    \ and receive data. FDD uses separate frequencies for transmitting and receiving\n\
    data, while TDD uses the same frequency for both.\nOn the other hand, IoT devices\
    \ use a variety of technologies and protocols to com-\nmunicate with each other\
    \ and with the internet. These devices can operate on different\nfrequency bands,\
    \ such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and sub-GHz bands. Some IoT devices use the\nunlicensed\
    \ spectrum, which means they can operate on any frequency without needing a\n\
    license, while others use the licensed spectrum, which requires a license from\
    \ the relevant\nregulatory body.\nOne of the main issues with 4G services and\
    \ networks is that they can cause inter-\nference with IoT devices, especially\
    \ those operating on the same frequency bands. This\ninterference can cause communication\
    \ problems and even lead to data loss or corruption.\nTo mitigate this interference,\
    \ different methods can be used, such as frequency hopping,\nspread-spectrum techniques,\
    \ and power control.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n9 of 41\nFigure 4 summarizes this\
    \ section, where the main concepts related to the impact of\n5G networks on IoT\
    \ services are observed. We analyze the implementation, the evolution,\nand the\
    \ types of wireless technologies that inﬂuence current services, the leading 5G\n\
    technologies and problems, and the coexistence of next-generation networks. We\
    \ frame\ninterference as the heart of the study of problems in this type of network.\n\
    Figure 4. Materials and Methods for 5G and IoT services.\n3.1. 5G Implementation\
    \ Requirements\n5G is an emerging technology in the telecommunications area. Enabling\
    \ high-speed\nconnections, offering lower latencies, and ensuring highly scalable\
    \ connectivity between mul-\ntiple devices [34], every industry worldwide eagerly\
    \ waits for mainstream implementation.\n5G allows for several technologies related\
    \ to massive machine-to-machine communi-\ncations, or IoT, to improve and offer\
    \ high-speed connectivity between devices, primarily\nallowing automation in the\
    \ manufacturing and construction industries. However, IoT has\nseen massive consumer\
    \ implementation in homes, malls, and parks, which means this\ntechnology has\
    \ several use cases for ordinary daily consumers.\nOn the technical side of 5G,\
    \ it works on a higher spectrum range when compared to\ntraditional wireless technologies.\
    \ Ranging from 24 to 100 GHz, it provides low-latency\ncommunication and high\
    \ throughput rates but suffers from adverse conditions caused\nby its high-frequency\
    \ nature [35]. 5G also operates on two frequency bands: Sub 6 GHz\nand mmWave\
    \ (millimeter wave). While mmWave offers faster data transfer rates, it has\n\
    limited coverage and is easily obstructed. On the other hand, the Sub 6 GHz band,\
    \ which\nincludes frequencies below 6 GHz, offers wider coverage and can penetrate\
    \ obstacles such\nas buildings and walls [36]. This means that 5G can actually\
    \ work in the Sub 6 GHz band,\nproviding a more reliable and accessible network\
    \ for users. This is particularly important\nfor rural and suburban areas where\
    \ building penetration is critical, and for indoor usage\nwhere higher frequency\
    \ bands may not be able to reach. Therefore, despite the hype around\nmmWave,\
    \ the Sub 6 GHz band remains a vital part of the 5G network, providing a strong\n\
    foundation for the future of wireless technology.\nTo counteract the limitations,\
    \ 5G has been complemented with new technologies. The\nmost common ones are beamforming,\
    \ massive MIMO, small cell, mmWave, and network\nslicing, and new proposals arise\
    \ everyday to try and get the most out of this generation.\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 3876\n10 of 41\nEven though 5G is far from being implemented worldwide, several\
    \ service providers\nhave been publicly working and sharing their advances related\
    \ to this technology. Some\nfamous names from the IT world are Ericsson, Verizon,\
    \ Nokia, AT&T, T-Mobile, Samsung,\nand Qualcomm. However, undoubtedly, most big\
    \ telecommunications companies are\nworking on projects related to the new generation\
    \ of wireless technologies.\nResearch groups have been focused on the 5G mobile\
    \ network ecosystem, with institu-\ntions such as METIS (Mobile and wireless communications\
    \ Enablers for Twenty-twenty\n(2020) Information Society), 5G PPP (5G Infrastructure\
    \ Public Private Partnership), and\nNYU New York University Wireless, conducting\
    \ impactful research related to MIMO\ntransmissions, millimeter waves, and frameworks\
    \ in the 5G ecosystem [37].\n5G networks offer several features that are essential\
    \ for the Internet of Things (IoT)\nservices, as Figure 5 shows. 5G provides increased\
    \ bandwidth and lower latency, allowing\nIoT devices to transmit data quickly\
    \ and efﬁciently for real-time communication and\nresponse. 5G enables massive\
    \ machine-type communication (mMTC), which allows a\nlarge number of IoT devices\
    \ to connect to the network simultaneously. Ultra-reliable and\nlow-latency communication\
    \ (URLLC) is also provided, ensuring quick and reliable data\ntransmission suitable\
    \ for mission-critical IoT services. Network slicing is another feature of\n5G\
    \ networks, which creates dedicated virtual networks for IoT devices to provide\
    \ better\nnetwork performance and security.\nFigure 5. 5G features that are essential\
    \ for the Internet of Things services.\nBefore the implementation of 5G networks,\
    \ organizations such as IEEE needed to\ncope with challenges about the implementation\
    \ of 5G. One of these challenges is about the\ndata rate key dimensions, since\
    \ the demand of technology services are increasing in the\npast years. 5G should\
    \ be a solution in order to satisfy all this demand and provide a great\nQuality\
    \ of Service (QoS) [38].\nAnother factor to consider is the latency, which is\
    \ responsible for the delay in incoming\nand outgoing packages on a link, as streaming\
    \ services such as online games [39], metaverse,\nand more demand a low latency\
    \ in order to provide better services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n11 of 41\nIn modern\
    \ society, most products use electrical power, including, for example, electric\n\
    cars such as Tesla. In other words, we are surrounded by electronic devices, and\
    \ it is\nessential to focus on developing friendly devices to avoid consuming\
    \ too much electricity.\nSome important points about 5G energy consumption need\
    \ to be mentioned. First, energy\nefﬁciency depends on the trafﬁc in the network.\
    \ According to the article “Energy-efﬁcient\n5G for a greener future” [40], when\
    \ the trafﬁc load is low, a base station can save 98.75% of\npower, but if the\
    \ trafﬁc load is high, the power consumption may increase.\nFigure 6 describes\
    \ the requirements for 5G. This generation is the latest generation\nof cellular\
    \ networks that is designed to offer signiﬁcant improvements in performance,\n\
    capacity, and ﬂexibility compared to previous generations. To achieve these improvements,\n\
    5G networks utilize several key technologies. One of these technologies is millimeter\n\
    wave (mmWave) frequencies, which are higher frequency bands that can provide higher\n\
    bandwidth and faster data rates. However, these frequencies have short wavelengths\n\
    and require line-of-sight communication between the transmitter and receiver.\
    \ Another\ntechnology used in 5G networks is massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple\
    \ output)\ntechnology, which uses a large number of antennas to increase the number\
    \ of spatial\nstreams and improve the efﬁciency of the wireless channel. This\
    \ can help to increase the\ndata transfer rates and overall network capacity.\
    \ Beamforming is also a key technology used\nin 5G networks, as it uses advanced\
    \ techniques to focus the radio signal towards a speciﬁc\ndevice, increasing the\
    \ signal strength and reducing interference. This technology is crucial\nfor providing\
    \ reliable and high-speed connectivity in a dense and dynamic environment.\nNetwork\
    \ slicing is another feature of 5G networks that allows for the creation of dedicated\n\
    virtual networks to meet the speciﬁc requirements of different applications. This\
    \ means that\ndevices can allocated their own network resources and services,\
    \ providing better network\nperformance and security. Edge computing is also used\
    \ in 5G networks, which provides real-\ntime processing and analysis of data at\
    \ the edge of the network. This can help to reduce the\nlatency and improve the\
    \ performance of time-sensitive applications, such as autonomous\nvehicles and\
    \ virtual reality. Low latency is another feature of 5G networks that is important\n\
    for applications that require real-time communication and response, such as autonomous\n\
    vehicles and remote surgery. 5G networks aim to achieve a latency of less than\
    \ 1 millisecond.\nHigh reliability is also a critical feature of 5G networks,\
    \ with features such as network slicing\nand redundant network paths, ensuring\
    \ that devices stay connected. This is essential for\nmission-critical applications\
    \ that require high availability and low downtime. 5G networks\nsupport full duplex\
    \ communication, which allows for simultaneous transmission and\nreception of\
    \ data. This technology can help to improve the efﬁciency and capacity of the\n\
    network, enabling higher data transfer rates and reducing latency.\nBased on the\
    \ requirements above, the following are the 5G network deployment\nrequirements:\n\
    •\nMillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for higher bandwidth and faster data rates.\n\
    •\nMassive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) technology for increasing spatial\n\
    streams and improving the wireless channel’s efﬁciency.\n•\nBeamforming to focus\
    \ the radio signal towards a speciﬁc device, increasing signal\nstrength and reducing\
    \ interference.\n•\nNetwork slicing for creating dedicated virtual networks to\
    \ meet the speciﬁc require-\nments of different applications, improving network\
    \ performance and security.\n•\nEdge computing for real-time processing and analysis\
    \ of data at the edge of the net-\nwork, reducing latency and improving the performance\
    \ of time-sensitive applications.\n•\nLow latency for real-time communication\
    \ and response, aiming to achieve a latency of\nless than 1 millisecond.\n•\n\
    High reliability for mission-critical applications, ensuring high availability\
    \ and low\ndowntime.\n•\nFull duplex communication for simultaneous transmission\
    \ and reception of data,\nimproving efﬁciency, capacity, and reducing latency.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n12 of 41\nThe combination of these technologies in 5G\
    \ networks can enable a wide range of\napplications, from IoT services to high-bandwidth\
    \ applications, such as virtual reality and\naugmented reality. 5G networks aim\
    \ to provide the necessary performance metrics to\nsupport these applications,\
    \ enabling the growth of the IoT ecosystem and a new era of\nconnectivity.\nFigure\
    \ 6. 5G implementation requirements.\n3.2. Evolution of Wireless Networks\nWireless\
    \ networks [41] have an important role in our society, because they allow us to\n\
    keep connected in a network without cables, being the bridge to create useful\
    \ tools. For\ninstance, 3GPP provides basic data services such as voice and messaging\
    \ capabilities, with\n4G we can make video calls, and use IP services, and with\
    \ 5G we can get more beneﬁts,\nsuch as low latency, more bandwidth, and other\
    \ interesting features [42].\n3.3. Evolution of IoT\nThe evolution of the internet\
    \ allowed remote connections between machines, and\nthe protocol standardization\
    \ used to transmit the information, such as TCP/IP, enabled\nresearchers to take\
    \ advantage of the internet and allowed to creation of new protocols and\nways\
    \ to transmit the data [43]. Since then, new technologies has arrived in our lives,\
    \ which\nis the case of IoT. In the last few years, new technologies and protocols\
    \ arose to connect\nand transmit data between IoT devices and networks, each providing\
    \ speciﬁc features\nto perform the applications. In the following statements,\
    \ we mention some protocols to\ncommunicate data. Each protocol can provide better\
    \ communication depending on the\napplication. For example, LoRaWAN is used in\
    \ long-range communication, allowing to\ntransmit of data through large distances\
    \ even with obstacles between the link and using\nlow power consumption. Zigbee\
    \ is a protocol commonly used in smart homes, avoiding\ninferences by routers,\
    \ electronic devices, and so on.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n13 of 41\nThe evolution\
    \ of IoT technologies is having a signiﬁcant impact on 5G networks. As\nmore and\
    \ more devices are connected to the internet, there is a growing need for faster,\n\
    more reliable connectivity. This is where 5G networks come in, providing higher\
    \ speeds,\nlower latency, and greater capacity than previous wireless technologies.\
    \ The proliferation\nof IoT devices also creates new opportunities for 5G, as\
    \ the technology is able to support the\nmassive amounts of data generated by\
    \ these devices. However, this also poses challenges\nfor 5G networks, such as\
    \ the need to handle large amounts of trafﬁc from a variety of\ndevices with different\
    \ requirements. As a result, the evolution of IoT technologies is\ndriving innovation\
    \ in 5G networks, as providers look for ways to meet the demands of this\ngrowing\
    \ ecosystem.\nThe implementation of 5G networks is expected to have a signiﬁcant\
    \ impact on the\nevolution of IoT services. One of the most signiﬁcant changes\
    \ is the increase in the speed\nof data transfer. 5G networks have much faster\
    \ data transfer speeds, lower latency, and\nhigher capacity than previous generations\
    \ of mobile networks [44]. This means that IoT\ndevices can transmit and receive\
    \ data much more quickly, which enables more real-time\ndata processing and analysis.\
    \ The improved responsiveness of IoT services will open up\nopportunities for\
    \ new applications that require near-instantaneous data processing, such\nas remote\
    \ surgery, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.\nAnother important\
    \ change brought about by the implementation of 5G networks is\nthe increased\
    \ scalability of IoT services. 5G networks have a higher device density, which\n\
    means that they can support a greater number of IoT devices per unit area. This\
    \ will help\nto increase the scalability of IoT services and allow for the deployment\
    \ of more complex\nand sophisticated IoT solutions.\nFurthermore, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to improve the reliability of IoT services. 5G\nnetworks have more\
    \ robust error correction capabilities and redundancy features, which\ncan increase\
    \ the reliability of IoT services. This is particularly important for mission-critical\n\
    applications, such as remote monitoring of infrastructure or medical devices [45].\
    \ Improved\nreliability will also be beneﬁcial in industries that require highly\
    \ reliable communication\nnetworks, such as manufacturing and energy.\nThe enhanced\
    \ security features of 5G networks will also impact the evolution of IoT\nservices.\
    \ 5G networks offer improved security features, such as network slicing, which\n\
    allows for the creation of isolated virtual networks for different IoT applications.\
    \ This can\nhelp to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security and privacy\
    \ of IoT data. With\nthe increasing number of IoT devices, the importance of security\
    \ and privacy is critical and\n5G networks can provide a more secure environment\
    \ for the data transmitted.\n5G networks will help to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of IoT devices. 5G networks\nare designed to be more energy efﬁcient than previous\
    \ generations of mobile networks [46].\nThis can help to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of IoT devices, prolonging their battery life\nand reducing their environmental\
    \ impact. This is particularly important for IoT devices\nthat are difﬁcult or\
    \ expensive to replace or recharge, such as sensors deployed in remote\nor inaccessible\
    \ locations. Figure 7 describes the main features related to 5G networks and\n\
    IoT services. The performance metrics associated with energy consumption are mentioned\n\
    here too.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n14 of 41\nFigure 7. Deﬁning 5G and features\
    \ that are essential for the Internet of Things services.\n3.4. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for IoT and Cloud-Based Solutions\nThis section covers various\
    \ wireless communication protocols used in IoT devices,\nincluding Wi-Fi AdHoc,\
    \ Zigbee, Z-Wave, LoRaWAN, and SigFox. It also touches on the\nuse of cloud computing\
    \ for IoT applications, such as data storage, analytics, and remote\ndevice management.\
    \ This section could provide a comprehensive overview of wireless\ncommunication\
    \ technologies used in IoT devices and their integration with cloud-based\nsolutions.\n\
    1.\nWi-Fi AdHoc: With the standard of IEEE 802.11, Wi-Fi technology turned into\
    \ the\nﬁrst technology to create devices connected to the network. Allowing to\
    \ create news\narchitectures such as Wi-Fi AdHoc is a decentralized type of wireless\
    \ network because\neach node participates in routing by forwarding data to other\
    \ nodes [47]. These nodes\ncan be IoT devices and are very helpful in applications\
    \ where it is needed to have\nmany devices connected.\n2.\nZigbee: The most popular\
    \ industry wireless mesh networking standard for connecting\nsensors, instrumentation,\
    \ and control systems. Zigbee implements communication in\na personal wireless\
    \ area network, providing low power consumption and interoper-\nating multi-vendor,\
    \ commonly used in home automation, low-power consumption\nsensors, HVAC (Heating,\
    \ Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control, etc. [48].\n3.\nZ-Wave: A wireless\
    \ protocol evolved by Zensys and conﬁrmed by the Z-Wave Alliance\nfor automation\
    \ apparatuses for home and commercial environments. This protocol\nallows transmitting\
    \ short messages with minimum noise and uses a Mesh network\nconﬁguration [49].\n\
    4.\nLoRaWAN: A low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed to connect battery\n\
    wirelessly operated ‘things’ to the internet in regional, national, or global\
    \ networks. It\ntargets IoT requirements, such as bi-directional communication,\
    \ end-to-end security,\nmobility, and localization services. According to work\
    \ cited in [50], LoRa has the most\nfeatures in terms of IoT, such as low power\
    \ consumption, long-range communication,\netc. Furthermore, the paper tested communication\
    \ in urban and forest areas, showing\nthat LoRaWAN can transmit data up to 2.1\
    \ km in urban areas.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n15 of 41\n5.\nSigFox: SigFox is\
    \ a network operator dedicated to the Internet of Things. The SigFox\nnetwork\
    \ uses the ultra-narrow band, allowing devices to communicate with low\npower\
    \ on a wide area [51].\n6.\nCloud Computing: Cloud computing is a term used to\
    \ describe both a platform and a\ntype of application. One of the essential features\
    \ of cloud computing is the capability\nto assign dynamic resources to the network,\
    \ being an important key to providing\nscalable solutions and avoiding high costs.\
    \ The interference plays an important\nrole when connecting devices since the\
    \ signal quality decrease, which means the\nmodulation decreases and the bits\
    \ per error increases. That is a problem if we are\ntrying to offer large bandwidths\
    \ and low latency in each data transmission [52]. We\nmust consider different\
    \ factors to provide a great QoS, like the weather, buildings,\nhardware, software\
    \ resources, etc. In the IoT context, the buildings and distances\ncreate the\
    \ main interferences. For that reason, technologies such as Zigbee, SigFox,\n\
    LoRaWAN, and Z-wave play a vital role in connecting devices.\n7.\nWiGig: WiGig,\
    \ also known as 802.11ay, is a wireless communication technology that\noperates\
    \ on the 60 GHz frequency band [53]. It was developed as an extension of the\n\
    Wi-Fi standard to provide high-speed, short-range wireless communication, primarily\n\
    for applications that require high bandwidth, such as virtual reality, high-deﬁnition\n\
    video streaming, and gaming. WiGig supports multi-gigabit data transfer rates,\
    \ with\ntheoretical speeds of up to 176 Gbps, which is much faster than the previous\
    \ Wi-\nFi standards [54]. It achieves this speed through the use of wider bandwidth\
    \ and\nadvanced modulation techniques, such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation\
    \ (QAM)\nand Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Another notable\
    \ feature\nof WiGig is its low latency, making it ideal for applications that\
    \ require real-time\ndata transfer, such as gaming and virtual reality [55]. It\
    \ also supports multiple-input,\nmultiple-output technology, which enables multiple\
    \ antennas to transmit and receive\ndata simultaneously, improving the overall\
    \ performance and efﬁciency of the network.\nIn the context of 5G networks, WiGig\
    \ can be used as a complementary technology\nto provide high-speed local area\
    \ network (LAN) connections for mobile devices and\nIoT devices. The 60 GHz frequency\
    \ band has a limited range, but it can support high\ndata rates over short distances,\
    \ making it suitable for applications, such as augmented\nand virtual reality\
    \ (AR/VR), wireless HD video streaming, and cloud gaming [56]. In\naddition, WiGig\
    \ can be used as a backhaul technology for small cells in 5G networks,\nenabling\
    \ high-speed data transfers between small cells and the core network. This\ncan\
    \ help improve the performance and capacity of 5G networks, especially in densely\n\
    populated urban areas where there is high demand for data services. Regarding\
    \ IoT\nservices, WiGig can enable high-speed local area connections between IoT\
    \ devices,\nallowing them to share data quickly and efﬁciently. This can be especially\
    \ useful for\napplications, such as smart homes, where multiple IoT devices need\
    \ to communicate\nwith each other in real time.\n3.5. 5G Applications\n5G beneﬁts\
    \ are not utilized solely by the most prominent IT corporations world-\nwide.\
    \ In the modern era, we have found several exciting applications where 5G’s high\n\
    speeds, excellent reliability, and energy efﬁciency come into play and provide\
    \ a better\nuser experience.\n•\nEntertainment services: Video-on-demand services\
    \ are currently one of the most\nutilized services on the internet. These services\
    \ demand high-speed connections, and\nwith rising trends to utilize higher resolution\
    \ devices, 5G plays a vital role in providing\noptimal user experience so that\
    \ they can consume their content without interruption.\n•\nGeneral mobile networks:\
    \ Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years, teleworking\nhas seen an immense\
    \ rise in all sectors globally. This means workers must be able\nto respond to\
    \ video or voice calls at any given time, requiring improved downlink\nand uplink\
    \ speeds. These requirements, complemented with the higher reliability\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n16 of 41\naspects of 5G, mean that this implementation will\
    \ improve communications in any\ngiven context, especially for work-related tasks.\n\
    •\nInternet of Things: IoT is one of the trendiest topics around the electronics\
    \ ecosys-\ntem, due to its nature to provide automation to simple or very complex\
    \ topics. Even\nthough most IoT devices currently utilize 3G or 4G-LTE technologies\
    \ due to their low\nrequirements for data connectivity, a new generation of IoT\
    \ devices requires higher\nthroughput rates. These requirements are on the limits\
    \ of the current generation of\nwireless technologies, which makes 5G an interesting\
    \ contestant to solve these require-\nments. The most popular IoT applications\
    \ today involve Smart Homes, industries,\nor farming, which generally require\
    \ low amounts of wireless capabilities because\nthe devices have low microprocessing\
    \ power due to the nature of the technology\nitself. However, new trends, such\
    \ as Smart Cities or IoV (Internet of Vehicles), require\nmuch greater throughput\
    \ to function correctly and offer an optimal user experience.\nThese types of\
    \ solutions require capabilities that are only offered by 5G. IoT data\nare visioned\
    \ to increase in data provided per area by 1000 times [57] which means\nIoT applications\
    \ will be part of our everyday lives. The current data are provided\nmainly by\
    \ sensors, but more complex devices will mean that data will be gathered\nfrom\
    \ additional sources. This exponential growth in data consumption will also need\n\
    to be stored in scalable data storages, and this is where cloud computing comes\
    \ in.\nSome of the most famous architectural trends of IoT devices follow three\
    \ principles:\nHardware: All sensor nodes that gather data, their communication\

    \ charge of storing and analyzing the data and monitoring\nthe devices.\nPresentation\
    \ layer: Commonly called the front end, this presents visualization tools\nbetter\
    \ to understand our devices’ current state and behavior.\n5G technologies can\
    \ impact the hardware and middleware layer. As the technology is\nmore energy\
    \ efﬁcient, the devices do not need massive antennas, which can lead to\nincreased\
    \ consumption. At the middleware layer, as devices can communicate more\ndata\
    \ in a given period, this layer will beneﬁt from extra data to improve any statistical\n\
    or machine learning model.\n3.6. 5G Technologies\nThe purpose of this section\
    \ is to describe some of the most popular technologies\nimplemented with 5G.\n\
    Figure 8 shows characteristics and technical speciﬁcations of 5G. 5G networks\
    \ offer\nseveral key characteristics and technical speciﬁcations that make them\
    \ ideal for a wide range\nof applications. 5G provides signiﬁcantly increased\
    \ bandwidth, enabling faster data transfer\nrates for high-speed applications,\
    \ such as virtual and augmented reality. It also offers lower\nlatency, making\
    \ it suitable for real-time communication and response applications, such\nas\
    \ autonomous vehicles and remote surgery. 5G is highly reliable, with features\
    \ such\nas network slicing and redundant network paths, ensuring devices stay\
    \ connected. 5G\nenables massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable\
    \ and low-latency\ncommunication (URLLC), making it suitable for mission-critical\
    \ applications, such as\nindustrial automation. Additionally, 5G offers network\
    \ slicing, beamforming, and uses\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for even\
    \ higher bandwidth and faster data rates.\nOverall, 5G networks offer signiﬁcant\
    \ improvements in bandwidth, latency, reliability, and\nﬂexibility, making them\
    \ well-suited for a wide range of applications.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n17 of\

    1.\nMassive MIMO: This technology is responsible for sending and receiving multiple\n\
    signals simultaneously, utilizing the same radio channel. While other technologies,\n\
    such as Wi-Fi or 4G-LTE, have utilized this technology, massive MIMO performs\
    \ best\nwhen paired with 5G technologies. This technology uses extra antennas\
    \ to move\nenergy into smaller regions of space, which means spectral efﬁciency\
    \ and coverage\nare improved [58].\n2.\nNOMA: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access:\
    \ A radio access technology that plays a vital\nrole in 5G applications [59].\
    \ This technology offers several beneﬁts, such as low latency\nand massive high-speed\
    \ connectivity. Code domain NOMA is commonly paired with\nmMIMO, drastically improving\
    \ spectral efﬁciency [60]. Power domain NOMA is\ncommonly utilized with MIMO,\
    \ beamforming, and even cooperative communications,\nbeing one of the most ﬂexible\
    \ technologies utilized in 5G implementations.\n3.\nMillimeter Wave: This technology\
    \ uses a frequency band between 30 GHz and\n300 GHz and derives its name from\
    \ the 1 to 10 mm waves utilized by the tech-\nnology. Utilized commonly in radar\
    \ applications, this technology is being paired with\n5G to improve spectrum bandwidth\
    \ and increase spectrum utilizations. The main\nbeneﬁt of pairing this technology\
    \ with 5G is the spectrum freedom linked to mmWave.\nStandard technologies, such\
    \ as GPS, 4G, and satellite connections, utilize the 1 GHz\nto 6 GHz spectrum,\
    \ which is becoming very crowded [61]. Because mmWave is new\nand has a massive\
    \ spectral range, 5G provides an improved user experience through\nthis combination.\n\
    4.\nMachine Learning Techniques: Supervised and unsupervised models are being\
    \ im-\nplemented in 5G technologies to improve overall network capacities, predict\
    \ energy\nconsumption, and optimize tracking technologies such as beamforming.\
    \ In the su-\npervised category, some 5G networks utilize Linear Regression Algorithms\
    \ to predict\nthe scheduling of nodes [62]. Other supervised models utilize Deep\
    \ Neural Networks\nto predict beamforming vectors. Then, unsupervised learning\
    \ models are used to\nimprove handover selection and reduce interruption of services,\
    \ as well as they can\nreduce latency by clustering fog nodes.\n5.\nUnmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicles (UAV): Being the most innovative proposal, current 5G\nresearchers\
    \ are utilizing UAVs to improve network coverage. These UAVs will assist\nthe\
    \ terrestrial network by serving as beacons. The high altitude of these planes\
    \ could\nsolve many interference problems and even replace entirely terrestrial\
    \ cellular net-\nworks [63]. UAVs, commonly known as drones, have become increasingly\
    \ popular for\nboth commercial and personal use. With the advent of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT, UAVs\ncan now be equipped with a wide range of sensors and devices\
    \ that can transmit\nreal-time data to ground stations for analysis and decision\
    \ making [64]. There are\nseveral potential implementations of UAVs in the context\
    \ of 5G and IoT. One such\nimplementation is in the area of precision agriculture.\
    \ UAVs can be used to gather data\non crop growth, soil conditions, and other\
    \ factors that affect agricultural production.\nThese data can be transmitted\
    \ in real time to a ground station for analysis and used\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n\
    18 of 41\nto optimize planting, fertilization, and irrigation schedules [65].\
    \ 5G networks and\nIoT sensors can provide the necessary bandwidth and low latency\
    \ for this type of\napplication. Another potential application of UAVs in the\
    \ context of 5G and IoT is\nin industrial inspection and maintenance. UAVs equipped\
    \ with cameras and other\nsensors can be used to inspect and monitor equipment\
    \ and infrastructure such as\npower lines and wind turbines. Real-time data transmission\
    \ via 5G networks can\nenable remote monitoring and control of these systems,\
    \ improving their reliability\nand reducing maintenance costs [66]. UAVs can also\
    \ be used for emergency response\nand disaster management. In the event of a natural\
    \ disaster, such as a hurricane or\nearthquake, UAVs can be deployed to assess\
    \ damage and provide real-time informa-\ntion to ﬁrst responders. The data collected\
    \ can be transmitted via 5G networks to\nemergency management centers for analysis\
    \ and decision making. UAVs can be used\nfor surveillance and security purposes.\
    \ In public safety applications, UAVs can be\nused to monitor crowd movements\
    \ and gather intelligence on potential threats. In\nprivate security applications,\
    \ UAVs can be used to patrol and monitor facilities for\nintruders or other security\
    \ threats. The combination of UAVs with 5G networks and\nIoT sensors can enable\
    \ a wide range of applications in various industries. With the\npotential to improve\
    \ efﬁciency, reduce costs, and enhance safety, it is likely that we\nwill see\
    \ an increase in the adoption of UAVs in the coming years.\n3.7. 5G Problems\n\
    5G offers excellent improvements over last-generation mobile communication tech-\n\
    nologies. However, many problems related to technological complications, security\
    \ and\nprivacy implications, and even social implications have been discovered.\n\
    Technical complications are related primarily to interference. 5G as a technology\
    \ has\ncomplications related to interference, being as sensible as being dramatically\
    \ affected by\nmild rain in urbanized areas [67]. Even though the technologies\
    \ mentioned previously\nhelp mitigate these problems, 5G still needs to be ready\
    \ to be used on a massive scale.\nTests performed in several countries utilizing\
    \ small cells show the need for more extensive\narchitectures to offer full coverage\
    \ and optimal user experience [68]. This means costly\narchitectures will lead\
    \ providers to focus mainly on urban areas, leaving rural areas unat-\ntended.\
    \ This leads to the following obstacles, which are ethical and social implications.\n\
    One of the main advantages of 5G is the ability to offer improved connections\
    \ to people\nin poor conditions. However, right now, it is only used as a marketing\
    \ stunt because 5G\narchitectures are considerably expensive and cannot offer\
    \ coverage in rural areas. As 5G\nequipment and technology become more widely\
    \ adopted in the following years, we expect\nbig strides in this department.\n\
    Another ethical and social implication is IoV technologies enabled by 5G. As we\
    \ see\nmore autonomous driving cars, and 5G will enable more precise driving for\
    \ these cars, as\nwell as broad adoption of them, we are encountering huge moral\
    \ dilemmas in cases where\ncar accidents are caused by autonomous vehicles. Security\
    \ implications arise from the trend\nof connecting vehicles to the internet, which\
    \ means people can be kidnapped remotely by\ntheir car if hackers gain control\
    \ of their vehicle via the web.\nThe main problems mentioned and explained above\
    \ are listed below:\n•\nTechnical complications related to interference, including\
    \ sensitivity to mild rain in\nurban areas.\n•\nNeed for extensive and costly\
    \ architectures to offer full coverage and optimal user\nexperience, which may\
    \ lead providers to focus mainly on urban areas, leaving rural\nareas unattended.\n\
    •\nEthical and social implications related to the inability to offer improved\
    \ connections\nto people in poor conditions due to the high cost of 5G architectures\
    \ and the lack of\ncoverage in rural areas.\n•\nSecurity implications arising\
    \ from the trend of connecting vehicles to the internet,\nwhich could result in\
    \ remote kidnappings by hackers.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n19 of 41\nTable 2 compares\
    \ the problems presented by 5G and IoT services across several key\nareas, namely\
    \ security, latency, interference, cost, and compatibility. In terms of security,\n\
    5G networks are vulnerable to a range of threats, such as DDoS attacks, identity\
    \ theft, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks, while IoT devices can suffer from security\
    \ breaches due to weak\nencryption, passwords, and outdated ﬁrmware. Regarding\
    \ latency, 5G networks have lower\nlatency, which can be a problem for certain\
    \ IoT applications that require real-time response,\nwhile IoT services may suffer\
    \ from latency due to network congestion, distance from the\nserver, and the number\
    \ of devices connected to the network. Interference is another factor\nthat can\
    \ affect both 5G and IoT services, with both being susceptible to interference\
    \ from\nother wireless devices and environmental factors. Cost is also a concern,\
    \ as the high cost of\n5G infrastructure and services may limit its usefulness\
    \ for many IoT applications, while IoT\nservices may also be expensive to deploy\
    \ and maintain, particularly if they require high\nbandwidth or specialized hardware.\
    \ Finally, compatibility is a potential issue for both 5G\nand IoT services, with\
    \ some IoT devices not being compatible with 5G networks, and IoT\nservices limited\
    \ by compatibility issues with proprietary hardware or software.\nTable 2. Comparison\
    \ of problems presented by 5G and IoT services\nProblem\n5G\nIoT Services\nSecurity\n\
    5G networks are vulnerable to various security threats,\nsuch as DDoS attacks,\
    \ identity theft, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\nIoT devices are susceptible\
    \ to security breaches\ndue to poor encryption, weak passwords, and\noutdated\
    \ ﬁrmware.\nLatency\n5G networks have lower latency, which can be a\nproblem for\
    \ certain IoT applications that require\nreal-time response.\nIoT services may\

    the number of devices connected to the network.\nInterference\n5G networks can\
    \ experience interference from other\nwireless devices, which can disrupt the\
    \ transmission of\ndata.\nIoT services may also suffer from interference due\n\
    to environmental factors, such as obstacles and\ninterference from other wireless\
    \ devices.\nCost\nThe cost of 5G infrastructure and services may be\nprohibitively\
    \ high for many IoT applications,\nparticularly those that require large-scale\
    \ deployment.\nIoT services may also be expensive to deploy and\nmaintain, particularly\
    \ if they require high\nbandwidth or specialized hardware.\nCompatibility\nSome\
    \ IoT devices may not be compatible with 5G\nnetworks, which can limit their usefulness\
    \ in certain\napplications.\nIoT services may also be limited by compatibility\n\
    issues, particularly if they rely on proprietary\nhardware or software.\n3.8.\
    \ Coexistence of 5G Networks and IoT Applications\nThe coexistence of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT applications has the potential to revolu-\ntionize several industries\
    \ by providing ultra-reliable and low-latency communication,\nmassive machine-type\
    \ communications, and network slicing for multiple services and\napplications\
    \ [18]. One novel idea is the use of 5G networks for industrial automation and\n\
    autonomous vehicles, where ultra-reliable and low-latency communication is critical\
    \ for\nensuring the safety and reliability of the system. Another innovative application\
    \ is the use\nof 5G networks for vehicle-to-everything communication, where autonomous\
    \ vehicles can\nexchange information with other vehicles and infrastructure to\
    \ improve trafﬁc management\nand safety [69]. The use of 5G networks for smart\
    \ cities and agriculture can also be highly\nbeneﬁcial, as it can enable massive\
    \ machine-type communication to support a large number\nof IoT devices, such as\
    \ sensors and actuators, and facilitate data collection, analysis, and\ndecision\
    \ making. Additionally, the use of network slicing can enable multiple services\
    \ and\napplications to coexist on the same infrastructure while maintaining their\
    \ unique require-\nments for security, reliability, and latency. However, the\
    \ coexistence of 5G networks and IoT\napplications also presents several challenges,\
    \ such as security, interference, compatibility,\nand cost [35]. For example,\
    \ security is critical for protecting IoT devices and networks from\ncyber attacks,\
    \ while interference from other wireless devices and environmental factors can\n\
    affect both 5G and IoT services. Moreover, compatibility issues can arise when\
    \ IoT devices\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n20 of 41\nare not compatible with 5G networks,\
    \ and the high cost of deploying and maintaining 5G\ninfrastructure and IoT services\
    \ can limit their widespread adoption. Overall, the coexis-\ntence of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT applications presents both opportunities and challenges and\nrequires\
    \ careful consideration of their technical requirements, security, and compatibility\
    \ to\nrealize their full potential.\nTable 3 provides a summary of the coexistence\
    \ of various 5G services and networks\nwith IoT applications. It highlights the\
    \ wireless technology, algorithms used, and coex-\nistence of services with 4G\
    \ and Wi-Fi. The table includes several 5G services, such as\n5G NR, 5G-V2X, 5G\

    \ Difﬁculties\nNowadays, with the development of new technologies, networks face\
    \ different chal-\nlenges. Issues such as coverage, latency, availability, and\
    \ accessibility, among others, appear.\nMoreover, taking into account a more profound\
    \ or more centralized point to the character-\nistics of the network, issues such\
    \ as latency, interference, spectrum use according to the\ntechnology being used,\
    \ and others appear.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n21 of 41\nInterference in 5G networks\
    \ can occur due to a variety of factors such as environmental\nconditions, radio\
    \ frequency congestion, and the deployment of too many access points\nin a limited\
    \ area. These issues can cause signal loss or degradation, resulting in poor\n\
    network performance and reduced data transfer rates. Interference in 5G networks\
    \ can\nhave a signiﬁcant impact on IoT devices that rely on a stable and reliable\
    \ connection to\noperate effectively.\nIoT devices are designed to transmit small\
    \ amounts of data over long periods, often\nusing low power and low bandwidth\
    \ networks. The interference in 5G networks can cause\ndelays or interruptions\
    \ in the transmission of data between IoT devices and the cloud-based\nsystems\
    \ they rely on. These disruptions can impact critical functions, such as real-time\n\
    monitoring of environmental conditions, trafﬁc management, and energy consumption.\
    \ In\naddition, interference in 5G networks can result in increased latency, which\
    \ can make it\ndifﬁcult for IoT devices to communicate with each other in a timely\
    \ manner.\nAnother critical aspect of interference in 5G networks is the potential\
    \ for security\nbreaches. As the number of connected devices increases, the risk\
    \ of cyber attacks also\ngrows. Interference in 5G networks can make it easier\
    \ for hackers to gain unauthorized\naccess to IoT devices and the data they transmit.\
    \ This can have serious consequences,\nparticularly for devices that are used\
    \ in critical infrastructure, such as healthcare systems,\npower grids, and transportation\
    \ networks.\nTo mitigate the impact of interference in 5G networks on IoT devices,\
    \ it is essential to\nensure that the network is properly conﬁgured and managed.\
    \ This includes deploying ac-\ncess points strategically to minimize congestion,\
    \ using directional antennas to focus signals\nand reduce interference, and implementing\
    \ security measures to prevent unauthorized\naccess. In addition, new technologies\
    \ such as edge computing and network slicing can help\nto reduce latency and improve\
    \ the reliability of IoT device communication.\nTable 4 outlines some of the main\
    \ types of interference that can impact 5G networks\nand the IoT. Interference\
    \ can occur due to a variety of factors, such as noise, multipath,\nco-channel\
    \ interference, interference from other devices or wireless networks, and jamming.\n\
    One of the key aspects of network performance that interference can affect is\
    \ coverage.\nInterference can reduce the coverage of a wireless network by increasing\
    \ the signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) threshold required for reliable communication.\
    \ When there is noise,\nmultipath, or interference from other wireless networks\
    \ present, signals may not reach as\nfar or penetrate as deeply into buildings,\
    \ resulting in reduced overall coverage. Another\naspect that can be affected\
    \ by interference is latency. Interference can increase latency by\nintroducing\
    \ delays in signal transmission or reception. For instance, multipath interference\n\
    can cause signals to arrive at a receiver at slightly different times, leading\
    \ to signal distortion\nand increased latency. This delay can be particularly\
    \ problematic for real-time applications,\nsuch as gaming or video conferencing.\
    \ Interference can also impact the availability of a\nwireless network. When there\
    \ is co-channel interference or interference from other devices,\nit can cause\
    \ collisions or channel saturation, leading to reduced availability. This can\
    \ result\nin packet loss or connection drops, making it difﬁcult for users to\
    \ access the network and\nresulting in a poor user experience. Access to a wireless\
    \ network can also be affected by\ninterference. Interference can make it harder\
    \ for devices to connect to a network, leading\nto connection failures or reduced\
    \ bandwidth. This can be particularly problematic in\nareas with high device density,\
    \ such as urban environments. Interference can also affect\nmodulation and coding.\
    \ When there is interference present, the quality of the signal can\ndegrade,\
    \ making it more difﬁcult for the receiver to demodulate and decode the signal.\n\
    This can result in errors and reduce the overall throughput of the network.\n\

    \ of 5G is interference. It should be\nremembered that interference, by deﬁnition,\
    \ is when two electromagnetic waves overlap.\nThis overlapping causes communication\
    \ failures from where the wave is sent to where it is\nreceived. There are two\
    \ types of interference: constructive and destructive. Constructive\ninterference\
    \ occurs when the waves overlap or collide in phase, and this causes the resulting\n\
    wave to have a greater amplitude. Furthermore, destructive interference is when\
    \ there is\nan out-of-phase overlap, where the resultant of this wave will be\
    \ of lower amplitude [80].\nSome networks may be more susceptible to interference\
    \ depending on the type of wave\nthey handle, i.e., the frequency used in the\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. RF can give this\ninterference, whereas in 5G networks,\
    \ millimeter bands and below 6 GHz bands are used.\nIn addition, it must be taken\
    \ into account that these interferences will continue to grow\nwith the development\
    \ of technology.\nFigure 9 covers various types of interference in wireless communication\
    \ systems in\n5G. Adjacent channel interference occurs when adjacent frequencies\
    \ or channels overlap\ndue to imperfections in ﬁlters or non-linearity in ampliﬁers.\
    \ Inter-cell interference happens\nwhen two users from neighboring cells try to\
    \ use the same frequency band simultaneously\ndue to resource limitation within\
    \ the network. Intra-channel and inter-channel interference\noccur due to physical\
    \ proximity of devices and low power within the macro-cell network,\nrespectively.\
    \ Inter-symbol interference results from signal distortion due to phase or\namplitude\
    \ dispersion in the channel. Inter-carrier occurs due to frequency offsets between\n\
    sub-carriers. Inter-numerology interference arises due to non-orthogonality in\
    \ the system,\ncausing difﬁculties for symbol alignment. Cross-link interference\
    \ occurs when signals\nare transmitted to neighboring cells in different directions\
    \ simultaneously. Inter-beam\ninterference happens due to the use of multi-beam\
    \ antenna systems, causing interference\nfrom adjacent beams. Multi-user interference\
    \ happens when several users try to transmit\ntheir information requests at the\
    \ same time, and MU-MIMO is used to increase the capacity\nand performance of\
    \ wireless broadcasting systems.\nWe must consider that with the evolution of\
    \ higher data rates, we are looking for\nthe implementation in a frequency spectrum\
    \ that is becoming more saturated daily. The\ndevelopment in these frequencies\
    \ makes the operator reuse the same frequencies for\nneighboring cells to save\
    \ spectrum. This development causes high interference between\ncells [81]. In\
    \ addition to these, other interferences also occur within the networks. The\n\
    classiﬁcation of these interferences is as follows:\n•\nAdjacent channel interference:\
    \ Adjacent channel interference is a problem that occurs\nin many devices and\
    \ many frequency ranges. This occurs when an adjacent frequency\nor the adjacent\
    \ channel of the one used by our device overlaps. This problem occurs\nin 5G,\
    \ as in other mobile technologies. This type of interference is mainly caused,\
    \ as\nstated in [82], by an imperfection in the ﬁlters, where they cannot ﬁlter\
    \ the desired\nsignal correctly. These imperfections result in nearby frequencies\
    \ passing into the\npassband. In turn, this occurs because the ampliﬁers are not\
    \ linear.\n•\nIntra-cell and inter-cell interference: Inter-cell interference\
    \ is one of the most signiﬁ-\ncant causes of network performance degradation.\
    \ This occurs when two users from\nneighboring cells attempt to use the same frequency\
    \ band simultaneously. This occurs,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n23 of 41\nas said\
    \ in [83], because of resource limitation within the network, due to the frequency\n\
    reuse factor. In the same way, inter-cell interference is identiﬁed when a Base\
    \ Station\nconnects directly in the close range of another BS, and that is when\
    \ there is a simulta-\nneous transmission in that reuse. A distortion appears\
    \ by the interference that gives\nthe user and other equipment in the same cell.\n\
    •\nIntra-Channel and Inter-Channel interference: Inter-channel interference usually\
    \ oc-\ncurs when there is a low power within the macro-cell network. Then, when\
    \ communi-\ncating, the information is forwarded to the nearest base station.\
    \ When the transmission\nis made, it is completed through fast switching and restricts\
    \ delays and propagation\nlosses. However, this produces intra-channel interference\
    \ that affects the valuable\nsignal. On the other hand, inter-channel interference\
    \ occurs due to the physical prox-\nimity of the devices when two separate frequency\
    \ bands cause interference with each\nother. As these devices operate in close\
    \ range, the transmitter of a high-power signal\ninterferes with the receiver\
    \ of a weak signal. It is important to emphasize that 5G IoT\nnetworks or devices\
    \ with channels in the MHz range are susceptible to this type of\ninterference\
    \ due to the proximity and number of nearby devices. One way to mitigate\nthis\
    \ type of interference is through spatial modulation via MIMO [84].\n•\nInter-Symbol\
    \ Interference: Inter-symbol interference occurs when one or more symbols\ninterfere\
    \ with other symbols. It is caused by phase or amplitude dispersion in the\nchannel,\
    \ resulting in signal distortion. This can be seen in OFDMA, where multipath\n\
    propagation occurs. One study [85] exposed how this type of interference can be\n\
    an excellent challenge for network systems and should be sought to improve the\n\
    efﬁciency of the bandwidth while seeking alternatives in the modulation. This\
    \ is in\norder to counteract this type of interference.\n•\nInter-numerology interference:\
    \ Multiple numerology is a model to provide ﬂexibility\nfor devices in different\
    \ services. For these numerologies, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 kHz\nchannels are\
    \ used. They aim to improve performance and signiﬁcant bandwidth.\nAs stated in\
    \ [86], the authors introduce a non-orthogonality in the system, causing\ndifﬁculties\
    \ for symbol alignment in the time domain. When sampling at the same\nfrequency,\
    \ numerology tends to align differently, making synchronization within the\nframe\
    \ difﬁcult. This is known as interference between numerologies.\n•\nCross-Link\
    \ Interference: This interference occurs when signals are transmitted to\nneighboring\
    \ cells in different directions simultaneously, either in time frequency or\n\
    arbitrarily overlapping resources. As mentioned in [87], there are different types\
    \ of\ninterference and different ways in which it occurs. For example, the Base\
    \ Station\nreceives interference from user equipment devices in adjacent cells,\
    \ or a downlink\nuser equipment receives interference from a second database.\n\
    •\nInter Beam Interference: With the high demand for technological services, the\
    \ aim\nhas been to improve spectral efﬁciency and network performance. In trade-offs\
    \ for\nnetworks such as 5G, where the quality and capacity must be high, the solution\
    \ of\nincorporating a multi-beam antenna system such as mMIMO was sought, as explored\n\
    in detail in [88]. This technique identiﬁes the best route to providing optimal\
    \ perfor-\nmance to a user. This approach helps compensate for transmission attenuation\
    \ losses,\nespecially in millimeter-wave communication. In this case, the base\
    \ station generates\nmultiple narrow beams of mainly RF energy in all directions\
    \ of the coverage area. This\ncauses a spatial division of multiple beams, introducing\
    \ interference. Adjacent beams\ncause this interference from the same cell or\
    \ a neighboring cell.\n•\nMulti-user Interference: Multi-user interference is\
    \ due to the industry’s quest for\nhigher data rates in applications and the dramatic\
    \ increase in subscribers to wireless\ncommunications [89]. The techniques used\
    \ for this type of technology are given by MU-\nMIMO, a 5G generation technique\
    \ that helps increase the capacity and performance of\nwireless broadcasting systems.\
    \ Multi-user interference occurs when several users try\nto transmit their information\
    \ requests at the same time.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n24 of 41\nFigure 9. Main\
    \ concepts of interference in 5G.\n3.9.2. Interference in 5G\nThe different classiﬁcations\
    \ of interference have been explored. Now it is sought\nas part of the state of\
    \ the art to understand interference within 5G. The enrichment of\ninterference\
    \ in technologies such as Hetnets, IoT, D2D, Relay Node, and New Radio 5G\nwill\
    \ be sought.\n•\nInterference in Hetnets: Hetnets are 5G heterogeneous networks.\
    \ They aim to pro-\nvide wireless coverage for mobile subscribers and indoor and\
    \ outdoor applications.\nHetnets are multi-tier network systems that deploy small\
    \ cells in populated areas.\nThese cells are characterized by having a short range\
    \ and low power consumption.\nThis network comprises access points, which allow\
    \ high density, improvements in\nnetwork ﬂexibility, and so on [90]. Due to the\
    \ infrastructure and locations for deploy-\ning this type of network, they are\
    \ prone to different types of interference, such as\nintra-cell, inter-cell, and\
    \ adjacency channels. This type of problem is due to its poor\nsystematization\
    \ and organization in its network design. There are types of interference\nwithin\
    \ heterogeneous networks due to their infrastructure or grouping depending\non\
    \ the need to be met. The ﬁrst interference that appears is Co-tier interference.\
    \ This\ntype of interference appears mostly in femtocells, where there is much\
    \ demand for\nhigher data rates. This environment allows coverage, such as low-power\
    \ radio access\npoints, giving various services at home [91]. This type of interference\
    \ is observed\nwhen multiple users reside in the same network tier, where transmission\
    \ occurs over\nadjacent cells within the femtocell. Similar to co-tier, cross-tier\
    \ interference can appear.\nThe difference is that the co-tier is the inter-cell\
    \ interference, and the cross-tier is the\ninterference between the femtocell\
    \ and macro-cells, considering that the femtocell is\ninside the macro-cell [92].\
    \ Last but not least, in [93], channel control interference says\nthat one of\
    \ the most critical factors for channel control is the physical control format\n\
    indicator channel. This channel carries scheduling and synchronization information\n\
    for the uplink and downlink link data channels. As the transport is by physical\
    \ means,\nthis will induce interference.\n•\nInterference in D2D: With the introduction\
    \ of 5G, the best wireless systems have\nconstantly sought a solution that allows\
    \ the best quality of communication. Device-\nto-device networks are one of the\
    \ candidates to be the future of 5G networks. Direct\ncontact between two mobiles\
    \ increases efﬁciency in the spectrum. However, it always\nbrings some challenges,\
    \ in this case dealing with interference. As discussed in the\ndescription of\
    \ Hetnets above, these use a high connectivity capacity thanks to their\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n25 of 41\nstructure with macro-cell and femtocell. They allow\
    \ good performance [94]. With\nthe introduction of D2D, a cellular network is\
    \ sought that signiﬁcantly improves\nspectral efﬁciency and performance. However,\
    \ some challenges are the need for more\nsecurity that this type of technology\
    \ presents and interference. On the interference\nside, they appear related to\
    \ inter-cell interference. Furthermore, intra-cell may be\nrelated to adjacent\
    \ frequency. Furthermore, we must remember that there are types\nof interference\
    \ typical of D2D nodes, D2D-to-CU interference, and inter-D2D node\ninterference,\
    \ among others.\n•\nInterference in IoT and Smart Cities: We cannot limit our\
    \ minds to just one application\nwhen discussing the Internet of things. However,\
    \ everything from D2D devices and\nV2X to smart homes or buildings is part of\
    \ it. The conception of IoT with 5G has\nevolved in large and small ecosystems.\
    \ IoT in some applications is used over the\nunlicensed ISM band, which is used\
    \ for various physical devices to properly leverage\nthe spectrum to adhere to\
    \ the conditions and regulations of short radio communication.\nThe Internet of\
    \ Things has been seen as the other great leap in the evolution of the\nInternet.\
    \ With this in mind, developing smart cities will help create a more sustainable\n\
    and cost-efﬁcient ecosystem [95]. The combination of technologies such as 5G,\
    \ IoT,\nand others will enable big data, offering complex services to the community,\
    \ adding\nmembers in smart cities, and ensuring compatibility. However, it should\
    \ be noted\nthat interference must be characterized. When talking about smart\
    \ cities using Wi-Fi\nbecause of the use of the millimeter band, physical obstacles\
    \ such as walls are things\nto keep in mind, in addition to channel overlapping\
    \ and inter-carrier interference [96].\n3.9.3. Optimization Challenges in 5G Networks\n\
    5G is presented as a developed environment with an ecosystem where the boundaries\n\
    are complete cities. 5G technologies promise high-speed and low-latency data transmission\n\
    using the millimeter band. Although this frequency band allows these advantages,\
    \ it only\nallows short distances. By allowing such short distances, problems\
    \ such as interference\nbecome apparent. The optimization of this type of network\
    \ should always be used to\nget the best out of it. In 5G, techniques such as\
    \ MIMO and beamforming are used to\nreduce interference or signal degradation\
    \ [90]. It should be noted that optimizations for\n5G networks include different\
    \ architectures that are part of this type of network. These\narchitectures can\
    \ be divided into non-standalone and standalone.\nOptimizing these architectures,\
    \ depending on their niche, can be proﬁtable, as the\ncommunication varies. Communication\
    \ can be more accessible or restricted depending\non the architecture. At the\
    \ same time, different modulations can be obtained to enhance\ndata transmission,\
    \ transmission speed, and latency. In the same way, with 5G, most of the\narchitectures\
    \ allow the incorporation of MIMO. Thanks to beamforming management, it is\npossible\
    \ to optimize the use of frequencies for transmission so that some technologies\
    \ can\nsend information in the mmWaves range.\nFrom interference in the case of\
    \ NR, other interferences negatively affect the data\ntransmission in this architecture\
    \ due to the nature of this architecture. These are inter-\ncarrier interference\
    \ and phase interference. This is because it uses the mmWave frequency\nrange.\
    \ In turn, another interference that damages NR is numerology interference [97].\n\
    The evolution of mobile networks from 3G to 4G and now to 5G has signiﬁcantly\n\
    impacted the services and Internet of Things devices. Each new generation has\
    \ provided\nfaster data transfer speeds, increased bandwidth, and improved reliability,\
    \ enabling the\nemergence of new services and applications that were previously\
    \ not possible on mobile\ndevices. As 5G networks become more widely adopted,\
    \ they will continue to unlock new\nopportunities for innovation, transforming\
    \ the way we interact with our devices and the\nworld around us.\nTable 5 shows\
    \ the impact of each mobile generation starting with 3G and explains the\nimpact\
    \ in an IoT context.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n26 of 41\nTable 5. Mobile generations\
    \ and IoT.\nYear\nTechnology\nImpact in IoT\n2000\n3G allows devices to\nconnect\
    \ to the internet since\n3G enables mobile and\nwireless internet\nconnections.\n\
    With internet connections, electronic\ndevices start transmitting data through\n\
    the internet, the ﬁrst step to developing\nIoT devices.\n2008\n4G enables cloud\n\
    computing technology and\ntransmits information with\nthe IP protocol. In addition,\n\
    4G increased the bandwidth\nof each transmission.\nThe data transmission through\
    \ IP protocol\nenables an easy communication method with\nelectronic devices.\
    \ The cloud enables a way to\ndevelop more affordable solutions.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the internet connection cost\ndecreases because 4G delivers a cheap way to\n\
    transmit data as IP protocols manage the data\nmore efﬁciently. This generation\
    \ is the most\nimportant in an IoT context because the\nindustry has all the resources\
    \ to connect\ndevices to the cloud.\n2019\nWith 5G, an essential\nfeature is the\
    \ beam width,\nan important key in the IoT\ncontext.\nIf we have more bandwidth,\
    \ we can provide\nbetter solutions, such as real-time monitoring\nsystems. In\
    \ our society, these solutions are\nvital if we want to automate processes. For\n\
    this reason, 5G plays an essential role in the\nIoT context because the industry\
    \ is trying to\nautomate all its processes.\nNew technologies and recent research\
    \ about wireless communication have created\nnew ways to transmit and receive\
    \ data. With the evolution of technology such as 5G, new\nfeatures arrived to\
    \ provide/perform the ways to send and receive data. IoT has shown\nmore beneﬁts,\
    \ helping with other technologies such as machine learning, cloud computing,\n\
    and others. Since the data can be processed, each device forms a swarm intelligence\
    \ that\nallows automatization and avoids wasting resources in the industry.\n\
    Another factor in analyzing is the interference with the channels, since our houses,\n\
    ofﬁces, and even natural places have electronic devices that typically use the\
    \ 2.4 GHz band,\nwhich causes interference in this band. Therefore, 5G incorporates\
    \ new bands to avoid\nthe interference caused by this massive consumption of 2.4\
    \ GHz. We need to compare\nthe features of 3G, 4G, and 5G to understand why 5G\
    \ is an essential key in smart cities.\nThe main technical characteristics of\
    \ these three generations of technologies can be seen in\nTable 6.\nTable 6. Important\

    \ for the use of 5G technology in the IoT. The ﬁrst\nfeature mentioned is bandwidth.\
    \ Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be\ntransmitted over a network\
    \ or a communication channel in a given amount of time. In\nthe context of 5G,\
    \ higher bandwidth means that more data can be transmitted over the\nairwaves\
    \ in a shorter period of time, which can result in faster and more reliable 5G\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n27 of 41\ntransmissions. Another feature highlighted is\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, which can analyze\nall the data generated by the IoT\
    \ devices to take accurate decisions. With the use of AI,\nIoT devices can identify\
    \ patterns, make predictions, and take actions based on the data\ngathered. This\
    \ feature is essential to support IoT applications that require real-time decision\n\
    making, such as smart cities and intelligent transportation systems. The third\
    \ feature is\nreal-time monitoring and management, which means the capability\
    \ to monitor and manage\nelectronic devices. This feature allows IoT devices to\
    \ be monitored and managed from a\ncentral location, which can be very useful\
    \ for large-scale applications, such as industrial\nautomation or smart grid management.\
    \ Swarm intelligence is another feature mentioned,\nwhich means that each IoT\
    \ device can be a node and work with other nodes to create a\nswarm intelligence.\
    \ This feature enables IoT devices to work collaboratively and efﬁciently,\nproviding\
    \ better performance and reliability in complex applications. Quality of service\n\
    (QoS) is also listed as a signiﬁcant feature that 5G can provide in IoT connections.\
    \ With\n5G, IoT devices can experience better connectivity, lower latency, and\
    \ higher throughput,\nwhich can improve the overall QoS and performance of IoT\
    \ applications. In the context\nof IoT connections, QoS refers to the ability\
    \ of the network to provide reliable and high-\nperformance connectivity to IoT\
    \ devices. 5G is a promising technology for IoT connections,\nas it can provide\
    \ several features that can improve the overall QoS and performance of IoT\napplications.\
    \ 5G is designed to provide a signiﬁcantly improved QoS compared to previous\n\
    generations of mobile networks. This is achieved through a combination of advanced\n\
    technologies and features that are built into the 5G standard. One of the key\
    \ features of\n5G that can contribute to a better QoS is the use of advanced radio\
    \ access technologies.\nThese technologies, such as massive MIMO and beamforming,\
    \ allow for more efﬁcient\nuse of the radio spectrum and better signal quality.\
    \ This means that 5G can provide better\nconnectivity and signal strength, which\
    \ can improve the reliability and availability of the\nnetwork. Another important\
    \ feature of 5G that can contribute to a better QoS is the use of\nnetwork slicing.\
    \ Network slicing allows the network to be divided into multiple virtual\nnetworks,\
    \ each tailored to speciﬁc use cases and requirements. This means that different\n\
    applications and services can be given different levels of priority, bandwidth,\
    \ and latency\nrequirements, depending on their needs. This can improve the QoS\
    \ for each individual\napplication and user. In addition, 5G can provide lower\
    \ latency, higher throughput, and\nbetter support for massive IoT deployments,\
    \ all of which can contribute to a better QoS.\nLower latency means that there\
    \ is less delay between the transmission of data and its\nreception, which can\
    \ enable real-time communication and faster response times. Higher\nthroughput\
    \ means that more data can be transmitted over the network in a given time,\n\
    which can improve the performance of applications that require high-bandwidth\
    \ data\ntransfer. Finally, better support for massive IoT deployments means that\
    \ the network can\nhandle a large number of connected devices and data trafﬁc,\
    \ without compromising the\nQoS for individual devices or applications.\nLow latency\
    \ is another feature that 5G can offer, reducing the delay between data\ntransmission\
    \ and reception. This feature is particularly important for applications that\n\
    require immediate decision making, such as autonomous vehicles or remote surgery.\
    \ Cloud\ncomputing is mentioned as a feature that 5G can provide in IoT connections.\
    \ With 5G, IoT\ndevices can connect to the cloud more efﬁciently, and each device\
    \ can use all the resources\nof the cloud, such as storage and processing power.\
    \ This feature can signiﬁcantly improve\nthe performance and scalability of IoT\
    \ applications, especially those that require large\namounts of data processing\
    \ and storage.\nLow latency is particularly important for applications that require\
    \ immediate decision\nmaking, such as autonomous vehicles or remote surgery. With\
    \ 5G, the latency can be\nreduced to as low as one millisecond, which can enable\
    \ real-time communication and\nfaster response times. Furthermore, 5G can provide\
    \ higher throughput, which refers to\nthe amount of data that can be transmitted\
    \ over a network in a given time. With higher\nthroughput, IoT devices can transmit\
    \ and receive larger amounts of data, which can\nimprove the performance of IoT\
    \ applications that require high-bandwidth data transfer,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n\
    28 of 41\nsuch as video streaming or real-time sensor data. Cloud computing is\
    \ another feature\nthat 5G can offer for IoT connections. With 5G, IoT devices\
    \ can connect to the cloud more\nefﬁciently, and each device can use all the resources\
    \ of the cloud, such as storage and\nprocessing power. This feature can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the performance and scalability of\nIoT applications, especially those\
    \ that require large amounts of data processing and storage.\nTable 7. Expectation\
    \ for 5G in IoT.\nFeature\nDescription\nBandwidth\nMore bandwidth to supply applications\
    \ with\nhigh speed.\nAI\nArtiﬁcial intelligence can analyze all the data\ngenerated\
    \ by the IoT devices to take accurate\ndecisions.\nReal-time monitoring and\n\
    management\nThe capability to monitor and manage electronic\ndevices remotely.\n\
    Swarm intelligence\nEach IoT device can be a node, and working with\nother nodes,\
    \ can work as a swarm intelligence.\nQoS\n5G can provide a better QoS in IoT connections.\n\
    Low Latency\n5G reduces the latency, which means that the IoT\ndevices can take\
    \ immediate decisions.\nCloud computing\n5G can provide better connections to\
    \ the cloud,\nwhich means each IoT device can use all the\nresources of the cloud.\n\
    Since smart cities use IoT devices to provide a solution in our daily routine,\
    \ 5G is\nessential in providing a more stable, scalable, and accurate solution,\
    \ with help from other\ntechnologies, such as cloud computing, machine learning,\
    \ and so on. In other words, 5G is\nkey in smart cities because this generation\
    \ optimizes how to transmit and receive data and\nperforms the way to obtain data.\
    \ Based on these data, electronic devices can make accurate\ndecisions after processing.\n\
    Table 8 was divided into parts, in which the ﬁrst part deals exclusively with\
    \ the\ndescription and impact on 5G, and the second part describes cases and ways\
    \ to prevent\nthis interference.\nTable 8. Technologies for the elderly\nInterference\n\
    Description\n5G Impact\nAdjacent Channel\nInterference\nThis occurs when the frequency\
    \ channel of\nour device is overlapped.\nIf we do not have good bandpass ﬁlters,\
    \ there\nwill be interference from nearby frequencies. In\n5G devices, this can\

    \ interference occurs when two\nusers in neighboring cells attempt to use\nthe\
    \ same frequency simultaneously.\nIntra-cell interference occurs when there is\n\
    a simultaneous short-range transmission\nby two BSs, with distortion from the\
    \ user\nand the other equipment in the same cell.\nThis type of interference can\
    \ severely damage 5G\nnetworks because for bases or architectures\nwhere there\
    \ are micro- or macro-cells, the power\nof neighboring signals in both uplink\
    \ and\ndownlink transmission by multiple users can\ninterfere with each other\

    5G Impact\nIntra-Channel and\nInter-Channel\ninterference\nIntra-channel interference\
    \ occurs when\nthere is little power within the macro\nnetwork cell.\nInter-channel\
    \ interference occurs due to the\nproximity of devices when two separate\nfrequencies\
    \ cause interference. As they operate\nat short range, the transmitter of a high-power\n\
    signal causes interference; interference can also\nbe due to the exploration of\
    \ hetnets with OFDM.\nThere are ICI reduction solutions with reverse\nfrequency\
    \ allocation (RFA) employed, which is a\nproactive interference.\nInter-Symbol\n\
    interference\nThis type of interference occurs when one\nor more symbols interfere\
    \ with other\nsymbols.\nIt is caused by phase or amplitude dispersion of\nthe\
    \ channel, which results in signal distortion.\nThis can be clearly seen in OFDMA,\
    \ which\ncauses multipath propagation and impacts\nbandwidth efﬁciency.\nInter-Numerology\n\
    interference\nOccurs when using the numerology system\nfor greater ﬂexibility\
    \ and does not allow\nthe alignment in the time domain to be\nperfect. These misalignments\
    \ or\nimperfections are known as\ninter-numerology interference.\nIn the search\
    \ for higher performance and\nsigniﬁcant bandwidth, using numerology, can\ncause\
    \ interference by having networks with\nmany devices sending signiﬁcant amounts\
    \ of\ninformation, which makes this type of\ninterference more pronounced, affecting\
    \ the\nnetwork’s performance.\nCross-Link\nInterference\nThis type of interference\
    \ occurs when a\ntransmission is made to a neighboring cell\nin different directions\
    \ simultaneously,\neither by arbitrarily overlapping resources\nor by time frequency.\n\
    Cross-link interference can affect 5G networks\ndue to the amount of BS required,\
    \ since incorrect\nhopping can cause performance failures.\nInter-Beam\ninterference\
    \ [99]\nThis occurs when using MIMO technology,\nas this type of array sends RF\
    \ energy in all\ndirections, with the spatial division of the\nmultiple beams\
    \ causing interference.\nAdjacent beams cause this either by the\nsame cell or\
    \ by neighboring cells.\nIt causes interference in applications where\nMIMO antenna\
    \ technology is introduced due to\nthe same usage. When looking for better spectral\n\
    efﬁciency and improvements in network\nperformance, interference from adjacent\
    \ beams\nwithin the same cell or multiple MIMO arrays\nmay negatively inﬂuence\
    \ their neighbors.\nMulti-User\ninterference [100]\nThis occurs when, in MU-MIMO,\
    \ multiple\nusers try to transmit information\nsimultaneously.\nConsidering that\
    \ in 5G, performance and\ninformation forwarding improvements are\nsought, when\
    \ switching to MU-MIMO,\nuncoordinated cells encounter more signiﬁcant\nproblems\
    \ during user management.\nAdjacent Channel\nInterference\nThis occurs when the\
    \ frequency channel of\nthe device is overlapped.\nIf we do not have good bandpass\
    \ ﬁlters, there\nwill be interference from nearby frequencies. In\n5G devices,\
    \ this can have a signiﬁcant impact.\nIt is pertinent to consider how this type\
    \ of interference can affect or impact 5G networks\ntoday, since it must be kept\
    \ in mind with the explosive development of technology. In turn,\nthis can affect\
    \ different 5G architectures, since the main objectives of these networks are\
    \ to\nimprove things such as latency, throughput, transmission speeds, etc.\n\

    in neighboring cells attempt to use the same frequency simultaneously or when\
    \ there is a\nsimultaneous short-range transmission by two base stations in the\
    \ same cell. This type of\ninterference can severely damage 5G networks, particularly\
    \ in architectures where there\nare micro- or macro-cells. Intra-channel and inter-channel\
    \ interference occurs when there\nis little power within the macro network cell,\
    \ though inter-channel interference can also\noccur due to the proximity of devices\
    \ operating at different frequencies. Inter-Symbol inter-\nference occurs when\
    \ one or more symbols interfere with other symbols, resulting in signal\ndistortion\
    \ due to phase or amplitude dispersion of the channel. Inter-Carrier interference\n\
    occurs when the signal is lost due to an offset between the subcarriers, leading\
    \ to large-scale\nor small-scale fading and variations in the received signal.\
    \ Inter-Numerology interference\noccurs when using the numerology system for greater\

    \ interference. Cross-Link Interference occurs\nwhen a transmission is made to\
    \ a neighboring cell in different directions simultaneously,\nleading to performance\
    \ failures. Inter-Beam interference occurs when using MIMO tech-\nnology, with\
    \ the spatial division of the multiple beams causing interference from adjacent\n\
    beams either by the same cell or by neighboring cells. Finally, Multi-User interference\n\
    occurs when multiple users try to transmit information simultaneously, leading\

    \ networks has gained signiﬁcant attention due\nto its potential to revolutionize\
    \ the communication industry. One of the areas where 5G\nnetworks are expected\
    \ to have a substantial impact is the IoT services. This literature\nreview article\
    \ aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of 5G networks on IoT\nservices,\
    \ speciﬁcally examining the issue of interference in this type of network and\
    \ its\nrelated technologies.\nAs a result of new technologies in mobile communications,\
    \ 5G can provide a solution\nin a smart city context. Each IoT device can consume\
    \ a reduced bandwidth, but the problem\narises when the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases. For this reason, it is essential to provide\nhigh beam width for\
    \ better communication between IoT devices.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n31 of 41\n\
    The emergence of 5G networks and Internet of Things services has brought about\n\
    a new era of connectivity and transformation to various industries. With the increasing\n\
    number of connected devices, there is a need for a network that can handle the\
    \ massive\ndata transfer, low latency, and high-speed communication required by\
    \ IoT devices. The\nconvergence of 5G networks and IoT services is expected to\
    \ revolutionize the way devices\ncommunicate with each other and the internet.\
    \ In this section, we will critically discuss the\nrelated impact of network and\
    \ service convergence between 5G networks and IoT services.\nOne of the main beneﬁts\
    \ of the convergence of 5G networks and IoT services is the\nability to support\
    \ massive machine-to-machine communication. The integration of 5G\nnetworks with\
    \ IoT devices creates a seamless connection, allowing devices to communicate\n\
    with each other and the internet at high speeds and low latency. This has signiﬁcant\n\
    implications for industries such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing,\
    \ where\nlarge volumes of data need to be transmitted in real time to enable efﬁcient\
    \ operations. For\ninstance, connected cars, trains, and airplanes can communicate\
    \ with each other and other\nconnected devices in real time, leading to improved\
    \ safety and efﬁciency.\nAnother impact of the convergence of 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services is the creation\nof new business models and revenue streams. With\
    \ the increased speed and capacity of\n5G networks, service providers can offer\
    \ new IoT services such as smart homes, smart\ncities, and smart factories. This\
    \ creates an opportunity for service providers to develop new\nbusiness models\
    \ and revenue streams, such as selling data insights, providing managed\nservices,\
    \ and offering customized solutions. For example, telecom operators can offer\n\
    IoT connectivity as a service, which provides businesses with a cost-effective\
    \ and scalable\nmethod to connect and manage their IoT devices.\nHowever, the\
    \ convergence of 5G networks and IoT services also presents some chal-\nlenges\
    \ that need to be addressed. One of the challenges is the issue of security and\
    \ privacy.\nAs the number of connected devices grows, the potential for cyberattacks\
    \ and data breaches\nalso increases. Therefore, service providers and device manufacturers\
    \ need to work to-\ngether to ensure that IoT devices are secure and comply with\
    \ data protection regulations.\nAdditionally, the convergence of 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services requires signiﬁcant invest-\nments in infrastructure and technology.\
    \ Service providers need to deploy a massive number\nof 5G base stations to enable\
    \ reliable and consistent connectivity for IoT devices.\nThe convergence of 5G\
    \ networks and IoT services has the potential to revolutionize the\nway devices\
    \ communicate with each other and the internet. It has signiﬁcant implications\n\
    for industries such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, creating\
    \ new business\nmodels and revenue streams. However, it also presents challenges\
    \ such as security and\nprivacy concerns and the need for signiﬁcant investments\
    \ in infrastructure and technology.\nTherefore, service providers and device manufacturers\
    \ need to work together to address\nthese challenges and ensure that the convergence\
    \ of 5G networks and IoT services leads to\na safer, more efﬁcient, and connected\
    \ world.\nTable 10 discusses the potential positive and negative impacts of integrating\
    \ 5G\ntechnologies with IoT solutions. The table is divided into three columns,\
    \ including Category,\nContext, and Explanation.\nThe ﬁrst category mentioned\
    \ in the table is Positive, which includes three different\ncontexts. The ﬁrst\
    \ context is Cost Optimization, which refers to the potential cost savings\nassociated\
    \ with integrating 5G technologies with IoT solutions. With the help of data\n\
    gathered by devices, businesses and organizations can optimize their processes,\
    \ leading to\nmore cost-effective solutions. Additionally, data-driven decision\
    \ making allows private\nor public entities to make better decisions. For instance,\
    \ a city can use IoT solutions to\noptimize trafﬁc ﬂow, leading to reduced fuel\
    \ consumption and fewer trafﬁc jams.\nThe second context mentioned in the Positive\
    \ category is Improving QoS, which refers\nto the potential improvement in the\
    \ quality of life for citizens. By providing relevant\ninformation and real-time\
    \ control over public infrastructure, cities can positively impact\ncitizens’\
    \ lives. For example, using IoT solutions, a city can improve security by monitoring\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n32 of 41\npublic spaces and providing real-time alerts\
    \ in case of emergencies. Additionally, cities can\ncreate new economic development\
    \ opportunities fueled by the digitalization era.\nThe third context mentioned\
    \ in the Positive category is Reducing climate change. By\nimplementing IoT solutions\
    \ with 5G technologies, businesses can have closer control over\nindustrial processes\
    \ and real-time analytics regarding relevant environmental properties.\nThis can\
    \ be the next step in becoming a more environmentally friendly society.\nMoving\
    \ onto the Negative category, the table mentions two different contexts. The\n\
    ﬁrst context is Digital Non-Inclusion, which refers to the potential negative\
    \ impact of IoT\nsolutions on regions with less access to technological services,\
    \ while 5G and IoT efforts\ncan improve the quality of life of those cities that\
    \ can afford it, they currently do not offer\ncost-effective solutions for regions\
    \ with less access to technological services.\nThe second context mentioned in\
    \ the Negative category is privacy compromises.\nHaving real-time information\
    \ on assets, people, and any living or non-living organism\nin a region can seriously\
    \ threaten privacy violations. Political or social movements can\nnegatively use\
    \ sensible data related to citizens to perform any action.\nTable 10. Explanation\

    \ for data-driven decision making, allowing\nprivate or public entities to make\
    \ better decisions.\nPositive\nImproving\nQoS\nBy providing relevant information\
    \ and real-time\ncontrol over public infrastructure, citizens will be\npositively\
    \ impacted by reduced trafﬁc, improved\nsecurity, and new economic development\n\

    Negative\nDigital\nNon-Inclusion\nWhile 5G and IoT efforts can improve the quality\
    \ of\nlife of those cities that can afford it, they currently do\nnot offer cost-effective\

    citizens to perform any action.\nFigure 10 discusses the main challenges on 5G\
    \ networks. One of the main challenges\nof 5G networks related to interference,\
    \ IoT devices, and network optimization is the high\ndemand for wireless connectivity\
    \ and data transmission. With the increasing number of\nIoT devices and the exponential\
    \ growth of data usage, 5G networks must be optimized\nto handle the massive amount\
    \ of data transmission while minimizing interference. The\ndeployment of small\
    \ cells and heterogeneous networks is one strategy to increase net-\nwork capacity\
    \ and reduce interference. However, the complexity of network planning,\ndeployment,\
    \ and management increases with the deployment of small cells, which requires\n\
    sophisticated optimization techniques. Additionally, the development of 5G IoT\
    \ devices\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n33 of 41\nwith limited power and processing\
    \ capabilities also presents a challenge. The design of\nlow-power wireless communication\
    \ protocols and efﬁcient resource allocation techniques\nis necessary to optimize\
    \ the performance of IoT devices in 5G networks. 5G networks’\nchallenges related\
    \ to interference, IoT devices, and network optimization require advanced\nsolutions\
    \ and innovative technologies to ensure high-quality wireless connectivity and\n\
    meet the demands of the growing digital ecosystem.\nFigure 10. Challenges of 5G\
    \ networks.\nTable 11 is a representation of the future research challenges in\
    \ 5G that are directly\nrelated to IoT services. It is a ﬁve-column table with\
    \ the following labels for each column:\nFeatures, Advantages, Research Challenges,\
    \ Key Requirements, and Interoperability. The\nFeatures column lists the main\
    \ features that are relevant for IoT services in 5G. In this table,\nthe features\
    \ are IoT Services, Edge Computing, 5G Radio Access, and Network Slicing. The\n\
    Advantages column lists the advantages that 5G can provide to IoT services, for\
    \ example,\nenabling new use cases, reducing latency, providing high data rates,\
    \ and providing cus-\ntomizable networks. The Research Challenges column lists\
    \ the key research challenges that\nneed to be addressed in order to fully realize\
    \ the potential of 5G for IoT services, for exam-\nple, network slicing, security,\
    \ scalability, resource allocation, and spectrum management.\nThe Key Requirements\
    \ column lists the key technical requirements that need to be met in\norder to\
    \ address the research challenges, for example, low latency, high reliability,\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency, and service level agreements. The Interoperability column\
    \ lists the key interoper-\nability issues that need to be addressed in order\
    \ to ensure that different 5G networks and\nIoT devices can work together seamlessly,\
    \ for example, standardization, integration with\nexisting systems, compatibility\
    \ with different technologies, and interoperability between\nnetwork slices.\n\
    Interference can have a signiﬁcant impact on 5G networks, particularly in the\
    \ context\nof Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The large number of IoT devices\
    \ that will be connected\nto 5G networks will inevitably lead to increased interference,\
    \ which can result in degraded\nnetwork performance and poor user experience.\n\
    One of the critical responses to interference in 5G networks is to employ advanced\n\
    signal processing techniques to mitigate the effects of interference. For example,\
    \ beam-\nforming and advanced receiver algorithms can help to reduce interference\
    \ on 5G networks.\nAdditionally, the use of multi-antenna systems and smart antennas\
    \ can improve the quality\nof the received signal and reduce interference.\nAnother\
    \ critical response is to implement interference management protocols that\nenable\
    \ the efﬁcient use of available radio resources. These protocols can help to coordinate\n\
    the use of different channels, reduce interference between neighboring cells,\
    \ and optimize\nthe use of spectrum resources.\nFor instance, the use of small\
    \ cell networks can help to reduce interference by reduc-\ning the distance between\
    \ the transmitter and receiver. In addition, the use of frequency\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 3876\n34 of 41\nreuse techniques, such as fractional frequency reuse, can\
    \ help to mitigate the impact of\ninterference in multi-cell networks.\nTable\

    \ an essential step\ntowards achieving new business opportunities and improving\
    \ connectivity worldwide.\nThe ecosystem of IoT devices is complex, and choosing\
    \ the right primary or complementary\nconnectivity option depends on factors such\
    \ as deployment costs, range, interference,\nand capabilities. Technical studies\
    \ have shown that 5G and other services can coexist in\nspeciﬁc frequency bands,\
    \ provided that the technical conditions are adequately adapted.\nCompliance with\
    \ the permitted exposure limits is also essential when designing new\napplications\
    \ or technological accessories using 5G and IoT.\nThe convergence of networks\
    \ and services, driven by 5G technology, is transforming\nthe internet into a\
    \ complex and multifaceted ecosystem integrated into nearly every aspect\nof our\
    \ daily lives. The availability and speed of access to the internet are increasing,\n\
    allowing users to access high-quality media content in real-time and internet\
    \ service\nproviders to offer a range of new services and applications. Cellular\
    \ connectivity will\nenable the achievement of key IoT goals, such as reducing\
    \ device complexity and cost,\nincreasing coverage to support remote applications,\
    \ and providing deployment ﬂexibility,\nhigh capacity, and long battery life.\n\
    Businesses can beneﬁt greatly from the optimization of network performance in\
    \ 5G\nnetworks, which is essential for adequately functioning business processes,\
    \ improving\nproductivity, reducing downtime, and enhancing customer satisfaction.\
    \ The potential of the\nconvergence of networks and services in increasing the\
    \ availability and speed of access to\nthe internet enables a range of new and\
    \ innovative applications and services, transforming\nthe way we live and work.\n\
    Managing interference in 5G networks is a signiﬁcant challenge in ensuring the\
    \ reli-\nability and performance of IoT services. Effective interference management\

    \ products or services that align with market demand. \nBy delivering value to\
    \ customers through innovative solutions, \npersonalized experiences, and exceptional\
    \ quality, businesses \ncan create a competitive edge and increase their value.\
    \ \n2 \nCompetitive \nEnvironment \nThe competitive landscape plays a significant\
    \ role in business \nvalue creation. Factors such as the number and strength of\
    \ \ncompetitors, industry dynamics, and barriers to entry can \nimpact a company's\
    \ ability to create value. Businesses need to \nassess their competitive position,\
    \ differentiate themselves from \nrivals, and continuously adapt to changes in\
    \ the market to \nmaintain and enhance their value. \n3 \nOperational Efficiency\
    \ \nand Effectiveness \nThe efficiency and effectiveness of a company's operations\
    \ \ndirectly influence its value creation potential. Streamlining \nprocesses,\
    \ \noptimizing \nresource \nallocation, \nimproving \nproductivity, and reducing\
    \ costs can enhance profitability and \ngenerate value. Adopting technologies,\
    \ automation, and best \npractices can help organizations achieve operational\
    \ excellence \nand create a competitive advantage. \n4 \nInnovation and \nDifferentiation\
    \ \nInnovation is a critical driver of business value creation. \nDeveloping new\
    \ products, services, or business models that \nsolve customer problems, meet\
    \ emerging needs, or disrupt \nexisting markets can generate significant value.\
    \ Differentiating \nfrom competitors through unique features, superior quality,\
    \ or \nexceptional customer experiences can also enhance value \ncreation by attracting\
    \ and retaining customers. \n5 \nIntellectual Property \nand Knowledge Assets\
    \ \nIntellectual property (IP) and knowledge assets, such as \npatents, trademarks,\
    \ copyrights, trade secrets, and proprietary \ninformation, can contribute to\
    \ business value creation. \nProtecting and leveraging IP assets effectively can\
    \ provide a \ncompetitive advantage, create barriers to entry, and generate \n\
    revenue through licensing, partnerships, or asset sales. \n6 \nStrategic Partnerships\
    \ \nand Alliances \nCollaborating with other organizations through strategic \n\
    partnerships and alliances can boost value creation. Partnering \nwith suppliers,\
    \ distributors, complementary businesses, or \nresearch institutions can provide\
    \ access to new markets, \ntechnologies, expertise, and resources. Synergies and\
    \ shared \ncapabilities resulting from these collaborations can increase the \n\
    overall value of the business. \n7 \nFinancial Performance \nand Risk Management\
    \ \nThe financial performance of a company is closely linked to its \nvalue creation.\
    \ Achieving sustainable profitability, managing \ncosts and expenses, and effectively\
    \ allocating financial \nresources are crucial. Additionally, managing risks,\
    \ including \nmarket risks, operational risks, regulatory risks, and \nreputational\
    \ risks, is essential to protect and enhance business \nvalue. \n8 \nHuman Capital\
    \ and \nOrganizational Culture \nThe skills, knowledge, creativity, and motivation\
    \ of employees \nsignificantly impact business value creation. Building a \nInternational\

    \ effective communication, and a positive work \nenvironment are also critical\
    \ factors. \n9 \nSocial and \nEnvironmental \nResponsibility \nIn today's business\
    \ landscape, social and environmental \nresponsibility can contribute to business\
    \ value creation. \nDemonstrating ethical practices, sustainability initiatives,\
    \ and \ncorporate citizenship can enhance brand reputation, attract \ncustomers,\
    \ and create long-term value. Addressing societal and \nenvironmental challenges\
    \ proactively can result in positive \nimpacts on the business and its stakeholders.\
    \ \n10 \nRegulatory and Legal \nFactors \nCompliance with applicable laws, regulations,\
    \ and industry \nstandards is essential for maintaining business value. Failure\
    \ to \ncomply can result in penalties, legal disputes, reputational \ndamage,\
    \ and loss of market trust. Staying updated on relevant \nregulations and adapting\
    \ business practices accordingly is \ncrucial for value creation. \n \nThese affecting\
    \ factors interact and influence each other in complex ways for business value\
    \ creation. \nIt is evident that successful businesses carefully analyze these\
    \ factors, adapt their strategies and \noperations accordingly, and continuously\
    \ monitor and evaluate their performance to maximize value \ncreation (Solakis,\

    \ based Value Creation in Business Organizations from \nCustomers Point of view:\
    \  \nWhile technology-based value creation in business organizations offers numerous\
    \ advantages, there \nare also some disadvantages from a customer's point of view.\
    \ Some of the prominent disadvantages \nare listed in Table 17.  \n \nTable 17:\
    \ Disadvantages of technology based value creation from Customers’ point of view\
    \ \nS. \nNo. \nKey Issue \nExplanation \n1 \nLack of Personal \nInteraction \n\
    Technology-driven solutions often lack the personal touch and human \ninteraction\
    \ that customers value. Automated processes, self-checkouts, \nand chatbots may\
    \ replace face-to-face interactions with employees, \nleading to a sense of impersonality.\
    \ Some customers may prefer the \nwarmth and personal attention that comes from\
    \ direct human \ninteraction. \n2 \nTechnical Issues \nand Dependence \nCustomers\
    \ may encounter technical issues when relying on technology-\nbased value creation.\
    \ System failures, website crashes, or connectivity \nproblems can disrupt the\
    \ customer experience and lead to frustration. \nMoreover, customers become increasingly\
    \ dependent on technology \nand may feel helpless or inconvenienced when it fails.\
    \ \n3 \nPrivacy and Data \nSecurity \nConcerns \nCustomers may have concerns about\
    \ their privacy and the security of \ntheir personal information when engaging\
    \ with technology-driven \nsolutions. Sharing personal data online raises worries\
    \ about data \nbreaches, unauthorized access, or misuse of information. Customers\
    \ \nmay be hesitant to provide their data or engage with businesses they \nperceive\
    \ as not adequately protecting their privacy. \n4 \nInformation \nOverload and\
    \ \nDecision Fatigue \nThe vast amount of information available through technology\
    \ can \noverwhelm customers. With numerous options, reviews, and \nrecommendations,\
    \ customers may struggle to make confident \ndecisions. The abundance of choices\
    \ and information can lead to \ndecision fatigue, making it challenging for customers\
    \ to choose the best \nproduct or service that aligns with their preferences.\
    \ \n5 \nLack of Control \nand Autonomy \nTechnology-driven solutions may limit\
    \ customer control and autonomy \nin certain situations. For example, self-checkout\
    \ systems in retail stores \neliminate the interaction with a cashier but also\
    \ remove the ability to \nask questions or receive immediate assistance. Some\
    \ customers may \nprefer having more control and the ability to interact with\
    \ \nknowledgeable staff. \n6 \nDigital \nExclusion and \nAccessibility \nBarriers\
    \ \nNot all customers have equal access to technology or possess the digital \n\
    skills necessary to fully engage with technology-driven solutions. \nDigital exclusion\
    \ can result from limited internet connectivity, lack of \naccess to devices,\
    \ or insufficient technological literacy. This creates \nbarriers for customers,\
    \ limiting their ability to benefit from technology-\nbased value creation. \n\
    7 \nStandardization \nand Lack of \nUniqueness \nTechnology-driven \nsolutions\
    \ \noften \nprioritize \nefficiency \nand \nstandardization, which may lead to\
    \ a lack of uniqueness in the customer \nexperience. Automated processes and templates\
    \ can make interactions \nwith businesses feel impersonal and generic. Customers\
    \ may long for \npersonalized experiences and a sense of individuality that may\
    \ be \ndiminished by technology-driven standardization. \nInternational Journal\
    \ of Applied Engineering and Management \nLetters (IJAEML), ISSN: 2581-7000, Vol.\

    \ www.srinivaspublication.com \nPAGE 272 \n \n \n \n8 \nSocial \nDisconnect and\
    \ \nIsolation \nRelying heavily on technology can contribute to social disconnect\
    \ and \nfeelings of isolation among customers. Increased screen time and \nvirtual\
    \ interactions may replace face-to-face human connections, \nimpacting social\
    \ well-being. Some customers may crave authentic, in-\nperson experiences and\
    \ genuine social interactions that technology \ncannot fully replicate. \n9 \n\
    Learning Curve \nand \nTechnological \nBarriers \nCustomers may encounter challenges\
    \ in adapting to new technologies \nand platforms. User interfaces, complex features,\
    \ or unfamiliar \nprocesses can create a learning curve. Technological barriers\
    \ can limit \naccess and create frustrations, particularly for customers who are\
    \ less \ntech-savvy or have limited exposure to digital tools. \n10 \nInequality\
    \ and \nSocioeconomic \nDivides \nTechnology-based \nvalue \ncreation \ncan \n\
    exacerbate \nexisting \nsocioeconomic divides. Customers with limited access to\
    \ technology or \ndigital skills may be left behind, unable to fully benefit from\
    \ the \nconvenience and opportunities provided by technology. This can \nperpetuate\
    \ inequalities and create a digital divide between different \ncustomer segments.\
    \ \n \nThus, technology-based value creation in business organizations brings\
    \ about disadvantages for \ncustomers, including a lack of personal interaction,\
    \ technical issues, privacy concerns, information \noverload, limited control,\
    \ digital exclusion, standardization, social disconnect, learning barriers, and\
    \ \nsocioeconomic divides. Recognizing and addressing these disadvantages is important\
    \ for businesses \nto ensure inclusive and customer-centric approaches to technology\
    \ implementation. \n \n8.8 Disadvantages of Technology based Value creation in\
    \ Business Organizations from \nOrganizations Point of view: \nWhile technology-based\
    \ value creation in business organizations offers numerous benefits, there are\
    \ \nalso some disadvantages from an organizational point of view. Some of the\
    \ prominent disadvantages \nare listed in Table 18.  \n \nTable 18: Disadvantages\
    \ of technology based value creation from Organizational point of view \nS. \n\
    No. \nKey Issue \nExplanation \n1 \nHigh Initial \nInvestment Costs \nImplementing\
    \ technology-driven solutions often requires a significant \nupfront investment.\
    \ Businesses need to invest in hardware, software, \ninfrastructure upgrades,\
    \ and employee training. The costs associated \nwith acquiring and implementing\
    \ technology can strain the \norganization's budget, particularly for small or\
    \ resource-constrained \nbusinesses. \n2 \nComplexity and \nIntegration \nChallenges\
    \ \nAdopting new technologies can be complex and challenging for \norganizations.\
    \ Integration with existing systems and processes can be a \ntime-consuming and\
    \ complicated task. The need to reconfigure \nworkflows and align technology with\
    \ business objectives may disrupt \noperations and require significant effort\
    \ to ensure seamless integration. \n3 \nDependency on \nTechnology and \nVulnerability\
    \ \nOverreliance on technology can create vulnerability for organizations. \n\
    Technical failures, cyber-attacks, or system outages can bring \noperations to\
    \ a halt, resulting in financial losses and reputational \ndamage. Organizations\
    \ need contingency plans and backup systems to \nmitigate risks and minimize disruptions\
    \ caused by technology failures. \n4 \nSkills Gap and \nWorkforce \nReskilling\
    \ \nTechnology-driven solutions often require specialized skills and \nexpertise.\
    \ Organizations may face challenges in finding employees with \nthe necessary\
    \ technical knowledge or may need to invest in reskilling \nexisting employees.\
    \ Bridging the skills gap can be time-consuming and \ncostly, especially if the\
    \ technology landscape rapidly evolves. \nInternational Journal of Applied Engineering\

    \ \nPAGE 273 \n \n \n \n5 \nData Privacy and \nSecurity Risks \nThe collection,\
    \ storage, and processing of customer data present \nsignificant privacy and security\
    \ risks. Organizations must invest in \nrobust cybersecurity measures and comply\
    \ with data protection \nregulations to protect sensitive information. Failure\
    \ to safeguard \ncustomer data can result in legal liabilities, financial penalties,\
    \ and \nreputational damage. \n6 \nResistance to \nChange and \nEmployee \nMorale\
    \ \nIntroducing technology-based solutions may face resistance from \nemployees\
    \ who fear job displacement or feel overwhelmed by new \ntechnologies. Resistance\
    \ to change can impact employee morale, job \nsatisfaction, and productivity.\
    \ Organizations need to manage change \neffectively, provide adequate training\
    \ and support, and communicate \nthe benefits of technology adoption to gain employee\
    \ buy-in. \n7 \nSystem \nComplexity and \nMaintenance \nAdopting technology-driven\
    \ solutions often leads to increased system \ncomplexity. Multiple software applications,\
    \ integrations, and \ndependencies can make it challenging to manage and maintain\
    \ the \ntechnology infrastructure. Regular updates, troubleshooting, and \ntechnical\
    \ support are necessary to ensure smooth operations, which can \nstrain IT resources\
    \ and budgets. \n8 \nOveremphasis on \nEfficiency over \nHuman \nInteraction \n\
    Technology-driven solutions may prioritize efficiency and automation, \npotentially\
    \ diminishing the importance of human interaction. \nCustomers may feel disconnected\
    \ or frustrated when they cannot access \npersonalized assistance or when their\
    \ interactions are solely with \nautomated systems. This can impact customer satisfaction\
    \ and loyalty. \n9 \nRapid \nTechnological \nObsolescence \nTechnology evolves\
    \ at a rapid pace, making investments in technology \nsusceptible to obsolescence.\
    \ Businesses must continually monitor and \nassess emerging technologies to remain\
    \ competitive. Outdated \ntechnology can become a hindrance, requiring additional\
    \ investments \nto upgrade or replace systems. \n10 \nEthical \nConsiderations\
    \ \nand Social \nImpact \nTechnology-based value creation can raise ethical considerations\
    \ and \nimpact society at large. Organizations must navigate the potential \n\
    consequences of their technological choices, such as the impact on \nemployment,\
    \ privacy, and social equity. Failing to address these ethical \nconsiderations\
    \ can lead to backlash from customers, employees, and the \npublic. \n \nThus,\
    \ technology-based value creation in business organizations brings about disadvantages\
    \ from an \norganizational point of view, including high initial investment costs,\
    \ complexity and integration \nchallenges, dependency and vulnerability, skills\
    \ gap, data privacy and security risks, resistance to \nchange, system complexity\
    \ and maintenance, overemphasis on efficiency, rapid technological \nobsolescence,\
    \ and ethical considerations [298]. Understanding and effectively managing these\
    \ \ndisadvantages is crucial for organizations to maximize the benefits of technology\
    \ and mitigate \npotential drawbacks [299]. \n9. CONCLUSION :   \nThe role of\
    \ twelve ICCT Underlying Technologies including AI, Blockchain, Business intelligence,\
    \ \nCloud computing, Cyber security, 3D printing, IoT, Quantum computing, Mobile\
    \ marketing, \nInformation storage technology, Ubiquitous education technology,\
    \ and VR & AR for Business Value \nCreation like Innovation and Differentiation,\
    \ Customer focus, Operational efficiency, Strategic \nPartnerships and Alliances,\
    \ Talent Management, Effective Marketing and Branding, Financial \nPerformance\
    \ and Growth, Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, and Adaptability\
    \ and \nAgility are discussed. The advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages\
    \ of Technologies based \nValue creation from various stakeholders’ point of view\
    \ are analysed. The impact of ICCT underlying \ntechnologies on business value\
    \ creation in organizations are also determined using relevant \ninformation collection\
    \ & evaluation. New knowledge and interpretation are presented on how to create\
    \ \nbusiness value for long time sustainability by organizations in every industry.\

    We are traversing the growing emerging technology paradigms in today’s advanced
    technological world. In this present era, the

    Internet of Things (IoT) is extensively used in all sectors. IoT is the ecosystem
    of smart devices which contains sensors, smart

    objects, networking, and processing units. These integrated devices provide better
    services to the end user. IoT is impacting our

    environment and is becoming one of the most popular technologies. The leading
    use of IoT in human life is to track activities

    anywhere at any time. The utmost utilities achieved by IoT applications are decision-making
    and monitoring for eﬃcient and

    eﬀective management. In this paper, an extensive literature review on IoT has
    been done using the systematic literature review

    (SLR) technique. The main focus areas include commercial, environmental, healthcare,
    industrial, and smart cities. The issues

    related to the IoT are also discussed in detail. The purpose of this review is
    to identify the major areas of applications, diﬀerent

    popular architectures, and their challenges. The various IoT applications are
    compared in accordance with technical features

    such as quality of service and environmental evaluation. This study can be utilized
    by the researchers to understand the

    concept of IoT and provides a roadmap to develop strategies for their future research
    work.

    1. Introduction

    Kevin Ashton suggested the term IoT in the year 1999, but

    before that actual idea of connecting devices had been used

    since the later 1970s. At that time, this idea was called

    “embedded Internet or pervasive computing” [1]. IoT is a

    combination of interrelated computing devices that can

    transfer data over a network without human intervention.

    In the past few years, the Internet of things (IoT) has been

    sniggling in all areas of human life, such as hospitals, agricul-

    ture, the environment, industries, smart homes, and smart

    cities [2–7]. IoT improves daily life and eases the data

    production/consumption processes [8]. Smart devices are

    being used in the various applications and instruments oper-

    ated in the IoT environment [9]. Increasing human desires

    give rise to innovative applications for automating, manag-

    ing, and monitoring activities [10–12].

    Additionally, IoT applications enabled with cloud com-

    puting promote proper composite services by merging cur-

    rent service applications [13, 14]. In diﬀerent areas and

    activities, these smart devices help users to complete their

    day-to-day activities [15, 16]. Moreover, many applications

    enabled with IoT help the user to select the best prospects

    from environmental cloud resources in managing, deci-

    sion-making, and monitoring [17]. The motivation behind

    all the applications of diﬀerent domains common shared

    objective is to enhance the quality of life by providing intel-

    ligent and smart services [18, 19]. Achieving quality of ser-

    vice (QoS) metrics is the core apprehension of using

    applications based on IoT. Cost, reliability, security, avail-

    ability, energy consumption, and service time are some of

    the QoS metrics which should be properly addressed by

    the smart applications and services based on IoT to fulﬁll

    the requirements of the users [20–23].

    The use of the Internet within the last 20 years brought

    numerous beneﬁts to all individuals as well as organizations.

    In real time, perhaps the foremost important beneﬁt is the

    capability to consume and yield services and data. Currently,

    the IoT is likely to bring equivalent beneﬁts to daily things,

    providing us a chance to change the surrounding environ-

    ment and to expand our perception as well as our ability.

    IoT brings new prospects further than automation by merg-

    ing it with machine learning algorithms [24], further making

    it easy for managers, policymakers, and owners for decisions

    planning.

    Conventional areas of embedded systems, control sys-

    tems, wireless sensor networks, and all others contribute to

    enabling the IoT. In the consumer industry, IoT technology

    is mostly associated with products that help common eco-

    systems and can be controlled by devices linked to that, such

    as smart speakers, smartphones, thermostats, lighting ﬁx-

    tures, home security systems, and other home appliances.

    There are several serious concerns, particularly privacy and

    security, and thus, researchers are working to address these

    concerns. Using “asymmetry” and “symmetry” properties,

    IoT-based wide-ranging smart systems have become most

    eﬃcacious and eﬃcient. Many researchers, industry people,

    and academicians are presently working on IoT technologies

    to develop advanced systems. There are many studies on IoT

    reviews, but currently, there is no study available that

    focuses on IoT applications in a systematic manner.

    Internet of Things is becoming more popular than any

    other existing technology, such as the SCADA system. Basi-

    cally, SCADA allows humans to interact remotely with a

    process, whereas IoT is generally used as a machine-to-

    machine communication tool.

    The primary goal of this study is to conduct a survey on

    various IoT applications to better understand the variety of

    techniques that have recently been oﬀered in IoT applica-

    tions. Commercial, healthcare, smart city, environmental

    monitoring, industrial, and general aspects are among the

    initial applications of IoT which have been targeted in this

    article. SLR is used to overview the opportunities of IoT

    applications.

    The following are the important outcomes of this study:

    (i) Creating a technological taxonomy to categorize

    diﬀerent IoT applications

    (ii) Discuss the various popular IoT architectures

    (iii) Provides the futuristic scope to identify the applica-

    tions, problems, and their solutions

    This paper is arranged according to systematic literature

    review methods and provides an overview of IoT opportuni-

    ties, applications, and challenges. This paper is divided into

    the following sections: Section 2 represents the related work

    in the ﬁeld of IoT. Section3 provides the sectional techniques

    for research articles and the SLR method. Section 4 presents

    the application areas of IoT. Section 5 describes the chal-

    lenges in IoT, Section 6 provides the answers to the SLR

    questions, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

    2. Literature Review

    This section provides an overview of associated work in IoT

    applications. Mukherjee et al. [25] proposed an Internet of

    Health Things (IoHT) focused on fog computing for both

    outdoor and indoor scenarios. The weighted majority game

    theory has been applied in outdoor and indoor regions to

    pick a fog system. This reduces the energy consumption

    requirements, average waiting time, and average jitter rela-

    tive to the current cloud-only healthcare network. The fog

    computing-based system has reduced the energy consump-

    tion, average delay, and average jitter by approximately by

    15%, 20%, and 15%, respectively, than the existing cloud-

    only healthcare system.

    Gushev [26] introduced the dew computing architecture

    for cyber-physical systems, elaborated on the features func-

    tionalities, and compared it to other related architectures.

    Figure 1 shows the architecture of dew computing and con-

    cludes that the impact of dew computing architecture is

    high. The independence and collaboration feature and add-

    ing autonomy make them unique from the conventional

    edge computing system.

    Agyemang et al. [27] proposed a lightweight real-time

    algorithm that enables the identiﬁcation of rogue access

    points for embedded IoT devices. The advantage of this

    technique is that when an attacker clones the channel and

    SSID of a legitimate AP, it will detect rogue access points

    and deauthenticate, and clients will be unable to connect to

    either the rogue or legitimate access point. Kounoudes and

    Kapitsaki [28] discussed the state-of-the-art insight into

    how these features are treated. The authors introduced four

    user privacy challenges in GDPR: (a) discrimination, proﬁl-

    ing, and inference; (b) con-text-sensitive sharing of identity

    and control; (c) uncertainty and consent; and (d) trust,

    transparency, and honesty.

    Karanja et al. [29] suggested an approach for the study

    and classiﬁcation of IoT malware using Haralick’s image

    2

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

    texture features and machine learning classiﬁers, namely, K

    -nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Random

    Forest (RF). On each of the extracted images, the gray level

    cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) has been computed. Uddin

    et al. [30] introduced a blockchain leveraged decentralized

    e-Health architecture for deploying multiple instances of

    software patient agent at three layers like sensing, near pro-

    cessing, and FAR processing layer on 5G architecture.

    Verma et al. [31] proposed an IoT application protocol con-

    gestion control algorithm for swiftly adapting the transmis-

    sion rate to network conditions. It has been found that a

    combination of TCP variants based on loss and delay can

    give a better solution. This method is well suited for the

    MQTT protocol for IoT applications that works for light-

    weight smart home appliances, smart city monitoring sys-

    tems, healthcare providers, and sensors that communicate

    to the server via a satellite connection.

    Shukla et al. [32] implemented a scalable outlier detector

    that uses hierarchical clustering in combination with the

    neural network. Hierarchical clustering gives the outlier

    detector scalability by ﬁnding associated sensors. For diﬀer-

    ent attack strengths, the simulation results have more than

    90% accuracy, and the model parameter can be tuned

    according to the application requirement. Alli and Alam

    [33] surveyed the fog-edge computing for solutions pro-

    posed in studies involving IoT-fog-cloud ecosystems and

    predicted future growth patterns and raised open issues of

    the fog cloud of things and concluded that fogging oﬀers a

    forum for providing services between resource-constrained

    and latency-sensitive connected devices. Jiao et al. [34] ana-

    lyzed the resource scheduling to optimize the time-averaged

    network performance for uplink IoT systems based on

    OFDMA. An optimization problem has been solved by using

    the Lyapunov optimization theory and the Lagrangian tech-

    nique of dual decomposition. An algorithm, known as

    TORS, has been developed that can arbitrarily move the

    device throughput close to the optimum without any prior

    knowledge of the CSI. Yin et al. [35] suggested a model for

    the two-vehicle partnership scenario, considering the cir-

    cumstance of the evolving emergence. A bidding system

    enables vehicles to contribute their services, and the activi-

    ties are arranged accordingly for those vehicles. A new

    time-window-based method was designed to manage the

    tasks between vehicles and enable the vehicles to participate

    and then establish a blockchain system to protect the

    exchange of information through the smart contract.

    Chen et al. [36] focused on the request scheduling prob-

    lem. An online algorithm, RSRP, has been used to reduce the

    expense of the program when the queuing delay was associ-

    ated. RSRP can get a close-to-optimal system cost and make

    an arbitrary trade-oﬀ between system cost and the backlog of

    queues. Results from the simulation show that RSRP can

    eﬀectively reduce the expense of the program and keep the

    queue backlog down. Rizvi et al. [37] evaluated the attack

    surface for networks using IoT devices to estimate the risks

    of new IoT devices being deployed while oﬀering a way of

    deﬁning potential solutions. The IoT architecture has several

    zones, as shown in Figure 2.

    Fu et al. [38] maximized the energy eﬃciency of the sys-

    tem through cooperative computing in IoT networks based

    on blockchain and divided the program into data collection,

    database processing, processing for network optimization,

    and data transmission parts based on the optimization

    model considering power consumption in each segment

    using geometric programming method to maximize system

    energy eﬃciency. Chen et al. [39] proposed a quality-driven,

    auction-based incentive system based on a blockchain con-

    sortium that guarantees trust in both on-chain and oﬀ-

    chain data. A safe problem with data sharing for an IoV

    allowed by blockchain to optimize social welfare. The

    tamper-resistant consortium blockchain was implemented

    to tackle the on-chain data protection issue. The proposed

    algorithm performed better in both social welfare and com-

    putation time.

    Duan et al. [40] suggested a JointRec system for the deep

    learning of mobile app video recommendations and intro-

    duced a federal recommendation strategy to cooperatively

    improve the weight of training for each distributed model

    of cloud trains based on local data. The model was validated

    on the real-world dataset, and the experimental results

    showed the eﬀectiveness of the approach. Asheralieva and

    Niyato [41] introduced an unregulated hierarchy RL and

    profound educational background for a stochastic Stackel-

    berg game with incomplete knowledge from many partici-

    pants. This game formed the interactions between the IoT

    system leaders and partners with the help of BaaS-MEC

    and developed the hierarchical RL algorithm based on the

    MDP and POMDP models of the BSs and peers’ decisions.

    Chen et al. [42] introduced a time-conscious SIoT object

    model by bringing together the temporal eﬀect of contact

    with user objects and the social resemblance of smart

    objects. The proposed model exploits usage events of the

    user object to uncover the user’s preference over time with

    a latent probabilistic model. The experimental results over

    the real SIoT test bed show that the proposed method per-

    forms better than the existing one. Li et al. [43] studied the

    satellite-IoT system age-optimal redundancy problem. The

    optimum redundancy allocation issues were characterized

    by a minimum of the average age under a given error prob-

    ability. The result shows that, at the explicit threshold of the

    propagation delay below, the IR-HARQ scheme is beneﬁcial.

    Liao et al. [44] proposed a multiuser authentication

    framework for PHY coindividuals to simultaneously identify

    high-end devices at low costs by integrating deep neural net-

    works with DNN-based authentication methods and check-

    ing the eﬃciency of authentication of PHY in the two typical

    IoT scenarios, OATS, and automotive factories. Pyoung and

    Baek [45] developed the LiTiChain blockchain with a ﬁnite

    lifetime, scalable, lightweight architecture. LiTiChain can

    easily delete obsolete transactions and blocks. Two graphs

    are incorporated into the LiTiChain structure: a tree that

    represents the expiry order and a linear graph that shows

    the order in which blocks are formed and concludes that

    construction not only maintains the chain continuity of

    block deletions but also helps preserve the block height of

    the shortened chain.

    Lohachab et al. [46] discussed IoT’s layered architecture

    along with the associated challenges and countermeasures.

    The IoT layered architecture with associated challenges,

    existing countermeasures, and the concept of quantum cryp-

    tography is shown in Figure 3.

    Perez et al. [47] suggested a compact EDHOC in which

    security parameter negotiation was derived from the core

    protocol. It does a comprehensive evaluation using IoT

    hardware and simulation tools as well as providing end-to-

    end security properties. The tests showed that EDHOC-

    based recommendations were an accessible and reliable solu-

    tion for the setup of an IoT-restricted security association.

    Qin et al. [48] implemented a revolutionary Green IoT Gate-

    way (GIG) to reduce gateway energy usage while maintain-

    ing a cross-interface partnership to ensure a clear system

    delay requirement. While using coexisting ZigBee powerful

    radios, GIG programs the wake-up actions of powerful Wi-

    Fi radios for energy-eﬃcient and time-bound D2G commu-

    nications. The ﬁndings show that GIG’s energy usage is

    38.5% and 12.7% lower than that of the most state-of-the-

    art Wi-Fi communication system.

    Li et al. [49] analyzed the swarm decision table in con-

    trast with the conventional decision-making tree by intro-

    ducing a new incremental learning model. A simulation

    was tested with an empirical dataset of energy consumption

    representing a typical IoT-linked BEDP scenario, and the

    SDT showed superior accuracy and time, and the results

    demonstrate it as the suited machine learner in the fog com-

    puting environment. Biswas et al. [50] presented a light-

    weight proof of block and trade (PoBT) IoT blockchain

    consensus algorithm and its integration structure. This

    approach allowed both trading and blocks with reduced cal-

    culation time to be validated. A system that reduces the

    memory demands of IoT nodes, security aspects review

    and assessment, calculation time, memory, and bandwidth

    requirements indicated substantial improvements in the

    overall device performance.

    Alrawahi et al. [51] proposed a trading strategy for CoT

    resources consisting of a multiattribute classiﬁcation model

    for trade priorities and business architecture. The CoT appli-

    cation development and hardware development require CoT

    resources to be considered commodities. Experimental eval-

    uation validates the device’s performance. An assessment

    was made of optimum resource prices, supplier lock-in,

    resource utilization, and provider beneﬁt.

    Lei et al. [52] introduced a group chain decentralized

    distributed blockchain with a 2-chain fog network frame-

    work for IoT services and concluded that the leader group’s

    employability decreases consensus, including transactions

    and approval time, and leaders of a leading group are

    dynamically and publicly elected through a transparent

    PoW. Wang et al. [53] suggested a new method of learning

    to solve CAS. Many heterogeneous PER data were used in

    contrast to traditional CAS risk values to produce a strong

    predictive clinical risk model that depends on a small risk

    factor.

    Diro et al. [54] proposed an authenticated encryption

    scheme for a resource-restricted IoT setting based on the

    publishing subscribe protocol. The system used a fog node

    as an intermediate broker, to collect real-time data on the

    workforce, devices, and parts associated with the task by

    adopting RFID and 2D data matrix code for identifying

    unexpected events.

    Hu et al. [55] designed an IoT-based monitoring system.

    The collective management of the task’s series, worker

    assignment, logistics preparation, and management take

    place when disruptions occur. The experimental ﬁndings

    had demonstrated a reduction in component and tool distri-

    bution defects, quality problems, and halt time to improve

    the eﬃciency and eﬀective assembly of the turbine.

    Cetinkaya et al. [56] introduced an IoMIMO that envi-

    sions an autonomous architecture that adopts single and

    double hop energy transitions as well as data transitions so

    that energy sharing and data traﬃc on networks can be eﬃ-

    cient. Hybrid access points (HAPs) are conducted in single

    hops, whereas unmanaged aerial vehicles (UAVs) utilize

    double-hop relays. The HAPs handle energy and data with

    multiple-inputs multiple-outputs (MIMOs) as well as man-

    age transfers network components.

    Wu et al. [57] studied the wireless resource planning

    schedules of the MEC in IIoT by jointly optimizing wireless

    transmission, data storage, disposal, and oﬄoading. The

    total device usefulness consisting of outputs, resources, and

    data age was maximized. A new online algorithm was devel-

    oped with the Lyapunov optimization technique as an

    asymptotic optimization for the control of the diﬃcult

    query.

    Yuan et al. [58] provided a low complexity algorithm

    that needs no prior knowledge. Simulation results veriﬁed

    the eﬀective detection of user activity and an estimate of

    CSIs between users and access points (APs) by the algo-

    rithm. A two-stage dynamic clustering for synchronized

    multipoint transmission using broad-scale fading (LSF)

    information to fulﬁll the requirements of heavy-cargo users

    for the throughput after UAD and CE had been used.

    Wan et al. [59] developed an IoT authentication node

    model to increase Internet-to-roaming device security

    authentication. The authentication protocol uses the remote

    server for authentication on the roaming system in the local

    and remote areas, which raises the complexity of malicious

    nodes targeting or infecting multiple network areas. The

    security analysis indicated that the protocol protects from

    multiple network attacks and the protocol has a lower

    energy burden and authentication delay.

    Souri et al. [60] implemented behavioral modeling of a

    multilayer perceptron (MLP) and particle swarm optimiza-

    tion (PSO) algorithm for a hybrid machine learning-based

    error prediction model. The developed behavioral models

    5

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

    were mapped into the LATS to evaluate behavioral models,

    and the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model examiner

    was used. Qureshi et al. [61] suggested the SACBR protocol

    to allow the Cluster Heads (CH) to interact with other CHs.

    Every node of vehicles starts a self-evaluation approach

    based on more suitable routing metrics and selects the CH

    for each cluster and then collects data from the member

    nodes and transmits the data to other CHs. The CH man-

    ages its data transmission mechanism and its member

    nodes. Compared with the aggregation method, every node

    exchanges its data with the one-hop neighbor. Compared

    to the latest protocols, the experimental results showed a

    better performance of SACBR.

    Yao et al. [62] explained the limitations of the manual

    labeling of traditional image matching technology. For solv-

    ing this problem, a content-based medical image retrieval

    technique was used. The technique uses the visual attributes

    of the image to set the feature index to adopt CNN (Convo-

    lutional Neural Network) for sparse connectivity and weight

    sharing. Liu et al. [63] suggested an authentication scheme

    for a secure multifactor client, which requires the user iden-

    tity, the password, and the client-server authenticated bio-

    metrics, which is a hidden key and is associated with key

    agreements chosen on the chaotic map because the size of

    the map is smaller and the computing overhead is lower.

    Medina et al. [64] introduced a simple, adaptable, low-

    cost IoT system that allows viewing in graphical form on

    the website and the real-time temperature and humidity.

    When the temperature or moisture exceeds, the systems

    send a message to a mobile application. The temperature

    can be manually monitored in the data center based on the

    monitoring results. Results established the best location to

    position the sensors in the data center for temperature and

    humidity monitoring.

    Lu et al. [65] proposed an IoMT health knowledge

    exchange scheme. The scheme allowed access for the approved

    users. The software also allowed for eﬀective completeness

    checking by preventing the installation of corrupted data by

    users. From the results of tests and the study of reliability, it

    has been concluded that the program is more cost-eﬃcient

    and reliable in the sharing of health data.

    Shammari et al. [66] examined the latency of service

    embedding in the IoT network to reduce the energy traﬃc.

    The services are to be incorporated by a data topology (data

    nodes and associations) according to an SOA paradigm-

    determined business process workﬂow. The multitarget opti-

    mization demonstrates the ability to optimize the integration

    of BPs for both energy savings and traﬃc latencies with a

    high optimal level of 91%.

    Liang et al. [67] used UAV as the main mobile network

    of the next generation to intermittently connect IoT devices

    and to promote data collection based on the DTN protocol.

    A Hilbert curve-based route planning algorithm decided the

    UAV ﬂight direction and validated the eﬀectiveness of the

    method in a network emulation environment with a series

    of quantitative experiments and conﬁrmed its beneﬁts com-

    pared to several baseline approaches.

    Hu et al. [68] suggested a high-level structure, namely,

    Things2Vec. In Things2Vec, the graph to model the

    sequence of feature relationships by the interaction of things

    was formed. Since these relationship series were heteroge-

    neous, a partial random walking process is tailored to cap-

    ture node neighborhoods with diﬀerent types of semantic

    relationships. Extensive experiments were performed, and

    ﬁndings showed that the proposed approach eﬀectively cap-

    tures semantical connections between context-conscious IoT

    data. He et al. [69] explored the question of fog preparation

    by analyzing total CAPEX, OPEX, and energy usage when

    the IoT tasks were given with scheduled. To meet IoT tasks

    timely and mobility requirements, two ILP models were pro-

    posed to minimize total cost and energy consumption.

    Yao et al. [70] studied a heterogeneous IoT network of

    UAV-assisted downlinks consisting of macrocells and

    energy-saving IoTTs in the 3D space delivery models for

    the UAV swarms, MBSs, and IoTTs. The possible transmis-

    sion of energy-constrained IoT’s beneﬁts from the one-slot

    and two-slot charging. The optimization of IoTT density

    maximizes energy eﬃciency. Network transmission and

    energy eﬃciency are distinguished both by the eﬀect of the

    association factor and by the transmission power of the

    active IoTTs. Ti et al. [71] contrasted the performance of

    seven DSSE systems, including SPS, NPG, KPR, SPS, HK,

    CJJJ, and the new DSSE system called HDSSE. The devel-

    oped scheme has its advantages and inconveniences from

    the results of the experiments. If only speed is measured,

    then HK is very good for ﬁle search adds and deletes. How-

    ever, also certain considerations need to be taken when con-

    trasting security programs. Some users need a higher degree

    of protection to avoid unauthorized access to sensitive

    information.

    Tan et al. [72] proposed a multiradio multichannel

    deterministic transmission scheme. A combined multichan-

    nel, multislot scheduling problem has been developed for the

    tree hybrid topology of network monitoring. A lightweight,

    pseudopolynomial time transmission scheduling scheme

    has been proposed based on the greedy strategy. The heuris-

    tic algorithm achieves the optimum result under a topology

    hybrid tree. The experimental results illustrated that the pro-

    posed method has a lower packet loss rate and transmission

    delay compared to the traditional transmission scheme.

    Yang et al. [73] suggested a new architecture for the

    delivery of hierarchical machine learning (ML) tasks for

    industrial IoT based on mobile edge computing (MEC). It

    was presumed to be carried out in a MEC environment

    where devices were restricted in computation while the

    MEC server was full of computation resources. Therefore,

    a small ML model for the system and a deep ML model for

    the MEC server were pretrained oﬄine with historical data.

    The growing unit must determine the part of the tasks to

    be downloaded to reduce the processing time. As communi-

    cations and ML computing cause data processing delays and

    errors, the overall delays are subject to the ML model com-

    plexity, inference error rate, data quality, and MEC server

    computing capacities.

    Liu et al. [74] investigated a method for free coding con-

    trol to achieve ultralow latency communications for both

    slow and quickly fading channels and compared the method

    of coding-free control and the traditional method of coding-

    based control numerically and found that the coding-free

    method is superior in a realistic range of signal to noise

    ratios. Fan et al. [75] used a wearable interface simulation

    system for the identiﬁcation of human body attitude. The

    human phase period was divided along with the force anal-

    ysis. It was not only possible to divide step position but also

    to determine the position of the still posture. The study and

    work of the human posture were carried out using the accel-

    eration module and FFT transformation.

    Farivar et al. [76] suggested a hybrid intelligent classical

    control approach for a nonlinear n-order CPS model while

    cyber-attacks were conducted only on the front channel.

    The neural network (NN) was developed as a smart attack

    assessment estimator and was built to compensate for

    attacks and regulate system output in tracking applications

    through a traditional nonlinear control system centered on

    a variable structure control process. Nonlinear control theo-

    ries were incorporated into the proposed strategy to main-

    tain system stability when attacks take place. Neural

    network has been used as a Gaussian radial base to estimate

    and restore cyber-attacks.

    Eid et al. [77] introduced a compact, lightweight energy-

    harvesting system. The system used an integrated Schottky

    diode rectiﬁcation system that includes a dual-tapered line-

    based matching network. This topology was illustrated by a

    2.4 GHz system with an output of up to 58% over the input

    of 0 dBm. The output was compared to a referral corrector

    based on a regular open-circuit matching stub network.

    The rectiﬁer and a miniature monopole antenna were then

    optimized for a versatile substratum with an input power

    of about 50% at 0 dBm. Despite large load ﬂuctuations, the

    corrector had an almost ﬂat eﬃciency over the range of

    2.3-2.5 GHz. The suggested ﬂexible harvester was shown

    no major variations in harvested power for various bent

    states.

    Niu et al. [78] introduced an IoT enhanced cloud-

    computing data-sharing network based on blockchain. In

    addition to stable data management services, the data-

    sharing program supports successful search services. A key

    aggregation, searchable encryption scheme based on block-

    chain with an auxiliary entry system called BAI-KASE to

    guarantee data conﬁdentiality and key protection had been

    used. It enables users to securely externalize information

    and search for it through BAI-KASE in the cloud. Cornetta

    et al. [79] presented a novel manufacturing concept using

    FaaS that improves existing capabilities by oﬀering digital

    manufacturing equipment for interacting remotely to con-

    trol

    manufacturing

    activities

    over

    the

    Internet.

    The

    manufacturing facilities were exposed to the Internet as soft-

    ware services that third-party applications can consume. The

    results of the study demonstrated the high performance and

    accuracy capacity of FaaS.

    Cao et al. [80] proposed a distributed MAC protocol for

    IoT networks in the ambient backscatter communication

    framework, which allows each BD to freely switch between

    backscatter transmitting, receiving, and energy harvesting

    in a distributed manner. Also, the proposed MAC protocol

    adopts an ultralow-power sensing scheme and the dual-

    back-oﬀ

    method.

    Considering

    the

    sensing

    errors,

    an

    enhanced 3D discrete Markov chain model, including

    energy harvesting, was presented to analyze the standardized

    throughput of the proposed MAC protocol. An optimum

    comparator threshold had been derived from the upper

    bound of the normalized throughput. The numerical results

    show that the proposed MAC protocol functions well for

    IoT networks with low power consumption. Hu et al. [81]

    suggested a theoretical model for achieving the optimal

    number of items anchoring. BBIL had been assessed against

    existing methods and compared with them. The results of

    the simulation showed that BBIL’s average localization error

    is less than 11.6%. It does well in anisotropic networks. Wei

    et al. [82] considered a UAV-enhanced edge computing sce-

    nario for IoT applications. In particular, the problem of

    smart task oﬄoading at UAV-enhanced edge was ﬁrst iden-

    tiﬁed to address the generated big data. Final numerical tests

    conﬁrmed the dominance of energy saving of the overall

    optimum job oﬄoading scheme.

    3. Adopted Research Methodology

    This section presents a systematic literature review (SLR)

    method adopted to conduct this study [83–87]. A typical

    methodology for the SLR contains domain categorization,

    application area identiﬁcation, opportunities, outcomes,

    and their future scope. All the related synonyms and the

    alternatives of the keywords are identiﬁed, and then, subse-

    quential ﬁnal search words are chosen [88–90]. The SLR

    method was applied to the Science Direct, IEEE Xplore,

    7

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

    Wiley, ACM, and MDPI electronic databases, as shown in

    Table 1. Apart from the number of articles, all the research

    papers are indexed in SCI/SCIE, WoS, and Scopus index.

    Finally, 67 peer-reviewed research articles are selected totally

    on the basis of IoT applications in diﬀerent sectors purely

    based on commercial, environmental, smart city, industry,

    and healthcare.

    The principle of selection and evaluation ﬂow diagram is

    shown in Figure 4. For the ﬁnal mapping of the database, the

    4. Application Areas of IoT

    This section contains the existing research studies on

    selected IoT applications to prepare this technical review

    according to the SLR method. Taxonomy in Figure 5 pre-

    sents a broad classiﬁcation of the IoT applications, including

    various sectors like smart city, environmental, industrial,

    healthcare, and commercial sectors. Practically, in every

    IoT application, some glitches can emerge that can poten-

    tially aﬀect the eﬃciency of IoT applications, focused, eﬀec-

    tive solutions to counter these technical.

    This study has a major focus on IoT applications, chal-

    lenges, and available opportunities. The subsequent sections

    exemplify the diﬀerent methods in IoT applications.

    4.1. IoT in Commercial Sector. The Internet of Things, as

    part of the “Future Internet,” has evolved into a dynamic

    paradigm that is inﬂuenced by a diverse set of stakeholders.

    IoT enhanced the capabilities and serviceability of shopping

    and retail systems. To understand the applications in the

    commercial area, a more speciﬁc literature review has been

    presented.

    Alodib [91] described a model-driven solution for auto-

    mating the QoS-aware service composition process, which

    included real-time monitoring. The breach of SLAs set by

    various users in various places is a big problem, as stated

    in this article. As a result, the SLAs asserted by users across

    several sites were mapped into a Petri net, allowing the Petri

    net model to be integrated with the UML QoS model. Huo

    et al. [92] suggested a novel multiobjective model for service

    composition that takes into cost-eﬀectiveness. Availability,

    response time, throughput, and reputation are among the

    QoS criteria. The proposed service composition model was

    created using an ABC algorithm with the goal of maximizing

    the given QoS criteria while lowering costs.

    Liu et al. [93] suggested a cooperative solution for QoS

    that was implemented through PSO algorithms. Many algo-

    rithms were used, but the best-suggested algorithms were

    GA and PSO. The main advantage of this work is that it

    reduces time as well as cost. The limitation of this work is

    that it cannot be able to handle large-scale data. Hua and

    Wang [94] used the artiﬁcial bee colony algorithm for the

    composite services. The authors suggest that this proposed

    algorithm is much better than GA and other similar algo-

    rithms. The quality variables are analyzed in relation to the

    IP case study in order to arrive at the best optimum solution

    for the suggested composition method.

    Kleinfeld et al. [95] described a framework for connect-

    ing data from Web-based IoT devices and web services. This

    study oﬀered the glue-things concept as a Web of Things

    (WoT) center for mobiles, TVs, homes, and wearable

    appliances.

    A summary of the research work available in the com-

    mercial sector is shown in Table 2.

    4.2. IoT in Healthcare. The integration of IoT technology

    into healthcare systems is transforming the future of the

    health industry. The applications of IoT in the healthcare

    system, such as decreasing emergency room waiting time,

    telehealth, tracking of information, drug management, food

    management, determination of glucose level, and monitor-

    ing of electrocardiograms, are tabulated in Table 3. The

    architecture of IoT in healthcare is shown in Figure 6.

    Researchers across the world are working hard to enhance

    the healthcare system by bringing unique ideas, cutting-

    edge technology, and complex software. Security, privacy,

    authentication, energy consumption, processing power,

    resource management, QoSs, and other issues with IoT

    healthcare systems are all major problems. The IoT applica-

    tions in healthcare are also shown in Figure 7.

    4.3. IoT in Agriculture. Farming is very vital in today’s globe,

    and it needs suﬃcient environmental and dietary protection.

    To remotely control and monitor an animal farm, a smart

    system is required. This system should give feed and water

    as needed, as well as exhaust excess biogas created by the

    animal waste and detect ﬁres on the farm. Furthermore, this

    sophisticated system should monitor the entire farm.

    Memon et al. [128] used water level sensors, gas sensors,

    temperature, humidity sensors, ultrasonic sensors, micro-

    controllers, and an IP camera with Internet connectivity to

    create an IoT-based system. The architecture of IoT in agri-

    culture is shown in Figure 8.

    Billah et al. [129] develop a real-time water quality mon-

    itoring system. Three types of sensors, pH sensor, turbidity

    sensor, and temperature, were used to measure the quality

    of water. To regulate and monitor the Water Quality Index

    (WQI) parameters, the controller box contains a CC3200

    Launchpad microcontroller, a DS18B20 temperature sensor,

    an SKU: SEN 0189 turbidity sensor, and an SKU: SEN 0161

    pH sensor. The collected data would be saved in the cloud

    8

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

    and accessible via any mobile device with access to the Inter-

    net or Wi-Fi.

    In recent years, smart farming has paid greater emphasis

    to be eﬀective and eﬃcient animal illness diagnosis and con-

    trol. Feng et al. [130] worked on mastitis detection and con-

    trol in smart farms using IoT and social cattle behavior

    sensing. Data fusion techniques were used to combine data

    from diﬀerent sources, and noisy data were ﬁltered using

    GPS hardware-reported faults to make the gathered trajecto-

    ries more robust and dependable.

    Vaughan et al. [131] developed animal weight and gait

    sensors on the ﬂoor for precision livestock farming. The

    author suggested that pig farms may use low-cost, low-

    maintenance, and low-proﬁle sensor mats to track the pigs’

    stride and weight. The primary goal was important for mon-

    itoring pregnant animals since this information is useful for

    detecting lameness early and planning for the next gestation

    period.

    Pan et al. [132] evaluated two main web service tech-

    nologies to see which one is best for creating an IoT

    system for animal farming. The author presented the RICS

    platform for constructing animal husbandry IoT systems

    based on the comparative results, which chose the RESTful

    framework. The RICS platform demonstrates the several

    beneﬁts of RESTful architecture in IoT systems. To begin

    with, the uniﬁed protocols, as well as the streamlined tech-

    niques and data structure, make it easy to provide the

    improved caching capability. When the central manage-

    ment

    server

    and

    clients

    communicate,

    this

    greatly

    improves performance. Users may easily administer and

    maintain the system by employing the established HTTP

    methods, which include device monitoring and control,

    registering, and setting new features and hardware. Access

    control may be applied precisely and simply for security

    concerns.

    In smart farming, the IoT is used in soil moisture mon-

    itoring, temperature monitoring, humidity monitoring,

    pressure monitoring, gas monitoring, and crop disease

    monitoring. Revolutions in the agricultural industry are pre-

    sented in Figure 9.

    Precision farming assists farmers in improving, automat-

    ing, and optimizing all possible directions in order to

    increase agricultural production [133]. Various IoT sensors

    are used in harvesting operations. A correlation study

    between agricultural environment information and crop sta-

    tistical analysis has been created to collect crop data in order

    to improve crop output [134]. Popović et al. [135] describe

    the development of IoT-based solutions for precision agri-

    culture and ecological monitoring. Weather predictions

    based on IoT enhance production and do anticipatory anal-

    yses to prevent crop damage. Multiple monitoring sensors

    are utilized to forecast pest activity and plant growth and

    manage any looming pest problem. IoT-based irrigation sys-

    tems are used to control and evaluate agricultural irrigation

    needs. Nakutis et al. [136] presented a remote agriculture

    monitoring platform. Watteyne et al. [137] presented a pre-

    cision farming conceptual architecture based on cyber sys-

    tems and software-deﬁned works. IoT foundation climate

    time to sow and harvest, and tracking/tracing are examples

    of precision farming.

    Plants are cultivated in greenhouses in a controlled

    atmosphere. By monitoring proper environmental condi-

    tions, this glasshouse technology aids growing plants any-

    time, everywhere. Because greenhouse cultivation is more

    intensive, it needs greater accuracy in terms of manage-

    ment and monitoring. Several researches on the usage of

    WSNs in greenhouses to monitor environmental or mete-

    orological

    conditions

    have

    been

    conducted.

    Recent

    research has demonstrated how the IoT may be used in

    greenhouses

    to

    reduce

    human

    resources,

    accumulate

    energy, and give direct communication between ranchers

    and buyers [138–140].

    Furthermore, there has been much research that com-

    bines metaprocessing structure with data to send it to

    remote infrastructures via the Internet for the goal of high

    accuracy. Assessment of crop status aids ranchers in making

    better decisions by using well-validated crop models [141].

    Sensors can collect data which is subsequently sent to the

    main server for processing. The sensors and network for cor-

    rect data transfer are the most important components in the

    physical implementation.

    Growers put various sensors according to the individual

    requirements and then track or record the data. Agricultur-

    ists make better judgments by studying the data they get and

    acquiring the best data possible. Water management, plant

    monitoring, and climate monitoring are just a few examples

    of IoT-based greenhouse applications. Everything in today’s

    contemporary society must be automated in order to save

    time and manpower. A summary of the IoT applications in

    agriculture is given in Table 4.

    4.4. IoT in the Environment. Due to the tremendous rise in

    population, industrialization, and urbanization, trash collec-

    tion and segregation have become a key concern for all met-

    ropolitan areas throughout the world. At the household

    level, there is a dearth of information concerning trash seg-

    regation. The principal concerns that arise as a result of poor

    waste management are human health risks and environmen-

    tal issues.

    Hassan et al. [142] created an IoT-based garbage moni-

    toring and collection system. The system’s hardware consists

    of a NodeMCU coupled with two ultrasonic sensors and a

    Wi-Fi module mounted on the board. These sensors were

    used in the system to create an automatic lid opener as well

    as to update the waste level situation for monitoring pur-

    poses. The proposed system used a mobile application to

    monitor the waste level in the bin over the Internet applica-

    tion. The Wi-Fi module had restricted coverage, which is the

    restriction of the system.

    Fang et al. [143] introduced a novel IIS that combines

    the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, a global posi-

    tioning system (GPS), geographical information system

    (GIS), and e-Science for environmental monitoring and

    management.

    The “green consumer,” a person who is aware that their

    consumption habits have an impact on the sustainable

    development of the region where they live and values their

    quality of life in terms of environmental respect, is one of

    the social megatrends that has had the most impact on

    changing people’s minds. Furthermore, a green consumer

    is very supportive of environmental causes such as recycling,

    vehicle emissions control, and environmental care resources,

    among others. IoT technology has been indirectly involved

    in such activities by detecting environmental factors, identi-

    fying contaminants, and, in certain circumstances, con-

    ducting remedial steps in situations when considerable

    environmental harm has occurred [144].

    4.5. IoT in Energy Sector. The steady rise in energy consump-

    tion that comes with population growth and the introduc-

    tion of new technology has created substantial problems

    for consumers in terms of energy management. Smart

    meters (SMs) are no longer only instruments for measuring

    energy usage; they are now a key component of energy man-

    agement systems. The beneﬁts of using SM include correct

    billing data, the development of two-way communication,

    and remote control of user equipment. SM is the most

    important component of a smart power grid since it ana-

    lyzes, monitors, regulate, implements, and communicates

    power allocation, usage, and consumption at both the single

    device and network level with the support of a smart energy

    management system (SEMS). Power supply businesses use

    Smart meters and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been

    widely used to replace old analog meters in today’s smart

    homes. The data may be delivered wirelessly, which

    decreases the amount of human labor required. The com-

    munity of smart home networks, on the other hand, is vul-

    nerable to energy theft. Li et al. [145] created machine

    learning and statistical-based models to reduce energy theft

    called smart energy theft systems (SETS). The prediction

    model, which employs a multimodal forecasting system, is

    the initial step of the decision-making modules. This system

    combines many machine learning algorithms into a single

    power consumption forecasting system. The secondary

    decision-making model, which utilizes a simple moving

    average (SMA) for aberrant ﬁltering, is the second step.

    The third stage is the secondary decision-making model,

    which is used to arrive at the ultimate stage of the energy

    theft decision.

    Zhang et al. [146] reviewed future IIoT core technolo-

    gies, including complete sensing techniques and the broad

    range of communication devices, large-scale data treatment,

    and

    The smart energy grid becomes more dependable, dura-

    ble, and eﬃcient when IoT-based technologies are inte-

    grated. IoT technologies, on the other hand, provide

    additional issues for the smart energy grid system, such as

    security ﬂaws. Some emerging technologies, such as block-

    chain, machine intelligence, high-performance computing,

    and distributed frameworks, can help to address these issues.

    One of the key elements of IoT smart grid technology is

    energy consumption. It is a novel smart electricity distribu-

    tion mechanism that focuses on enhancing renewable energy

    in power systems, grid operation control, and customer

    power consumption optimization [17]. Distribution and

    consumption management, transmission control, better

    metering design, integration of renewable resources, energy

    storage, and self-healing infrastructure are the services pro-

    vided by smart grid technologies [147]. As a result, smart

    grid technologies are regarded as one of the foundational

    technology that can aid in the development of smart cities

    [148]. Furthermore, it employs a variety of approaches,

    including machine learning and deep learning, to create

    intelligent and eﬃcient power management systems [149].

    A summary of the applications of IoT in the energy sec-

    tor is shown in Table 5.

    4.6. IoT in Smart Cities

    4.6.1. Eco-Smart Cities. Smart cities have been seen as a loca-

    tion that is both ecologically friendly and sustainable. Diﬀer-

    ent factors such as air quality, water quality, and weather are

    measured by local governments using wireless sensor net-

    works. Administrations have put permanent and mobile

    monitoring stations that measure some of these factors using

    sensors that are connected to a central communication

    device, which then sends the data to a central server for stor-

    age or analysis. The architecture of IoT in smart cities is pre-

    sented in Figure 11.

    In addition to sensor networks, IoT has enabled indi-

    viduals to gain a better understanding of their daily energy

    and water use at home, as well as the creation of pollut-

    ants [150, 151], resulting in increased environmental con-

    sciousness and the consolidation of this mega societal

    trend.

    4.6.2. Traﬃc Control. It is one of the major issues in the big

    cities, which occurs when road infrastructure is insuﬃcient

    to meet mobility demand, and public transit services are

    overburdened. Smart city governments have developed

    Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) designs, which

    include video cameras, GPS devices, GIS systems, and sensor

    networks to monitor paths, bridges, and road infrastructure

    [152]. People may monitor from a transport control center

    and make judgments regarding transportation, such as

    rerouting, adding transport buses, optimizing traﬃc signals,

    and responding quickly [153].

    4.6.3. Education. National and municipal governments are

    particularly interested in education-related innovation since

    a well-educated country is more competitive in many social,

    political, and economic areas. Virtual classrooms are

    increasingly quite widespread at schools and colleges, as

    educational techniques have altered drastically in recent

    years. It is now feasible to interconnect multiple venues

    where students may access common information to better

    their learning experience. Remote access control, lighting,

    air conditioning, projection displays, and automated detec-

    tion of the presence of students in a classroom by RFID

    are all examples of IoT in schools [153].

    4.6.4. E-Health. IoT technologies have various applications

    in healthcare innovation that may be incorporated into a

    smartphone or other device for monitoring health diagnosis

    factors like blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate to

    prevent and diagnose illnesses [154]. In hospitals, IoT tech-

    nology provides a variety of services, including patient mon-

    itoring of physiological signals and surgical aid using

    Internet-connected medical tools that can be controlled

    remotely. IoT technology enables the monitoring and track-

    ing of medications and pharmaceutical items in the pharma-

    ceutical business [155].

    5. Challenges in IoT Developments

    Till now, a broad range of IoT applications as well as several

    IoT datasets produced for the evaluation of IoT systems has

    been discussed in detail. Despite the fact that our analysis

    explored many IoT concepts and infrastructure, there are

    still certain obstacles and research paths that need to be

    solved in order to match the IoT sector with real-world

    requirements. In this part, we outline some of the research

    gaps that may be used by researchers in the ﬁeld of IoT sys-

    tems to get insight into current trends and gaps, as well as

    how these gaps might be addressed.

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

    5.1. Data Management. The data management issues in the

    healthcare industry are similar to other industries. Medical

    sensors attached to humans provide the e-Health data. The

    human body is a dynamic system that is constantly changing

    its condition. As a result, there will be a steady ﬂow of data

    arriving from edge sensors via fog computing nodes. IoT e-

    Health needs to deal with the data’s complexity in terms of

    volume, diversity, and velocity. For example, ECG data

    may be sent in XML format, but diagnosing skin illnesses

    using a camera-based IoT device would need handling pic-

    ture formats.

    5.2. Connectivity Issues. The core of the IoT is the creation of

    a network of interconnected devices that can share data. As a

    result, connecting several devices for communication is one

    of the most diﬃcult challenges in developing IoT systems.

    The systems and technology should be able to handle the

    existing and additional infrastructure. A centralized client-

    server design is responsible for initiating communication

    across several nodes in the network that is not scalable

    enough to support billions of IoT devices in a single net-

    work. As a result, the centralized network will experience a

    bottleneck. The addition of additional devices to the network

    necessitates a signiﬁcant investment in capital cost to main-

    tain cloud servers for data storage.

    5.3. Security. A large number of devices are connected across

    a vast region, and securing IoT systems is diﬃcult and

    demanding. Intruders can readily compromise this informa-

    tion since these gadgets interact and exchange it. The secu-

    rity component of IoT systems is crucial since the data

    transferred among the devices might contain sensitive infor-

    mation such as a patient’s health information, a company’s

    trade secrets, or state government or military network classi-

    ﬁed information. Finding the intruder in the network who

    may infect or harm the entire communication network

    would be a diﬃcult assignment.

    The cost of extracting DNA sequencing procedures in e-

    healthcare applications to cure

    any illness

    has been

    extremely high for numerous decades. With the use of

    low-cost genetic sequencing, we can incorporate genomic

    analytics into normal medical treatment. This will assist us

    in receiving better and more timely care. The extraction of

    information

    from

    the

    genomic

    sequence

    is

    a

    time-

    consuming process. Genomic data also contains information

    on the patient’s ancestors and relatives. As a result, informa-

    tion leaks and sharing produce creates lots of issues.

    5.4. Software Applications. The ability of software applica-

    tions to execute built-in IoT infrastructure is reliant on their

    innovativeness and intelligence in the IoT paradigm. IoT

    system developers vary on the functionality to be imple-

    mented. For example, edge developers are hired to create

    hardware drivers for various edge devices and those who

    provide interfaces for transmitting the acquired sensor data.

    Data analytics developers are the developers that are in

    charge of processing and aggregating data obtained from

    various sensors throughout the network. Application devel-

    opers are the people that create the interface between the

    users and the hardware.

    For each developer, the competence needs and environ-

    ment are diﬀerent. For example, a data analytics developer

    is familiar with the operation of underlying hardware

    devices and how data should be presented to a user. Based

    on the knowledge needs, IoT concepts and software applica-

    tions must be developed and explored. Additionally, a

    generic programming interface can aid in the development

    of eﬀective software applications.

    The unavailability of storage devices might cause the sys-

    tem to shut down, putting a massive quantity of data being

    transmitted between network nodes at risk.

    Because the consumer and business needs of IoT vary on

    a daily basis, the technology itself involves a large number of

    linked devices resulting in an increase in the cost of service

    and maintenance, which will further position itself while

    generating an imbalance in a country’s economy. The devel-

    opment of sensors or devices that require very little or no

    maintenance is one answer to this challenge. This will lower

    the cost of maintenance and help to avoid certain economic

    diﬃculties.

    Furthermore, most of the devices used here are battery-

    powered, and it is very hard to replace a sensor’s battery

    after it has been deployed, resulting in high power consump-

    tion. As a result, another issue is to build sensors that do not

    require battery replacement over time, which may be accom-

    plished by creating more gadgets that use renewable energy

    sources. As we know, the Internet is the heart of IoT. Issues

    with Internet connectivity will result in poor service and per-

    formance. Almost all base stations/gateways have a restric-

    tion on the number of users who may connect at the same

    time. If the number of users exceeds the limit, some users

    will be unable to connect. So, in order for IoT to be success-

    ful, the Internet needs to be fast, inexpensive, and hassle-

    free.

    The establishment of a single communication standard is

    still a question. Because the goal of the Internet of Things is

    to make it more user-friendly and to make it easier to com-

    municate with other connected devices, as a result, certain

    common communication protocols that facilitate network

    heterogeneity and interoperability must be implemented,

    making it substantially easier for users to contribute to its

    considerable development.

    In addition, one of the most signiﬁcant diﬃculties that

    IoT faces is the security, privacy, and control of personal

    data. Because IoT is a linked platform, all of your personal

    information is stored on the cloud, which is extremely sus-

    ceptible. If there is a ﬂaw in IoT security, it will clearly jeop-

    ardize a person’s privacy and security. This might be

    mitigated by using a secure gateway and implementing

    secure algorithms and cryptographies to create a more

    secure environment.

    6. Discussion

    The review approach for the selected research in IoT appli-

    cations was discussed in the previous sections. This section

    presents a “statistical analysis” of the suggested IoT

    16

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

    application techniques. Figure 12 represents a comparison of

    the percentage of IoT applications to date, based on the tax-

    onomy provided in Section 4. We looked at environmental,

    healthcare, commercial, industrial, smart city, and general

    aspects of IoT applications. In the literature, the smart city

    method has the largest percentage of application domains,

    with 30% utilization. Healthcare applications account for

    20% of all IoT utilization, followed by commercial applica-

    tions (14%), environmental applications (12%), general

    applications (12%), and industrial applications (10%).

    Figure 13 depicts the main contexts of IoT applications.

    With 21 investigations, we discovered that QoS-aware tech-

    niques are the most popular, followed by intelligent moni-

    toring with 17 studies.

    According to Figure 14, 24% of the research studies have

    adopted the recommended strategy for developing IoT applica-

    tions. Furthermore, it has been found that 58% of the research

    publications used simulation tools to evaluate the IoT plat-

    form’s case studies. In addition, 14% of the studies did not

    include any implementation. The evaluation criteria according

    to cost, response time, security, energy consumption, etc. are

    shown in Figure 15. It has been found that 4% of the present

    articles used datasets to analyze their case studies utilizing ana-

    lytical methodologies such as prediction and testing.

    The main concern of the IoT is security and privacy

    because the architecture of IoT changes with respect to the

    area of application. Reduced energy usage is one of the most

    crucial concerns in IoT. Green IoT is a major idea that

    guides the development of many technologies and concerns

    aimed at achieving a sustainable world with smart technolo-

    gies in which the energy requirement of smart IoT items can

    be minimized. Green IoT is enabled by a number of factors,

    including green RF identiﬁcation, green wireless sensor net-

    works, green communication between machines, green data

    centers, and green cloud computing. Future eﬀorts in these

    areas, such as green IoT design, understanding the charac-

    teristics of various IoT applications and service requirements

    for these applications, and presenting appropriate energy

    consumption models for various parts of IoT systems, will

    help to address the energy consumption challenge.

    Abstract: Agriculture 5.0 refers to the next phase of agricultural development,
    building upon the

    previous digital revolution in the agrarian sector and aiming to transform the
    agricultural industry

    to be smarter, more effective, and ecologically conscious. Farming processes have
    already started

    becoming more efﬁcient due to the development of digital technologies, including
    big data, artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented
    reality. Farmers

    can make the most of the resources at their disposal thanks to this data-driven
    approach, allowing

    them to effectively cultivate and sustain crops on arable land. The European Union
    (EU) aims to

    make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable through the Green
    Deal and its

    farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, zero pollution action plan, and
    upcoming sustainable

    use of pesticides regulation. Many of the historical synthetic pesticides are
    not currently registered

    in the EU market. In addition, the continuous use of a limited number of active
    ingredients with

    the same mode of action scales up pests/pathogens/weed resistance potential. Increasing
    plant

    protection challenges as well as having fewer chemical pesticides to apply require
    innovation and

    smart solutions for crop production. Biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks to
    human health and the

    environment, their efﬁcacy depends on various factors that cannot be controlled
    through traditional

    application strategies. This paper aims to disclose the contribution of robotic
    systems in Agriculture

    5.0 ecosystems, highlighting both the challenges and limitations of this technology.
    Speciﬁcally, this

    work documents current threats to agriculture (climate change, invasive pests,
    diseases, and costs)

    and how robotics and AI can act as countermeasures to deal with such threats.
    Finally, speciﬁc case

    studies and the application of intelligent robotic systems to them are analyzed,
    and the architecture

    for our intelligent decision system is proposed.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture 5.0 constitutes an entire ecosystem; it aims to integrate emerging
    technolo-

    gies, such as AI, IoT, and ML in agriculture, to improve productivity while promoting
    sus-

    tainability and decision-making processes. Enhancing traditional farming practices
    through

    automation and scalable technology solutions is meant to reduce risks, enhance
    sustain-

    ability, and provide predictive decision-making for growers [1,2]. Moreover, data-driven

    agriculture and advanced farm management systems are becoming increasingly important

    in the contemporary agrarian sector. Smart agriculture relies on objective information

    acquired through sensors to make optimal decisions and maximize productivity while

    ensuring resource efﬁciency and environmental sustainability. By incorporating
    robotic

    solutions and AI techniques, data-driven agriculture lays the groundwork for sustainable

    agriculture in the future. In relation to Industry 5.0 (which emphasizes collaboration
    be-

    tween humans and intelligent machines, with a focus on resilience and sustainability),

    Agriculture 5.0 seeks to reconcile the need for sufﬁcient and affordable food
    production

    with the preservation of ecosystems. While Industry and Agriculture 4.0 focus
    mainly on

    technologies, like IoT and Big Data, Industry and Agriculture 5.0 add human, environmen-

    tal, and social aspects to the equation. The transition from the digital farming
    revolution to

    Agriculture 5.0 is considered critical for the future well-being of farmers and
    the gradual

    shift to efﬁcient, intelligent, and autonomous farms in terms of energy consumption.
    In-

    tegrating emerging technologies and alternative energy sources into Agriculture
    5.0 can

    provide cost-effective access to ﬁnance, weather updates, remote monitoring, and
    future

    energy solutions for smart farm installations.

    According to the European Agricultural Industry (EU-27), the growing demands on

    agricultural products as well as the growing world population have raised the
    demand

    for an increased production yield. Note that agriculture possesses strong links
    with food

    processing and farm machinery sectors. The latter is directly affected by the
    performance

    of the agrarian sector; thus, the total economic impact of agriculture is multiplied
    [3].

    More speciﬁcally, the global population increase and the consecutive exponential
    one in

    food demand have led to a search for more efﬁcient ways of production, both in
    terms

    of production size and quality of products. Speciﬁcally, the above reasons caused
    the

    Third Agricultural Revolution to ﬂourish by introducing vital technological pillars
    in the

    agricultural ﬁeld. The mentioned stations are: (i) the selective breeding to improve
    the

    quality of food in products for humans and animals as well as (ii) the use of
    chemical fertil-

    izers and synthetic pesticides for increased quality production with a low environmental

    footprint. Chemical pesticides used to protect crops from pests, pathogens, and
    weeds pose

    acute and long-term risks to humans and other non-target organisms [4]. Moreover,
    many

    pesticides and their degradation products persist in the environment for many
    years [5].

    The farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, as well as the zero pollution
    action

    plan, include ambitious and speciﬁc targets on pesticides, fertilizers, biological
    agriculture,

    and resistance development against pesticides (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/sustainability/environmental-sustainability/cap-andenvironment_en (accessed

    on 1 April 2023)) [6]. Some clear targets to be achieved by 2030 are to reduce
    chemicals

    and more hazardous pesticides by 50%, reduce fertilizer use by 20%, and enhance
    the

    organic farming sector by 25% of total farmland (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/farming/organic-farming/organic-production-and-products_en (accessed
    on

    1 April 2023)). New technological advances must be introduced in traditional agricultural

    systems to support those EU targets. Hence, process automation can be a modern
    way

    of handling this situation. The high-tech precision agriculture systems result
    from the

    research and development of interdisciplinary teams in mechatronics and agronomy
    [7].

    In this context, various vehicles have been developed, which are capable of moving
    in

    difﬁcult rural terrains, while the development of drones has given new impetus
    to several

    applications, such as crop health assessment, plant monitoring, etc. These developments

    allow modern mechatronic systems to collect data, communicate wirelessly, and
    share

    large sizes of data between them [8,9]. The above data constitute a cornerstone
    of precision

    farming since they can be used for timely and accurate spraying of fungicides,
    insecticides

    and herbicides, fruit harvesting when appropriate for ripening, etc. This enables
    intelligent

    cultivation, production automation, and production automation, saving farmers’
    time in

    various stages of production, such as sowing, spraying, harvesting, etc. At the
    same time,

    farmers have the ability to control their processes and results through communication

    technology [10]. The evolution of modern robots has an impact on improving the
    quality of

    crops by increasing both the proﬁtability of producers as well as the choice-consumption

    of quality food [11]. Therefore, the implementation of new technologies helps
    to restrict

    dosing and dispersal, thereby reducing the environmental consequences. However,
    inde-

    pendent of their targeted operational environment, contemporary robots should
    be smart

    and, thus, retain advanced perception abilities [12,13]. These capabilities are
    highly related

    to how the robots understand, interpret, and represent their environment and its
    elements

    (such as crops, leaves, etc.), and each individual productive entity (e.g., plants,
    trees, pests,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    3 of 15

    pathogens, etc.). Semantic mapping is salutary and can provide viable solutions
    to related

    problems [14]. Also, the heterogeneous data extracted from an integrated system
    are neces-

    sary to be understandable and useful for the direct actions of the producers/farmers
    or for

    the direct supply to another robot system that implements the next action (for
    example,

    spraying, collecting fruit, etc.). The above challenges involve system advancements
    in

    terms of dependability and semantic perception abilities with the ultimate requirement
    of

    being operable in different environments.

    Crop protection constitutes a major food production component. Using cutting-edge

    technologies such as the introduction of low-risk pesticides, precision farming,
    and genome

    editing will help to keep modern agriculture sustainable. Timely monitoring of
    crop

    protection problems and targeted application of the ﬁt-for-purpose pesticide would
    reduce

    the overall risk and increase the efﬁcacy of each application. Speciﬁcally, our
    proposed

    system will contribute to improving crop protection by making it more efﬁcient
    and robust.

    The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:

    •

    To summarize the most recent and relevant literature in the domain of smart farming

    through robots.

    •

    To highlight and stress the beneﬁts of introducing an autonomous robotic ecosystem
    in

    the agricultural ﬁeld.

    •

    To reveal the technological challenges and barriers to introducing such solutions
    in

    this domain.

    •

    To propose a conceptual framework for the realization of robotized systems in
    agricul-

    tural environments to help with their protection.

    •

    To explore potential improvements in pesticide efﬁcacy by providing timely pesticide

    delivery to targets.

    •

    To investigate strategies for reducing the risk posed by pesticide applications
    to non-

    target organisms.

    •

    To discuss the development of a decision support system for selecting low-risk
    pesticides

    among the available options.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Firstly, the crop justiﬁcation
    is analyzed

    in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss related works in the ﬁeld of precision
    agriculture.

    In the same section, the problem formulation is also presented. Section 4 describes
    the

    agriculture ﬁeld requirements, and the next section highlights the beneﬁts of
    utilizing AI

    methods. In Section 5, we analyze the proposed system and its architecture. In
    Section 6, a

    discussion of our ﬁndings is provided, while in Section 7, our conclusions are
    drawn and

    plans for future work are presented.

    2. Crop Justiﬁcation

    Two important crops for the EU economy were selected as case studies. A ﬁeld crop

    (wheat) and a perennial crop (olive) constitute our models, covering different
    (i) crop-

    ping systems, (ii) pest/weed/pathogen severity, and (iii) registered pesticides.
    The olive

    tree (Olea europea L.) is a universal tree that has accompanied Mediterranean
    agriculture

    for thousands of years. Nowadays, over 750 million olive trees are cultivated
    world-

    wide, 95% of which are in the Mediterranean region. The fruit, oil, and branches
    of

    olive trees have been culturally and economically tightly linked with Mediterranean
    his-

    tory (https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/news/producing-69-worlds-production-eu-largest-

    producer-olive-oil-2020-02-04_en (accessed on 20 April 2023)). About 98% of olive
    oil

    and 80% of table olive production are from Mediterranean countries. Approximately

    70% of the world’s olive oil production is concentrated in Europe. In the EU,
    olive tree

    plantations are found in nine EU Member States: Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal,
    Cyprus,

    France, Croatia, Slovenia, and Malta. EU olive production reached 10,908,000 tonnes

    and EUR 2255 million in 2016 [15]. The average annual olive yield and product
    qual-

    ity varied between years, reﬂecting the effect of plant protection problems. The
    olive

    tree is a long-living drought-tolerant species that is limited by many biotic
    stressors (e.g.,

    pests, diseases, and weeds). Bactrocera oleae, Prays oleae, Euphyllura spp., Saissetia
    oleae,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    4 of 15

    Parlatoria oleae, and Eriophyidae mites are the most important pests and Cycloconium
    oleag-

    inum, Glomerella cingulata, Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi are among the
    diseases receiv-

    ing chemical control by various pesticides. In the EU, olive cultivation tends
    to move from

    traditional low-density systems to new, high-density, super-intensive cropping
    systems.

    All of these changes have affected the incidence and severity of pests and diseases.
    In olive

    trees, at least ten of the currently registered pesticides, one insecticide (lambda-Cyhalothrin),

    seven fungicides (Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper oxide, copper oxychloride,

    Difenoconazole, Tebuconazole, Tribasic copper sulfate), and two herbicides (Diﬂufenican,

    Metribuzin) are listed as candidates for substitution. Copper products are used
    in high

    quantities and most alternatives lack copper efﬁcacy. Moreover, the limited number
    of

    pesticides registered for use in olives has resulted in resistance development
    to most pests,

    diseases, and weeds against insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, respectively.
    Table 1

    summarizes the currently registered pesticides in olive trees. Cereal grains have
    numerous

    uses, such as bread, semolina, and pasta; they are also important components of
    animal

    feed and serve as raw material in the production of products such as alcohol,
    beer, starch,

    and dextrin, and are used in the glucose industry. In the EU, the cereal sector
    accounted

    for approximately 11% of the total output value of agricultural production in
    2016 and it

    is an important sector in the northern member states (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/

    RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/640143/EPRS_BRI(2019)640143_EN.pdf (accessed on 1 April

    2023)). The EU cereal sector is facing structural, ﬁnancial, and climatic challenges.
    Russia’s

    war against Ukraine has put global food security at risk and has contributed signiﬁcantly

    to the growing wheat and wheat ﬂour prices. Around one-third of the EU’s cereal
    imports

    in 2021 came from Ukraine and Russia; following the war, the EU had to undertake
    all

    measures to certify EU cereal production. Wheat, the most important cereal crop
    cultivated

    worldwide, is used to prepare bread for approximately 40% of the global population
    [16].

    Wheat is an important commodity in Europe, with a production of 133 million tonnes
    per

    year. Wheat production depends on numerous production factors, and the use of
    pesti-

    cides is important for increasing the quantity and quality of wheat production.
    Pesticides

    help to control pests and diseases or their vectors, as well as reduce spoilage
    during stor-

    age. Broadleaf and grassy weeds, diseases (Puccinia striiformis/graminis/recondita,
    Erysiphe

    graminis, Septoria tritici/nodorum, Fusarium spp. Tilletia caries, Ustilago nuda,
    Ustilago spp.,

    Rhizoctonia spp.), insects (Agrotis spp., Rhopalosiphum padi, Sitobion avenae,
    Limothrips cere-

    alium), and other pests can reduce wheat crop yields, and the use of pesticides
    helps to

    minimize these losses. In the early stages of crop development, using herbicides
    to con-

    trol weed infestations is essential for achieving optimal grain yield and desired
    economic

    beneﬁts. With wheat, at least two insecticides (Cypermethrin, lambda-Cyhalothrin),
    one

    fungicide (Tebuconazole), and two herbicides (Pendimethalin, Metsulfuron-methyl)
    from

    the current authorized products are listed as candidates for substitution. Wheat
    production

    is also threatened by the development of weed resistance against most registered
    herbicides,

    and there are numerous instances of insects and fungi developing resistance against
    insecti-

    cides and fungicides, respectively. While the investigation into less harmful
    compounds

    to substitute undesirable pesticides is an important strategy, other promising
    smart farm-

    ing technologies (innovative formulations), tools (innovative spraying equipment),
    and

    methodologies (lower dosages) can contribute to increased pesticide efﬁcacy and
    reduced

    impact on the environment and human health. Table 2 summarizes the currently registered

    pesticides in wheat. AI can help in the selection of the most appropriate pesticides
    in order

    to achieve the highest efﬁciency against targeted crop protection problems and
    the lowest

    risks for resistance development and hazards related to non-target organisms.
    The mode of

    action of pesticides, the life cycle and susceptibility of pests/pathogens/weeds,
    stability,

    leaching and runoff potential, environmental conditions, and availability of application

    technologies are among the major factors that an AI system can be trained to handle.

    3. Related Works

    This section presents the existing knowledge related to the research topic and
    provides

    an overview of the relevant literature. The purpose of this section is to contextualize
    the

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    6 of 15

    research of the ﬁeld’s current state. Through a comprehensive review of related
    works,

    gaps in the research can be identiﬁed, providing a rationale for our study. This
    section also

    allows readers to situate the research within a broader scholarly conversation
    and provides

    a foundation for the argument presented in the paper.

    The importance of crop area (CA) protection can be attributed to the growing pop-

    ulation. Automatic mapping using information extracted from high-spatial resolution

    remote sensing (RS) images is powerful for acquiring accurate and up-to-date CA
    maps.

    RS image information extraction includes feature classiﬁcation, which is a long-standing

    research issue in the RS community [13]. Emerging deep learning techniques, such
    as the

    deep semantic segmentation network technique, are effective methods to automatically

    discover relevant contextual features and obtain better image classiﬁcation results
    [17].

    More speciﬁcally, several studies have dealt with agricultural precision sectors,
    contributing

    to increased agricultural yields. Note that the authors of [18] applied transfer
    learning

    to domain adaptation—from the source domain to the plant domain—by using a major

    category in the plant domain. Category adaptation was performed from the major
    to minor

    categories within the plant domain. UAVs are immediately accessible tools for
    remote sens-

    ing scientists and farmers. In recent years, small commercial UAVs (<50 kg) [19]
    have been

    available for environmental and agricultural applications. Much of the research
    on preci-

    sion agriculture for conservation has focused on strategically placing conservation
    areas to

    minimize runoff contaminants (e.g., sediment, nutrients, and pesticides) and,
    subsequently,

    increasing water quality [20]. The approach in [21] stated that spatial variability
    in soil,

    crops, and topographic characteristics, combined with temporal variability between
    sea-

    sons, could lead to variable annual yield patterns. The complexity of interactions
    between

    yield-limiting factors, such as soil nutrients and soil water, requires specialized
    statistical

    processing to quantify convenience and, thus, inform crop management practices.
    This

    study used multiple linear regression models, cubic regression, and neural propagation

    networks to predict performance.

    Generally, the advent of AI and robotized solutions have revolutionized crop protection

    by offering advanced capabilities and precision in addressing agricultural challenges.
    These

    technologies enable automated monitoring, early detection of pests and diseases,
    targeted

    application of treatments, and efficient resource management, leading to increased
    crop

    yields and sustainable farming practices. Semantic recognition plays a crucial
    role in crop

    protection by enabling the identification and classification of pests, diseases,
    and other threats

    to agricultural crops [13,14]. Through advanced algorithms and machine learning
    techniques,

    semantic recognition systems can accurately analyze images, sensor data, and other
    inputs to

    provide timely and targeted interventions, leading to improved crop health and
    yield [22,23].

    In recent years, different machine learning techniques have been implemented to
    achieve

    accurate yield prediction for different crops. The most successful techniques
    used support

    vector regression [24], M5-Prime regression trees [25], and k-nearest neighbor
    [26]. The authors

    created the spiking neural network (SNN) model for timely crop yield prediction.
    The above

    approach [27] introduces SNN as a promising technique for spatiotemporal data
    modeling

    and crop analysis prediction. Because deep learning techniques have the capability
    to extract

    feature maps from data for estimation, they can be expected to have less dependency
    on

    the input data. Even in rural areas where data acquisition is limited, deep learning
    can be

    expected to provide good crop yield estimation [28].

    In [29], the obstacles faced in implementing smart agri-robotic solutions for
    global

    broadacre crop production were analyzed. The authors argued that the current strategies

    and technologies used in agri-robotics are insufﬁcient to address the unique complexities

    associated with large-scale crop farming. They identify several key challenges,
    including

    the unpredictable nature of diverse broadacre crops, the necessity for adaptable
    robotic

    systems, and the intricate decision-making processes involved in crop management.
    To

    overcome these challenges effectively, the authors proposed fundamentally rethinking

    existing approaches and technologies, like machine learning, computer vision,
    and sensor

    networks, as essential components of smart agri-robotic solutions. Furthermore,
    the authors

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    7 of 15

    of [30] presented an in-depth analysis of the use of intelligent robot systems
    in the ﬁeld

    of ecological agriculture. The paper emphasized the signiﬁcance of adopting advanced

    technologies to address challenges related to pest control and promote sustainable
    farming

    practices. By integrating robotic platforms, sensors, imaging techniques, and
    artiﬁcial

    intelligence algorithms, the paper discussed how these technologies enable precise
    and

    targeted pest management strategies, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and
    minimize

    environmental impacts. The beneﬁts of intelligent robot plant protection systems,
    such

    as improved efﬁciency, reduced labor requirements, and enhanced crop yield, are
    high-

    lighted. The authors also acknowledge potential challenges in implementing these
    systems,

    including cost, scalability, and compatibility with existing agricultural practices.

    Subsequently, the approach in [31] provides a comprehensive summary of the role
    and

    impact of robotics, IoT, and AI in automating the agricultural sector. The review
    explores

    various applications of these advanced technologies, including automated harvesting,

    precision agriculture, crop monitoring, livestock management, and smart irrigation
    systems.

    It highlights how the integration of robotics, IoT, and AI can enhance efﬁciency,
    productivity,

    and sustainability in farming practices. The paper also emphasizes the importance
    of

    incorporating data analytics and machine learning algorithms for intelligent decision-

    making in agriculture. Finally, it addresses the challenges associated with implementing

    these technologies, such as cost, scalability, interoperability, and data privacy.

    Moreover, in [32], the authors presented a comprehensive overview of the integration
    of

    machine learning and emerging technologies in precision crop protection, specifically
    focusing

    on the transition towards Agriculture 5.0. Specifically, the paper explored the
    immense

    potential of these technologies to revolutionize farming practices, improve sustainability,

    and optimize crop protection strategies. By delving into various areas, such as
    machine

    learning algorithms, sensor technologies, remote sensing, IoT, and data analytics,
    the review

    examined how these technologies could be utilized to enhance crucial aspects of
    agriculture,

    including crop monitoring, pest detection, disease diagnosis, and targeted application
    of

    agrochemicals. The authors emphasized the significance of context-aware and data-driven

    decision-making to achieve precision crop protection in the evolving agricultural
    landscape.

    Then, it addressed pertinent issues, such as data quality, scalability, privacy
    concerns, and the

    need for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, farmers, and policymakers.
    By

    highlighting these challenges, this approach provides a holistic view of the potential
    barriers

    and considerations that need to be addressed for successful implementation.

    4. Analysis of Agriculture Field Requirements

    As the global population is projected to surpass 9 billion by 2050, the agricultural

    industry will have to satisfy the increasing demand for food. Pesticides will
    play a cru-

    cial role in ensuring high crop yields. Pesticides, according to the Food and
    Agriculture

    Organization (FAO), include substances of natural or synthetic chemicals or biological

    ingredients used to repel, destroy, or regulate pests and regulate plant growth.
    They help

    to protect seeds and crops from unwanted plants, insects, bacteria, fungi, and
    rodents, and

    come in various types, such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides,
    and ne-

    maticides [33]. However, pesticides, herbicides, and chemicals have increased
    signiﬁcantly

    in recent years to manage plant diseases and increase crop productivity. This
    increases

    crop quantity, but it often lowers the quality, pollutes the land and groundwater,
    and

    poses several health risks, causing nearly 300,000 deaths worldwide each year.
    Early-stage

    disease detection using IoT-based solutions that deploy various sensors can help
    reduce

    the use of harmful chemicals. AI techniques, such as vision-based techniques using
    image

    processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, have also been proposed
    for

    disease detection automation [34].

    In recent years, signiﬁcant advances have been made in the use of deep learning

    (DL) approaches to build high-performance AI models for plant disease detection.
    Some

    lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods show promise for
    use

    in IoT applications. Despite advancements in these vision-based methods, real-world

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    8 of 15

    detection of plant diseases remains challenging due to complex backgrounds and
    varying

    environmental conditions. Crop monitoring through aerial/drone-based surveillance
    can

    be an alternative solution, but robust and reliable vision-based techniques are
    required to

    work for various crops. Expert knowledge and thorough training are required to
    recognize

    early symptoms of plant diseases and take timely action to prevent further spread
    [35].

    Plant diseases are classiﬁed into different categories, and visible symptoms are
    important

    in identifying diseases. Smart agriculture systems using AI methods for plant
    disease

    detection can be effective solutions to combat the problem of crop loss. There
    have been

    successful case studies in developing countries, but ﬁeld disease diagnosis in
    real time is

    still difﬁcult. Several models have been proposed to detect healthy and diseased
    leaves

    from various crops using CNN classiﬁcation techniques, achieving high accuracy
    [36].

    AI techniques for crop protection in agriculture have become increasingly prevalent

    in recent years, allowing for more efﬁcient and accurate identiﬁcation of pests,
    diseases,

    and soil deﬁciencies. AI sensors are now being utilized to identify and target
    weeds, with

    the appropriate herbicides then being applied to the speciﬁc area. In addition,
    integrating

    IoT sensors and supporting technologies, such as drones, geographic information
    systems

    (GISs), and other tools allow for real-time data monitoring, measurement, and
    storage.

    The aforementioned data can empower farmers by providing valuable insights into
    areas

    needing irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatment. This enables them to
    make well-

    informed decisions, effectively allocating resources and minimizing unnecessary
    expenses.

    Overall, incorporating AI techniques into agriculture use cases can lead to improved

    harvest quality, reduced herbicide usage, increased proﬁts, and signiﬁcant cost
    savings [35].

    Precision weed management is an efﬁcient tool to meet the EU targets for pesticide
    use

    reduction. In ﬁeld crops, like wheat, weed control is crucial to any plant protection

    scheme. Most of the proposed commercial technologies and prototypes for precision
    weed

    control consist of three essential elements (i) sensors for weed/crop detection,
    (ii) decision

    algorithms regarding the type of herbicides that would be the most efﬁcient, and
    (iii) a

    precise sprayer to deliver the appropriate dose of each herbicide to the targeted
    weed. Of

    the above-mentioned parts, inputs and validation of the decision algorithm are
    the most

    crucial for increasing the efﬁciency and reducing the risk of the applied herbicide
    [37].

    Saving herbicides by applying AI techniques in wheat depends on the location,
    stage, and

    distribution of the weeds [38]. The accuracy of the detected weeds could reach
    up to about

    99% [39]. Apart from weed management, scientiﬁc modeling has also been employed
    for

    forecasting in an IoT context involving fungal diseases in winter wheat [40].
    The recent

    progress in AI and automation have been applied to a machine-learning-based classiﬁcation

    approach to distinguish pests of tree crops, including the olive fruit ﬂy (Bactrocera
    oleae [41].

    In addition, online analytical processing models have been used to combine inputs
    in an

    integrated pest management scheme of olive tree crop protection [42].

    5. Beneﬁts of Utilizing AI Methods in Crop Protection

    The integration of robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) into agriculture has
    rev-

    olutionized the way crops are grown and protected. While the title “Sustainable
    Crop

    Protection via Robotics and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Solutions” suggests a focus
    on pest

    control, it is crucial to recognize that AI and robotics can contribute to comprehensive

    crop protection strategies. By leveraging these technologies, we can enhance agricultural

    practices and ensure a sustainable future for food production. While our primary
    focus

    lies in crop protection, speciﬁcally in the realms of weed and disease management,
    it is

    essential to acknowledge the broader scope of whole crop protection and monitoring.
    In

    this section, we aim to provide a concise overview of these additional components
    and

    highlight the invaluable contribution of AI solutions to these areas.

    Crop protection encompasses various factors beyond weeds and diseases that sig-

    niﬁcantly impact crop health and yield. Elements such as climate conditions, nutrition

    optimization, cultural activities, and plant physiology play crucial roles in
    ensuring com-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    9 of 15

    prehensive crop protection strategies. By leveraging AI solutions, we can unlock
    new

    possibilities and advancements in each of these areas.

    Climate adaptation and resilience: Climate change poses signiﬁcant challenges
    to

    agricultural productivity. AI and robotics can play pivotal roles in adapting
    and mitigating

    climate-related risks. Advanced algorithms can process vast amounts of climatic
    data,

    helping farmers make informed decisions about planting times, water usage, and
    crop

    selection. Robotics equipped with environmental sensors can monitor weather conditions,

    soil moisture levels, and pest outbreaks, providing real-time data to optimize
    crop manage-

    ment. With AI-driven climate modeling, farmers can anticipate weather patterns,
    allowing

    for timely adjustments and minimizing crop losses [32].

    Nutrition optimization: Achieving optimal crop nutrition is crucial for both yield
    and

    quality. AI and robotics can optimize nutrient management by analyzing soil composition,

    plant nutrient requirements, and growth patterns. Intelligent systems can monitor
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies or excesses, enabling precise application of fertilizers or other
    supplements.

    Additionally, robotics can automate tasks such as precision seeding, weeding,
    and nutrient

    delivery, minimizing waste and maximizing resource efﬁciency. By tailoring nutrition

    strategies to speciﬁc crop needs, AI and robotics contribute to sustainable agriculture
    while

    reducing environmental impacts [43].

    Cultural Activities and Labor Optimization: Agriculture encompasses a range of

    cultural activities that are essential for successful crop production. AI and
    robotics can

    automate and streamline various tasks, reducing labor-intensive efforts and optimizing

    resource allocation. For example, robotic systems can perform time-consuming activities

    such as harvesting, pruning, and sorting with greater accuracy and efﬁciency.
    By automat-

    ing repetitive tasks, farmers can focus on higher-value activities, such as crop
    planning,

    disease management, and market analysis. The integration of AI and robotics not
    only

    enhances productivity but also improves the quality of life for farmers, making
    agriculture

    a more attractive profession [44].

    Enhancing plant physiology and health: Understanding plant physiology is vital

    for effective crop protection. AI can analyze large datasets on plant physiology,
    growth

    patterns, and disease symptoms, enabling early detection and intervention. By
    analyzing

    the relationships between plant traits and environmental conditions, AI can develop
    models

    to predict plant stress and disease susceptibility. Robots equipped with cameras
    and sensors

    can precisely monitor plant health, detecting signs of nutrient deﬁciencies, water
    stress,

    or pest damage. This data-driven approach allows for proactive management strategies,

    reducing the reliance on reactive measures and promoting sustainable plant health
    [32].

    Furthermore, we outline some additional advantages of utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence

    (AI) methods in crop protection and agriculture as a whole. By enhancing precision
    agricul-

    ture, AI systems are improving the overall accuracy and quality of crop yields.
    Primarily,

    AI technology plays a role in detecting plant diseases, pests, and poor soil nutrition.
    Using

    AI-based sensors, weeds can be identiﬁed and targeted, and the appropriate herbicide

    can be applied in the area. Additionally, AI techniques allow for the collection
    of soil

    health data, fertilizer recommendations, weather monitoring, and tracking of the
    product’s

    readiness [45]. Hence, farmers are empowered to make informed decisions throughout
    the

    crop-growing process. Precision agriculture is a technique that incorporates the
    most efﬁ-

    cient soil management practices, variable rate technology, and optimal data management

    methods to help farmers enhance crop yields and minimize expenses. AI can offer
    real-time

    insights to farmers, allowing them to identify which areas require irrigation,
    fertilization,

    or pesticide treatment [46]. Additionally, innovative farming methods such as
    vertical

    agriculture can boost food production while minimizing resource usage. This approach

    reduces herbicide use, improves harvest quality, increases proﬁts, and has signiﬁcant
    cost

    savings. By employing IoT sensors and other supporting technologies, farmers can
    monitor,

    measure, and store ﬁeld data on various metrics in real time. Combining AI-based
    farming

    tools with IoT devices and software quickly provides farmers with more accurate
    informa-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    10 of 15

    tion. Having better data enables farmers to make more informed decisions, reducing
    the

    time and money spent on trial and error [47].

    6. Proposed Framework

    6.1. Background and Use Case Scenario

    Crop protection is an essential aspect of modern agriculture, and the use of fungicides,

    insecticides, and herbicides is common. However, the indiscriminate use of chemicals
    can

    lead to environmental damage and harmful effects on human health. An AI- and robotics-

    based crop protection system can provide a sustainable and efﬁcient solution to
    this prob-

    lem. The objective of this conceptual scenario is to develop an AI- and robotics-based
    crop

    protection system that minimizes the use of chemicals, chooses the most appropriate
    pesti-

    cide, and improves crop yield. The proposed methodology—as an example case—is
    applied

    to the agricultural crops colorof wheat and olive trees based on the following
    assumptions:

    (i) Major plant protection problems (pests/weeds/pathogens) of the selected crops
    (wheat

    and olive tree) have been identiﬁed (Tables 1 and 2). (ii) Registered insecticides,
    fungicides,

    and herbicides have been categorized as conventional, low-risk, and candidates
    for sub-

    stitution. It is also necessary to integrate the following: (iii) A decision support
    system

    regarding the selection of the most appropriate pesticide on an integrated pest
    management

    (IPM) system. (iv) Environmental factors affecting efﬁcacy and the environmental
    fate of

    pesticides. (v) Legislation and other policy information. The proposed crop protection

    scheme can be applied to environmentally sensitive cases (e.g., near protected
    surface- and

    ground-water bodies, sensitive non-target organisms, like bees, earthworms, and
    beneﬁcial

    microbes) or in cases of resistance to pesticides pests/pathogens/weeds.

    6.2. Concept

    The proposed concept incorporates a comprehensive and research-driven approach

    to revolutionize crop protection and enhance agricultural practices. A preliminary
    phase

    involves the creation of an extensive database that encompasses detailed information
    about

    various plant diseases, their corresponding pesticides, and the overall health
    status of plants.

    This database forms the foundation for accurately identifying the specific disease
    based

    on the symptoms exhibited by candidate plants. To ensure practical implementation,
    the

    system utilizes portable devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to provide farmers
    with

    images of diseased plants for disease recognition. In larger crop areas, a UAV
    equipped

    with visual sensors, capable of high or low-resolution imaging, can perform the
    disease- and

    pest-recognition process. Additionally, the system obtains georeferenced data
    on the examined

    plants, enabling the determination of potential disease spread to nearby crops
    within the area.

    Moreover, the system goes beyond disease identiﬁcation and extends its capabilities

    to identify weed species and distribute grassy and broadleaf weeds automatically.
    This

    information empowers the system to automatically employ AI to select the most
    appro-

    priate herbicide. In the future, selective spraying techniques utilizing UAVs
    could be

    implemented, provided that technological feasibility is achieved. This exciting
    prospect

    has the potential to revolutionize crop protection practices. The system also
    incorporates

    information on insect populations obtained from digital traps or other monitoring
    sys-

    tems. In the pesticide prioritization process, considerations regarding the pesticide
    risk to

    non-target organisms in wheat and olive agroecosystems can be considered. The
    system

    adapts to speciﬁc crop/pesticide combinations by incorporating pesticide cutoff
    criteria or

    dedicated authorization schemes aligned with national or regional legislation.

    Furthermore, the proposed system is designed to seamlessly communicate with other

    components of Agriculture 5.0. These include automatic watering functions, autonomous

    spraying robots, weather sensors, and software for optimizing spraying schedules,
    har-

    vesting, and other farming operations. By leveraging these interconnected components,

    the system aims to optimize farm protection, create a sustainable ecosystem, and
    foster a

    holistic approach to agriculture. The proposed framework is depicted in Figure
    1, highlight-

    ing the systematic ﬂowchart of the entire process. Its primary focus revolves
    around crop

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    11 of 15

    protection, which is continuously threatened by weeds, pests, and diseases. Building
    upon

    this pipeline, the aim is to establish a digital ecosystem, termed the industrial
    metaverse

    (IM) digital world, which is capable of recording the complete life cycles of
    agricultural

    crops. This digital ecosystem will gather extensive information about the rural
    environment

    by leveraging IoT, virtual reality (including augmented reality capabilities),
    cloud and edge

    computing, and other features of Industry 5.0 (Agriculture 5.0), as depicted in
    Figure 2.

    Figure 1. A ﬂowchart of the crop protection system with AI and robotics techniques.

    Figure 2. High-level architecture of a crop protection system with AI and robotics
    techniques.

    Ultimately, the industrial metaverse comprises an explainable AI system that derives

    actionable results to improve production, environmental sustainability, and economic

    status. This comprehensive approach fosters communication across the supply-value
    chain,

    enhances responsiveness to potential issues, and improves safety, production efﬁciency,

    and environmental monitoring in real time. By leveraging the power of technology
    and

    research-driven methodologies, the proposed system aims to revolutionize agriculture
    and

    pave the way for a more sustainable and efﬁcient future.

    6.3. Architecture

    The methodology of the above-described system for improving crop protection is

    based on extensive research and aims to provide a convincing and actionable solution.

    The proposed architecture encompasses various data collection techniques and advanced

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    12 of 15

    technologies, as illustrated in Figure 2. The agriculture ﬁeld’s digital transformation
    begins

    with IoT sensors for irrigation and weather monitoring. These sensors gather real-time
    data

    on soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and other relevant factors. Additionally,

    AI techniques are employed to recognize plant diseases based on visual cues and
    patterns,

    allowing for early detection and timely intervention. The production evolution
    aspect

    involves monitoring and analyzing crop growth and development over time.

    The AI- and robotics-based crop protection system comprises several modules that

    work in tandem to enhance agricultural practices:

    Data collection module: To generate valuable insights, the system collects data
    from

    diverse sources, including weather reports, soil sensors, satellite imagery, and
    digital insect

    traps. This comprehensive dataset enables accurate predictions of pest infestations,
    disease

    outbreaks, weed growth, and weather conditions.

    Machine learning model development and interpretation module: This module

    involves the creation of automated systems that process data and derive meaningful

    conclusions. The system provides clear and actionable insights to guide decision-making

    by interpreting results from machine learning models.

    Decision-making module: AI algorithms analyze the collected data and determine

    appropriate crop protection strategies. Factors considered include crop type,
    growth stage,

    severity of pests, weeds, or diseases, as well as environmental and risk assessment
    aspects

    related to pesticide use. Legislative limitations and the potential development
    of pesticide

    resistance are also taken into account.

    Robot module: The system can be integrated into autonomous robots equipped

    with sensors, cameras, and spraying equipment. Through the use of machine learning

    algorithms, these robots are trained to accurately identify and target pests,
    weeds, and

    diseases, optimizing the effectiveness of crop protection strategies.

    Monitoring module: AI is leveraged to monitor the effectiveness of crop protection

    strategies and make necessary adjustments in real time. This continuous monitoring

    ensures optimal performance and enables timely intervention when needed.

    User interface module: To facilitate communication between farmers, agricultural

    scientists, and other stakeholders, a user interface is provided. This interface
    presents the

    system’s ﬁndings and suggestions, allowing users to provide input and customize
    results

    according to their speciﬁc needs.

    The above system will have the modularity and agility to integrate other modules,
    for

    example, blockchain and NFT development platforms, with the aim of achieving the
    traceability

    of foods. The AI- and robotics-based crop protection systems hold immense potential
    to

    revolutionize crop protection practices while minimizing the detrimental impact
    of chemical

    use on the environment and human health. The system maximizes crop yields and
    promotes

    sustainable agricultural practices by enabling farmers to make informed decisions
    about

    their crop protection strategies. However, implementing this system requires extensive

    research and development to continually improve its efﬁciency and effectiveness.

    7. Discussion

    Crop protection is a critical aspect of agriculture that involves safeguarding
    crops

    against various threats, including pests, diseases, and weeds. Traditional crop
    protection

    methods involve using fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, which can adversely
    affect

    the environment and human health. However, with the advent of robotics and artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), farmers now have new tools at their disposal to improve crop
    protection

    and increase yields. Robotic- and AI-based crop protection solutions involve using
    sensors,

    cameras, and machine learning algorithms to monitor crops and detect potential
    threats.

    These solutions offer several advantages over traditional methods, such as increased

    accuracy, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness. For example, robots equipped with
    sensors

    can detect pest infestations and apply targeted treatments only where necessary,
    reducing

    the number of chemicals used and minimizing the environmental impact. Furthermore,

    AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data on weather patterns, soil conditions,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    13 of 15

    and crop growth to predict potential threats and recommend preventive measures.
    This

    comprehensive approach enables farmers to make well-informed decisions regarding

    crop protection. It empowers them to effectively identify issues, choose the most
    suitable

    pesticide and application technology, and implement a reduced-risk crop protection
    scheme.

    Robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection also offer the potential for
    in-

    creased precision and automation, reducing the labor costs and time required for
    manual

    inspection and treatment. For example, drones equipped with cameras and sensors
    can

    survey large areas of crops quickly and efﬁciently, providing real-time data on
    crop health

    and potential threats. In addition, robotic- and AI-based solutions can provide
    farmers

    with real-time insights into the health and growth of their crops, enabling them
    to make

    more informed decisions and optimize crop management practices. For example, machine

    learning algorithms can analyze data on crop growth and identify patterns and
    trends

    that may not be immediately apparent to human observers. Despite the many advantages

    of robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection, some challenges still
    need to be

    addressed. For example, these solutions may require signiﬁcant investments in
    terms of

    hardware, software, and training. Additionally, there may be concerns about data
    privacy

    and security, particularly regarding sensitive information about crop yield and
    growth.

    In conclusion, robotic- and AI-based solutions have the potential to revolutionize
    crop

    protection and management, offering increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness.

    However, it will be essential to continue to develop these technologies and address
    any

    challenges to ensure that they are widely accessible to farmers and that they
    contribute to

    sustainable and ethical agriculture practices.

    8. Conclusions

    In conclusion, integrating robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions into crop
    protec-

    tion is a promising avenue for addressing modern agriculture’s challenges. The
    potential ad-

    vantages of these technologies include increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness,

    as well as better monitoring and management of crop health. Looking to the future,
    several

    research areas could further enhance the effectiveness of these solutions. For
    example, the

    development of more advanced sensors and cameras, as well as improvements in machine

    learning algorithms, could enable more precise and accurate monitoring of crop
    health

    and growth. Additionally, advances in robotics could allow for more sophisticated
    and

    automated treatment of crops, reducing the need for manual labor. Another important
    area

    of future work is the integration of these technologies with existing agricultural
    practices

    and infrastructure, including relevant legislation, risk assessment, and environmental
    as-

    pects of AI modules. The availability of pesticide databases and alternative crop
    protection

    measures will help establish a robust machine learning model. This will require
    collabora-

    tion between farmers, agronomists, technology developers, and policymakers to
    ensure

    that the beneﬁts of these solutions are accessible to all and contribute to sustainable
    and

    ethical agriculture practices. Finally, addressing data privacy and security concerns
    will

    be essential, particularly regarding sensitive crop yield and growth information.
    This will

    require the development of robust data protection and governance frameworks and
    greater

    awareness among farmers and other stakeholders about the risks and beneﬁts of
    these

    technologies. Hence, the use of robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions in
    crop protection

    has the potential to transform modern agriculture and ensure food security in
    the face of

    global challenges, such as climate change and population growth. Continued research

    and development in this area and integrating these technologies into existing
    agricultural

    practices will be crucial to realizing this potential and creating a more sustainable
    and

    resilient agricultural system for the future.

    \ \n1. Introduction\nSmart farming, also known as precision agriculture, is an\
    \ innovative approach to agricultural practices that leverages \nadvanced technologies\
    \ to optimize efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in farming operations\
    \ [1]-[4]. As shown \nin Fig. 1, it involves the integration of various technologies,\
    \ such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), \ndata analytics,\
    \ robotics, and remote sensing, to make informed decisions and automate processes\
    \ in agricultural \nsystems. The primary goal of smart farming is to enhance crop\
    \ production, minimize resource waste, reduce \nenvironmental impact, and improve\
    \ overall profitability. By utilizing a network of interconnected devices and\
    \ sensors \n[5], farmers can collect real-time data on various factors such as\
    \ soil moisture levels, weather conditions, crop health, \nand pest infestations.\
    \ This data is then analyzed to provide actionable insights, allowing farmers\
    \ to make data-driven \ndecisions and implement precise interventions [6]-[8].\
    \ \nOne of the key components of smart farming is the use of IoT devices and sensors.\
    \ These devices are deployed \nthroughout the farmland to monitor and control\
    \ different variables [8]-[11]. For instance, soil moisture sensors can \nprovide\
    \ information about the water requirements of crops, enabling farmers to apply\
    \ water precisely where and when \nit is needed, reducing water wastage. Similarly,\
    \ weather stations and satellite imagery can offer accurate and localized \nweather\
    \ data, helping farmers optimize planting schedules and manage crop diseases.\
    \ \nAccording to [12], artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in smart farming\
    \ by analyzing the collected data and \nproviding intelligent recommendations.\
    \ Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and correlations in the data,\
    \ \nenabling predictive models for crop growth, pest outbreaks, and yield estimation\
    \ [13]-[16]. This information assists \nfarmers in making informed decisions regarding\
    \ the optimal use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, leading to \n\
    improved resource management and reduced environmental impact. As explained in\
    \ [17], robots and drones can be \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,\
    \ 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1208 \nutilized in smart farming to automate labor-intensive\
    \ tasks. Robots can perform activities like seeding, weeding, and \nharvesting\
    \ with precision and efficiency, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing\
    \ productivity [18]-[20]. As \nshown in Fig.2, drones equipped with cameras and\
    \ sensors [21] can gather high-resolution images and collect data over \nlarge\
    \ areas, helping farmers monitor crop health, detect early signs of diseases or\
    \ nutrient deficiencies, and identify \nareas requiring attention. \n \nFigure\
    \ 1 Typical smart agriculture scenario \n \nFigure 2 Drones in smart agriculture\
    \ \nResearchers in [22] point out that smart agriculture relies on various sensors\
    \ to collect real-time data about \nenvironmental conditions, crop health, soil\
    \ characteristics, and livestock parameters. These sensors provide critical \n\
    insights that enable farmers to make informed decisions and optimize farming practices.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 3, examples \nof sensors commonly used in smart agriculture\
    \ include weather sensors, soil moisture sensors, soil pH sensors, nutrient \n\
    sensors, crop health sensors, light sensors, livestock monitoring sensors, water\
    \ quality sensors, gas sensors and insect \ntraps sensors. Here, weather sensors\
    \ measure atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind\
    \ \nspeed, and solar radiation [23]–[26]. They help farmers understand weather\
    \ patterns, predict storms, and optimize \nirrigation schedules based on evapo-transpiration\
    \ rates. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors measure the water \ncontent\
    \ in the soil, allowing farmers to monitor [27] soil moisture levels and determine\
    \ irrigation needs. These sensors \nhelp prevent overwatering or underwatering,\
    \ optimize water usage, and prevent water stress in crops. However, soil \npH\
    \ sensors measure the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. By monitoring soil pH,\
    \ farmers can determine the soil's nutrient \navailability and adjust soil amendments\
    \ accordingly [28]. Maintaining optimal pH levels is crucial for healthy plant\
    \ \ngrowth and nutrient uptake. As explained in [29], nutrient sensors measure\
    \ the concentration of essential nutrients in \nthe soil, such as nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ and potassium. These sensors provide valuable data for precise fertilizer \n\
    application, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of nutrients for optimal\
    \ growth and yield. On the other hand, \ncrop health sensors detect indicators\
    \ of plant stress, diseases, and pests [30]. They can measure parameters such\
    \ as leaf \ntemperature, chlorophyll content, and vegetation indices to assess\
    \ crop health and detect early signs of disease or pest \ninfestation. This data\
    \ helps farmers take timely preventive measures and implement targeted pest management\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1209 \nstrategies. On their part, light sensors measure the intensity and quality\
    \ of light in the crop canopy [31]. They provide \ninformation about photosynthetic\
    \ activity, plant growth stages, and light requirements. This data helps optimize\
    \ \nlighting conditions in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems, such\
    \ as greenhouses or vertical farms. On the \nother hand, livestock monitoring\
    \ sensors are used to track parameters related to animal health and well-being\
    \ [32]. For \nexample, temperature sensors [33] can monitor body temperature,\
    \ activity sensors can track animal movement, and \nrumen pH sensors can assess\
    \ digestive health in ruminant animals. Livestock sensors enable early detection\
    \ of health \nissues and support proactive animal management. \n \nFigure 3 Smart\
    \ agriculture \nWater quality sensors measure parameters such as pH, dissolved\
    \ oxygen, conductivity, and turbidity in irrigation water \nsources or aquaculture\
    \ systems [34]. Monitoring water quality ensures that crops or aquatic organisms\
    \ receive clean \nand suitable water, preventing adverse effects on plant health\
    \ or aquatic ecosystems. However, gas sensors detect and \nmeasure the concentration\
    \ of gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene, which are important indicators\
    \ of plant \nrespiration and ripening processes [35]. Gas sensors can be used\
    \ to optimize storage conditions and shelf life of \nharvested crops. On their\
    \ part, insect traps equipped with sensors and lures capture and monitor insect\
    \ populations \n[36]. These sensors help farmers assess pest infestation levels,\
    \ identify specific pest species, and implement targeted \npest management strategies.\
    \ These sensors, among others, provide critical data points that enable farmers\
    \ to monitor \nand manage agricultural systems effectively. Integrating sensor\
    \ data with advanced analytics and decision support \nsystems empowers farmers\
    \ to optimize resource allocation, improve crop yields, and make informed decisions\
    \ for \nsustainable and efficient farming practices. \nIn a nutshell, smart farming\
    \ holds great promise for transforming agriculture into a more sustainable and\
    \ productive \nindustry. By harnessing the power of technology and data, farmers\
    \ can optimize their operations, improve crop yields, \nconserve resources, minimize\
    \ environmental impact, and contribute to global food security in a rapidly evolving\
    \ world.  \nIn this paper, an extensive review of the current status of smart\
    \ agriculture technologies and their security posture is \ngiven. Towards the\
    \ end of this paper, some research gaps are identified which needs to be filled\
    \ by future researches.  \n2. Need for smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ or precision agriculture, is increasingly becoming a necessity due to several\
    \ pressing challenges and \nneeds in the agricultural sector. Table 1 discusses\
    \ some key reasons why smart agriculture is crucial. \n \n \nWorld Journal of\
    \ Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1210 \nTable 1 Necessity\
    \ of smart agriculture \nNecessity \nDiscussion \nResource Scarcity \nResources\
    \ such as water, land, and energy are limited and face increasing pressure due\
    \ to \npopulation growth and climate change [37]. Smart agriculture enables precise\
    \ resource \nmanagement, minimizing waste and maximizing the efficient [38] use\
    \ of inputs like water, \nfertilizers, and energy. \nCost Optimization \nTraditional\
    \ farming practices often involve overuse or misuse of inputs, leading to higher\
    \ \ncosts [39]. Smart agriculture allows farmers to make data-driven decisions,\
    \ optimizing the \nuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and water, thereby reducing\
    \ costs and increasing profitability \n[40]. \nLabor Efficiency and \nSafety \n\
    Farm labor shortages are a significant challenge in many regions. Smart agriculture\
    \ \nintroduces automation and robotics, reducing the reliance on manual labor\
    \ for tasks such \nas planting, weeding, and harvesting. This not only improves\
    \ efficiency [43] but also \nenhances worker safety by minimizing exposure to\
    \ hazardous conditions. \nClimate Change and \nEnvironmental \nSustainability\
    \ \nClimate change impacts agriculture through extreme weather events, changing\
    \ rainfall \npatterns, and the spread of pests and diseases. Smart agriculture\
    \ helps farmers adapt to \nclimate change by providing real-time data on weather\
    \ conditions, enabling timely \ninterventions, and reducing environmental impact\
    \ through optimized resource usage [44], \n[45]. \nTraceability \nand \nQuality\
    \ Assurance \nConsumers are increasingly concerned about the origin and quality\
    \ of the food they \nconsume [46], [47]. Smart agriculture technologies enable\
    \ improved traceability [48], \nallowing farmers to track the entire supply chain,\
    \ ensure food safety, and provide \ntransparent information to consumers. \nData-Driven\
    \ Decision \nMaking \nSmart agriculture generates vast amounts of data through\
    \ sensors, drones, and satellite \nimagery [49], [50]. Analyzing this data using\
    \ AI and data analytics helps farmers gain \nvaluable insights, make informed\
    \ decisions, and optimize farming practices for better \noutcomes [51]. \nPopulation\
    \ \nGrowth \nand Food Demand \nThe global population is projected to reach 9.7\
    \ billion by 2050, which will significantly \nincrease the demand for food. Smart\
    \ agriculture offers a way to increase agricultural \nproductivity and efficiency\
    \ to meet this growing demand [52]. \nCrop Monitoring and \nManagement \nSmart\
    \ agriculture technologies enable continuous monitoring [53] of crops, including\
    \ \nfactors like soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels. This data-driven\
    \ approach helps \nfarmers detect crop stress, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies\
    \ early on, allowing timely \ninterventions and reducing crop losses [54], [55].\
    \ \n \nBasically, the need for smart agriculture arises from the need to address\
    \ challenges such as population growth, resource \nscarcity, climate change, cost\
    \ optimization, and labor efficiency. By integrating advanced technologies, smart\
    \ agriculture \noffers the potential to transform traditional farming practices\
    \ into more sustainable, productive, and environmentally \nfriendly systems. \n\
    2.1. Technologies driving smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture is driven by various\
    \ technologies that enable advanced monitoring, automation, and decision-making\
    \ \nin agricultural practices. These technologies play a crucial role in optimizing\
    \ resource management, improving crop \nyields, and enhancing overall efficiency\
    \ in farming operations. Some of the prominent key driving technologies in smart\
    \ \nagriculture are presented in Fig. 4 and are discussed in the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n2.1.1. Internet of Things (IoT) \nIoT technology forms the backbone\
    \ of smart agriculture by connecting physical devices and sensors to the internet,\
    \ \nenabling data collection and remote monitoring [56]-[58]. IoT devices such\
    \ as weather stations, soil moisture sensors, \nand crop health sensors provide\
    \ real-time data on environmental conditions, plant growth, and livestock health.\
    \ This \ndata enables farmers to make data-driven decisions and optimize resource\
    \ allocation [59]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03),\
    \ 1207–1231 \n1211 \n \nFigure 4 Key technological drivers for smart agriculture\
    \ \n2.1.2. Remote Sensing and Satellite Imaging \nRemote sensing technologies,\
    \ including satellite imaging and aerial drones, provide valuable insights into\
    \ crop health, \nwater stress, and pest infestation [60]-[62]. These technologies\
    \ capture high-resolution images and multispectral data, \nallowing farmers to\
    \ monitor large agricultural areas and detect anomalies or crop stress indicators.\
    \ Remote sensing \nhelps in early pest detection, disease prevention, and precision\
    \ agriculture practices. \n2.1.3. Big Data Analytics \nThe ability to process\
    \ and analyze large volumes of data is vital in smart agriculture. Big data analytics\
    \ techniques \nextract meaningful insights from various data sources, including\
    \ weather data, soil data, sensor data, and historical crop \nrecords [63]-[67].\
    \ By analyzing this data, farmers can gain valuable insights into crop performance,\
    \ predict yield \noutcomes, optimize irrigation and fertilization, and identify\
    \ trends for better decision-making. \n2.1.4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\
    \ Machine Learning (ML) \nAI and ML technologies are instrumental in smart agriculture\
    \ applications. AI-powered algorithms and ML models can \nanalyze vast amounts\
    \ of data and generate predictive models for disease outbreak detection, crop\
    \ yield forecasting, and \npest management [68]-[71]. These technologies enable\
    \ automated decision-making, real-time monitoring, and \nautonomous operations\
    \ in smart agriculture systems. \n2.1.5. Robotics and Automation \nRobotics and\
    \ automation technologies are transforming traditional farming practices [72].\
    \ Autonomous robots and \ndrones equipped with sensors and cameras can perform\
    \ tasks like seeding, spraying, and harvesting with precision and \nefficiency\
    \ [73]-[76]. Robotic systems can also assist in weed detection and removal, reducing\
    \ the need for manual labor \nand minimizing the use of chemical herbicides. \n\
    2.1.6. Precision Agriculture and Variable Rate Technology (VRT) \nPrecision agriculture\
    \ utilizes technology to optimize resource application based on specific field\
    \ conditions [77]. VRT \nsystems analyze data from sensors [78] and mapping tools\
    \ to precisely deliver inputs such as water, fertilizers, and \npesticides. This\
    \ technology ensures that resources are used efficiently, minimizing waste and\
    \ environmental impact \nwhile maximizing crop productivity. \n2.1.7. Cloud Computing\
    \ and Edge Computing \nCloud computing enables the storage, processing, and analysis\
    \ of agricultural data on remote servers, providing \nscalability and accessibility\
    \ [79]-[83]. Edge computing, on the other hand, brings computing capabilities\
    \ closer to the \ndata source, reducing latency and enabling real-time decision-making\
    \ at the field level. Both cloud and edge computing \nsupport the seamless integration\
    \ of data from various sources and enable efficient data management and analysis\
    \ in \nsmart agriculture. \n2.1.8. Agricultural Robotics and Sensing \nAdvanced\
    \ robotic systems equipped with sophisticated sensors and actuators have the potential\
    \ to revolutionize \nagricultural practices [84], [85]. These systems can perform\
    \ tasks such as selective harvesting, precision spraying, and \nWorld Journal\
    \ of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1212 \nsoil sampling\
    \ with high accuracy and efficiency. Sensing technologies, including hyperspectral\
    \ imaging and \nmultispectral cameras, enable detailed crop analysis and monitoring.\
    \ \nIt is important to note that these  technologies are continuously evolving\
    \ and becoming more sophisticated, enabling \nfarmers to make data-driven decisions,\
    \ optimize resource allocation, and improve overall agricultural productivity.\
    \ As \nthese technologies continue to advance, they hold immense potential to\
    \ address the global challenges of food security, \nsustainable agriculture, and\
    \ environmental conservation. \n3. General challenges in smart agriculture \n\
    Although smart agriculture brings numerous benefits, there are several challenges\
    \ that need to be addressed for its \nwidespread adoption and successful implementation.\
    \ Some of the general challenges in smart agriculture are described \nin the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n3.1.1.  High Initial Investment \nThe upfront costs of implementing\
    \ smart agriculture technologies can be a significant barrier for many farmers,\
    \ \nespecially small-scale and resource-constrained operations. The cost of purchasing\
    \ and installing sensors, IoT devices, \ndrones, robotics, and data management\
    \ systems can be prohibitive [86], [87]. Governments, organizations, and \nstakeholders\
    \ need to provide financial support, incentives, and subsidies to make these technologies\
    \ more accessible. \n3.1.2. Limited Technical Expertise \nSmart agriculture requires\
    \ a certain level of technical expertise in areas such as data analytics, AI,\
    \ and IoT [88]-[91]. \nHowever, many farmers may lack the necessary knowledge\
    \ and skills to effectively implement and utilize these \ntechnologies. Training\
    \ programs, workshops, and educational initiatives are crucial to bridge this\
    \ knowledge gap and \nempower farmers to leverage smart agriculture solutions\
    \ effectively. \n3.1.3. Connectivity and Infrastructure \nSmart agriculture heavily\
    \ relies on reliable and high-speed internet connectivity, especially in rural\
    \ areas [92]. However, \nin some regions, internet infrastructure is inadequate\
    \ or nonexistent. Poor connectivity can hinder real-time data \ncollection, remote\
    \ monitoring [93], and the seamless operation of IoT devices [94], [95]. Governments\
    \ and private \nstakeholders must invest in improving rural connectivity to ensure\
    \ widespread adoption of smart agriculture. \n3.1.4. Data Privacy and Security\
    \ \nSmart agriculture involves the collection, storage, and analysis of vast amounts\
    \ of data, including sensitive information \nabout crops, farms, and farmers [96]-[99].\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount to protect farmers' and \nconsumers'\
    \ interests. Strong data encryption, secure cloud storage, and robust cybersecurity\
    \ measures must be \nimplemented to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches,\
    \ and misuse of information. \n3.1.5. Data Interoperability and Integration \n\
    Smart agriculture systems often involve multiple technologies and platforms, which\
    \ may use different data formats and \nprotocols [100]-[104]. Ensuring seamless\
    \ data interoperability and integration across various systems can be \nchallenging.\
    \ Standardization of data formats, open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces),\
    \ and data-sharing \nprotocols are essential for efficient data exchange and collaboration\
    \ between different smart agriculture solutions. \n3.1.6. Adoption and User Acceptance\
    \ \nFarmers may be resistant to change or skeptical about adopting new technologies.\
    \ Lack of awareness, concerns about \ntechnology reliability, and the perceived\
    \ complexity of smart agriculture solutions can hinder adoption rates [105]-\n\
    [109]. Demonstrating the tangible benefits, providing training and support, and\
    \ showcasing successful case studies are \ncrucial to building trust and encouraging\
    \ widespread adoption. \n3.1.7. Data Management and Analysis \nSmart agriculture\
    \ generates large volumes of data, and effectively managing, analyzing, and interpreting\
    \ this data can \nbe overwhelming [110]-[114]. Farmers need user-friendly data\
    \ management tools and analytics platforms that can \nprocess and present data\
    \ in a meaningful way, providing actionable insights. Simplified data visualization,\
    \ user-friendly \ninterfaces, and user training can help farmers effectively utilize\
    \ the data generated. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023,\
    \ 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1213 \n3.1.8. Regulatory and Policy Frameworks \nAs smart\
    \ agriculture involves the use of new technologies, regulatory frameworks need\
    \ to keep pace with these \nadvancements. Issues related to data ownership, data\
    \ sharing, privacy regulations, and standardization should be \naddressed through\
    \ appropriate policies [115]-[117]. Governments need to establish clear guidelines\
    \ and regulations to \nensure ethical and responsible use of smart agriculture\
    \ technologies. \nBy addressing these challenges, stakeholders can promote the\
    \ adoption of smart agriculture and leverage its potential \nto revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural sector, improve productivity, and achieve sustainable and efficient\
    \ food production. \n3.2. Security issues in smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ like any other technological system, is susceptible to various security issues\
    \ that need to be addressed \nto ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability\
    \ of data and operations [118], [119]. Fig. 5 shows the various \nlayers of the\
    \ smart agriculture environment. \n \nFigure 5 Smart agriculture environment layers\
    \ \nAccording to [120], some of these security issues specific to smart agriculture\
    \ include unauthorized access, data privacy \nand confidentiality, data integrity,\
    \ network security, device security, physical security, supply chain security,\
    \ as well as \nawareness and training. Fig. 6 shows the layered depiction of these\
    \ smart agriculture security challenges. Unauthorized \nindividuals gaining access\
    \ to smart agriculture systems can disrupt operations, manipulate data, or even\
    \ cause physical \ndamage [122]-[123]. It is crucial to implement strong access\
    \ controls, such as secure authentication mechanisms, to \nprevent unauthorized\
    \ access to devices, networks, and data [124]. On the other hand, authors in [125]\
    \ explain that \nsmart agriculture involves the collection and storage of sensitive\
    \ data, including farm management information, crop \nyields, and farmer details.\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and confidentiality is essential to protect farmers' and\
    \ consumers' \ninterests. Robust encryption techniques, secure storage, and proper\
    \ data access controls should be implemented to \nsafeguard sensitive information\
    \ [126]-[129]. In addition, maintaining the integrity of data is crucial in smart\
    \ agriculture \nsystems. This is because any unauthorized modification, tampering,\
    \ or corruption of data can lead to incorrect decisions \nand impact the overall\
    \ farming operations. Implementing data validation mechanisms, digital signatures,\
    \ and secure \ncommunication channels can help ensure data integrity [130]-[134].\
    \ As explained in [135], smart agriculture systems \nrely on networks and communication\
    \ channels for data transmission. These networks are vulnerable to various threats\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1214 \nsuch as eavesdropping, data interception, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\
    \ [136]-[139]. Implementing secure \nnetwork protocols, firewalls, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, and regular network monitoring are essential to protect \nagainst network-based\
    \ attacks. \n \nFigure 6 Layered security challenges in smart agriculture \nIoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators play a significant role in smart agriculture\
    \ [140]-[144]. However, these devices can \nbe potential entry points for attackers.\
    \ Ensuring the security of these devices through measures like strong \nauthentication,\
    \ regular firmware updates, and secure configurations is crucial to prevent unauthorized\
    \ access and \ncompromise of the entire system. Researchers in [145] discuss that\
    \ smart agriculture systems may include physical \ninfrastructure like weather\
    \ stations, drones, and robots. Securing these physical assets from theft, vandalism,\
    \ or \nphysical tampering is vital. Implementing access controls, surveillance\
    \ systems, and physical barriers can help protect \nthe physical components of\
    \ smart agriculture. On their part, the authors in [146] argue that smart agriculture\
    \ systems \nrely on various vendors and suppliers for hardware, software, and\
    \ services. Ensuring the security of the entire supply \nchain is crucial to prevent\
    \ the introduction of compromised or malicious components [147], [148]. Conducting\
    \ thorough \nvendor assessments, implementing secure development practices, and\
    \ performing regular security audits are important \nfor maintaining a secure\
    \ supply chain. In addition, human error and lack of awareness can contribute\
    \ to security \nvulnerabilities [149]. Farmers and operators should receive proper\
    \ training and awareness programs to understand \nsecurity best practices, identify\
    \ potential threats, and respond to security incidents promptly. \nAddressing\
    \ these security issues requires a multi-layered approach that combines technical\
    \ controls, policies, training, \nand regular security assessments. Collaboration\
    \ between farmers, technology providers, and cybersecurity experts is \ncrucial\
    \ to identify and mitigate security risks, ensuring the safe and secure implementation\
    \ of smart agriculture systems. \n4. Ways of securing smart agriculture \nSecuring\
    \ smart agriculture systems involves implementing various techniques and best\
    \ practices to protect data, \ndevices, and infrastructure. Table 2 describes\
    \ some techniques for securing smart agriculture. \nTable 2 Techniques for securing\
    \ smart agriculture \nTechnique \nDescription \nStrong Authentication \nand Access\
    \ Controls \nImplement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor\
    \ authentication, to \nensure that only authorized individuals can access the\
    \ smart agriculture system [150]-\n[154]. Additionally, enforce strict access\
    \ controls to limit privileges and restrict access to \nsensitive data and critical\
    \ functionalities. \nRegular Patching and \nUpdates \nKeep all software, firmware,\
    \ and operating systems up to date with the latest security \npatches [155]-[158].\
    \ Regularly update IoT devices, sensors, and other components to \naddress any\
    \ known vulnerabilities [159] and ensure that they are running on the most \n\
    secure versions. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03),\
    \ 1207–1231 \n1215 \nNetwork Segmentation \nSegment the smart agriculture network\
    \ into different zones or subnets to separate critical \ncomponents, such as IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data storage systems [160]-[163]. This helps \ncontain\
    \ security breaches and limits unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the network.\
    \ \nSecure Communication \nChannels \n \nUse secure protocols and encryption techniques\
    \ (e.g., SSL/TLS) to ensure the \nconfidentiality and integrity of data transmitted\
    \ between devices, sensors, and the central \nsystem [164]-[168]. Secure communication\
    \ channels prevent eavesdropping, data \ninterception, and tampering during data\
    \ transmission. \nPhysical \nSecurity \nMeasures \nSecure physical components\
    \ of smart agriculture systems, including weather stations, \ndrones, and robots,\
    \ to prevent theft, tampering, or unauthorized access [169]. Implement \nphysical\
    \ barriers, surveillance systems, and access controls to protect physical assets\
    \ \n[170]-[173]. \nEmployee Training and \nAwareness \nProvide comprehensive training\
    \ programs to farmers, operators, and other stakeholders \nto raise awareness\
    \ about security best practices, social engineering threats, and safe \nhandling\
    \ of data and devices. Educate users about potential risks and how to identify\
    \ and \nreport security incidents [174]. \nSecurity \nMonitoring \nand Incident\
    \ Response \nImplement robust monitoring tools and techniques to continuously\
    \ monitor the smart \nagriculture system for potential security incidents [175].\
    \ Establish an incident response \nplan to handle security breaches, including\
    \ procedures for investigation, containment, \neradication, and recovery [176]-[178].\
    \ \nIntrusion \nDetection \nand \nPrevention \nSystems \nDeploy intrusion detection\
    \ and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor network traffic, \ndetect suspicious\
    \ activities, and prevent potential attacks [179], [180]. IDPS can identify \n\
    and respond to malicious behavior, such as unauthorized access [181] attempts\
    \ or \nabnormal data patterns. \nData Encryption and \nPrivacy \n \nImplement\
    \ strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in \n\
    transit. Encrypt data stored on devices, databases, and cloud storage to prevent\
    \ \nunauthorized access [182]-[186]. Also, ensure compliance with privacy regulations\
    \ and \nestablish clear policies on data handling and sharing. \nRegular \nSecurity\
    \ \nAssessments \nConduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and\
    \ vulnerability scanning to \nidentify and address any potential weaknesses in\
    \ the smart agriculture system [187]-[191]. \nRegular assessments help ensure\
    \ that security measures are up to date and effective in \nprotecting against\
    \ emerging threats. \n \nBy implementing these techniques, smart agriculture systems\
    \ can significantly enhance their security posture and \nprotect against potential\
    \ threats, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and\
    \ operations. \n5. Issues with current smart agriculture protection techniques\
    \ \nThere are several protection techniques available for securing smart agriculture\
    \ systems. However, there are still some \nissues and challenges associated with\
    \ their implementation. The following sub-sections discuss some common issues\
    \ \nwith current smart agriculture protection techniques. \n5.1 Lack of Standardization\
    \ \nThe smart agriculture industry lacks standardized security protocols and frameworks,\
    \ making it challenging to ensure \nconsistent and interoperable security measures\
    \ across different systems and devices [192], [193]. The absence of \nwidely accepted\
    \ standards hinders seamless integration and can lead to compatibility issues\
    \ when implementing \nsecurity solutions. \n5.2 Limited Security Awareness and\
    \ Expertise \nMany farmers and agricultural professionals may have limited knowledge\
    \ and awareness of cybersecurity risks and \nbest practices. The lack of security\
    \ expertise among end-users can result in improper implementation of security\
    \ \nmeasures, such as weak passwords, misconfigurations, or failure to update\
    \ software/firmware promptly [194], [195]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research\
    \ and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1216 \n5.3 Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices\
    \ \nIoT devices used in smart agriculture systems may have inherent security vulnerabilities\
    \ [196]. These vulnerabilities \ncan be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized\
    \ access, manipulate data, or disrupt operations [196]-[199]. The rapid \nproliferation\
    \ of IoT devices and their diverse manufacturers make it challenging to ensure\
    \ consistent security standards \nacross all devices. \n5.4 Complexity and Cost\
    \ \nImplementing comprehensive security measures can be complex and expensive\
    \ for farmers, particularly small-scale \noperations with limited budgets. The\
    \ costs associated with purchasing, deploying, and maintaining security solutions\
    \ \ncan be prohibitive, deterring widespread adoption of robust security measures\
    \ [200], [201]. \n5.5 Legacy Systems and Infrastructure \nMany agricultural systems\
    \ still rely on legacy equipment and infrastructure that may not have built-in\
    \ security features \nor support modern security protocols [202], [203]. Integrating\
    \ security solutions with existing legacy systems can be \nchallenging and may\
    \ require additional investments in upgrading or replacing outdated components\
    \ [204]. \n5.6 Lack of Security Updates and Support \nSome smart agriculture solutions\
    \ may lack regular security updates and ongoing support from vendors [205]-[207].\
    \ \nThis can leave systems vulnerable to emerging threats, as security patches\
    \ and updates are essential for addressing \nnewly discovered vulnerabilities\
    \ and ensuring the long-term security of the system. \n5.7 Physical Security Risks\
    \ \nWhile digital security is crucial, physical security risks in smart agriculture\
    \ systems cannot be overlooked [209], [210]. \nComponents such as sensors, drones,\
    \ or weather stations are vulnerable to physical tampering, theft, or damage.\
    \ \nEnsuring adequate physical security measures, such as access controls and\
    \ surveillance, is essential but can be \nchallenging in remote or expansive farming\
    \ environments. \n5.8 Integration and Compatibility Challenges \nSmart agriculture\
    \ systems often involve the integration of various technologies, platforms, and\
    \ third-party solutions. \nEnsuring seamless integration and compatibility between\
    \ different components can be complex, as they may have \ndifferent security requirements,\
    \ protocols, or interfaces [211]-[214]. Incompatibility issues can create security\
    \ gaps and \nincrease the risk of vulnerabilities. \nAddressing these issues requires\
    \ collaborative efforts between technology providers, agricultural stakeholders,\
    \ and \npolicymakers. It involves promoting security standards and best practices,\
    \ providing security training and awareness \nprograms, encouraging security-by-design\
    \ principles in IoT device manufacturing, and fostering partnerships to \ndevelop\
    \ cost-effective security solutions tailored for the agricultural sector [215]-[219].\
    \ \n6. Future research scope \nBased on the shortcomings of the current smart\
    \ agriculture defense mechanisms, future research can explore several \nareas\
    \ to enhance the protection of agricultural systems and address emerging challenges.\
    \ Some potential research \nscopes include the following: \n6.1 Threat Modeling\
    \ and Risk Assessment \nThere is need to develop advanced threat modeling techniques\
    \ specific to smart agriculture systems to identify potential \nvulnerabilities\
    \ and attack vectors [220]-[225]. Conduct comprehensive risk assessments to understand\
    \ the potential \nimpact of security breaches and prioritize security measures\
    \ accordingly. \n6.2 Blockchain Technology \nInvestigate the applicability of\

    \ in smart agriculture pose significant challenges that need to be addressed to\
    \ ensure the integrity, \nconfidentiality, and availability of data and operations.\
    \ The protection of smart agriculture systems is crucial to prevent \nunauthorized\
    \ access, data breaches, tampering, and disruption of farming operations. This\
    \ paper has highlighted several \nfactors that contribute to the complexity and\
    \ vulnerability of these systems. For example, lack of standardized security \n\
    World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1218\
    \ \nprotocols and frameworks, limited security awareness and expertise among farmers,\
    \ and vulnerabilities in IoT devices \nhave been shown to be major concerns. Additionally,\
    \ the complexity and cost associated with implementing \ncomprehensive security\
    \ measures, legacy systems and infrastructure, and the need for regular security\
    \ updates and \nsupport pose additional challenges. Physical security risks and\
    \ integration and compatibility issues further compound \nthe security landscape\
    \ of smart agriculture. To overcome these challenges, future research and development\
    \ efforts \nshould focus on threat modeling, risk assessment, blockchain technology,\
    \ secure data analytics, intrusion detection \nsystems, machine learning for anomaly\
    \ detection, security-aware IoT device design, secure communication protocols,\
    \ \nSIEM for agriculture, privacy and data protection, security-aware farm management\
    \ systems, and social and ethical \nconsiderations. It has been shown that addressing\
    \ security issues in smart agriculture requires collaborative efforts \nbetween\
    \ technology providers, agricultural stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers.\
    \ It is crucial to develop and \nimplement robust security measures, promote security\
    \ standards and best practices, provide security training and \nawareness programs,\
    \ and foster partnerships to develop cost-effective security solutions tailored\
    \ for the agricultural \nsector. By addressing these security issues comprehensively,\
    \ we can ensure the trustworthiness, resilience, and \nsustainability of smart\
    \ agriculture systems, thereby unlocking their full potential to revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural \nindustry, improve productivity, and contribute to global\
    \ food security. \nCompliance with ethical standards \nAcknowledgments \nAll the\

    \ complex and interconnected infrastructure of smart cities offers several opportunities\n\
    for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and carry out cyberattacks that can have\
    \ serious consequences\nfor the functioning of cities’ critical infrastructures.\
    \ This study aims to address this phenomenon\nand characterize the dimensions\
    \ of security risks in smart cities and present mitigation proposals\nto address\
    \ these risks. The study adopts a qualitative methodology through the identiﬁcation\
    \ of\n62 European research projects in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity in smart cities,\
    \ which are underway during\nthe period from 2022 to 2027. Compared to previous\
    \ studies, this work provides a comprehensive\nview of security risks from the\
    \ perspective of multiple universities, research centers, and companies\nparticipating\
    \ in European projects. The ﬁndings of this study offer relevant scientiﬁc contributions\
    \ by\nidentifying 7 dimensions and 31 sub-dimensions of cybersecurity risks in\
    \ smart cities and proposing\n24 mitigation strategies to face these security\
    \ challenges. Furthermore, this study explores emerg-\ning cybersecurity issues\
    \ to which smart cities are exposed by the increasing proliferation of new\ntechnologies\
    \ and standards.\nKeywords: cybersecurity; smart cities; intelligent devices;\
    \ cyber-attacks; privacy\n1. Introduction\nSmart cities are urban spaces characterized\
    \ by the widespread use of Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICTs).\
    \ They intend to improve political-economic efﬁciency\nand support human and social\
    \ development, thus improving the quality of life of its citizens.\nAccording\
    \ to Toli and Murtagh [1], a city is considered “smart” when there are drivers\n\
    of sustainable eco-economic growth, a high quality of life, and conscious management\
    \ of\nnatural resources through participatory and democratic governance. Several\
    \ drivers of\nsmart cities include investments in technological infrastructure,\
    \ investments in human\ncapital, and social investments. In addition, other aspects\
    \ that should be considered when\nclassifying cities as smart include urban mobility,\
    \ commitment to environmental issues, and\nsocial issues [2–5]. In summary, smart\
    \ cities use technology and innovation to improve the\nquality of life of their\
    \ inhabitants, increase the economic value generated in that community,\nand promote\
    \ environmental sustainability.\nSmart cities focus on the provision of a set\
    \ of initiatives, actions, and services, in\nvarious areas of applicability in\
    \ cities that aim to optimize and improve the well-being of\ntheir populations,\
    \ both in terms of health and the environment. In broad terms, the goal\nof smart\
    \ cities is to dynamically optimize the city to provide a set of actions and services\n\
    for a more inclusive and sustainable city [6,7]. The main role that ICTs can assume\
    \ is to\nintegrate information systems services from each domain of activity of\
    \ a city, such as health,\neducation, transportation, energy, water, and waste\
    \ management, to provide public services\nto citizens in a more efﬁcient and ubiquitous\
    \ way [8]. Furthermore, ICT plays a role in\nthe incorporation and integration\
    \ of various complex systems at the level of technological\ninfrastructure, social\
    \ structures, politics, and human behavior [9,10].\nAt the same time, the role\
    \ of ICT for businesses, citizens, and civil society to create,\ninvent, and experiment\
    \ new things to improve and optimize the quality of life in cities is\nalso widely\
    \ known and accepted. However, taking into account the exposure of digital\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2023, 15, 285. https://doi.org/10.3390/ﬁ15090285\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet\n\
    Future Internet 2023, 15, 285\n2 of 21\nservices and support services of the various\
    \ domains through communication networks\nand the use of ICT, it is important\
    \ to consider the identiﬁcation of risks and challenges\nassociated with smart\
    \ cities, to reduce or mitigate these risks, namely in different sectors of\n\
    activity, such as industrial control systems, intelligent transportation systems,\
    \ Internet of\nThings (IoT), and digital health (e-health), in addition to other\
    \ areas of intervention of cities.\nThe literature [11,12] recognizes that cybersecurity\
    \ and data privacy issues have become\nincreasingly relevant, questionable, and\
    \ challenging, both for citizens and for technology\ncompanies that provide digital\
    \ services who are aware of the problem of cybercrime\nand cyberterrorism.\nCybersecurity\
    \ plays a key role in smart cities due to the increasing interconnectivity\nand\
    \ widespread use of ICT [13]. In smart cities, systems and devices are networked\
    \ to\ncollect data, monitor infrastructures, optimize services, and improve citizens’\
    \ quality of\nlife. However, this connectivity exposes cities to a range of cyber\
    \ threats, making data and\ninfrastructure security critical. Systematic literature\
    \ reviews performed by Kim et al. [14]\nand Gracias et al. [15] in the ﬁeld of\
    \ smart cities have identiﬁed cybersecurity as a key\nfactor for the implementation\
    \ of a smart city. Furthermore, studies in the area have sought\nto characterize\
    \ the various security risks considering theoretical models for identifying\n\
    vulnerabilities [16–20] and empirical scenarios considering several smart cities\
    \ such as\nDubai, Barcelona, Shanghai, and Como [21–24]. The main research gap\
    \ is the difﬁculty of an\nintegrative overview of the main security risks considering\
    \ a multidisciplinary perspective\nthat can complement the vision of scientiﬁc\
    \ and industrial partners. Combining scientiﬁc\nand industrial partners in the\
    \ development of smart cities is of paramount importance\nconsidering that smart\
    \ city challenges are complex and multifaceted [25,26]. Therefore,\nscientiﬁc\
    \ partners can provide in-depth insights into these challenges, while industrial\n\
    partners can contribute their practical experience and knowledge of market dynamics.\n\
    By combining these perspectives, smart city projects can be designed and executed\
    \ in\na more holistic and comprehensive manner. In view of this, this study seeks\
    \ to use a\ncomprehensive perspective that results from the analysis of the role\
    \ of cybersecurity in\nsmart cities considering several projects, in which several\
    \ European universities, research\ncenters, and companies participate. The data\
    \ are extracted from the EU-funded projects\ndatabase made available by the CORDIS\
    \ portal. Three research questions (RQs) are posed:\nRQ1 intends to characterize\
    \ the dimensions of security risks that can be found in smart\ncities; then, RQ2\
    \ aims to identify measures proposed under these projects to mitigate\npreviously\
    \ identiﬁed security risks; ﬁnally, RQ3 seeks to explore emerging security risks\n\
    that may arise in the face of recent technological and social developments.\n\
    This study is organized into the following sections: In the ﬁrst phase, a theoretical\n\
    review is made on the topics of information security and security risks in smart\
    \ cities. After\nthat, the methodological approach and methods applied in the\
    \ development of the study\nare presented. This is followed by the presentation\
    \ and discussion of the results given the\nresearch questions previously formulated.\
    \ Finally, the main conclusions of the study are\nlisted. This last section also\
    \ sets out the limitations of the study and provides suggestions\nfor future work.\n\
    2. Literature Review\n2.1. Information Security\nIn recent years, the potential\
    \ and actual impacts of security threats in cyberspace\nhave become evident due\
    \ to several incidents with direct repercussions on the security of\ncountries\
    \ and citizens [27–29]. Digital technologies and cyberspace are not only resources\n\
    and space where one can do better and more efﬁciently what was once difﬁcult,\
    \ time-\nconsuming, and costly to do. As argued by Lippert and Cloutier [30],\
    \ this new reality has\ncreated the potential to signiﬁcantly alter the inﬂuence\
    \ of different groups or actors in the\ninternational and national, social, or\
    \ business scenes.\nInformation systems, digital communication, and the surrounding\
    \ digital environment\nare key elements for successful decision-making processes\
    \ that aim to produce informed\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n3 of 21\ndecisions\
    \ on critical and sensitive issues. Today, we are able to create, update and store\n\
    more information than we have ever been able to in the past, but never has that\
    \ information\nbeen as threatened as it is today. To maintain sustainable and\
    \ competitive infrastructures,\nwhich are vital to the survival of nations around\
    \ the world, there has been a drive to invest\nin mechanisms and processes that\
    \ derive from the need to make every possible effort to\nensure secure digital\
    \ resources. Authors such as Knell [31] and Pereira et al. [32] emphasize\nthat\
    \ the world is highly interconnected, with resources interconnected with structures\n\
    and networks on a global scale. Therefore, one of the main concerns to ensure\
    \ a secure\nprotection and safeguarding of information has been the security of\
    \ information systems,\npublic and private, and their information, which is essential\
    \ to support the activities\nof organizations. It also emerges that information\
    \ security is also vital to building and\nmaintaining customer trust. Consumers\
    \ are increasingly concerned about the privacy and\nprotection of their personal\
    \ data. Bleier et al. [33] argue that by demonstrating a serious\ncommitment to\
    \ information security, organizations can gain customer trust and establish\n\
    lasting relationships. This is also an important element in the context of smart\
    \ city adoption,\nas recognized in this study, in which the relationships established\
    \ also manifest themselves\nin the inclusion of new services in smart cities.\n\
    Information security addresses multiple domains. Broadly we can look at information\n\
    security as the protection of data and information of individuals, organizations,\
    \ and\ngovernments from unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, alteration, or\
    \ destruction [34].\nThe importance of information security can be understood\
    \ in different aspects. Information\nsecurity must ensure the conﬁdentiality of\
    \ data, preventing sensitive information from\nfalling into the wrong hands. This\
    \ is especially critical when it comes to personal data,\nﬁnancial information,\
    \ trade secrets, or government information. Based in a literature review,\nRath\
    \ and Kumar [35] have concluded that a breach of conﬁdentiality can lead to serious\n\
    consequences such as identity theft, ﬁnancial loss, or reputational damage. Information\n\
    security also aims to ensure data integrity (i.e., its accuracy, completeness,\
    \ and consistency\nover time). It is essential that information is not altered\
    \ in an unauthorized or accidental\nway, ensuring that it remains reliable and\
    \ accurate. A lack of data integrity can lead to\nwrong decisions, errors in processes,\
    \ and loss of conﬁdence in the information [36]. Finally,\ninformation security\
    \ must ensure that data and systems are available when needed. This\nimplies protecting\
    \ information against technical failures, cyber-attacks, or natural disasters\n\
    that may compromise data availability. In their work exploring the relationship\
    \ between\navailability and other security issues, Qadir and Quadri [37] have\
    \ realized that a lack of\navailability can cause business disruptions, lost productivity,\
    \ and ﬁnancial losses. In the\ncontext of smart cities, this study also conﬁrms\
    \ that a lack of availability can have profound\nand far-reaching impacts on various\
    \ aspects of urban life. Smart cities rely on a network of\ninterconnected devices,\
    \ sensors, and systems to deliver critical services and real-time data.\nService\
    \ disruptions can lead to inconvenience for citizens, economic losses for businesses,\n\
    and even public safety concerns.\nInformation security, data science, and technology\
    \ are interconnected domains. Data\nscience involves the extraction of knowledge\
    \ and insights from data. It encompasses a\nwide range of techniques, including\
    \ data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, data\nvisualization, machine\
    \ learning, and statistical modeling [38,39]. Technology serves as the\nfoundation\
    \ for both information security and data science. Technological advancements\n\
    have enabled the rapid growth of digital data and the development of sophisticated\
    \ tools\nand algorithms to process and analyze it. Key technological components\
    \ that support\ninformation security and data science include big data platforms,\
    \ cloud computing, artiﬁcial\nintelligence, machine learning, cryptography, and\
    \ networking and communication. Hazim\nand Khan [40] provide several examples\
    \ of the use of the cloud in organizations and pointed\nout that cloud services\
    \ have revolutionized data storage, accessibility, and processing.\nThey provide\
    \ scalable infrastructure to accommodate large datasets and host data science\n\
    applications and security solutions. Cloud service providers maintain vast data\
    \ centers\nwith a wide array of servers, storage, and networking resources. They\
    \ can allocate and\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n4 of 21\nreallocate these resources\
    \ dynamically based on demand. According to Brataas et al. [41],\nthis allows\
    \ users to scale up (add more resources) or scale down (remove excess resources)\n\
    as needed, without having to invest in physical hardware themselves. Furthermore,\
    \ cloud\nplatforms offer elasticity, which means they can automatically adjust\
    \ resources in response\nto varying workloads. During periods of high demand,\
    \ the cloud can rapidly provision\nadditional resources, and during low-demand\
    \ periods, it can release unneeded resources.\nBiswas et al. [42] state that dynamic\
    \ scaling ensures efﬁcient resource utilization and cost-\neffectiveness. Cloud\
    \ computing and machine learning are two powerful technologies\nthat can be effectively\
    \ combined to leverage their respective strengths. The integration\nof machine\
    \ learning with cloud computing enables scalable and ﬂexible solutions for\nprocessing\
    \ and analyzing large datasets, building sophisticated models, and deploying AI-\n\
    powered applications [43]. Machine learning tasks often require signiﬁcant computational\n\
    resources, especially for training complex models. Peng et al. [44] provide a\
    \ vision regarding\nthe parallel computing programming mode in the context of\
    \ cloud computing and argue\nthat it has enabled distributed computing, which\
    \ can signiﬁcantly speed up the training\nprocess by distributing the workload\
    \ across multiple servers or nodes. This parallel\nprocessing capability can be\
    \ relevant when training complex models on large datasets.\n2.2. Security Risks\
    \ in Smart Cities\nICT plays a key role in the development of smart cities, which\
    \ combine infrastructure,\narchitecture, objects, and people to improve processes\
    \ and address social, economic, and\nenvironmental problems. Several technologies\
    \ such as cloud, big data, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nblockchain, and IoT are found\
    \ in smart cities. Nastjuk et al. [45] advocate that the use of\nemerging technologies\
    \ is an enabler of innovation in the context of smart cities, and that it\nis\
    \ not limited to the technological perspective of cities, but enables the creation\
    \ of a smart\nenvironment, smart governance, and smart economy. Given the above,\
    \ it can be inferred\nthat there is no smart city without technology and innovation,\
    \ as these are the factors that\ndifferentiate it from an ordinary city [46].\
    \ Necessarily, the adoption of new technologies\nand the high interconnectivity\
    \ between them and humans makes smart cities vulnerable to\nvarious cyber threats\
    \ [47,48]. Therefore, protecting the infrastructure, systems, and data\nfrom malicious\
    \ activities is essential to ensure the security, privacy, and reliability of\
    \ smart\ncity services. Accordingly, there is a need to explore and know mitigation\
    \ strategies that\ncan address these challenges.\nIt is important to highlight\
    \ that the security and privacy challenges of smart cities are\nnot new and that\
    \ many of them already exist in the isolated use of each of their technologies,\n\
    but that they now assume a greater impact in the interconnected context of smart\
    \ cities.\nThe infrastructure of a smart city is composed of thousands of devices\
    \ and applications\nthat aim to improve processes and bring beneﬁts to citizens.\
    \ However, the use of these\napplications and systems can bring several problems\
    \ related to security and privacy. Elliott\nand Soifer [49] and Federspiel et\
    \ al. [50] refer to the vulnerabilities that occur by adopting\nsmart systems\
    \ based on artiﬁcial intelligence, as they not only collect a wide variety of\n\
    sensitive information from people and their social circles, but also control city\
    \ facilities\nand inﬂuence citizens’ lives. The empirical work carried out also\
    \ shows that the European\nprojects included in this study consider the challenges\
    \ inherent in big data, data analytics,\nartiﬁcial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\
    Security is seen as a dynamic concept, not a stagnant one, in which we seek to\
    \ prevent\nharm by digital and physical means, both direct and indirect [51].\
    \ In a smart city, security\nis looked at in the general component by covering\
    \ all the features of the city, but it is\nalso included in all the aspects that\
    \ make it up. Studies by Ghazizadeh et al. [52] use an\nextended version of the\
    \ Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to demonstrate that security\nis a key factor\
    \ in technology acceptance. Thus, safety encompasses more than just technical\n\
    factors, having a strong human-dependent aspect, also including subjective factors\
    \ related\nto the perception of individuals [53]. Consequently, the existence\
    \ of objective and subjective\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n5 of 21\ndimensions\
    \ of security is assumed. The role of human behavior is also widely highlighted\n\
    in this study as a dimension is identiﬁed.\nCybersecurity plays a key role in\
    \ protecting critical infrastructure, which includes\nsystems and assets that\
    \ are essential to the functioning of society and the economy. This\ninfrastructure\
    \ can include power grids, transportation networks, water treatment facilities,\n\
    communication systems, and more. Protecting these vital components from cyber\
    \ threats\nis critical to prevent the disruptions, unauthorized access, or sabotage\
    \ that can affect\ncitywide operations [54]. The privacy by design approach advocated\
    \ in studies such\nas Drev and Delak’s [55] and Romanou’s [56] is essential in\
    \ smart cities that must be\nsupported by a secure architecture and design. Therefore,\
    \ cybersecurity considerations\nshould be integrated into the architecture and\
    \ design of critical infrastructure systems from\nthe outset. This involves following\
    \ the best security practices, conducting risk assessments,\nand implementing\
    \ appropriate security controls [57,58].\nProtecting data privacy is another area\
    \ of concern in smart cities’ environments. Smart\ncities generate massive amounts\
    \ of data from sensors, surveillance systems, and connected\ndevices. These data\
    \ often contain sensitive information about individuals, including their\nlocations,\
    \ behaviors, and personal preferences. Data encryption is a fundamental technique\n\
    used to secure data in transit and at rest. In smart cities, sensitive data such\
    \ as personal\ninformation, ﬁnancial records, and surveillance footage should\
    \ be encrypted to prevent\nunauthorized access or interception by malicious actors\
    \ [59]. The importance of data\nminimization and anonymization is associated with\
    \ the appearance of data encryption.\nDaoudagh et al. [60] recommend that smart\
    \ cities should practice data minimization, col-\nlecting only the necessary data\
    \ to fulﬁll their functions and reducing the risk associated\nwith storing excessive\
    \ personal information. Furthermore, smart cities must implement\nrobust access\
    \ controls to restrict access to sensitive systems and data. This involves im-\n\
    plementing secure authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication\
    \ and\nrole-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized individuals\
    \ can access\nspeciﬁc data [61]. Additionally, smart cities must incorporate secure\
    \ communication mech-\nanisms. Communication between devices and systems within\
    \ a smart city’s infrastructure\nshould be secured to prevent eavesdropping or\
    \ tampering. In the review work carried out\nby Rahouti et al. [62] it is highlighted\
    \ that the adoption of secure protocols like Transport\nLayer Security (TLS) and\
    \ Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can ensure encrypted and au-\nthenticated communication\
    \ channels. These proposals are relevant to the approach of our\nstudy, which\
    \ identiﬁes cybersecurity challenges related to network vulnerabilities related\n\
    to unauthorized access and interception of communications.\nIoT devices are the\
    \ backbone of smart cities, enabling connectivity and data exchange\namong various\
    \ systems and devices. However, these devices are often vulnerable to cyber-\n\
    attacks due to their limited security measures [63]. Consequently, robust cybersecurity\n\
    practices are needed to secure IoT devices, including implementing secure authentica-\n\
    tion, encryption, and regular software updates to prevent unauthorized access\
    \ or control.\nSeveral approaches are proposed in the literature to increase the\
    \ security of IoT devices.\nImplementing robust authentication mechanisms such\
    \ as multi-factor authentication (MFA)\nis proposed by Ometov et al. [64] to ensure\
    \ that only authorized users or devices can access\nthe IoT devices. This helps\
    \ prevent unauthorized access and protects against brute-force\nattacks. The adoption\
    \ of secure communication protocols such as Transport Layer Secu-\nrity (TLS)\
    \ or Secure Shell (SSH) to encrypt data transmitted between IoT devices and the\n\
    backend systems is proposed by Paul et al. [65]. This prevents the eavesdropping\
    \ of and\ntampering with sensitive information. Regular ﬁrmware updates are recommended\
    \ by\nGong et al. [66] to keep the ﬁrmware of IoT devices up to date by applying\
    \ regular security\npatches and updates provided by the manufacturers. This helps\
    \ address vulnerabilities and\nensures that devices are protected against known\
    \ security risks. Finally, Prazeres et al. [67]\nemploy an approach using test\
    \ data from different datasets to suggest the implementation\nof network segmentation\
    \ to isolate IoT devices from other critical infrastructure systems.\nThis way,\
    \ even if one device is compromised, it will not provide direct access to the\
    \ entire\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n6 of 21\nnetwork, reducing the potential\
    \ impact of an attack. Our study conﬁrms that IoT security\nplays a critical role\
    \ in safeguarding not only the devices and systems connected to the\ninternet,\
    \ but also the entire digital infrastructure and data ecosystem.\nEffective cybersecurity\
    \ in smart cities requires collaboration among various stake-\nholders, which\
    \ may include government authorities, urban planners, industry partners,\ncommunity\
    \ and citizen groups, and academic and research institutions, among others.\n\
    As it is advocated by Clement et al. [68], the sharing of information, best practices,\
    \ and\nestablishing partnerships can help develop comprehensive cybersecurity\
    \ strategies and\nresponses to emerging threats. Public awareness and education\
    \ are another pillar of cy-\nbersecurity in smart cities. At this level, Williamson\
    \ [69] states that citizens should be\ninformed about potential risks, advised\
    \ on secure practices, and encouraged to report any\nsuspicious activities. It\
    \ is advocated that building a culture of cybersecurity awareness\ncan help prevent\
    \ attacks and ensure the collective security of the smart city ecosystem.\nOur\
    \ study demonstrates that collaborative efforts made at Europe-wide research projects\n\
    facilitate the sharing of threat intelligence and cybersecurity information among\
    \ different\nentities. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of emerging\
    \ threats, attack\npatterns, and vulnerabilities. By staying informed about the\
    \ latest threats, smart cities can\nproactively implement countermeasures. Furthermore,\
    \ it is expected that cybersecurity\nchallenges in smart cities will continue\
    \ to evolve. Collaborative efforts enable ongoing\nadaptation to new threats and\
    \ technologies, ensuring that cities can maintain a robust\ncybersecurity posture\
    \ over the long term.\n3. Methodology\nThis study adopts qualitative methodology\
    \ to understand and characterize the role\nof cybersecurity in smart cities. According\
    \ to Hammarberg et al. [70], cybersecurity is\nmostly employed in situations where\
    \ one seeks to explore and describe in depth the\nnature, meanings, and characteristics\
    \ of a particular context, rather than seeking statistical\ngeneralizations. In\
    \ this study, qualitative methodology is used as a tool in the exploratory\nresearch\
    \ of cybersecurity in smart cities. Indeed, qualitative methodology is often used\
    \ at\nthe beginning of a research process to explore a little-known problem or\
    \ area of study. It\nhelps to generate hypotheses, identify relevant variables,\
    \ and gain a deeper understanding\nof the topic before developing more structured\
    \ research [71]. This exploratory research\nof the topic is later complemented\
    \ by an in-depth survey, which allows exploring the\nperspectives and experiences\
    \ of the various research projects in depth, which allows\ncapturing the complexity\
    \ and context of how cybersecurity is addressed in smart cities’\nresearch projects.\n\
    The CORDIS database is used to identify projects in smart cities that address\
    \ cyberse-\ncurity risks. CORDIS is maintained by the European Commission to provide\
    \ information\non the objectives, development status, and technical and scientiﬁc\
    \ outcomes of EU-funded\nresearch and development projects [72]. The search in\
    \ this database considered only the\nrepository of projects funded under the Horizon\
    \ Europe Framework Program, which is\nthe successor to the Horizon 2020 program\
    \ and spans the period from 2021 to 2027. The\nprogram aims to support scientiﬁc\
    \ research, technological development, and innovation\nacross various disciplines\
    \ and sectors. It is important to highlight that Horizon Europe\nencourages interdisciplinary\
    \ research, international cooperation, and open science prin-\nciples. External\
    \ and internal validity procedures have been considered. First, we have\nused\
    \ consistent search terms to identify relevant projects. Initially, a search was\
    \ made\nconsidering all projects funded by Horizon Europe in the smart cities\
    \ ﬁeld. This resulted in\nthe identiﬁcation of 180 projects. After that, the combination\
    \ of the three words “smart”\nand “city” and “security” was applied. It was also\
    \ ensured that the current state of devel-\nopment of the projects is relatively\
    \ similar. Therefore, all projects in the approval phase, or\napproved but not\
    \ yet started, have been excluded. In total, and after applying the listed\nrestrictions,\
    \ a total of 62 projects were identiﬁed as presented in Table 1. Associated with\n\
    each project is the date of its implementation (i.e., start date and end date)\
    \ and a brief\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n7 of 21\ndescription of its main\
    \ goal. The identiﬁcation of the goal of each project was manually\ncarried out\
    \ considering the main objectives of each project, since the information available\n\
    in the CORDIS portal is more extensive.\nTable 1. Characterization of the projects\

    \ and objectives of the projects were subsequently uploaded into NVivo\nv12.2\
    \ software. NVivo is a software program developed for qualitative data analysis\n\
    that provides a set of tools and features to organize, analyze, and interpret\
    \ qualitative\ndata. It supports a wide range of qualitative research methods,\
    \ including content analysis,\ngrounded theory, and thematic analysis, among others.\
    \ In addition, the software offers\nadvanced analytic tools, including matrix\
    \ coding, concept mapping, sentiment analysis, and\ntext search queries, to help\
    \ researchers identify patterns, trends, and relationships in their\ndata. NVivo\
    \ also offers visualizations such as graphs, diagrams, and word clouds to help\n\
    interpret and present the results [73]. This study adopted thematic analysis to\
    \ ﬁnd the main\nthemes associated with the projects and subsequently identiﬁed\
    \ innovative approaches\nadopted in the projects to address cyber security risks.\
    \ Then, a conceptual map of the\nrelationship between the main cybersecurity challenges\
    \ in smart cities was developed,\nwhich guided the discussion of the innovative\
    \ proposals presented by these projects.\nTable 2 provides a global vision of\
    \ the several steps of thematic analysis. Eight phases are\nconsidered which include\
    \ the preparation of data, its coding, the process of identifying and\nreﬁning\
    \ themes throughout the process, and the production of the ﬁnal report.\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2023, 15, 285\n10 of 21\nTable 2. Thematic analysis phases.\nPhase\n\
    Description\nData preparation\nThe data collected on the CORDIS platform for each\
    \ project are compiled into an individual report. Information\non project name,\
    \ implementation dates, summary, objectives, and technical description are extracted.\
    \ These\nelements are available in “fact sheet” and “reporting” sections on CORDIS\
    \ platform. A script written in Python\nwas developed to automatically collect\
    \ this information.\nCodiﬁcation\nNVivo v12.2 software is used to assign codes\
    \ to text segments or signiﬁcant units of data that represent a speciﬁc\ntheme.\n\
    Identiﬁcation of initial themes\nInitial emerging themes are identiﬁed and highlighted\
    \ by Nvivo v12.2 software. Themes represent groups of\ncodes that share similar\
    \ characteristics.\nReview of themes\nThis step aims to review the identiﬁed themes\
    \ to ensure that they are aligned in the cybersecurity domain and are\nappropriately\
    \ relevant and comprehensive. It is also relevant to ensure that the themes correctly\
    \ capture the\nperspectives of each project.\nDeﬁnition and naming of\nthemes\n\
    Each theme is associated with a descriptive name to assist in the analysis and\
    \ production of the ﬁnal report.\nAnalysis of themes\nThe themes identiﬁed in\
    \ the previous step are analyzed to understand the relationships between them\
    \ and to\nhighlight how they contribute to the research questions formulated in\
    \ the study.\nInterpretation of results\nThe results obtained are discussed considering\
    \ the research objectives and the literature in the ﬁeld. Implications\nof the\
    \ themes are noted to guide the discussion of the ﬁndings.\nReporting of results\n\
    A detailed report of the identiﬁed themes and their deﬁnitions is produced. Original\
    \ citations are also collected\nfrom the studies that support each theme. The\
    \ implications of the research are also noted.\n4. Results\nThe thematic analysis\
    \ began by exploring the most frequent terms associated with the\nobjectives and\
    \ description of each project. Table 3 summarizes the top 10 frequent themes\n\
    considering the total number of times is the theme was identiﬁed in projects.\
    \ The most fre-\nquent themes include “smart cities” with 96 occurrences, “data-driven”\
    \ with 74 occurrences,\n“artiﬁcial intelligence” with 53 occurrences, “machine\
    \ learning” with 44 occurrences, and\n“digital environments” with 41 occurrences.\
    \ Other themes that stand out with less frequency\nare “privacy”, “sensors”, “education”,\
    \ “sustainability”, and “collaborative environment”.\nA signiﬁcant portion of\
    \ the terms identiﬁed are not directly related to cybersecurity in its\nmultiple\
    \ aspects, nor to the area of application to smart cities, but emerge as important\n\
    elements in the methodological and organizational processes of each project, such\
    \ as the\nsearch for artiﬁcial intelligence support in data analytics for decision\
    \ making and the role\nof collaborative environments in the development of these\
    \ technological solutions. Some\ncommon architectural components for the development\
    \ of smart cities are also identiﬁed,\nsuch as the exploitation of information\
    \ generated through data analytics techniques, the\nevolution of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ that enables a more personalized interaction with citizens,\ninformation privacy,\
    \ and the role that the IoT can assume in various areas, such as urban\nmobility,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and sustainability.\nThe next step in presenting the results\
    \ was to create a cognitive map to capture the\nvarious dimensions of cybersecurity\
    \ risks in smart cities. Figure 1 presents the multiple\ndimensions captured in\
    \ a cognitive map. A total of 7 dimensions and 31 sub-dimensions\nwere identiﬁed.\
    \ Cybersecurity risks in smart cities are grouped under dimensions such as\n“infrastructure\
    \ vulnerabilities”, “data privacy”, “network vulnerabilities”, “access control”,\n\
    “IoT devices”, “security standards and regulation”, and “human behavior”. It is\
    \ note-\nworthy that there is a strong dependence between the various dimensions.\
    \ Infrastructure\nvulnerabilities are divided into areas such as sensors and networks,\
    \ which then give rise to\nvulnerabilities supporting network communication in\
    \ smart cities and IoT devices. It is\nalso highlighted that the modular and collaborative\
    \ structure in the development of smart\ncities with multiple manufacturers and\
    \ technologies makes it difﬁcult to manage the entire\nnetwork in an integrated\
    \ way. Finally, human behavior makes the emergence of social\nengineering attacks\
    \ a possibility, in addition to being a challenge for digital inclusivity.\nFinally,\
    \ the security risks identiﬁed above are addressed by European research projects.\n\
    Several solutions are proposed in the technological, organizational, and human\
    \ behavior\ndomains. Table 4 identiﬁes mitigation proposals put forward by the\
    \ research projects. Three\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n11 of 21\nquotes from\
    \ the projects are provided, extracted from NVivo v12.2 software, on how the\n\
    research projects address mitigation proposals in each dimension. It is highlighted\
    \ that the\nmitigation proposals presented by the research projects highlight\
    \ their scope of application\nas smart infrastructure, urban mobility, energy\
    \ and sustainability, and quality of life. It\nalso stands out that the same project\
    \ (e.g., EDGELESS, PANTHEON) addresses multiple\ndimensions of cybersecurity in\
    \ a smart city.\nTable 3. Top 10 most frequent themes.\nFinal Theme\nAssociated\

    \ under Horizon Europe are a prime source of information\nfor understanding security\
    \ risks in smart cities. The EU has encouraged and funded several\ninitiatives\
    \ to promote the concept of smart cities and bring the poorest regions of the\
    \ EU\ncloser to the richest. European smart city projects often involve partnerships\
    \ between\ncities, businesses, research institutions, and civil society organizations.\
    \ They provide a\nframework for collaboration, sharing knowledge and good practices,\
    \ and provide ﬁnancial\nresources for implementing smart city solutions. The exploration\
    \ of these initiatives helps\nus to answer RQ1 and allows us to synthesize cyber\
    \ security risks in seven dimensions,\nand it is noted that the projects cover\
    \ all these multiple areas. The role of these initiatives in\nproviding a comprehensive\
    \ view of security risks is also noted. Thus, the risks of using\nemerging technologies\
    \ are compounded by regulatory difﬁculties in implementing smart\ncities and the\
    \ interaction of humans with smart cities.\nThe infrastructure of a smart city\
    \ is a critical element. Mitigation measures, as indi-\ncated in RQ2, should address\
    \ this central point of smart city architecture. As cities become\nmore reliant\
    \ on technology to operate, critical infrastructure becomes an attractive target\n\
    for cyberattacks. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of devices and systems in\
    \ smart cities\ncreates a larger attack surface for potential attackers. Several\
    \ mitigation measures can\nbe implemented, such as risk assessment and management,\
    \ continuous monitoring, and\nintrusion detection, among others. The vulnerabilities\
    \ existing in the security systems of a\nsmart city exist in several forms, such\
    \ as security breaches in communication networks,\nfailures in monitoring and\
    \ control systems, outdated systems, and lack of proper authen-\ntication, among\
    \ others [74,75]. Effectively, the continuous monitoring of security risks\nis\
    \ an activity that must be constantly performed to detect and respond to threats\
    \ in real\ntime. In Herath and Mittal [76], the role of security monitoring tools,\
    \ data analytics, and\nartiﬁcial intelligence to identify anomalies and suspicious\
    \ activities is highlighted. Artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence also poses new risks such\
    \ as autonomous learning models and Deepfake,\nwhich refers to the malicious use\
    \ of deep learning technology to create highly realistic and\noften misleading\
    \ fake content. Moreover, security risk management in smart cities is an\nongoing\
    \ process. Good practices in this area are addressed by Hui [77] and Younus [78],\
    \ by\nsuggesting conducting regular risk assessments, updating security measures\
    \ according to\nemerging threats, and participating in collaborative actions with\
    \ other smart cities to share\nknowledge and experiences. Privacy is another key\
    \ issue in smart cities. The large-scale\ncollection of personal information and\
    \ constant monitoring of individuals’ activities can\nraise legitimate concerns.\
    \ Smart cities must be transparent about their data collection\npractices and\
    \ involve citizens in the decision-making process. This includes providing\nclear\
    \ information about the technologies used, the expected beneﬁts, and the associated\n\
    privacy risks. Data collection is an activity that should be conducted in a transparent\n\
    and consenting manner, informing citizens of what data are collected, how they\
    \ are used,\nand who has access to it. How data are processed and stored is another\
    \ point that should\ndeserve attention. Faisal [79] points out that one way to\
    \ protect citizens’ privacy is to ensure\nthat the data collected are minimized,\
    \ anonymized, and aggregated wherever possible.\nThis means removing personally\
    \ identiﬁable information and grouping data at aggregate\nlevels to avoid identifying\
    \ speciﬁc individuals.\nThe cybersecurity risks identiﬁed are also strongly connected\
    \ with the emergence of\ndata-driven solutions in smart cities. Therefore, answering\
    \ RQ2 requires considering that\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role\
    \ in processing and analyzing vast amounts\nof data to optimize services and infrastructure.\
    \ AI’s rapid evolution has revolutionized\nvarious aspects of smart cities, enabling\
    \ them to make data-driven decisions, automate\nprocesses, and enhance citizen\
    \ experiences. In transportation, AI-powered algorithms\nmanage trafﬁc ﬂow, optimize\
    \ public transportation routes, and predict maintenance needs\nfor infrastructure\
    \ [80]. In energy management, AI enables real-time monitoring, demand-\nresponse\
    \ systems, and the optimization of energy consumption [81]. However, as smart\n\
    cities become more reliant on AI-driven systems, their susceptibility to cyber\
    \ threats\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n15 of 21\nincreases signiﬁcantly. Effectively,\
    \ as AI becomes increasingly integrated into smart cities,\nit also exposes these\
    \ urban environments to new cybersecurity challenges. Cyber threats\npose signiﬁcant\
    \ risks, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruptions, privacy\n\
    violations, and even physical harm [82,83]. One signiﬁcant concern is the potential\
    \ for AI\nmodels to be manipulated, leading to biased decision-making or malicious\
    \ actions. As\nstated by Anthi et al. [84], AI algorithms may be vulnerable to\
    \ adversarial attacks, where\nmalicious input data are crafted to deceive the\
    \ model. Additionally, Anwar and Ali [85]\nreveal that the centralization of data\
    \ in smart cities presents a potential target for hackers\nseeking to steal sensitive\
    \ information or hold it for ransom.\nDealing with the challenges of standards\
    \ and regulation in smart cities requires a col-\nlaborative and adaptive approach.\
    \ Ensuring interoperability between the different systems\nand devices in a smart\
    \ city is a challenge that must be considered in RQ2. Madsen [86] states\nthat\
    \ adopting open standards allows systems to communicate with each other efﬁciently,\n\
    avoiding dependence on speciﬁc vendors and promoting healthy competition. In addition,\n\
    standards also help to ensure data security and privacy. Importantly, smart cities\
    \ involve\na wide range of stakeholders, including governments, businesses, academic\
    \ institutions,\nand citizens. Promoting and establishing mechanisms for dialog\
    \ and collaboration among\nthese stakeholders can be used to develop appropriate\
    \ standards and regulations. Several\napproaches can be implemented in this ﬁeld,\
    \ such as the use of discussion forums, public\nconsultations, and public–private\
    \ partnerships [87,88]. Citizens are also a key pillar in\nthe implementation\
    \ of smart cities. Citizen ethics are important because they inﬂuence\npeople’s\
    \ behavior toward the use of these technologies and how they interact with the\n\
    smart city environment. Ethical citizens use the technologies available in smart\
    \ cities\nresponsibly. This includes not using digital tools for illegal or harmful\
    \ activities, respecting\nlaws and regulations related to cybersecurity, and avoiding\
    \ the misuse of others’ personal\ndata. Additionally, citizens’ ethics can be\
    \ promoted through educational programs and\nawareness about security in smart\
    \ cities. According to Ziosi [89], this involves disseminat-\ning information\
    \ about the risks and beneﬁts of the technologies used, the importance of\ndata\
    \ protection, and raising awareness about citizens’ rights and responsibilities\
    \ in a smart\ncity environment.\nThe strong technological interconnection in smart\
    \ cities allows them to collect, analyze\nand share data efﬁciently, making it\
    \ possible to operate and manage various urban aspects\nintelligently. However,\
    \ the proliferation of new technologies and the need to have a highly\nintegrated\
    \ environment means that new security risks are continuously emerging. The\nresearch\
    \ projects launched between 2022 and 2027 should not only address the main current\n\
    security risks, but should identify new risks that may emerge in the next decade,\
    \ which\ngives us relevant information to address RQ3. The PANTHEON project presents\
    \ the\nfollowing strategic vision:\n“PANTHEON will design and develop a Community\
    \ based Digital Ecosystem for Dis-\naster Resilience utilizing Smart City Digital\
    \ Twin (SCDT) technology and leveraging\nnew and emerging technologies and innovations\
    \ to improve risk assessment, reduce\nvulnerability, and building community disaster\
    \ resilience.” (PANTHEON)\nThe SCDT approach proposed in PANTHEON refers to a\
    \ comprehensive framework\nthat combines digital technologies, data analytics,\
    \ and modeling techniques to enhance dis-\naster preparedness, response, and recovery\
    \ in a smart city environment. A SCDT is referred\nto in Deren et al. [90] as\
    \ a virtual replica or simulation of a city’s physical infrastructure,\nsystems,\
    \ and processes. A SCDT integrates various data sources, such as Internet of Things\n\
    (IoT) devices, sensors, and real-time data feeds, to create a dynamic representation\
    \ of the\ncity. SCDT is a cutting-edge concept that contributes to better infrastructure\
    \ management,\nurban planning and design, and real-time decision making. Caprari\
    \ et al. [91] argue that\ndigital twins enable city planners and architects to\
    \ test and visualize various urban plan-\nning scenarios before implementing them\
    \ in the physical world. This helps in optimizing\nthe layout of infrastructure,\
    \ buildings, transportation networks, and public spaces, leading\nto more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable cities. Furthermore, the availability of real-time data from\n\
    Future Internet 2023, 15, 285\n16 of 21\nan SCDT empowers city ofﬁcials to make\
    \ informed and data-driven decisions promptly.\nCheng et al. [92] provide the\
    \ example that during emergencies or unexpected events, such\nas natural disasters\
    \ or trafﬁc congestion, authorities can quickly assess the situation and\nrespond\
    \ effectively.\nAnother emerging issue where the roles of cybersecurity and sustainability\
    \ are aligned\nis represented in the ambition of the CONCERTO project.\n“Clean\
    \ Aviation’s ambition to go over decisive impactful steps in demonstrated disruptive\n\
    aircraft performance compatible with 2035 EIS will only be possible if the future\
    \ regulatory\nframework is not an impediment to innovation.” (CONCERTO)\nAs reported\
    \ by Timperley [93], the aviation industry is a signiﬁcant contributor to\nglobal\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels in aircraft\n\
    engines. Clean aviation aims to address this issue by adopting various strategies\
    \ and\ntechnologies to increase the sustainability of air travel [94–96]. Furthermore,\
    \ CONCERTO\nproject exposes the potential cybersecurity risks raise in this context.\
    \ As aviation be-\ncomes increasingly digitized and connected, with the adoption\
    \ of technologies such as\nautonomous systems, IoT devices, and cloud computing,\
    \ the potential cybersecurity risks\nalso increase. Furthermore, a sustainable\
    \ organization aims to be resilient and adaptable\nto various challenges, including\
    \ cyber threats. Cybersecurity measures play a signiﬁcant\nrole in safeguarding\
    \ an organization’s ability to continue sustainable practices in the face\nof\
    \ potential disruptions or attacks. Therefore, sustainable practices should be\
    \ integrated\ninto business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Several strategies\
    \ like redundancy,\ngeographic diversity, and robust backup systems can help organizations\
    \ to protect data\nand infrastructure from cyber-attacks, natural disasters, or\
    \ other disruptive events [97–99].\nAnother area addressed by the projects is\
    \ smart agriculture as in the 3P-Tec project.\n“Changes in climate extremes (e.g.,\
    \ heatwaves, ﬂoods and drought) require new breeding\ntechnologies to allow farmers\
    \ to achieve high yields with climate-robust crops.” (3P-Tec)\nCybersecurity in\
    \ smart agriculture is a growing concern as the agricultural industry\nincreasingly\
    \ adopts digital and connected technologies to optimize crop production and\n\
    management. Smart farming, also known as precision agriculture, involves the use\
    \ of\nsensors, drones, IoT, and other technologies to collect data and automate\
    \ agricultural\nprocesses. While these technologies offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts such\
    \ as increased efﬁciency,\ncost reduction, and higher productivity, they can also\
    \ expose farming operations to cyber\nthreats. Some of the key cybersecurity challenges\
    \ in smart agriculture include connectivity,\ndata protection, phishing, and malware\
    \ [100–102].\nFinally, another area highlighted by research projects is the role\
    \ of entrepreneurship in\ncybersecurity. This perspective is addressed in projects\
    \ such as EHHUR.\n“Future adopters will beneﬁt from a DSS tool, supported by a\
    \ capacity building pro-\ngramme, that offers the ideal mix of best technical\
    \ solutions, optimal ﬁnancing schemes\nand engagement tools and social innovation\
    \ practice.” (EHHUR)\nDSS tools can be used in the context of smart cities for\
    \ resource allocation and pre-\ndictive analytics. Mahmood et al. [103] state\
    \ that DSS can optimize resource allocation\nby analyzing data on resource availability\
    \ and demand, ensuring that resources are uti-\nlized optimally. Osman and Elragal\
    \ [104] add that DSS can employ predictive analytics to\nforecast future trends\
    \ and events. This capability will allow city authorities to proactively\naddress\
    \ potential issues, plan for contingencies, and make informed decisions to improve\n\
    the city’s resilience. Also linked to the role that technology can play is the\
    \ importance of\nentrepreneurship in this ﬁeld. Entrepreneurs have the ability\
    \ to identify gaps in the cyberse-\ncurity market and understand the needs of\
    \ end users. They can ﬁnd business opportunities\nby realizing unsolved problems\
    \ or inadequate solutions existing in the cybersecurity ﬁeld.\nThis view is shared\
    \ by Aiyer et al. [105] and Alspach [106], when highlighting that many\nstartups\
    \ have emerged in the cybersecurity area, seeking to develop more effective and\n\
    Future Internet 2023, 15, 285\n17 of 21\naffordable solutions. Entrepreneurs found\
    \ these startups and brought together specialized\ncybersecurity talent to address\
    \ emerging challenges.\n6. Conclusions\nCybersecurity is a key element in the\
    \ context of smart cities. The high connectivity\nand high technological dependence\
    \ of smart cities increase the emergence of cyber risks.\nThe security of digital\
    \ systems and infrastructures is essential to ensure data protection,\ncitizens’\
    \ privacy, and the efﬁcient functioning of smart cities. The approach adopted\
    \ in this\nstudy complemented the systematic review works in the identiﬁcation\
    \ of key factors in the\nimplementation of smart cities and also the empirical\
    \ studies carried out in the speciﬁc\ncontext of smart city implementation. The\
    \ exploration of emerging security risks and the\nanalysis of proposals to mitigate\
    \ these risks based on research projects carried out in the\nEuropean context\
    \ allowed the risks identiﬁed to reﬂect not only the scientiﬁc perspective\nof\
    \ the research work, but also the technical and practical solutions that have\
    \ been proposed\nto make cities smarter supported by technology and optimization\
    \ of available resources.\nThis study identiﬁed that the main security challenges\
    \ facing smart cities cover several\nareas, such as the protection of technological\
    \ infrastructure, data privacy, network secu-\nrity, access control, IoT device\
    \ security, the adoption of standards and regulations in the\narea, and human\
    \ behavior. All these factors contribute to the implementation of robust\ncybersecurity\
    \ measures in all aspects of the planning, development, and operation of smart\n\
    cities, to ensure a safe and reliable digital environment for all involved. Furthermore,\
    \ this\nstudy identiﬁed emerging research areas in projects addressing topics\
    \ related to SCDT,\nclean aviation, smart agriculture, and data analytics that\
    \ bring new security challenges to\nsmart cities.\nThis study offers both theoretical\
    \ and practical contributions. In the conceptual\ndimension, this study contributed\
    \ to identifying the main cybersecurity risk areas to\nwhich smart cities are\
    \ exposed. It was possible to build a cognitive map consisting of\nseven dimensions\
    \ and identify mitigation measures to address these risks. Furthermore,\nthe identiﬁcation\
    \ of emerging cybersecurity research areas in smart cities includes the\nimplementation\
    \ of the concept of digital twins, smart aviation, smart agriculture, and the\n\
    emergence of new cybersecurity startups that bring new challenges to the management\
    \ of\nsmart cities using emerging technologies and living test labs. In the practical\
    \ dimension,\nthe ﬁndings of this study are relevant for researchers in the ﬁeld\
    \ who want to launch\nnew approaches and practical solutions to mitigate the risks\
    \ of smart cities and deepen\ntheir knowledge on this area. Also, the practical\
    \ results of this study are relevant for\nthe establishment of public policies\
    \ that can encourage the development of regulatory\ninstruments that facilitate\
    \ collaboration between the various stakeholders involved in the\nplanning and\
    \ implementation of a smart city.\nSome limitations should also be highlighted.\
    \ The database of research projects pro-\nvided by CORDIS is a rich and complementary\
    \ instrument of the scientiﬁc production\nassociated with each of the areas and\
    \ allows us to have a more comprehensive view of\nthe projects implemented on\
    \ a global scale considering the perspective of the various\nstakeholders. However,\
    \ the projects included in this database include only projects funded\nby the\
    \ European Commission, although they may include partners outside the European\n\
    Union. It is also relevant to note that the objectives proposed by these projects\
    \ at the time of\ntheir acceptance by the EU often have to be reformulated throughout\
    \ their implementation\nphase. This study does not cover this situation by capturing\
    \ only the objectives of the\nprojects in their design phase. In future work,\
    \ it would be interesting to explore how the\nobjectives of each project are modiﬁed\
    \ with the emergence of new security risks throughout\nits implementation cycle.\
    \ Another limitation of this study is the absence of a quantitative\nand comparative\
    \ metric that would allow us to assess the current relevance of each security\n\
    risk and its potential for growth over the course of this period of learning.\
    \ The study\nonly captured each of the dimensions of security risks without measuring\
    \ their relative\nprevalence. Therefore, for future works, it is suggested that\
    \ each of the security risks be\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n18 of 21\nassessed\
    \ considering their practical impact on building a smart city. This can be achieved\n\
    by carrying out a study considering the speciﬁc scenario of a smart city or adopting\
    \ a\nmore globalizing perspective and reﬂecting the perception of the various\
    \ stakeholders (e.g.,\ncompanies, public institutions, citizens, etc.) about these\
    \ risks.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nInstitutional\

    parks resort to various conventional ways to attract different stakeholders to
    the park. Some of these traditional measures include business support, workspaces,
    laboratories, networking events, accommodation, and essential commodities. Besides,
    with rampantly changing multidisciplinary technologies and increased data-oriented
    business models, the classic science and technology park value-creation strategies
    may not be instrumental in the near future. Hence, we foresee that future science
    and a technology parks should be fully integrated, sustainable, and innovative
    living science cities. Where park tenants can actively interact and contribute
    to emerging technologies. Therefore, this paper carries out an in-depth study
    of world’s best practices in smart cities and science and technology parks, their
    characteristics, and value-added contributions that excite the prospective tenants.
    Developing on the detailed survey, we propose a unique feature of “Autonomous
    Systems as a Service” to bestow a futuristic look to the science and technology
    parks. It is envisaged that autonomous systems will not only provide value-added
    services to the park tenants but will also provide an infrastructure for testing
    new technologies within park premises. Furthermore, this study evaluates security
    and privacy challenges associated with autonomous systems and data-oriented services
    and recommends appropriate security measures. The role of universities in the
    success of a science and technology park is also delineated. Finally, the components
    deemed essential for the attainment of science and technology parks’ objectives
    are highlighted. Adaptive Road Bump – One of the Components of Autonomous Systems

    a Science and Technology Park (STP) dates back to 1953 when the world’s first
    science park was opened at Stanford University, United States [1]. A science park
    is also termed as a technology park or a research park. The primary objective
    of Stanford’s technology park was to provide a pleasant environment for collaboration
    between various stakeholders such as startups, research and development (R&D)
    companies, venture capital firms, and Stanford University’s research brainpower.
    This technology park stimulated regional economic growth, thus transforming regional
    development policies. Similarly, other countries also followed, and in the 1960s
    and 70s, this phenomenon extended to England and Japan. In the 1980s, France,
    Germany, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, and some Southeast Asian countries also laid
    the foundations of such technological parks [2]. Correspondingly, Sydney Science
    Park (SSP) [3], [4] is a multi-billion-dollar greenfield development project that
    aspires to be a world-class facility clustering together leading innovators in
    the industry, education, and business. The vision for SSP is to be a fully integrated,
    innovation-based community that will include high-quality lifestyle opportunities.
    SSP aims to promote a culture of innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship
    to benefit the whole region. However, there may be a question that why do we need
    STPs? It is proffered that the sharing of knowledge and resources is deemed essential
    to promote innovation and technological development. However, there are high communication
    costs associated with the transmission of knowledge to distance. Whereas technology
    parks and incubators support firms to transmit technical knowledge that is complex,
    uncertain, and in the noncodified form [5], [6]. Similarly, STPs and incubators
    fully articulate knowledge flows among the actors of a regional innovation system
    [7], [8]. If we look at the academic aspect of the science parks, the universities
    see the STPs and incubators as a means to conduct productive research and commercialize
    their technologies. The educational institutions also visualize an environment
    where they can improve corporate innovation capacity by converting academic knowledge
    and local R&D into commercial products or processes [9]. Hence, in the last decade
    or so, there has been an exponential rise in entrepreneurial activity at the universities,
    which has further stimulated activities such as patenting, licensing, research
    joint ventures with private companies, and the creation of spinoff companies.
    In this context, the universities resort to licensing for the commercialization
    of university-based Intellectual Property (IP). Correspondingly, universities
    are increasingly emphasizing the creation of new companies as a mechanism for
    commercialization [10]. Moreover, universities also facilitate technology diffusion
    by establishing technology transfer centers through the licensing of a university-based
    technology to an existing firm or a new venture [11]. Accordingly, there has been
    a rise of “Innovation Districts” in the world [12]. Innovation districts can be
    termed as a mash up of entrepreneurs and educational institutions, start-ups and
    schools, to foster mixed-use development and technological innovations. For example,
    David Johnston Research and Technology (R+T) Park [13], is Canada’s largest innovation
    district. This innovation district aims at creation of state-of-the-art (SoTA)
    technology by incubating and helping companies in innovation, harnessing appropriate
    talent, and entering into a world-class ecosystem of startups. The main attractions
    of R+T park include: 1) A strong collaboration with University of Waterloo that
    is known for prolific industry partnerships to solve real-world problems. 2) The
    co-location of R+T park and University of Waterloo gives the residents of research
    and technology park an edge to be closer to the one of the world’s best human
    resource in the form of over sixty thousand students. 3) Availability of an Accelerator
    Centre that offers comprehensive corporate innovation program to facilitate creation
    of spinoffs, develop out of the box solutions to customer problems, and fast validation
    of proposed solutions. However, the desired impact of a STP may vary as per the
    types of tenants it accommodates. For example, the needs of a startup may differ
    from that of an established firm, academic research institution, or a service
    provider [14]. Besides, with rapidly changing multidisciplinary technologies,
    an increase in data-oriented business models, and resulting concerns over users’
    privacy, the classic STP business models may not be very useful. Hence, it is
    envisioned that a STP should be a fully integrated, sustainable, innovative living
    science city. Where park tenants can actively interact and contribute to the future
    technologies with minimal impact to other citizens’ privacy. Accordingly, an ideal
    science park should create value for all types of tenants with a futuristic approach.
    Therefore, there is a need to derive new value-creation strategies for STPs by
    evaluating world’s best practices in technology parks and smart cities to attract
    tenants and promote technological innovation. Moreover, research is also required
    to explore new technologies that would give STPs a futuristic look. Subsequently,
    the proposed innovative systems should be carefully assessed to ensure the security
    and privacy of users’ data in a living science city environment. A. Related Work
    Existing literature on STPs is somewhat shallow, focusing on particular matters
    and therefore not comprehensive. For instance, researchers in [15] only evaluated
    the impact of science parks on local firms to validate policy effectiveness. Similarly,
    another study exclusively analyzed the economic impact of science parks [16].
    In the same way, [17] examined the contributions of science parks to multiple
    stakeholders considering various contingencies. On the other hand, authors in
    [18] reviewed the current state of knowledge on science park contributions and
    proposed ways to enhance this knowledge. Also, some studies either focused on
    the general aspects of science parks [19] or concentrated on business incubation
    mechanisms [20]. Likewise, [21] mapped businesses’ performance and their prospects
    of survival against contributions of STPs. Correspondingly, certain studies explored
    just a particular aspect of science parks such as entrepreneurship and incubators
    [22], effects of STP policies on the creation of spinoff firms [23], generalized
    benefits of parks and incubators [24], and the impact of science parks on different
    types of firms [8], [24]. Correspondingly, [25] proposed a performance management
    framework for science parks to demonstrate results and seek improvements. Similarly,
    [26], [27] analyzed the role of STPs in the United Kingdom (UK) in nurturing scientific
    activity and cooperation between various stakeholders. Likewise, [28] studied
    the effects of research centers and universities on organizations’ growth, innovativeness,
    and overall R&D investments in the science parks. Hence, there is a lack of literature
    that emphasizes the value-creation strategies in STPs. Moreover, given the scope
    of existing literature, authors in [29] proposed that more research be done on
    the development of science parks. To address this, we see an opportunity in the
    ideation and definition of SSP to visualize SSP as an autonomous living city.
    Hence, this paper is relevant to researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested
    in establishing, investing in or joining a STP to make value-added contributions
    or gain from state-of-the-art technological development. Resultantly, this study
    aims to provide a holistic view of a STP as an autonomous living city with a futuristic
    approach. The significant contributions of this research include: Presents a comprehensive
    review of the world’s best practices in STPs and smart cities and their value-added
    contributions in attracting prospective tenants. Introduces numerous Autonomous
    Systems as a Service frameworks for STPs to not only act as the game-changing
    business models but also serve as a testbed for park residents to test and evaluate
    new technologies. Proffers an analysis of security and privacy risks associated
    with autonomous systems and data-oriented services. Recommends appropriate security
    and privacy measures to secure autonomous systems at various layers of the network
    architecture. The data security and privacy measures are further supplemented
    by a consolidated data strategy and viable technical controls to achieve desired
    cyber protection. Stipulates the role of universities/HEIs (Higher Education Institutions)
    in the success of the STP. Establishes a list of components/entities that should
    form part of the STP to help attain most of its goals/objectives. B. Organization
    of the Paper The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II covers
    some basic concepts related to STPs. At the same time, Section III illustrates
    numerous value-creation techniques and proposes ingenious application scenarios
    of ASaaS for STPs. Whereas Section IV highlights threats to data security and
    privacy in autonomous systems and related defensive measures. In addition, Section
    V delineates universities’ role in STPs, and Section VI highlights some essential
    components of STPs. Finally, future challenges and conclusions are emphasized
    in Section VII, and Section VIII respectively. SECTION II. STP - Basic Concepts
    Before we dwell upon the benefits and objectives of STPs, it is imperative to
    differentiate between a smart city and a STP. Both smart cities and STPs are considered
    the hub of technological innovation that offers high-class livability and a quality
    lifestyle. However, it is perceived that a smart city is just an application of
    technology with the vision of providing futuristic, safe, and interactive environment
    for living [30]. In comparison, a STP is believed to be a property-based initiative
    close to HEIs [31], that fosters innovation by increasing R&D activities, extending
    cooperation among firms [32], facilitating knowledge transfer, and promoting the
    transfer-of-technology (ToT). Moreover, STPs also provide infrastructure, business
    support, and allied services to support the growth of startups and young firms
    [33]. In general, the vision of STPs is to bolster the knowledge-based economy
    and contribute towards local and regional economic growth [34]. Since the distinction
    between STP and a smart city is now clear, it is important to illustrate the fundamental
    benefits of STPs. A. Benefits of a STP Some of the perceived benefits expected
    out of STPs with respect to various stakeholders are shown in Table.1. It is evident
    that to harbor a knowledge-based economy, a meticulously planned and efficiently
    managed STP accrues knowledge sharing between startups and other technology-based
    young firms. Another significant contribution of a science park with a pristine
    location is increased collaboration between co-located organizations, technology-based
    young firms, industrial R&D centers, and universities. Hence, multiple-stakeholders
    residing, working, and collaborating in the shared space also benefit from unplanned
    data sharing. It is also believed that proximity to universities’ research brain
    in the STP is productive for all the stakeholders. Correspondingly, if we consider
    other factors such as proximity to HEIs’ research centers, closeness to same sector
    firms, availability of specialized labs and testing facilities, a well-equipped
    and prepared STP stimulates innovation [15]. Which subsequently results in a high
    number of patents and IP [35]. TABLE 1 Benefits of a Science and Technology Park
    Furthermore, a well-reputed science park boosts the tenants’ image (all stakeholders)
    [36]. It also attracts customers to various state-of-the-art products developed
    by commercially oriented or science-based firms. Moreover, as discussed earlier,
    a well-managed STP usually offers high livability conditions for its prospective
    tenants [37]. Additionally, a STP developed with a futuristic approach provides
    various high-tech services to its users, thus attracting a large number of national
    and international companies with promising growth potential [38]. Therefore, a
    user-oriented specialized STP supplied with a high standard lifestyle, essential
    commodities, public spaces, and high tech research facilities promotes social
    networking [39] and attracts a skilled workforce [40], [41]. Finally, the utmost
    benefit of a STP to any region is increased economic activity based on research
    and accelerated development of new technologies [21]. Undoubtedly, the above-quoted
    benefits are attainable; however, a STP should carefully set its objectives to
    achieve desired goals. B. Objectives of a STP Keeping in view the desired benefits
    of STPs discussed in the previous section, some of the elementary objectives (shown
    in Fig.1) that a science park must pursuit include: Reduce the gap between universities
    and the industry. Increase networking and collaboration between park tenants by
    facilitating accessibility [42]. Augment knowledge sharing [43]. Ease ToT between
    various stakeholders. Enhance regional technological developments. Promote innovation
    and boost regional economic development. Increase innovation efficiency [44].
    Help educational institutions/startups showcase their technologies to secure funds
    for future developments [45]. Accelerate technological development by localizing
    technology-based firms at one location [29]. Facilitate regional progress by establishing
    a localized mechanism for shared resources and knowledge development [46]. Support
    product development life cycle through all stages, i.e., (a) concept development,
    (b) design and engineering, (c) prototyping, and testing, and (d) launch stage
    [47]. Make the science park a living science city by planning, designing, developing,
    and deploying value-added autonomous tech services for the park tenants. Provide
    a conducive environment and infrastructure for the testing and evaluation of new
    technologies. Promote and support local industry, and the R&D sector, by developing
    autonomous systems locally. Provide excellent and cost-effective services (including
    accommodation, dining, workspace, business support, leisure, networking venues,
    etc.) FIGURE 1. Objectives of a science and technology park. Show All SECTION
    III. Value Creation for the STP Tenants It is envisioned that the progressive
    firms and other industry representatives residing in the science park facilitate
    achieving most of the park objectives. Hence, a STP should endeavor to offer unique
    value-added services to attract progressive tenants. Correspondingly, researchers
    in [18] emphasize that the science parks should have the means to make alluring
    contributions to all the stakeholders. Also, there should be exceptional reasons
    why the industry, startups, entrepreneurs, and Venture Capitalists (VCs) come
    to the STPs. Therefore, to form a consensus on the essential attributes that a
    science park should have, we analyzed some of the world’s best practices in various
    science parks around the globe, including the Netherlands and Sweden [15], [48].
    It is observed that the critical attributes of a science park (that the park tenants
    perceive to be attracted to) are business support, park management’s commitment
    and expertise, proximity to universities and other firms, and high tech infrastructure.
    According to “Triple Helix Theory” [49], integration of industry, academia, and
    other sectors is a common trait of successful STPs. There are other contributing
    factors/attributes as well, which are highlighted in the following paragraphs.
    Considering the importance of business support, science parks usually support
    the new firms initially during the park’s planning stages and later during provisioning
    of desired services. Correspondingly, during the science park planning stages,
    the business support aims to attract quality firms, startups, and entrepreneurs.
    Moreover, park management selects/prioritizes the prospective tenants based on
    their knowledge intensity, innovativeness and by mapping their technical profile
    to the on-site HEI’s research activities. The park management can also offer business
    support to the tenants in the form of consultation related to marketing, finance,
    IP, copyrights, and government regulations. Furthermore, financial support to
    the firms may be provided through public and private VC organizations and seed
    capital providers. Subsequently, the activities and services that fall under business
    support once the science park is operational may include the university-led incubation
    and development programs. The incubators advise and assist the firms through kick-start
    programs in the initial period (a few months) of their establishment. The assistance
    can be external consultancy, access to lawyers, marketing experts, business coaches,
    and technical facilities. Correspondingly, young firms or startups are also interested
    in various training activities offered by the park management. These may include
    specialized workshops, symposiums, or demonstrations. The new businesses are also
    interested in multiple entrepreneurship programs offered during their respective
    preincubation, incubation, and post-incubation period. These programs also help
    the startups develop/refine their business ideas and reduce the investors’ risks.
    Another critical attribute is industrial R&D that increases collaboration and
    stimulates innovation. Then is the establishment of laboratories, which facilitates
    testing and experimentation. Similarly, proximity to universities and co-located
    firms/startups results in more complex innovation and a high number of patents.
    Thus the enterprises prefer to locate on-park premises to establish connections
    with the universities and associated research centers [50]. Moreover, an affordable
    and high-tech workplace as per business’s needs, including green environmentally
    sound spaces, always attracts potential tenants. In addition, information sharing
    between park tenants is also believed to enhance innovation, increase collaboration
    among the stakeholders, and boost technological development. It is also observed
    that the STP tenants are interested in the social events organized by the park
    management or other stakeholders. These events are taken as networking opportunities
    to increase personal interaction, knowledge transfer, and seek professional partnerships.
    The social events may include academic conferences, seminars, and roadshows. In
    the context of social events, the provision of facilities such as conference rooms,
    exhibition halls, auditoriums, and theatres by the science park management is
    considered an essential element in attracting enterprises and industry leaders
    to the park premises. Moreover, the availability of a resilient, sustainable,
    and highly livable environment is also a contributing factor to attract people
    from various walks of life to the park. Likewise, park tenants also expect the
    availability of essential services such as restaurants, bars, banks, ATMs, supermarkets,
    and post offices. Moreover, prestigious locations are in high demand by startups
    and high-tech companies to showcase their ideas and technologies. A science park’s
    site should also be in closer proximity to an international airport to facilitate
    cargo and human resource transfer/travel. Similarly, accessibility is another
    contributing factor to attract firms to the science park. Where accessibility
    refers to the access to support services and technical knowledge provided by the
    network of neighboring/co-located firms [51]. Moreover, a clearly defined business
    plan by the STP for valuable knowledge sharing and service provisioning is also
    seen positively by the park tenants [21]. Researchers have also identified that
    the tech firms chose to stay on-site in a well-established science park to build
    up their prestige [52], [53]. Finally, the science park management’s commitment,
    expertise, and services offered also play a vital role in the success of a STP.
    A. Case Study of Singapore - the Smartest City of the Future The previous section
    highlighted the importance of business support, proximity to universities, and
    other critical attributes that mostly contribute to a STP’s success. However,
    in this section, we analyze various factors that make a city highly futuristic
    and boost its livability by improving its residents’ quality of life. The same
    attributes can be inherited by the STPs to transform into high-tech living science
    cities and attract prospective tenants. For this purpose, because of developed
    IT infrastructure, strong government support, effective IP laws, and innovation-friendly
    environment, we selected Singapore as a case study [54]–[56]. The Singapore government
    endeavors to make Singapore the smartest city in the world by 2025. In this regard,
    Singapore is developing and implementing future technologies in eight highly technical
    and specialized areas. The first on the list is the use of autonomous cars. Singapore
    has implemented autonomous taxis since 2015, and to further promulgate the use
    of driver-less cars, the National University of Singapore (NUS) has developed
    and implemented the concept of self-propelled golf buggies. Similarly, Nanyang
    Technological University (NTU) is working on driver-less city buses and aims to
    bring them on the roads by 2022. Secondly, the Singapore Government is using drones
    to enhance the local policing capability to monitor crowds. The specialized police
    drones are equipped with powerful sirens, blue and red police lights, and a searchlight
    almost ten times more potent than a standard car headlight. Besides, the police
    are also making use of autonomous ground bots (rovers) for remote surveillance.
    The rover is equipped with cameras and sensors and is fully independent. However,
    it can be programmed with pre-planned routes for navigation. Moreover, to raise
    the living standard and quality of life of its people, the Singapore Government
    has paid due attention to smart homes. These houses have been equipped to automate
    the daily routine of the residents. In this context, the house lighting, Heating
    Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), infotainment, energy, and security settings
    can be customized as per the user’s preferences. For example, the smart home can
    be configured to switch off extra lights, raise curtains, reduce security level,
    start the coffee machine, and regulate shower temperature under the good morning
    settings as per user-preferred timings. Similarly, the settings can be configured
    to prepare for bedtime. Correspondingly, robotic vacuums and smart house assistance
    are common elements in Singapore households. Furthermore, to ensure citizens’
    security on the roads, the Singapore Government is developing smart lamp posts
    (street lights). These lamp posts are equipped with numerous sensors to monitor
    environmental changes, respond to high sounds like car crashes, and screams for
    help. Also, plans have been made to install smart radars and facial recognition
    systems to detect unusual traffic and unlawful citizens. Another technological
    landmark achievement of Singapore is the ubiquitous use of robots. It is estimated
    that there are around four hundred and eighty-eight robots per ten thousand people
    in Singapore. The robots have been employed in shopping malls where people can
    interact with them by asking questions. These robots can also sing, rap, wink,
    crack jokes, and perform cleaning duties. They are also being used in restaurants
    to collect and return trays and used crockery from the dining tables. A more official
    version of the robots is being used as robocops at airports. These robocops act
    as auxiliary police and perform various security duties. Another breed of robots
    is being employed in pharmacies to assist its human counterparts in delivering
    medicines. Other than these, there are numerous personal, social, and service
    robots, e.g., a robot-coach that advises and demonstrates physical exercises to
    the senior citizens. Another monumental step by the Singapore Government is the
    amalgamation with Virtual Reality (VR). Subsequently, different VR applications
    have been developed and put into use, e.g., intelligent interactive mirrors have
    been deployed to help kids with learning disabilities to practice various tasks
    such as tracking a train or finding the way to a particular restaurant. Similarly,
    equal attention has been given to Augmented Reality (AR) applications used by
    various enterprises to attract customers to their products and try them virtually.
    Lastly, the Singapore Government is in the process of deploying a three-dimensional
    (3D) city model to provide a testing ground to students, researchers, citizens,
    and government officials for various learning, planning, and professional activities.
    B. Autonomous Systems as a Service Keeping in view the discussion on park attributes
    and cutting edge technologies in the preceding sections, we propose a unique feature
    of Autonomous Systems as a Service (ASaaS). In this business model, numerous autonomous
    systems and smart applications provide unparalleled services to the park tenants.
    One of the reasons we are interested in ASaaS is that these are economical besides
    other value-added services. They also reduce the associated risks to human lives
    [57] in the provision of various services and increase the quality of life. However,
    before these autonomous systems are discussed, it is imperative to understand
    an autonomous system’s basic concepts and requirements in a STP setting. 1) Autonomous
    System Definition The history of autonomous systems dates back to 1964 when Leonard
    Scheer from APL Adaptive Machines Group developed and demonstrated sensors and
    actuators supported autonomous rover system. The rover could navigate, identify
    an electrical outlet, and plug in to recharge its batteries without any human
    intervention. Hence, an autonomous system can be defined as a system that can
    change/modify its behavior when subjected to unexpected events during operation
    [57]. However, once we talk about ASaaS in a science park, a particular system
    must meet some essential requirements. 2) Requirements for an Autonomous System
    in a STP An autonomous system should be designed and developed based on open systems
    and standards-based approaches for compatibility with other technologies. It should
    interact with users through a well-designed mobile application (app). In addition
    to default settings, the system should have the capability of being personalized
    by remembering user’s preferences so that his experience is always familiar and
    easy. It must conform to respective country’s legislative, regulatory, and standards
    frameworks, e.g., Section 95 of Australian Government’s Privacy Act 1988 [58],
    outlines the guidelines issued by National Health and Medical Research Council
    (NHMRC) concerning handling/processing of personal health information. Ensure
    security and privacy of users’ data at all stages of STP operation. It should
    be self-sustained (including operation and maintenance). To reduce the carbon
    footprint and support renewable energy technologies, the system should focus on
    using solar energy, energy harvesting mechanism, or other green energy technologies.
    To create a unified or collated picture of the ASaaS to the park tenants, all
    the autonomous systems should be able to integrate. It should support open communications
    protocols/standards. The system should have minimal operation and maintenance
    requirements (including infrastructure, human resources, power, spares, scheduled
    servicing, etc.) Availability of any simulation technology or a lab setup related
    to a particular/multiple autonomous systems will help the researchers and industry
    partners test and further improve respective technology/system. C. Proposed Autonomous
    Systems for a STP Fig.2 gives an overview of the autonomous systems that we have
    conceived for STPs. The design details, features, and the services offered by
    respective systems to the STP tenants are illustrated in following paragraphs.
    FIGURE 2. Autonomous systems in science and technology parks. Show All 1) Smart
    and Green Environment According to [15] a vibrant and green landscaped public
    area indicates the level of environmental quality. Correspondingly, potential
    tenants of the science park value a clean and healthy environment for quality
    living. Hence, we propose an autonomous environment monitoring system that is
    self-sustainable in monitoring and maintaining healthy air and water quality levels.
    Such an approach is also expected to ensure high flora and fauna standards in
    the STPs. The factors that contribute to achieving the desired outcomes through
    autonomous smart and green environment system may include: Monitoring of air pollution
    (including vehicle emission control), and water quality. Monitoring of soil quality
    to assist in the growth of vegetation in the area. Soil moisture testing to facilitate
    smart irrigation. Smart weather monitoring; Weather sensors can be integrated
    with intelligent street lights. These sensors can monitor and analyze the effects
    of global warming and propose remedial measures. Smart tree monitoring: Smart
    tree sensors enable efficient monitoring of tree states. This not only ensures
    a cost-effective optimal tree growth and cheaper maintenance but also helps in
    early detection of diseases. A green environment is not possible without green
    energy such as solar or wind power. Hence, the due focus should be given to renewable
    energy sources in a STP. Correspondingly, to promulgate green environment, researchers
    in [59] highlight the importance of sustainable, intelligent buildings. It is
    believed that the availability of smart and green buildings is one of the main
    attractions to lure potential tenants to the STPs. The main features of intelligent
    buildings include indoor environment control, water, and energy efficiency, eco-friendly
    construction, roof-top/vertical gardens, durable and sustainable design, waste
    reduction and management, smart surveillance and intrusion detection system, disaster
    response, high tech ICT services, dynamic and spacious workspaces, and last but
    not the least charging stations for electric/hybrid vehicles. Similarly, since
    the onset of the fourth revolution in agriculture triggered by the advancement
    in ICT, especially Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, there has been an increased
    focus on smart/autonomous farming [60]. Smart farms not only ensure food sustainability
    but also make efficient use of the available space. Today, numerous robotic machines
    can autonomously perform various farming/agriculture operations, including weeding,
    harvesting, plowing, fertilizing, and irrigation. In addition, autonomous drones
    have been developed to calculate biomass development and fertilization status
    of the crops [60]. The drones also provide visual information to the farmers concerning
    various plant diseases. Similarly, advancement in IoT technologies can be beneficial
    in cattle, horses, ducks, swans, or other domestic animals/wildlife management.
    Correspondingly, we propose a business model of Autonomous Farming as a Service
    in the subsequent paras. a: Autonomous Farming as a Service To patronage the concept
    of a STP as a self-sustainable autonomous greenfield project, there may be one
    to two-acre size farms to grow different crops, vegetables, and fruits to sustain
    park tenants. Hence, to effectively and efficiently realize agriculture (Agri)
    farms’ development and autonomous management in STPs, we propose Autonomous Farming
    as a Service (aFaaS). The proposed system aspires to tackle conventional agriculture
    problems such as high machinery costs, safety risks concerning massive machines,
    shortage of skilled labor, the slower value of trade-ins, long working hours,
    wastage of products, and materials during seeding, fertilizing, spraying, harvesting,
    picking, sorting, and irrigation. Moreover, it is difficult for farmers to detect
    and identify crop/plant diseases in time for effective treatment without losses
    in crop yields in traditional settings. Furthermore, the human workforce’s safety
    and health concerns due to accidents while working with heavy machinery and pesticides
    is also a matter of grave concern. Hence, the concept of precision agriculture/farming
    involves farm management with the support of various technologies. The primary
    objective is to improve crop production and environmental quality. Thus, to address
    above mentioned problems, assist farmers in optimizing every acre of their operation,
    and achieve high productivity with reduced cost effect, aFaaS utilizes advancements
    in agricultural technologies, especially the autonomous systems [61]–[63]. Before
    illustrating aFaaS business model shown in Fig.3, it is highlighted that all the
    autonomous vehicles, robots, and agricultural machines have some common traits.
    They all are equipped with a navigation system and multiple layers of safety equipment,
    sensors, and tools to detect obstacles (tree line, water bodies, power lines,
    rocks, etc.), perform self-diagnostics and generate an alarm in the case of any
    error/faults to notify owners. The sensing and safety equipment includes LiDAR
    (Light Detection and Ranging) to create a 3D map of the area, SONAR (Sound Navigation
    and Ranging), visual cameras, and IR sensors to detect obstacles, kill switches
    for emergency stop, environmental sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, wind speed and GPS for navigation [64]. FIGURE 3. Autonomous farming
    as a service. Show All Moreover, before the autonomous agricultural machinery
    is put into operation, the farmer creates the path plan by entering the boundary
    and permanent obstacles information for each field/farm on the field’s satellite
    image using aFaaS user app. To cater to people who are not comfortable with computers
    and technology, they can follow the “Drive and Learn” approach. In which, the
    farmer can map the field/farm by driving in the farm. After that, with the help
    of LiDAR and other sensing equipment, the field/farm boundary and obstacles are
    automatically mapped through the aFaaS app. The autonomous robots/machines can
    then move on the prescribed route using GPS. Moreover, the farmer can set various
    parameters for a particular agriculture operation, e.g., in the case of seeding,
    he can set the seed density, the pattern of laying, and the distance between each
    seed location through aFaaS app. Another key highlight of aFaaS is that it does
    not employ exiting large-scale agricultural machineries such as tractors, harvesters,
    and sprayers. Instead, based on the concept of Mobile Agricultural Robot Swarms
    (MARS) [65] and swarm farms [66], aFaaS employs swarms of small agricultural robots
    with a modular design. These robots can be customized for a particular task. Moreover,
    the robots are carried and managed through a mobile Robots Transport and Coordination
    Unit (RTCU). The RTCU acts as a transporter for the robots and can also store
    supplies, e.g., seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides, spare tools, batteries,
    etc. RTCU also functions as a Real-time Kinematic (RTK) base station to ensure
    robots’ positional accuracy. On the other hand, the robots can operate around
    the clock with satellite navigation and data management through aFaaS and STP
    Data Arena (being illustrated later in Section-III-C8). At the same time, the
    farm owners have permanent access to their data. As shown in Fig.3, the autonomous
    robots can perform numerous agricultural/farming tasks [67] including soil sampling
    and testing, seeding, planting, spraying, weeding, crop protection and inspection,
    watering, harvesting, fruit picking, sorting, materials handling, pruning, and
    grass cutting/mowing. It can also be seen that aFaaS may employ a combination
    of aerial and ground robots as per the requirements of the tasks. Although some
    of the agricultural/farming operations can be achieved by both platforms, yet
    there are some distinctions. Ground-based autonomous robots varying in shapes
    and sizes such as a crawler, caterpillar [68], [69] and the most simplistic wheeled
    platforms are the common types. As compared to their aerial counterparts, ground
    robots can be equipped with more sensors and actuators without considering their
    weight. The sensors may include GPS, LiDAR (considered better than Radars), SONAR,
    visual cameras, kill switches, and weather sensors. Moreover, the autonomous robots
    designed for picking fruits may have different types of end-effectors, e.g., electric
    gripper, pneumatic gripper, suction cups [70], gecko gripper, origami flower gripper,
    fruit picker, trash fingers [71] and other robotic tools, depending upon the shape
    and size of the fruit, bins, or nature of the task. Similarly, to compensate for
    the terrain-specific limitations of wheeled robots, spherical robots can also
    be used in all-terrain types for exploration [72], surveillance [73], and measuring
    soil temperature and moisture for precise agriculture [74]. Hence, some of the
    tasks that can be performed explicitly by ground-based autonomous agricultural
    robots include: Seeding and planting: Ground-based robots controlled by RTCU can
    be employed in a swarm for seeding or planting crops/saplings. Weeding: It involves
    using computer vision and machine learning (ML) to detect weed in cereal crops
    such as wheat, rice, maize, oat, barley, rye, and millet. The weed can be controlled
    by two methods. The first one is precision spraying, in which the robots accurately
    spray herbicides at the exact location of the weed to prevent any overlapping
    or overflow of the pesticides. However, chemically removing the weed has other
    associated hazards affecting actual crops and adjacent soil. Hence, to manually
    remove the weed in an old-fashioned way without any labor and in less time, autonomous
    robots can be equipped with a plucking tool. It is also visualized that the robots
    can autonomously navigate different field configurations and run unstoppable for
    long hours [75]. Precision spraying: Use of pesticides is necessary to prevent
    crop losses and improve yield. Conventionally, farmers use traditional sprayers
    to apply pesticides. These sprayers distribute them uniformly over the entire
    field. Subsequently, due to toxicity, pesticides have a significant impact on
    the environment and people’s health. Therefore, there is a need for accurate delivery
    of defoliants in the correct amount using a fleet of autonomous robots to reduce
    the impact on humans and the environment [76]. Soil moisture and temperature sensing:
    Ground robots equipped with the right tools are the most suitable for checking
    soil moisture and temperature, especially once crops/plants grow up and it is
    not easy to access soil from the top. Precision irrigation. Based on soil moisture
    and soil temperature readings, the ground-based robots can be utilized for precise
    watering of the crops/plants. Such a controlled irrigation mechanism will help
    in conserving water, especially in dry or drought-hit areas. Measurement of water
    stress: An autonomous ground-based robot equipped with a micro-thermal and hyperspectral
    camera can measure water stress in a farm/field. Water stress can arise due to
    excess water (in case of floods) or water deficit (during drought) and affect
    crop productivity. Therefore, measurement of water stress level in a field is
    essential to ensure precise watering of the crops/plants. Measurement of Leaf
    Area Index (LAI): Robots on the ground are suitable to measure LAI. Where LAI
    is the ratio of leaf surface to the unit ground area, which reflects the essential
    ecological characteristics by quantifying the amount of foliage in the plant canopy
    [77]. Autonomous ground robots are also useful for grass cutting/mowing without
    any human intervention. In comparison with ground-based robots, aerial platforms
    can be employed for: Pest and disease control: Pests and diseases can be detected
    in crops/plants by applying computer vision techniques on RGB (Red Green Blue)
    and 3D images of the crops/plants [78], [79]. Moreover, the same can also be done
    by taking samples from the fields/orchards and analyzing them in the laboratory.
    Correspondingly, the correct amount of fertilizers can be calculated and applied
    to the crops [80], [81] with precision and economy of effort using robots. There
    are, however, different parameters that need to be optimized for the effective
    and efficient delivery of fertilizers. These parameters include the operational
    height and velocity of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the volume of fertilizer
    delivered as per different heights and types of plants. Yield Prediction: UAVs
    can also collect RGB and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from
    the crop/plants. The collected data can then be analyzed to predict crop yield
    using deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) [82]. Distributed environmental monitoring
    and assistance in crop pollination: Micro aerial robots to the likes of RoboBees
    [83] may be employed to monitor environmental parameters. They can also assist
    in the pollination of plants as well as crops in the STP. Crop inspection and
    protection: Appropriately equipped autonomous drones can inspect the crops and
    plants. The drones provide high-resolution images that can be used to check crops,
    detect diseases, and find unseeded rows or bare soil in the field [84]. Similarly,
    UAVs can also protect crops and fruit trees from birds. Cattle spotting: Australia
    is home to world’s largest cattle stations. E.g., Anna Creek has an area of around
    twenty-four thousand square kilometers, followed by three other stations with
    an area of more than fifteen thousand square kilometers [85]. Therefore, cattle
    in such large areas can only be tracked and monitored by using aerial platforms.
    b: Agri Farms Mapping Service Mapping of agricultural and forestry land provides
    means to estimate current production and environmental states. It also helps in
    monitoring progress over time. The information on production and ecological conditions
    can be used in site-specific farming to tailor specific crop and soil treatments
    for each field [86], [87]. Keeping in view the advancements in 3D mapping technologies
    and their benefits for the farmers, a STP may offer Agri farms mapping service.
    There are two ways to create a 3D map of a field: using ground-based robots and,
    secondly, by utilizing aerial technologies. Correspondingly, satellite imagery
    and the images obtained from manned aircraft are used to map land all over the
    world. However, satellite and aircraft sensory data’s spatial resolution is of
    low quality compared to a UAV. However, some limitations may affect the quality
    of images or operation of UAVs. E.g., the presence of clouds, the extended data
    delivery times, the need for special permissions, and the cost effect. Subsequently,
    the low spatial resolution sensory data may underestimate productivity and environmental
    factors and result in insufficient treatment coverage [88]. Besides, with the
    advancements in vertical take-off and landing technologies, UAVs like quadcopters
    are among the best alternatives. These UAVs are economical, efficient, can carry
    multiple sensors, and do not have many restrictions on the usage [89]. UAVs equipped
    with multi-spatial sensors, including LiDAR, RGB, thermal, and hyperspectral imaging,
    can be used to map green farms. Similarly, LiDAR mapping data can then be used
    to evaluate the impact of agricultural production methods [90]. In addition to
    large-scale farms, LiDAR mapping and monitoring [91] can also be applied to orchards
    and wineries. Moreover, the mapped data can also estimate crop volume/canopy and
    related biomass for precise delivery of nitrogen (N), which is the primary source
    of nutrients for crops/plants. Similarly, ground-based mobile robots equipped
    with a stereo camera, location sensor, and inertial measurement unit [92] can
    create 3D terrain maps using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm
    for precise agriculture [93]. We believe that the above-discussed mapping technologies
    can also be used to create a 3D map of a STP for the urban archaeology project.
    c: Soil Testing as a Service (STaaS) Soil plays an integral part in keeping the
    environment healthy by regulating N use and carbon flow. Similarly, soils help
    in mitigating greenhouse gasses [94]. However, crop health may be threatened by
    soil-borne diseases. Numerous factors influence soil-borne diseases such as block
    selection, crop rotation, varieties, nutrition, irrigation, and fumigation [95].
    Therefore, healthy soil is essential for the environment and high yields in Agri
    farms. Hence, to facilitate commercial and household farmers, the STP must offer
    STaaS, in which autonomous robots collect soil samples from the prescribed location.
    The soil samples are then analyzed and profiled for the microbial population using
    Next Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS). STaaS may also provide agronomic insights
    from soil data using AI-driven analytics. The test results will help farmers understand
    their soils and decide on the type and amount of nutrients, fertilizers, and water
    to be used in the farms. There might be a question of what advantages we get by
    using autonomous robots for agricultural tasks. Rather people are a bit pessimistic
    about giving autonomy to the machines. Subsequently, they see it as a safety risk
    in case of a hardware/software failure and a threat to human jobs. However, in
    reality, autonomous technologies are paving the way to create and grow new industries.
    Similarly, jobs requiring skills related to servicing, managing, observing, and
    optimizing autonomous systems’ performance are emerging. Moreover, the demand
    for competent data engineers and analysts is also on the rise. Some other benefits
    of using robots in the agriculture/farming sector are: Robots can perform dangerous
    and high precision monotone tasks. Autonomous robots can be more efficient in
    performing Agri tasks because they better understand the situation based on sensor
    data and access to online databases and forecasts. Robots mostly operate on batteries
    or solar energy; hence they contribute to a greener future with less carbon footprint
    and noise pollution. Robots will optimize the use of resources, including water,
    energy, time, and skilled workforce. Thus, increasing the yields of the farms.
    Save farm workers from various risks/hazards including: Exposure to pesticides.
    long working hours. Injuries from heavy machinery. Exposure to heat and ultraviolet
    (UV) rays. Organic dust toxic syndrome that is caused by inhaling dust from moldy
    material, thus causing an inflammatory reaction in the lungs. Exposure to excessive
    noise from machines. Risk of accidents caused by fatigue, wild weather, and equipment
    failure. Stress of health-related claims and huge costs of medicines. However,
    at the same time, there are particular challenges associated with using robots
    in farming. For instance, unlike industrial, the agricultural environment is not
    controlled. Hence, natural calamities like rain, storms, flood, fire, and earthquakes
    affect the operations. Therefore, agriculture requires more versatile and robust
    robots. Moreover, despite high economic and environmental benefits, the adoption
    of autonomous Agri technologies is very slow [96]. This lag can be attributed
    to knowledge gaps in farmers around the world. Besides, precision farming has
    not been adopted in an umbrella deployment. Instead, some specific tasks are automated
    to meet the farmers’ needs. Correspondingly, the existing robotic technology in
    precision agriculture is limited to vehicle guidance and auto-steer systems. The
    reason is that the economic benefits are easily achievable without requiring the
    integration of additional components or decision support systems [96]. However,
    it is envisaged that aFaaS offered by the futuristic STPs will pave the way for
    better understanding and complete transformation of traditional agriculture/farming
    operations with autonomous technologies. d: Autonomous Vertical Farms To avoid
    uncertainties emerging from natural calamities and global warming, a more refined
    variant of smart farms is autonomous vertical farming. The concept of vertical
    farms is not new. In 2010, Kono Designs created an urban farm in a nine-story
    office building (Pasona Headquarters) in Tokyo, Japan. In addition to providing
    green space, this farm also allows its employees to grow and harvest their food
    at work [97]. Vertical farming is expected to be the best option to meet future
    food production requirements in the backdrop of the rapidly increasing global
    population, shrinking agricultural lands, and adverse effects of global warming
    [98]. Hence, vertical farming’s primary objective is to yield maximum harvest
    with economical use of resources and zero waste in a minimum possible space. E.g.,
    as shown in Fig.4, a small autonomous farm can even fit into a standard shipping
    container [99]. The farm is equipped with various sensors and actuators to automate
    the processes without any human intervention. The smart environment provides a
    crop with a perfect climate, including light, temperature, humidity, nutrients,
    and water every day. On the contrary, it is impossible in the natural environment.
    FIGURE 4. Autonomous vertical farm. Show All One of the significant benefits of
    growing plants in such a concealed/controlled environment is that there is no
    need for any pesticides or herbicides. Hence, there is no danger of passing any
    contamination to humans. The automated farm in the shipping container is designed
    in a way that one container can accommodate hundreds of trays. At the same time,
    the dimensions of the trays can be adjusted as per the size of the plant/crop.
    Therefore, each vertical farm can be individually climate controlled, allowing
    for a perfect environment for each crop at every stage of its life. Moreover,
    the sensors-based watering system ensures that water and nutrients are distributed
    as per requirement, and the excess water is also recycled. It has been tested
    and proven that autonomous vertical farms yield quality products in terms of size,
    taste, and nutrient value and ensure the efficient and economical use of resources
    [100], [101]. 2) Smart Living Besides dynamic workspaces, smart living is an equal
    fascination for present and future park tenants. The desired services in this
    regard include: Smart Homes: Houses with an intelligent security system, smart
    lighting, and HVAC (energy-saving mode when the house is empty) are no more out
    of reach. Hence, STP’s management must provide intelligent homes equipped with
    high-tech gadgets/technologies to its tenants. Similarly, the availability of
    intelligent appliances such as a smart refrigerator with inventory notifications
    and smart vehicle diagnostics (fuel, battery, tire pressure, coolant, engine oil)
    is also vital. Correspondingly, an intelligent home application (app) must allow
    the residents to configure different ambient settings such as “bedtime” mode.
    In this mode, the unnecessary lights (as per user’s preferences) are switched
    off, the security system is armed, and nonrequired appliances are put into idle
    mode. In the same way in the “Good Morning” mode, the security lights and nonessential
    security equipment are switched off, and necessary appliances such as coffee machine,
    toaster, and oven are warmed up. Smart Personal Assistant: This feature allows
    providing services to a tenant as per his personal preferences. E.g., the tenant
    gets an alert for wake-up as per daily traffic, road and weather conditions, office
    time, meetings schedule, or if the vehicle requires refueling. He may also be
    notified when there is a restaurant deal on his favorite dish, or he gets an alert
    for his favorite movie show in the cinema. Similarly, a resident may be suggested
    to attend a social/professional networking event in the science park based on
    his professional/personal interests, research area, skills, etc. eHealth: Remote
    healthcare is considered a basic need in the current pandemics era. The remote
    health monitoring devices comprising sensing and actuating systems keep track
    of an individual’s vital physiological signs and inform the medical personnel
    immediately upon any medical emergency. In this context, a portable, lightweight
    on-body sensing device can monitor a person’s vitals, including heart rate, ECG,
    blood pressure, and blood sugar. It can also keep track of and inform the patient
    at the time of his usual medication. The data or any alarm generated by these
    devices instantly notifies the medical center for emergency response [102], [103].
    Smart Utilities: For efficient usage of home utilities such as water, gas, and
    electricity, smart metering can be offered as a service (SMaaS). Hence, the residents
    can be informed about the utilities’ usage in real-time. This service can be provided
    in the form of a smart metering app embedded in the science park user dashboard
    (main app). The smart metering app will assist the users in efficient and economical
    use of the utilities based on peak and off-peak hours [104]. Moreover, data collected
    through smart meters help the service providers detect any leakages, line losses,
    or faults at the earliest than the manual metering services [105]. Likewise, smart
    metering also reduces the cost of manual meter reading, and the continuous information
    flow helps the distributors understand demand patterns and supply forecasts. Hence,
    the utility companies can reduce operational costs and pass some of this financial
    relief onto the consumers. iShopping: Although world’s first VR-based shopping
    app was launched in May 2016 to enhance customers’ shopping experience [106].
    However, in a post-pandemic (COVID-19) environment, online shopping has increased
    enormously [107]. For example, in South Australia, online shopping has seen an
    increase of sixty-four percent (Year Over Year (YOY)) in November 2020 [108].
    No wonder businesses worldwide have started using immersive VR environments to
    provide an interactive in-store equivalent shopping experience to the customers
    without leaving their homes [109]. Hence, today people can shop for clothes by
    trying them virtually using mobile VR and AR apps. Moreover, they can also buy
    products, e.g., furniture, by virtually decorating their house/room space. Therefore,
    we foresee STPs offering a VR/AR-based shopping services to the park tenants in
    both online and in-store environments. The objective should be to make the life
    of the park tenants productive and easy. Some other features of the perceived
    VR/AR-based shopping environment in the STPs may include; display of product’s
    key features, e.g., for food products, it may show its origin, date of the package,
    user rating, taste, seed or seedless, nutritional information, special offers,
    and comparative prices at other stores. Smart Pet Grooming: In today’s busy life,
    it is challenging and stressful for people working in offices for long hours to
    take care of their pets at home. Hence, to facilitate researchers, developers,
    and other tenants at STPs, a smart pet monitoring, and grooming system is recommended.
    Such a system should have the capability to monitor the pet’s whereabouts, interact
    and play with it like humans, take it for a walk (in case of dogs), conduct scheduled
    or emergency visits to the vet, and feed the pets at times prescribed by the owner.
    This interactive assistance in the absence of a human owner is expected to keep
    the pets stress-free and happy and keep them refrained from destructive activities
    while home alone. Correspondingly, there has been a significant advancement in
    computing, sensing, and actuating communications technologies and automobiles.
    However, at the same time, an increase in population has given rise to the number
    of cars on the roads, thus creating a stressful negative impact on the environment,
    human safety, and transportation systems [110]. Hence, to increase drivers’ and
    driving safety, efficient time management, and optimum resource utilization, some
    of the leading tech companies, car manufacturers, and governments have started
    investing in autonomous cars. The greater interest in autonomous car technologies
    is to launch personal and fully commercialized autonomous car fleets to improve
    traffic safety. 3) Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Keeping abreast with world trends
    and future requirements, the modern STPs should aim to provide autonomous MaaS
    for park tenants and visitors. More importantly, the science parks must serve
    as a testing ground for new autonomous transport infrastructure and related technologies
    by providing a rare real-life greenfield city environment. In this regard, the
    primary prerequisite is autonomous intelligence, which must permeate the system,
    from recharging, to maintenance, garaging, parcel handling, scheduling, and user
    interaction. Correspondingly, some other desired constituents of MaaS are: Autonomous
    Vehicles: The fundamental elements for the autonomous vehicles comprise: state
    of the art smart vehicle technologies (hardware and software), fully autonomous
    control, fail-safe navigation system [111], integrated health monitoring system
    to monitor passengers’ health such as heart rate and blood pressure, emergency
    response to inform concerned authorities regarding a safety or health emergency
    event, simple user interaction using Natural Language Processing (NLP) or other
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to communicate with normal as well as
    passengers with a disability. Similarly, self-charging capability is also an essential
    requirement. Hence, once in low power, the autonomous car should automatically
    park itself at a prescribed charging station and get a recharge. Green Transport:
    In a bid to contain the impact of global warming, the STPs should advocate the
    use of green transport within park premises. Green transport may include electric
    or solar vehicles. Moreover, in addition to autonomous, green cars, smart personal
    transportation such as self-driving scooters [112], can be used to commute in
    various areas of the park. Autonomous Infrastructure: Operation of autonomous
    vehicles cannot be completed without autonomous/smart infrastructure. E.g., A
    driver-less vehicle once approaches a charging station to recharge its batteries;
    the charging station should have the provision of wireless charging to prevent
    any human involvement. Similarly, there can be an autonomous car wash and autonomous
    vertical parking system [113], [114] to make efficient use of parking space and
    keep cars safe from thefts, accidents, and other sabotage activities. To make
    the vertical car park more economical and eco-friendly, it can be operated just
    on solar power with sufficient battery backup to sustain through prolonged bad
    weather days. In addition to the autonomous vertical car parks, the autonomous
    cars’ navigation system should be able to communicate with the smart parking systems
    so that the car is taken directly to the empty car space at/near the desired destination.
    Moreover, to make the recharging of driver-less cars more autonomous, the roads
    in the future STPs may be equipped with dynamic wireless charging lanes [115],
    [116]. Besides, when we talk about autonomous infrastructure, the discussion is
    not complete if smart concrete in constructing self-healing roads, pavements,
    and other architectures is not highlighted. Smart concrete is an upcoming technology
    that can extend respective infrastructure’s life by autonomously repairing the
    cracks [117]. The mechanism behind smart concrete is a super absorbent polymer
    that is mixed with the concrete during the construction stage. Over the period,
    when cracks develop in the concrete architecture and water enters these cracks,
    the polymer absorbs the water and produces concrete-like material that fills in
    the gaps. Scientists believe that cracks of even a few microns can be fixed to
    prevent significant damage. Similarly, using Phase Change Materials (PCM) like
    Butyl Stearate (BS), concrete’s thermal properties can be enhanced [118]. As a
    result, the ambient temperature in a concrete building can be maintained as per
    the comfort level of humans by preventing temperature fluctuations. Intelligent
    Traffic Management: One of the rudiments of a successful MaaS system is perceived
    to be the intelligent traffic management system. The primary element of this system
    is the traffic signal operation. According to [119], modern traffic-actuated signals
    ensure traffic flow in minimum possible phases. Where a phase consists of a set
    of nonconflicting movements. E.g., the existing traffic signal system in Australia
    uses an inductive loop detector to adjust the duration of the signal lights, i.e.,
    red or green, by detecting the number of vehicles waiting or moving through an
    intersection. However, inductive loop detectors are not considered very effective
    as compared to infrared (IR) or video radar detectors. Moreover, there is a minimum
    time for which green light is to be displayed for a particular approach/lane even
    if there is no vehicle waiting. Hence, considering STP, a testing ground for various
    autonomous technologies, it is recommended that a dynamic/intelligent traffic
    management system be employed to regulate the traffic based on real-time traffic
    conditions in each lane. These conditions may include traffic density and speed
    of heavy and light vehicles, the emergency vehicle, if any, and the type of road,
    i.e., a lateral, highway, or a local street. This idea is not unrealistic, as
    many researchers have proposed various solutions in this regard. For instance,
    [120] uses real-time data about vehicle volume and waiting time in each lane to
    determine traffic light sequence and length of green light. Similarly, researchers
    in [121] used IR sensors to manipulate traffic signals based on traffic density.
    Also, [122] proposed a monitoring system using street video cameras in parallel
    to the traffic light system to determine different street cases (e.g., empty,
    normal, crowded) in varying weather conditions. Other than intelligent traffic
    signals, we foresee testing of dynamic/adaptive speed bumps on the streets of
    STPs. As shown in Fig.5, an adaptive speed bump system may comprise a speed bump
    sign, speed radar, a control system with an actuator to control the operation
    of the speed bump, and the bump itself. The speed bump remains in de-active mode,
    i.e., parallel to the road during peak hours, once most vehicles are moving within
    the prescribed speed limit. However, when the radar unit detects an incoming car
    driving over the speed limit during off-peak hours, it alerts the control unit,
    which activates the speed bump from a safe distance from the approaching vehicle
    to slow it down. Moreover, to add more security, license plate recognition can
    also be performed to slow down specific vehicles [123]. FIGURE 5. Adaptive road
    bump. Show All 4) Smart Community iHealth: Intelligent health services at community
    level aim at improving medical emergency response, managing patients Electronic
    Health Record (EHR), analysis of community medical data, predict community transfer
    diseases, propose precautions, and make efficient use of resources. In addition,
    data collected from community (local council) medical center may be shared with
    state’s health department for analysis and provision of specialized medical services
    like an air ambulance, special medical consultancy, emergency response, and health
    alerts. Use of Personal, Social, and Service Robots: To foster an ingenious view
    of STPs, we propose the use of personal, social, and service robots. These robots
    will improve the livability in the STPs by autonomously performing various tasks
    and making the processes more cost-effective, risk-free, reliable [124], and productive.
    Although using a personal robot is quite intuitive, one may get confused in differentiating
    between a social and a service robot. A service robot is designed and developed
    to interact with humans as living human machines. Therefore, social robots should
    be realistic, and they should communicate, and cooperate with humans as naturally
    and intelligently as possible [125]. Whereas a service robot is used to automate
    specific or several tasks, where human interaction may not be necessary, e.g.,
    industrial and medical robots [126]. Some use cases of these robots are shown
    in Fig.6. As per a case study on personal robots, people desire that a personal
    robot should clean the house, prepare food, do laundry, serve people, care for
    pets, look after kids, and ensure the security of the house [127]. On the contrary,
    social robots can be used in shopping malls, parks, hospitals, restaurants, airports,
    schools, offices, and public transport to interact with humans and also for security-related
    tasks. Whereas service robots can be used to assist in agriculture, construction,
    industry, inspection and monitoring, medical, and defense-related tasks [126].
    Moreover, every day, numerous incidents globally involve Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)
    such as chemical spills, leaks, fires, and the intentional release of toxic substances.
    These incidents not only adversely affect human health but also ecosystems and
    the environment. Therefore, the most vulnerable are the emergency services personnel.
    E.g., in South Australia alone, there had been one thousand four hundred and twenty-one
    incidents involving HAZMAT, fire, transport, sabotage, etc., between 2001 and
    2018 [128]. Besides, it is a fact that human rescue workers become a scarce resource
    in disaster scenarios. Therefore, [129] proposes that a single rescue worker should
    supervise a multitude of autonomous robots equipped with appropriate sensors and
    tools in ideal circumstances. These intelligent machines can assist in inspecting
    incident sites from a safe distance, analyzing the type of HAZMAT, damage assessment,
    rubble clearance, and search for survivors. However, there are numerous challenges
    in using autonomous rescue robots as a service. [130]. Firstly, existing rescue
    robots cannot operate autonomously in a harsh environment. Where harsh environments
    are perceived as unknown, unstructured, dynamic, cluttered, hazardous, and limited
    in resources (such as the availability of communications, GPS, and visibility)
    [131], [132]. Hence, machine decision-making capabilities in rescue robot technologies
    need further research. It is also difficult to decide whether a fully autonomous
    or semi-autonomous (teleoperated by a human supervisor) system would be better
    as a general-purpose rescue robot. Another critical challenge for rescue robots
    is the mapping or construction of a path profile. iLighting (Smart Street Lights):
    To augment environmental monitoring, surveillance, security, information dissemination,
    emergency response, and public service, the use of intelligent street lights can
    never be overemphasized. An intelligent street light is an autonomous element
    of the overall smart community. As shown in Fig.7, the iLight is solar-powered
    and equipped with numerous sensors and equipment such as a WiFi transceiver module,
    temperature, humidity, CO2, smoke, and noise sensors, surveillance camera with
    image processing capability, motion sensor, emergency telephone, digital street
    sign, digital info screen, a speaker and a microphone, an electric vehicle (EV)
    charging port, and a power socket for general use (mobile charging). The highlight
    of the iLight is that the surveillance camera with the requisite image processing
    capability can detect and generate alerts for any security or emergency incident
    such as street crime, street fight, bullying, road accident, flash flooding, or
    a prescribed health emergency. Upon receiving an alert, the STP management can
    always monitor the real-time situation and generate an appropriate response. ibuildings:
    The intelligent buildings are mostly equipped with sensing and control infrastructure
    for efficient HVAC and lighting management. Some other technologies may include
    energy generation, storage, and distribution. Smart buildings maximize efficiency
    and productivity. Hence, the essential features envisaged in an ibuilding include
    safety and security, network connectivity, functional spaces, IoT enabled environment
    (HVAC, lighting), layered security (integrated access control, fixed network camera,
    network dome camera, multi-factor authentication locks, intrusion detection),
    safety (HAZMAT, fire, gas, and sabotage detection), and efficient water and energy
    management. Smart Maintenance: It implies using sensors and other surveillance
    means to autonomously monitor and initiate a complaint to the council/park management
    for maintenance issues along with evidence in the form of pictures, videos, or
    sensor data. Smart Waste Management: Waste management is an integral part of a
    green environment. However, in the existing scenario, most of the counties resort
    to manual/predefined waste collection, irrespective of the fact that what percentage
    of a waste bin is full. This may infer extra costs in terms of fuel and waste
    collection vehicles. Moreover, if there is a waste bin with rotting and fast decaying
    food items such as fish waste, meat, and fruits, then if the bin has to wait to
    be emptied as per respective council’s schedule, it may affect the environment.
    Although there are different color codes for the bins for the segregation of waste
    items at the source in Australia, e.g., a Red-lidded container is for nonrecyclable
    household rubbish and is collected weekly. The yellow-lidded bin is for recyclable
    items collected fortnightly, and the green-lidded bin is for garden cuttings and
    is also collected fortnightly. Nevertheless, it has been observed that people
    may not follow the color codes and throw unwanted items in different bins, such
    as batteries, toxic materials, medical waste, and fast decaying food items, including
    fruits and meat products. Hence, we recommend using digital technologies to; reduce
    costs and resource consumption, identify objects in the waste for faster response,
    overall improved performance, and social well-being with increased engagement.
    In this context, the smart waste management system architecture is shown in Fig.8.
    All the waste bins placed at various locations are intelligent bins equipped with
    IoT sensors that continuously monitor the volume [133], [134] and the type of
    objects in the waste. As soon as a bin is ninety percent full, or a rotting, fast
    decaying, or a toxic thing is thrown in the bin, an alert message is generated
    containing the location of the bin, time, volume, and type of the waste to the
    waste management controller (located at STP waste management office). The controller
    automatically compiles the data from all the waste collection points in the STP.
    After processing the received data, the waste management app generates the dynamic
    route and schedule for daily waste collection. Any impromptu task of waste collection
    on an urgent basis is also automatically added to the specific waste collection
    vehicle route. Keeping in view the use of autonomous vehicles in the STP, it is
    presumed that the complete waste collection process is autonomous, comprising
    smart bins, driver-less vehicles, and intelligent app. The waste management system
    is envisaged to perform necessary data processing to dynamically create waste
    collection routes and schedules and propose an appropriate recycling plan. However,
    the only foreseeable challenge in successfully implementing the smart waste management
    system is the effective classification of objects in the waste. Although many
    solutions have been proposed in this regard, [135]–[138], yet considerable research
    is required to develop a real-world product. FIGURE 6. Use cases of robots in
    a smart community. Show All FIGURE 7. Intelligent street light (iLight). Show
    All FIGURE 8. Waste management system architecture. Show All 5) Intelligent Safety
    and Security System The vision of a STP as a living science city cannot be accomplished
    unless an autonomous security and safety system is deployed to intelligently protect
    against conventional security threats and reduce the impact of natural calamities
    and man-made disasters. An autonomous and intelligent security and safety system
    has the following necessary attributes. A wide network of surveillance cameras
    with image processing capabilities for real-time incident detection, face recognition,
    alarm generation, immediate response, and follow-up monitoring based on the analysis
    of live video/surveillance cameras feed. The surveillance system based on CCTV
    cameras can be supplemented by incorporating drones and robots in the security
    and monitoring mechanism. Use of iProvost (robotic police) for surveillance, incident
    detection, and initial response. The robots equipped with armor protection, cameras,
    acoustic sensors, speakers, searchlights, sirens, and blue and red flashing lights
    can be deployed at all public places, including parks, shopping malls, sports
    grounds, science park residential and commercial areas, car parks, bus/train stations,
    public libraries, etc. The robots should be able to operate autonomously on the
    predefined routes, generate an alarm, and preserve any onsite evidence (video,
    pictures, handheld objects, etc.). The essentials of an iProvost’s job profile
    include detection of road-rage, street fights/crimes, bullying at public places,
    carjacking, illegal travel on bus and train without a ticket, shoplifting, etc.
    The robots can also identify criminals using facial recognition and help find
    family/guardians of lost kids or senior citizens. Safety of science park against
    natural/man-made disasters based on environmental monitoring and issuance of related
    warnings and precautionary/remedial measures. The sensors may include seismic
    sensors, fire/smoke detectors, and an automated flood warning system. 6) Drones
    as a Service (DaaS) In today’s dynamic and eventful world, the requirement of
    speedy response to various social service requests has been made easy by drone
    technologies. Nonetheless, most of the current drone applications are centered
    around a service-based business model. However, as per the existing regulatory
    frameworks e.g., drone policy outlined by Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA)
    Australia [139], limited commercial use of drones or Remotely Piloted Aircraft
    (RPA) is allowed under strict standing operating conditions for micro and small
    excluded category RPA. Small excluded category RPA involving drones weighing no
    more than 25 Kilograms is only applicable to private landowners. Some of the other
    conditions that restrict an all-out commercial use of drone technology include
    no flying within 5.5 Km of an airport with a control tower. The drone should not
    go beyond 120 m from the operator. No drones should be flown in an area with emergency
    operations underway. Hence, the above discussion concludes that the future STPs
    should seek some leverage from the respective government in the commercial use
    of drones within the park premises. Thereby, the STPs may use drones to inspect
    industrial equipment or construction sites, surveillance and security services,
    cargo delivery, land surveying, and farming operations. It is also proposed that
    a STP should workout a customized drone use policy as a test case for the provision
    of various autonomous drone-based services and try new business models in a realistic
    urban environment under centralized control. To deliberate further on the concept
    of DaaS, some of the proposed applications, as shown in Fig.9 are illustrated
    in succeeding paragraphs: Inspection and Surveying Services: Inspection/observation
    service may include rooftop condition assessment, land surveying, construction
    site monitoring, gas/water pipe leakage detection and assessment, and other HAZMAT
    leakage detection or monitoring. Emergency Response: It can include different
    scenarios, e.g., in the case of a traffic accident, drone-based service may be
    used for first responder damage assessment, evidence gathering for insurance purposes,
    and road/traffic assessment to regulate traffic on alternate routes. Concerning
    health emergency response, park residents may sign up with the STP health emergency
    response service indicating desired medicines or medical equipment. Therefore,
    once the affected person or his nominated close contact triggers an alarm for
    immediate requirement of a specific medication or medical equipment such as EpiPen,
    inhaler, defibrillator, insulin, Ventolin, anti spider/snake venom, etc., a drone
    is dispatched to make the delivery. Disaster Response and Relief Management: Disaster
    response and management is a critical task that requires speedy situational awareness
    for a targeted and effective response. E.g., in case of natural/man-made disasters,
    including bushfire, earthquake, flood, or severe storms, autonomous drones can
    be used to assess the extent of damage caused by the calamity, monitor rescue
    and relief efforts, and also provide food and necessary supplies to the affectees.
    There are drone technologies that can assist in fire fighting efforts in areas
    inaccessible to humans. Correspondingly, drones can provide early warning of flash
    floods by visual surveillance of waterways and reservoirs. Delivery Services:
    It is perceived that most stakeholders tend to engage in time constraint activities
    in the science park environment. They may require some essential equipment, IT
    parts, tools, small packages, or food and grocery items on an urgent basis. Hence,
    the drone delivery service’s on-demand nature will allow shipments to be sent
    as soon as they are ready rather than waiting for the following day’s shipping
    run. The drones can thus ensure swift fulfillment of time-critical scheduled as
    well as spontaneous deliveries. In this regard, users may be charged an extra
    amount depending upon the urgency/priority of delivery. Telepresence: Another
    compelling use case of DaaS business model is telepresence. This service can assist
    STP residents in supervising various tasks remotely. E.g., Walking kids home from
    school if their nanny is not available that day. The kids’ parents can view the
    real-time video footage of the drone to see their kids going home. Similarly,
    if a person is busy at work and wants to check on his kid at a soccer game remotely,
    the DaaS app will provide him the opportunity to request such a service by entering
    the date, time, and location of the event. Correspondingly, a drone can also be
    hired to search and locate a lost pet. Research Support: Research scientists,
    startups, and other parties can book a drone flight to test a new sensing technology
    or a flight control mechanism. Similarly, university students can also hire standard
    drones to test various intelligent applications. Challenges: Like other autonomous
    systems, DaaS business model also has associated challenges. E.g., A bad weather
    environment, including thunderstorms or strong winds, may disrupt drone flights,
    especially for the small RPAs. Similarly, in a large drone fleet, it would be
    an arduous task to monitor and manage drone flight paths, scheduled and spontaneous
    task assignments, and prioritizing the jobs based on user-specific response time.
    Besides, the urban environment and integral obstacles may adversely affect drone
    flight paths. Likewise, transitioning from fully outdoor to semi-indoor operation
    may affect the performance of on-board GPS. Hence, an improved drone localization
    algorithm needs to be developed to provide cm-level accuracy in the absence of
    GPS service. Correspondingly, there is a need to create a flight management system
    with the capability of flight schedule, flight path mapping and analysis, data
    analytics for proactive/predictive maintenance, and drone abstraction that involves
    working with multiple drone providers. FIGURE 9. Drones as a service (DaaS) use
    cases. Show All 7) Smart Governance and Management Autonomous Resource Management
    System (ARMS): It refers to monitoring and managing all types of resources in
    the STPs. E.g., as shown in Fig.10, to facilitate research, innovation, and collaboration
    between various stakeholders, we introduce ARMS. The suggested system will monitor
    the status of all the projects undertaken by startups, tech-based firms, and entrepreneurs.
    It keeps a record of organizations’ resource requirements, including equipment
    and a skilled workforce. Similarly, it will connect with the industry partners
    to track their R&D needs, funding options, and expertise/specialized equipment
    on the inventory. In the same way, the ARMS will monitor and maintain data on
    HEIs’ research interests, skilled human resources, the requirement of funds, grants
    in progress, specialized equipment, and laboratories. HEIs’ incubation capabilities
    will also be monitored along with data on academic literature, government policies,
    and regulations. Correspondingly, the system will maintain and manage the availability
    of equipment and skilled workforce at specialized laboratories. Hence, when an
    organization requires some equipment or a skilled workforce, ARMS can provide
    the desired information and do the requisite coordination. Moreover, if an organization
    requires HEIs’ support for a research project, then ARMS can facilitate the submission
    of Expression of Interests (EoIs). Besides, ARMS will also provide updates on
    patents and innovative technologies to all stakeholders in the STP. Smart IP and
    Copyrights Management: IP and copyrights management is a critical affair in academics
    and the tech world. Hence, it is proposed that ARMS being connected to all the
    stakeholders can easily monitor and detect any IP and copyrights violation not
    only within the STP but also with any other organization globally (based on resources
    available on the internet). Autonomous Fleet and Construction Site Management:
    Most of the time, construction sites present a scene of the hustle and bustle
    with heavy machinery moving in and out of the site. Due to the involvement of
    heavy trucks, giant construction machines, and massive construction materials,
    the safety and management of men and material is an arduous task. However, today
    autonomous hardware and software-based applications have made the job easy. For
    instance, researchers in [140] introduced the concept of Smart Construction Objects
    SCO) to enable a safer, greener, efficient, and cost-effective construction system.
    SCOs are the construction resources or materials that can be made autonomous and
    smart by harnessing them with requisite capabilities such as sensing, actuating,
    networking, computing, and data processing. Subsequently, the ability of SCOs
    to interact/talk to each other results in increased awareness and more autonomous
    decision-making without human intervention. E.g., a smart tower crane can communicate
    with a smart steel column to find its weight and potential safety hazards before
    lifting it. Hence, SCOs provide decision-making information to human decision-makers
    and make rule-based decisions autonomously themselves. Therefore, construction
    companies can now remotely manage the fleet of heavy vehicles, do load balancing,
    estimate future stock requirements, and carry out trip planning [141]. In this
    regard, we propose an Autonomous Construction Fleet and Site Management (AFCSM)
    service. As shown in Fig.11, AFCSM comprises various applications. For instance,
    eTrack provides GPS-based real-time asset location information via 4G/LTE. Similarly,
    the Road Traffic Management (RTM) app collects road usage data from vehicles through
    onboard sensing devices. RTM thus facilitates the movement of large vehicles by
    monitoring vehicle loads and road conditions. It can also ensure compliance with
    environmental and safety standards by generating an alarm in case of any violation.
    Correspondingly, vehicle telemetrics plays a vital role in managing a large fleet
    of vehicles [142]. Hence, the Vehicle Telemetrics Application (VTA) continuously
    performs vehicles’ diagnostics and generates early warnings. It can also initiate
    collision and breakdown notifications. Subsequently, an emergency call is automatically
    made for a rapid response in case of an accident. VTA may also report/share the
    location of the vehicle in case of a theft. Also, to assist the organizations
    in fleet management, VTA can perform vehicle diagnostics to optimize maintenance
    and fuel consumption and ensure driver and vehicle safety. AFCSM offers another
    compelling feature of freight priority in which the customer organizations can
    prioritize delivery of the freight/construction material as per their schedule
    or to meet an urgent requirement. The customers registered with AFCSM can access
    a range of information about their fleet and construction sites. The users can
    see live asset location, asset trip record (including history, routes, and load),
    vehicle safety, and breakdown event notifications. The AFCSM dashboard may also
    show information about an organization’s assets being used on-site, the available
    space, and the upcoming scheduled deliveries. Thus facilitating the customers
    in the efficient management of their stocks. We believe that AFCSM will improve
    fleet management, reduce maintenance costs, safety risks, and liabilities. AFCSM
    can also make use of geofencing to monitor fleet activity and identify abnormal
    driver behavior. In addition, by real-time asset tracking, AFCSM will facilitate
    road safety and infrastructure management, e.g., once a heavy vehicle, such as
    a prime mover, is entering a narrow road, other personal and commercial vehicles
    are shifted to alternate routes. Autonomous System for Workers’ Safety: It is
    not surprising that construction sites and other industries involving heavy machinery
    and vehicles are full of potential hazards. Especially during summer, due to long
    working hours and temperatures exceeding forty degrees Celsius, the construction
    workers may lose focus on their surroundings. Hence, distracted workers working
    at dangerous heights or moving around heavy machinery and equipment along with
    unaware drivers are prone to life-threatening risks. As a result, the risk of
    injury in a construction site due to collision with site vehicles, falling from
    heights, and run-over by plant machinery is significant. As per Safe Work Australia
    [143], there have been 158 deaths at work in 2020. And the top industries in these
    work-related deaths include transport/warehouse, agriculture, and construction.
    Hence, we propose an intelligent safety service named “Safe@Work”. Based on the
    solution proposed in [144], [145], Safe@Work system may consist of three main
    components. First is the sensing unit that is installed to the rear of the vehicles
    or heavy machinery. It comprises three 868 MHz Radio Frequency (RF) transceivers,
    three directional antennas, three 40 kHz ultrasonic sensors, a processor, and
    a monitoring app. The second component is the alert device (a wearable device)
    that consists of a radio transceiver, an RF wake-up sensor, and an alarm/vibrator
    actuator. Whereas the third component includes a cloud server and safety monitoring,
    and data analytics dashboard. As shown in Fig.12, to prevent vehicle backover
    accidents, the sensing unit installed at the back of the vehicles or heavy machinery
    starts functioning as soon as the vehicle is put into reverse gear. Hence, when
    a worker wearing the alert device enters the sensing unit’s coverage area, the
    alert device is powered up by the RF wake-up sensor. Otherwise, the alert device
    remains in power save (idle) mode. Soon after the alert device is activated, it
    sends an acknowledgment (ack) message to the sensing unit along with its unique
    identity (ID). All the three RF transceivers in the sensing unit receive the ack
    message with varying Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values. The processor
    analyzes the RSSI values and accordingly instructs the respective ultrasonic sensor
    to measure the worker’s distance in the direction of the highest RSSI value. If
    the measured distance is within the prescribed dangerous zone, e.g., four meters,
    then as a warning, an alarm/vibrator activation signal is sent to the worker’s
    alert device. Moreover, the worker’s location with respect to the vehicle (based
    on distance and angle) is also shown on the driver’s monitoring app. Similarly,
    sensing units can be installed at various hazardous locations within a STP to
    alert the workers and prevent any untoward incident. These locations may include
    big dug-outs, deep pits, unprotected rooftops, freshly laid concrete or charcoal
    area, HAZMAT, or a busy work zone involving heavy machinery. FIGURE 10. Autonomous
    resource management system (ARMS). Show All FIGURE 11. Autonomous fleet and construction
    site management. Show All FIGURE 12. Safe@Work system. Show All 8) STP Data Arena
    Based on the concept of “Data Lakes,” we propose STP Data Arena, a data as a service
    business model that aims to overcome organizational boundaries and system complexities
    involved in data sharing. Illustrating a data lake, James Dixon in [146] referred
    to it as a large body of water in a natural state which requires further cleansing
    and processing to be useful. On the contrary, this paper proffers STP Data Arena
    to be a more refined and user-ready application. As shown in Fig.13, raw data
    from each autonomous system database (DB) is extracted and moved to STP Data Arena.
    The raw data may include any type or size of data, e.g., sensors data, user interaction
    logs, images or video libraries, structured or semi-structured data (JSON, Avro,
    Parquet, etc.), and snapshots of autonomous systems’ DB. The data ingestion can
    be done through Apache Sqoop that bulk loads (pull) relational data to Hadoop
    Distributed File System (HDFS) [147]. HDFS is a distributed file system designed
    to store big data and stream those data sets at high bandwidth to user applications
    [148], [149]. Similarly, to ingest batched or streaming data into the STP Data
    Arena, scalable message ques (Kafka [150]) and data stream engines such as Samza
    [151], or Spark streaming [152] can be used. However, as data is stored in Data
    Arena in the original format, the inconsistent and incomplete data pose a problem
    of data integration for the data scientists [153]. Therefore, data scientists
    must carefully prepare the data, including data profiling and integration, before
    the analytical results are extracted. FIGURE 13. STP Data Arena business model.
    Show All However, HDFS is believed to have numerous system administration challenges
    related to data replication, adding nodes, creating directories and partitions,
    performance, workload management, data (re-)distribution, etc. [154]. Furthermore,
    HDFS has minimal core security tools, thus often requiring add-ons. Moreover,
    disaster recovery is another significant problem. Nonetheless Snowflake [155]
    resolves above-mentioned problems. Snowflake data cloud eliminates storage management
    concerns by ousting the need to set up and manage nodes, define file systems or
    directories, and implement and revise data distribution policies. Besides, Snowflake
    provides data replication, backup, and disaster recovery as an integral part of
    managed services. In addition, Snowflake employs end-to-end encryption to ensure
    user data security at rest and in transit [156]. The ultimate objective here is
    to drive value from the raw data by exploring and transforming original data and
    training statistical models to be used in various services/applications. E.g.,
    based on data uploaded by the DaaS system, the data scientists can extract the
    peak time for various drone-based services such as the type of deliveries, i.e.,
    food or packages, the kind of drone used, i.e., delivery or inspection. Hence,
    a careful analysis can reveal users’ preferences for drone services at a particular
    time of day, peak hours for each type of drone service, users’ food choices, most
    popular restaurants, etc. The processed data/results will help the DaaS management
    optimize drone scheduling and flight paths as per peak hours of various drone
    services. Similarly, the restaurants can prepare the popular food items in appropriate
    quantity at peak hours to reduce delivery time for their customers. Similarly,
    analysis of data ingested by the smart living system may infer the STP tenants’
    usage pattern of various appliances/utilities in a smart home. Hence, the manufacturers
    can use the processed data to improve predictive maintenance or optimize various
    utilities’ load/availability. In the same way, data available from real-time autonomous
    systems can help stakeholders in statistical analysis, customized marketing campaigns,
    or improved services. Moreover, by collecting data in STP Data Arena, different
    sources’ data can be correlated without crossing system or organizational boundaries.
    E.g., the data generated by various research centers can be correlated with the
    industry’s technological challenges. This will help the analysts or STP management
    in understanding whether the current research at the science park is aligned with
    real-world challenges or not. In addition, STP Data Arena infrastructure should
    be accessible to nontechnical users, i.e., self-service analytics or enterprise
    applications. Furthermore, to prevent the storage of garbage data in the data
    arena, there is a need for a data governance process to control what goes into
    the data arena and how it is shared. Correspondingly, a well-placed governance
    model will ensure data quality, security, privacy, and accountability. 9) Additional
    Services In addition to ASaaS, this research also proposes a couple of unconventional
    services and 3D modeling and printing as a supporting service to facilitate STP
    tenants. a: Tech Think Tank as a Service (3TaaS) Augmenting the support provided
    to the new firms and businesses in the form of incubators and business support
    by the STP management, we propose 3TaaS, a think tank as a service. The 3TaaS
    is supposed to be a technology research policy institute comprising representatives
    from academia, industry, research centers, and enterprises. The think tank will
    analyze the industry’s overall technology needs, future technologies, and current
    orientation of research in the STP to advocate new research ideas. Such an arrangement
    is expected to promote innovation and make the respective STP a leader in developing
    new technologies while solving real-world industry/tech problems. b: 3D Urban
    Archaeology According to Archaeological Institute of America [157], archaeology
    is the scientific excavation and study of ancient human material remains. Similarly,
    urban archaeology is defined as the application of archaeological methods to the
    study of cities and the process of urbanization [158], [159]. Based on the concept
    of urban archaeology, we propose a 3D STP Archaeology Service, i.e., time-lagged
    history of the STP evolution/development. The main features of this service are:
    It allows for evaluation of past design decisions that may affect future investments
    in a STP. It provides a rich source of data to improve future designs by identifying

    Scanning and Printing Laboratory Today, there is a multitude of diverse 3D printing
    technologies that can manufacture objects using a vast array of materials. These
    materials range from thermoplastics and polymers to metal, and micro-fluids, which
    are capable of fulfilling most engineering and design needs [160]. Hence, a 3D
    modeling, scanning, and printing laboratory is recommended in STPs to facilitate
    researchers and startups in the swift design and manufacturing of essential components
    or product parts. D. Integration of Autonomous Systems Advances in Sensors and
    Actuators Network Environment (SANE) have provided an opportunity to integrate
    multiple autonomous systems. As shown in Fig.14, different autonomous systems
    may have a wholly distinct or shared infrastructure. E.g., At some locations in
    a STP, especially the areas with road network, the smart environment system may
    rely on the sensors installed on iLights. Similarly, the iSecurity and Safety
    system or DaaS may depend on the information received from personal, social, and
    service robots for search and rescue or an emergency response operation. The data
    generated by autonomous systems’ sensors and other devices such as surveillance
    cameras, robots, intelligent traffic management, iBuildings, or iLights is received
    or routed by multi-protocol gateway devices installed in SANE nodes available
    throughout the STPs at strategic locations. The end-devices and sensing equipment
    mostly communicate with the gateway devices using LoRaWAN, WiFi, or NBIoT technologies.
    Whereas the back-haul communication to link IoT layer with data orchestration
    layer primarily supports 5G, optical fiber, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE), or satellite
    technologies. Besides, the data orchestration layer comprises the autonomous systems’
    DBs, STP Data Arena, data processing, and analytics infrastructure, and requisite
    data services. Moreover, the data orchestration layer further feeds the data to
    the application layer that comprises an STP ASaaS dashboard. The dashboard provides
    an interface to the autonomous systems applications and offers essential statistics
    and selected real-time data streams. FIGURE 14. Autonomous systems as a service
    (ASaaS) - network architecture. Show All In addition, there are certain aspects
    that may drive the methodology of integrating different systems: Autonomous systems’
    relationships, networks and security, may dictate how data is exchanged between
    different systems [161]–[164]. STP autonomous systems’ dashboard be designed to
    better support the end-users by providing understandable, flexible and trustworthy
    services [165]. Efficient coordination is essential between multiple systems with
    different objectives. And the same can be provided via a centralized or distributed
    approach [166]. Ethics, regulations, and standards should be complied with for
    ethical, reliable, and safe performance of autonomous systems [167]–[169]. 1)
    Kevin - a STP Tenant’s Case Study To better understand the potential of ASaaS,
    let us visualize a day in the life of Kevin, an entrepreneur, and an STP tenant.
    Today, he has an important presentation to a VC at 4 pm. But before that, he has
    to collect and assemble a prototype of his new IoT device by 9 am. So that he
    can include some actual results about device’s operation in his presentation.
    Kevin lives in an autonomous smart home that intelligently and independently controls
    all the functions in the house. E.g., at night, all the lights and the HVAC vents
    are switched off in the unoccupied rooms. The smart home controller “iAssist”
    regulates all the operations as per Kevin’s habits and personal preferences. Correspondingly,
    over the period, the iAssist learns that Kevin likes to run the ceiling fan at
    medium speed in his room if the ambient temperature is less than or equal to twenty
    degrees Celsius. Hence, the iAssist keeps the air conditioner switched off. Moreover,
    iAssist ensures that Kevin wakes up at the right time to reach his workplace in
    time. In this regard, iAssist accesses data from the STP Data Arena to estimate
    the expected travel time based on current weather and traffic conditions. Unfortunately,
    due to yesterday evening’s storm, there are a few road blockades. Hence, based
    on real-time traffic data extracted from the STP Data Arena, iAssist predicts
    that it will take fifteen minutes more than the usual travel time. Thus, it sets
    Kevin’s alarm clock to trigger at 7:15 am instead of 7:30 am every day. Accordingly,
    the iAssist switches on the HVAC in the ensuite at 7:10 am to regulate the temperature
    to twenty degrees Celsius, and the light in the room is switched on as the alarm
    is set off. To conserve energy, all the lights are also controlled through motion
    sensors. Hence, the light in the ensuite switches on as Kevin walks in. Usually,
    Kevin takes thirty minutes to get ready and reach the kitchen for breakfast. Therefore,
    keeping an eye on the shower, iAssist switches on the coffee machine at 7:41 am
    so that when Kevin comes to the kitchen at 7:46 am, the coffee is ready at Kevin’s
    desired temperature. As soon as Kevin gets his bread out of the toaster, iAssist
    orders an autonomous cab for 8 am so that Kevin reaches his office by 8:15 am
    with sufficient time to collect and assemble his IoT device. iAssist also alerts
    Kevin to take his routine medicines and vitamins after breakfast. However, just
    two minutes before the arrival of the autonomous cab, Kevin realizes that he had
    to buy a new lounger for his living room today as it was the last day of the sale.
    But his 4 pm meeting leaves him no time to visit the furniture outlet. Hence,
    he immediately opens up the iShopping app on the STP ASaaS dashboard, visually
    performs a final inspection of the lounger for his living room, and places an
    order for delivery at 6:30 pm. Once Kevin leaves for work, his wife Sophia prepares
    for her “Chef@Home” a home-cooked food delivery business. Because of the on-park
    autonomous vertical farms, it is pretty easy for Sofia to organize her daily cooking
    and preparation of orders. She receives fresh produce and groceries every morning
    through an autonomous cab. In contrast, all the packaging and consumables are
    delivered from suppliers in the city by delivery drones. Sofia mostly provides
    food at lunchtime to STP offices, and in the evening, the great bulk of her food
    is delivered to people’s homes using DaaS. She does not even need to know the
    customers’ personal details. All that is required is customers’ location code
    from their phone when they place the order, and the system takes care of the rest.
    However, in the midst of her work, Sofia realized that today her eight-year-old
    daughter Bella’s school would close early, but she cannot leave her work due to
    an urgent order. Although the school is in the near vicinity, and she believes
    that Bella can quickly get home. However, still as a worried mother, she requests
    a telepresence drone using her STP app by entering the school location and her
    daughter’s STP digital ID. Now, she can easily monitor her daughter walking to
    the home via live streaming through the DaaS system. On the other hand, en-route
    to his office, Kevin realized that the autonomous cab had taken a diversion from
    the usual route. Upon checking the real-time 3D map of STP, Kevin finds out a
    small accident on the other road a few minutes before. As a result, the nearby
    iLighting system detected and escalated the incident so that all the traffic is
    autonomously diverted to the alternate routes shown on the map. As soon as Kevin
    glances away from his smartphone, suddenly, a cyclist brushes past the side of
    the car. Although it is just a minor scratch, however still to record the incident
    and fulfill insurance formalities within three minutes of the incident; an inspection
    drone arrives and takes the mishap’s visual evidence. Moreover, the cyclist also
    got a minor scuff mark on his leg and was immediately provided medical aid through
    an emergency response drone. Despite a couple of untoward events, Kevin reaches
    his office well in time to work on the IoT device. But there is one discrepancy,
    a part supposed to come with the device is missing. Kevin immediately logs into
    the DaaS’s parcel tracking and location system, which tracks the parcels through
    RFID tags. He finds that the package was incorrectly addressed and delivered to
    another company on the other side of the park in error. It is 10 am, and the DaaS
    system has already identified the mistake and arranged for the parcel to be collected
    and delivered to the correct address. Finally, Kevin gets the part, and he starts
    working on his presentation to finish it by 3 pm. By then, Kevin realizes that
    it is difficult for him to go for a late lunch to his favorite restaurant, with
    the meeting starting in an hour. So he places an order for office delivery. Kevin
    has a severe peanut allergy. Even small quantities of peanuts can lead to anaphylactic
    shock, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, he always carries an EpiPen as
    a precaution. However, due to the scheduled meeting in mind, he forgot to bring
    the EpiPen today. To his bad luck, the restaurant uses breadcrumbs from a new
    supplier and is less careful about peanut contamination. Therefore, after a few
    bites of his favourite chicken schnitzel, he starts feeling the allergic reaction.
    He searches his bag for his EpiPen and is alarmed to find it is not there. Fortunately,
    he has subscribed to the STP’s EpiPen Service and quickly uses the app on his
    phone to trigger an alarm. The system immediately dispatches a drone with an EpiPen
    to Kevin’s location. The EpiPen arrives in three minutes, and Kevin gets a lifesaving
    dose of Epinephrine. It took ten minutes for Kevin to recover from the allergy
    attack, but he finally got better. Later, at 4 pm, he made a successful presentation
    to the VC. However, during the presentation, the VC team was a bit skeptical about
    the idea’s IP rights. However, Kevin directed the team to verify the new concept’s
    IP and copyrights from the ARMS app available on the STP ASaaS dashboard. Once
    validated, VC bought the pitch and showed interest in funding the project. After
    the rewarding meeting, Kevin left his office at 5:15 pm in an autonomous cab to
    his home. On the way home, Kevin was thinking of spending a good evening with
    his family. Suddenly, it came like a shock to him that today is his anniversary.
    Just like most of the good husbands, he had forgotten the critical day. Now it
    was too late to go to the mall and buy a gift. Thanks to the STP autonomous technologies,
    Kevin opened the iShopping app and, using his wife’s full body picture, selected
    a beautiful dress for her and placed the order for the dress to be delivered to
    his home at 6 pm. Once Kevin reached home, luckily, his wife had taken their daughter
    to the swimming class. So Kevin received the dress and the delivery of the lounger
    at 6 pm and 6:30 pm, respectively. Moreover, as a surprise for his wife, he made
    a dinner booking using the STP ASaaS app, and while selecting the food items,
    he was proposed dishes based on his allergies. Once they left for dinner, the
    smart home activated its security apparatus, switched off all unwanted lights
    and HVAC vents, and the personal robot started taking care of their pet dog. Using
    the STP ASaaS app, Kevin could always watch the personal robot’s video stream
    to check on their pet and monitor their house. Thanks to the autonomous systems,
    Kevin survived another day. SECTION IV. Data Security and Privacy in Autonomous
    Systems A. Threats to Autonomous Systems AI-based autonomous systems process every
    type of user/environmental data for intelligent decision-making. Hence, they are
    a potential threat to user data security and privacy [170]. Similarly, the pervasive
    use of Online Social Networks (OSN) and smart devices has led to the collection
    and processing of users’ data by different OSN platforms, smart city control center,
    or various other smart city components such as Intelligent Transportation Systems
    (ITS), e-governance, health, and emergency response, smart homes, etc. In return,
    these entities provide various services to the users and third parties based on
    personal choices, interests, and current location. However, the point of concern
    here is that most OSNs and smart city systems have centralized control over users’
    data. Hence, they risk a single point of failure in case of a cyber-attack, or
    other technical malfunctions [171]. Moreover, this arrangement also has trust
    issues, as the users have to trust the entity that is handling their data. Hence,
    data owners have no control over their data assets [172] as they do not know where
    their data is stored, what is happening to it, who has access to it and is there
    any unauthorized disclosure to the third parties [173]. Before we further explore
    data security and privacy, it is essential to illustrate security and privacy
    terminologies. In this regard, data security is referred to as confidentiality
    of data, i.e., data protection from unauthorized disclosure. Whereas data privacy
    does not have a universal definition, it may differ from person to person according
    to individual preferences [172]. According to [174], when the confidentiality
    property of a system is breached, i.e., unauthorized users get access to confidential
    data, then the privacy breach also occurs if the disclosed data contains someone’s
    personal information. Similarly, [175] describes privacy as “the claim of individuals,
    groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent
    information about them is communicated to others.” Another definition [176] interprets
    privacy as “an individual’s ability to exercise control over the collection, use,
    and dissemination of his/her Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” Where
    PII is any piece of information that distinguishes or helps to trace a person’s
    identity, such as his name, social security number, insurance policy number, biometric
    records, etc. Hence, privacy issues arise with the collection, processing, and
    disclosure of PII. Moreover, researchers in [177] claim that privacy is difficult
    to achieve in today’s environment of intensive surveillance and monitoring technologies,
    including CCTV, RFID, IoT, data mining and profiling, ubiquitous computing, and
    ambient intelligence. Further, delineating threats to IoT-based Agri tech, [178]
    classify the threat models into five main categories, including attacks against
    privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity properties.
    Correspondingly, as shown in Fig.15, autonomous systems collect varying information
    about people. E.g., health information, smart home data, food choices, travel
    habits, research interests, personal skills, financial data, etc. According to
    [179], personal information is collected by two methods, i.e., surveillance and
    interrogation. Surveillance refers to the automatic collection of data by autonomous
    systems, e.g., autonomous cars collecting information about routes taken, time-stamped
    locations, distance, and destinations. Also, smart surveillance systems watch
    every move of people. Whereas in interrogation, systems actively ask the users
    for specific data. E.g., the iHealth system asking a user for existing health
    conditions and medications for data analytics or timely emergency response. Now
    the collection of information through surveillance and interrogation can be controlled
    to some extent by system designers by conforming to the privacy statement or privacy
    policies. However, there may be challenges for fully autonomous systems. These
    systems may start collecting new information that was not supposed to be collected,
    E.g., autonomous cars start recording people’s private conversations during a
    ride. FIGURE 15. Autonomous systems’ security evaluation. Show All Similarly,
    another activity during which user data may be subjected to security and privacy
    breaches is information processing. It involves the use or transformation of collected
    data. Data can be used or processed in many ways. Such as data aggregation, which
    refers to studying different pieces of data about an individual to predict his
    future behavior accurately. E.g., aggregating users’ travel data consisting of
    travel time, destinations, distance travel, and waypoints to predict his future
    destination or travel distance. Similarly, an iHealth system may predict an individual’s
    estimated life span based on his health history, medications, and lifestyle (eating
    and exercise habits). Such a piece of information may affect users’ insurance
    policies/claims. Hence, a scenario where an autonomous system has more information
    about a person than the person knows himself is termed as “Inverse Privacy” [180].
    In addition to data aggregation, identification [179] is another data processing
    action in which a person is uniquely identified based on his real-world ID. E.g.,
    if autonomous cars and smart surveillance systems start identifying and proactively
    recording data about all the people moving around. In such a case, people will
    not have any privacy of their movement, location, and usual activities. Sequel
    to data collection and processing, data storage, and management is another critical
    function that may affect data security and privacy. As shown in Fig.15 all the
    data collected and processed by autonomous systems in STP is stored in the respective
    autonomous system DB and also in STP Data Arena. The most significant requirement
    at this stage is that personal data should be protected against security breaches
    while it is kept in a traditional DB or a data lake. Hence, there is a need for
    secure autonomous systems. However, due to the complex nature of autonomous systems,
    and high-connectivity, they are vulnerable to hacking, and other cyber threats
    [181]. In addition, often due to service level agreements (SLA), the developers
    of autonomous systems have remote access to the deployed systems for troubleshooting
    or other maintenance tasks. Hence, it is highly probable that they have full access
    to respective autonomous system components, including user data, which may be
    a severe security and privacy threat. Therefore, service-level access should be
    carefully assessed and authorized. Similarly, data sharing between different autonomous
    systems should also be carefully planned and executed. Security and privacy of
    data must be ensured by design, and authorizations should be granted based on
    the principle of “Least Privilege” [182] i.e., people, systems, and processes
    should have access to only those resources (networks, systems, and files) that
    are absolutely necessary to perform their assigned function. E.g., DaaS may have
    access to the MaaS system to coordinate hand over and delivery of packages in
    case of inclement weather. Or DaaS may access data of aFaaS to spot and monitor
    livestock. Similarly, DaaS can access iSecurity and Safety system for various
    search, rescue and relief efforts. Hence, DaaS may have many different levels
    of privilege with other autonomous systems on mutual trust. However, every system/organization
    must ensure that each trust relationship is granted minimal privileges to perform
    a particular task. B. Data Security and Privacy Measures Security of any system
    is derived by some policy and regulatory controls. Subsequently, in the case of
    an IT system, the technical controls are designed and developed to comply with
    respective organization’s or country’s policies/regulations. According to Australian
    Privacy Principles (APP) [183], every individual has the right to decide how his
    personal (that identifies his identity) and sensitive information (personal opinion,
    choices, biometrics, etc.) is handled. Hence, any organization covered under the
    Australian Privacy Act 1988 (including all the amendments) [58], is bound to manage
    users’ personal information in a transparent way with a clearly expressed privacy
    policy. Correspondingly, every user has the right to know that: what kind of personal
    details the respective entity collects and holds, how the entity collects and
    stores that information, and the purposes for which the entity collects, maintains,
    uses, and discloses personal information. Moreover, the act also directs that
    users’ sensitive information must have a higher level of privacy protection than
    other data. Therefore, concerned parties must take reasonable steps to ensure
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data. Also, in some cases,
    personal information/data should be destroyed or de-identified. In the same way,
    [170] emphasizes that protecting user privacy is the first line of defense against
    various cyber-attacks that exploit users’ private data obtained through security
    breaches. These threats include online discrimination, phishing, identity theft,
    cyber scams, cyberstalking, cyberbullying, etc. Therefore, to preserve the privacy
    of user data, in addition to a transparent privacy policy statement, the respective
    organization/system should also hold confidentiality and integrity properties.
    In other words, any organization/system handling users’ personal data must employ
    both regulatory and technical controls to ensure data privacy. Subsequently, we
    propose a data strategy and some technical controls to ensure the security and
    privacy of STP users and tenants. 1) Data Strategy STPs must advocate compliance
    to regulatory frameworks so that system designers and developers are bound to
    design and develop privacy-preserving autonomous systems. E.g., given the Australian
    Privacy Act 1988, and European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)
    [184], the autonomous systems should: Collect and process personal data only with
    the consent of the data owner. Preserve user privacy by design. Gather, process,
    and use personal data/information under the instructions based on a mutual contract
    between the user and respective organization/entity. Give data owner the right
    to access the information concerning the processing of his data, i.e., which third
    parties have access to what information and how they use it. Erase users’ personal
    data immediately once it is no longer needed. Be transparent such that individuals
    know about the collection and use of their data. Make unbiased and fully autonomous
    decisions without any special considerations from the vendors or system manufacturers
    (additional regulation required). 2) Technical Controls Concerning technical controls,
    usually access to data is controlled through data encryption, authentication,
    and authorization measures [174]. Similarly, there are defined strategies to achieve
    privacy-by-design in autonomous systems [185]. Hence, the technical controls for
    security and privacy proposed in this study revolve around the following guidelines:
    Selected/particular data to be collected by the devices/autonomous systems and
    anonymization and pseudonymization techniques to hide the users’ real identity.
    Data is to be secured at rest and in transit, in combination with network traffic
    hiding techniques such as TOR [186]. Personal data must be stored and processed
    in a distributed manner, i.e., data from multiple sources about the same person
    should be stored and processed separately. So that if one DB or system is compromised,
    a complete profile of the affected users cannot be made. Use of privacy-preserving
    data aggregation techniques such as k-anonymity [187], differential-privacy [188].
    In this context, Lu et al. [189] proposed a lightweight privacy-preserving data
    aggregation solution for IoT applications, which can be applied in Agri tech.
    The proposed solution combines three cryptographic techniques: homomorphic Paillier
    encryption, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and a one-way hash chain. These three
    techniques are used to encrypt sensor data, calculate the mean and variance of
    aggregated IoT data, and provide lightweight authentication among IoT devices.
    While using any system, the users should be informed in a transparent way about
    the information being collected and processed, how it is collected, and its purpose.
    Data owners should also be informed about the ways their data is protected. In
    addition, the users must know that with which third parties their information
    is shared. Similarly, users must be clear about their data access rights and how
    to exercise them. Users should control their data so that they can update their
    privacy settings, regulate access to their data assets, and delete data that is
    not required for any of the services the user is availing. Privacy policies based
    on legal requirements should be enforced using various access control measures.
    There should be an accountability of compliance to privacy policies using logging,
    auditing, or other techniques. Correspondingly, Fig.15 portrays the complete picture
    of autonomous systems threats and requisite security measures. For better understanding,
    follow the diagram from left to right and bottom to top. The security threats
    are shown in the red box at each layer, and related security measures are shown
    in green boxes on the opposite (right) side. It can be seen that autonomous systems
    collect different types of user data varying from dietary habits to PII, such
    as medicare ID, citizenship number, driving license number, passport number, biometrics,
    etc. However, the autonomous systems should be so designed that they should consider
    privacy norms [190] while collecting information about users to optimize respective
    service levels. Moreover, most of the systems in the real-world present complex
    privacy statements at the time of signup. Therefore, it is recommended that there
    should be a smart personal assistant [191] that should negotiate the policy statements
    and related consents on behalf of the user. Similarly, to enforce compliance to
    a mutual agreement between an autonomous system and a user, a blockchain-based
    smart contract can be used. As blockchain works on the network consensus principle,
    no individual system can modify the contract terms. Moreover, data can only be
    collected as per authorizations defined by the data owner. The data sensed and
    collected by autonomous systems infrastructure is further transported to the data
    orchestration layer through various communications protocols. The communications
    protocols may include WiFi, 5G, Optical Fiber, GbE, satellite communications,
    or LP-WAN technologies such as LoRaWAN, and NB-IoT. Nonetheless, to counter protocol-specific
    vulnerabilities that may pose a threat to data confidentiality and integrity during
    transit, it is recommended that the source devices should encrypt the data. Similarly,
    an additional user/data authentication mechanism should also be employed to ensure
    data integrity. It is also preferred that autonomous systems such as DaaS, MaaS,
    aFaaS, smart homes, and iHealth mostly comprise particular types of IoT devices.
    And these devices, usually operating independently in a trustless environment,
    are vulnerable to various threats, such as physical compromise, hacking, and code
    modification [192]. Hence, the security of IoT devices is of utmost importance.
    Therefore, it is proposed that all the devices/equipment part of an autonomous
    system that operates directly in the public place must be tamper-proofed. Also,
    there should be some mechanism to verify the integrity of IoT devices on a regular
    basis. It is evident from Fig.15 that most of the vulnerabilities emerge at the
    data orchestration layer, where data is stored, processed, managed, and shared
    with various stakeholders. Hence, to prevent various attacks, different defense
    strategies are proposed. Firstly, to prevent unauthorized access to data in the
    garb of SLAs, access to system resources should be regulated based on the principle
    of “Least Privilege.” In the same way, to avoid a single point of failure, threats
    to data availability, and trust issues, STPs can leverage blockchain-based privacy
    and integrity-preserving data sharing framework [173] that provides a distributed
    environment with decentralized control. It also empowers data owners to authorize
    access and control the time of access to their data. The data owners are given
    an incentive for sharing their data. This incentive is important to bolster maximum
    participation of people by residing and working in a data-enabled living science
    city offering numerous autonomous services that rely on users’ data for intelligent
    decision-making. Correspondingly, there have been work on various blockchain-based
    solutions for Agri tech including Blockchain-based privacy-preserving data analytics
    [193], blockchain-based distributed key management solution [194], blockchain-based
    access control solution [195], blockchain-based reputation and trust solution
    [196], blockchain-based authentication and identification solution [197], and
    blockchain-based secure SDN to prevent false data injection [198]. Furthermore,
    entrusting users with more control over their data, end-to-end encryption can
    be used to ensure data security as it is collected and transmitted by the autonomous
    systems and stored in the local DB, followed by collection and storage in the
    STP Data Arena. However, it is not easy to perform different data analytics functions
    over encrypted data. Even homomorphic encryption schemes provide limited computable
    functions. On the contrary autonomous systems need to perform complex tasks over
    data such as reasoning, planning, inferring, or learning. Hence, an alternative
    to encryption may be trusted computing, which has been quite successful for private
    multi-party learning [199]. In addition, transparency is also considered essential
    for both user privacy [200] and autonomous systems [201]. In the context of privacy,
    transparency is that data owners know how a particular system collects, processes,
    stores, and share their data. Whereas, for autonomous systems, transparency fosters
    trust between humans and respective systems by allowing humans to better understand
    the operation of autonomous systems and their decisions. However, it is comparatively
    difficult to assess transparency for autonomous systems than traditional software
    applications where mostly public disclosure of the code is enough [202]. Therefore,
    a new research area has emerged to ensure fair computations and fair machine learning
    so that the autonomous systems make unbiased decisions [203]. Another challenge
    is the balance between transparency and privacy in autonomous systems. Since transparency
    involves knowing the current state of reasoning of an autonomous system and related
    data sets, this would be acceptable unless the current state of reasoning and
    related data sets does not disclose PII [201]. Hence, to preserve users’ privacy
    by preventing disclosure of PII, it is recommended that differential privacy based
    blockchain solutions be considered [204], [205]. Besides, there are numerous security
    threats to web applications [206]. Some of the most pronounced attacks at the
    application layer and related security measures are illustrated in the following
    paragraphs: Injection Flaws: Web applications are vulnerable to Structured Query
    Language (SQL), noSQL, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) injection
    flaws. These attacks enable the attacker to execute some specific commands or
    have unauthorized access to data by sending malicious data as a query to the interpreter.
    Such attacks can be avoided by carefully verifying the input data. Broken Authentication
    and Access Control: Attackers can compromise passwords, keys, session tokens,
    or have unauthorized access to users’ accounts and sensitive data. Similarly,
    attackers can modify access rights due to incorrect implementation of application
    functions related to authentication, access control, and session management. However,
    these threats can be prevented by prioritizing security during the design and
    development of web applications. Subsequently, the application developers should
    employ multifactor authentication schemes, and effective access control techniques
    such as role-based or geo-location-based access control [207], [208] to regulate
    unauthorized access to the applications and sensitive data. Sensitive Data Exposure:
    Most of the time, application developers do not pay much heed to the security
    aspects [192]. As a result, many web applications and APIs do not adequately protect
    sensitive data such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Hence, attackers may modify
    or steal such unprotected sensitive data and conduct identity theft, web extortion,
    credit card fraud, or other attacks. However, sensitive data can be protected
    with sufficient authentication and access control measures, as mentioned in the
    previous paragraph. Security Misconfiguration: This is the most common security
    vulnerability in web applications. It involves insecure default configurations,
    incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers,
    and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Therefore, it is
    recommended that all applications be securely configured with the compulsion of
    changing default security parameters such as usernames and passwords. Moreover,
    there must be timely security updates in case of any security breach or discovery
    of a zero-day attack. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): A successful occurrence of XSS
    attack enables an attacker to execute malicious chunks of JavaScript in victim’s
    browser. As a result, the attacker can redirect the victim to a malicious website,
    hijack the current session or deface the affected website. Such attacks can be
    prevented by making sure that any dynamic content coming from the back-end data
    store cannot be used to inject JavaScript on a web page [209]. SECTION V. Role
    of Universities in a STP Universities are the epic center of academic research,
    innovation, and generation of new ideas. According to [210], universities are
    a kind of “factory” generating new patentable products. Moreover, authors in [211],
    [212] assert that universities in a STP cause knowledge spillovers that benefit
    various stakeholders and promote the creation and exchange of technological knowledge.
    As a result of this knowledge sharing, the firms or startups at STP have the opportunity
    to improve their innovative capacity. Hence, universities attract private-sector
    organizations and other nonprofit technology research groups. However, universities
    require ways and means to turn academic research into innovative commercial products
    [9]. For this purpose, STPs should endeavor to provide the desired platform to
    the universities and private-sector research centers to play their part. In this
    context, STPs must try to enhance universities’ role with an increased cooperation/collaboration
    with industry. As shown in Fig.16 during the planning and design phase of a STP,
    universities can employ higher degree research students and respective staff members
    to conceive and prepare initial designs of different autonomous systems. The vital
    aspect here is identifying the right technologies and related products to sustain
    a particular autonomous system for the next 10–15 years, with an up-gradation
    option to cater to futuristic changes. Similarly, HEIs can help create data sets
    that would be required for various intelligent systems for training purposes.
    Moreover, keeping in view the research potential and availability of specialized
    equipment, HEIs can even develop numerous systems as part of the ASaaS business
    model. E.g., a university equipped with cutting-edge robotics technologies may
    develop prototypes of some personal, service, and social robots. These prototypes
    can be employed in universities’ campuses for further testing and optimization.
    Similarly, universities can design and develop prototypes of iLighting systems
    and use them in local council areas to gather environmental data and provide various
    services to the users. Subsequently, universities can collaborate with manufacturers/vendors
    for the ToT and commercial level development of new technologies/products. FIGURE
    16. Role of universities. Show All Another critical aspect that seeks the attention
    of HEIs is the evaluation of safety aspects related to autonomous systems. Here,
    the point of concern is uncontrolled or biased actions [203] by autonomous systems
    due to hardware or software bug threatening human lives. Similarly, research scientists
    from HEIs or specialized research centers can play their part in the research
    and development of security solutions against cyber threats at all stages of STPs’
    development, i.e., planning, design, development, and operation. Universities
    are also expected to build up a research collaboration with industry to stimulate
    patenting, licensing, and development of new technologies and products. Correspondingly,
    universities are increasingly emphasizing the creation of new startups/companies
    as a mechanism for commercialization [10] of newly developed technologies and
    products. E.g., University of Technology Sydney (UTS’s) “Startups” [213] and “Techcelerator”
    [214] programs aim at helping young entrepreneurs to promote their ideas, develop
    prototypes, and survive successfully through their infancy stages. These programs
    provide all necessary support to the students in terms of collaboration spaces,
    mentorship, profile-building, community-building, and enhancing prototyping and
    market-testing skills. Therefore, it is certain that if facilities like UTS’s
    Startups, and Techcelerator are available in STPs, many young firms can benefit
    from them. Moreover, universities are the best platform to communicate technological
    advancements identified through R&D to the business community and industry partners.
    This will also help in better understanding and propagation of innovative ideas.
    Thus increasing the chances of getting R&D grants. It is also foreseen that HEIs
    can facilitate technology diffusion by providing technical consultancy and establishing
    technology transfer centers through the licensing of university-based technologies
    to existing firms or new ventures [11]. Similarly, academic and specialized research
    centers can promote the development of new technologies by providing specialized
    equipment and labs for testing and evaluation. In the same way, HEIs should continuously
    carry out an appraisal of technologies employed in STPs to identify vulnerabilities
    and suggest improvements. SECTION VI. Components of a STP Based on our discussion
    on STP’s objectives in Section II-A and ASaaS in Section III, it is envisaged
    that components shown in Table.2 should form part of a STP to support attainment
    of most of its goals/objectives. As discussed in Section V universities and other
    HEIs are essential for the success of STPs. They are the source of knowledge spillover
    and also facilitate R&D collaboration with the industry. Moreover, HEIs can also
    support new startups and young entrepreneurs in the early stages of their establishment.
    Similarly, private-sector or even government-sponsored R&D centers located inside
    STPs can collaborate with HEIs and industries to solve future problems. In addition
    to R&D cooperation, technical consultancy services to tech-based startups in any
    form, i.e., technical advice or skilled resource, are necessary for new prototypes
    or product development. Correspondingly, new startups, entrepreneurs, and tech-based
    firms are some of the cardinal components of a STP that boost technological advancements.
    Likewise, representatives from industries such as manufacturing, agriculture,
    robotics, and construction should also be located in the park to coordinate and
    drive industry-focused research. TABLE 2 Components of a Science and Technology
    Park Another critical element is the provision of business support by STP management
    to the tenants. This support can be in the form of consultation related to marketing,
    finance, IP, copyrights, and government regulations. Furthermore, public and private
    VC organizations and seed capital providers with a presence in STP may provide
    financial support to the firms/startups. Subsequently, government agents from
    various regulatory bodies, e.g., finance, law, customs, cybersecurity, ICT, research
    and innovation, and IP, should be there in the STP to ensure compliance with government
    policies/regulations. Similarly, the presence of a suitably composed onsite park
    management is vital to govern and resolve all the issues related to maintenance,
    tenant registration and accommodation, event management, dispute resolution, supply
    chain management, disaster management, and security of park infrastructure. Other
    than park management, ICT service providers are also one of the core elements
    of a STP. ICT service providers must be involved in all the planning and development
    stages so that ICT services are available to the park developers, management,
    and tenants from the initial phases of their settlement in the park. Subsequently,
    after the start of ICT operations in the STP, a Security Operations Center (SOCS)
    is a crucial entity. SOC is a centralized function within the STP that employs
    people, processes, and technology to continuously monitor and improve security
    posture. Its primary objective is to prevent, detect, analyze, and respond to
    cybersecurity incidents [215]. On the other hand, to ensure road safety and regulate
    the MaaS system, Roads and Transport Services’ (RTS) availability in the park
    is of fundamental importance. Moreover, the adverse effects of global warming
    in the form of floods, storms, bush fires, and cyclones are on the rise than ever
    before. Hence, in coordination with respective government agencies, the STP management
    should prepare a comprehensive Disaster Recovery and Management (DRM) plan. And
    equip STP with the necessary equipment and allied resources. Similarly, to provide
    a high standard of living to the tenants, park management must arrange essential
    commodities such as grocery stores, restaurants, motels, parks, sports centers,
    gyms, hospitals, cinemas, professional gaming zones, etc. Likewise, to facilitate
    knowledge sharing and networking/collaboration between onsite firms/companies/HEIs,
    there should be libraries, auditoriums, and community centers at the STP. Park
    management may coordinate and arrange different social events, academic conferences,
    workshops, or seminars to build networking and collaboration opportunities between
    various stakeholders. In the same way, keeping in view the scope of R&D, the park
    management, in coordination with HEIs, and industry partners, should ensure the
    availability of necessary equipment, spares, and tools to meet demands in the
    minimum possible time. Also, to further enhance the STP’s livability, cutting-edge
    smart homes/units at economical rates should be provided to the park tenants.
    Correspondingly, to make STP a rare attraction for all the stakeholders with an
    innovative look, different autonomous systems should be employed to provide value-added
    services to the tenants. SECTION VII. Future Challenges Though we believe that
    ASaaS business model for STPs has more merits than the demerits. However, there
    are some significant challenges concerning autonomous systems that must be given
    due consideration during the design and development stages and while integrating
    different systems. It is a daunting task to ensure open-sourcing of autonomous
    systems and their compliance with international standards once a myriad of technologies
    and systems operate in a STP. Moreover, it is also an open challenge to control
    fully autonomous systems’ biasedness or malicious action if they are compromised
    or malfunction. Similarly, it is currently difficult to assess the transparency
    of fully autonomous systems. Furthermore, it is also challenging to draw a balance
    between transparency and privacy in autonomous systems. Correspondingly, the governments
    should update their data security and privacy regulations by including some clauses
    on autonomous systems’ unbiased decision making and transparency. Concerning the
    ASaaS user interface, we envision that the autonomous systems should intuitively
    interact with the users, which can be achieved using NLP supporting multiple languages,
    including French, English, Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, etc.). The users must find the
    interface familiar and straightforward where they can interact using voice and
    text commands. It is also essential that the user interface for each user should
    support customized settings as per the services subscribed by the respective user.
    Similarly, the STP tenants and other users should have a simple way, e.g., a slider
    to control the priority of their jobs for each service. The cost and the estimated
    time for the desired service can then be calculated and displayed in real-time
    on the user interface. If we look at system-specific merits and challenges, firstly,
    the autonomous waste management system requires considerable research for accurate
    identification and classification of objects. So that fast decaying items should
    be collected and disposed off immediately. The DaaS’s on-demand nature allows
    shipments to be sent as soon as they are ready rather than waiting for the following
    day’s shipping run. Thus DaaS supports the rapid fulfillment of time-critical
    deliveries. Moreover, data gathered both actively and passively can enhance the
    DaaS delivery system’s capability to track shipments accurately. However, inclement
    weather can affect the drones’ operation. Therefore, graded priority on jobs can
    help the system make intelligent decisions about responding to such events. Correspondingly,
    ground-based autonomous vehicles can be a suitable alternative to drones in inclement
    weather. Besides, the autonomous cars carrying more sensors are also suited to
    continuous mapping functions to update the real-time 3D map of STP. We also believe
    that a subscription to the DaaS health emergency service will save loved ones’
    lives. Concerning the STP Data Arena, a considerable effort is required to develop
    a privacy-preserving data analytics framework that must protect users against
    data privacy and security threats. Likewise, if we look at aFaaS, it has a lot
    of potentials. However, in addition to establishing model autonomous Agri farms
    in STPs, farmers worldwide need to be educated on Agri technologies’ use-cases
    and benefits. Hence, there is a need to address farmers’ concerns/misconceptions
    over safety, security, and loss of jobs due to autonomous robots. Another critical
    issue for autonomous systems is the availability of suitable datasets. Correspondingly,
    The datasets for cyber security are equally important in intrusion detection.
    Actually, most and recent intrusion detection systems are tested with KDD 1999,
    NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and Bot-IoT [178]. However, these datasets are not designed
    for IoT-based Agri tech scenarios. Hence, there is a requirement of developing
    new datasets for IoT-based agriculture environment to build network security and
    other service models. For blockchain supported IoT-based Agri tech solutions,
    the critical area to explore is validation of IoT devices’ integrity. This is
    also termed as an “Oracle Problem” for blockchain applications, where ensuring
    integrity of data input to the blockchain is an open challenge. Similarly, security
    of blockchain applications and smart contracts require considerable efforts in
    addition to conventional security measures. SECTION VIII. Conclusion STPs are
    considered to be the epitome of innovation and growth of a technology-based economy.
    However, for a STP to be successful, it should have the means to attract technology-based
    companies, related businesses, and industries. Therefore, to impart a futuristic
    look to STPs, we introduced the concept of autonomous systems as a service. We
    believe that the autonomous systems-based business model will increase the liveability
    in the STPs and provide a playground for the testing and evaluation of new technologies
    in a controlled environment. On the contrary, entrepreneurs and tech-based firms
    cannot reasonably evaluate new products and technologies without impacting the
    general population’s safety and privacy. However, autonomous Agri technologies
    need to be more robust and intelligent to operate effectively in a world of ever-increasing
    natural calamities, like bush fires, flash floods, storms, and earthquakes. We
    also anticipate reducing the operational costs and increase the serviceability
    of the autonomous systems. It can be achieved by ensuring that the autonomous
    systems must perform self-diagnostics to monitor the health of their equipment,
    devices/components, and schedule replacements and maintenance accordingly. This
    study also appraised threats to data security and privacy in autonomous systems
    and proposed requisite security measures. Subsequently, we observe that ensuring
    the security of multidimensional data acquisition, storage, and processing systems
    against perilous cyber threats is an appalling task that requires careful planning,
    risk assessment, and a defense-in-depth approach. This research also specified
    many components that may contribute to attaining the overall objectives of a STP.
    Finally, numerous challenges concerning autonomous systems were emphasized to
    facilitate practical implementation of the proposed ASaaS business model in near
    future. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This The

    \ sneethir@gmail.com\nAbstract: The emergence of precision and digital livestock\
    \ farming presents an opportunity for\nsustainable animal farming practices that\
    \ enhance animal welfare and health. However, this trans-\nformation of modern\
    \ animal farming through digital technology has several implications for the\n\
    technological, social, economic, and environmental aspects of farming. It is crucial\
    \ to analyze the\nethical considerations associated with the digitalization of\
    \ modern animal farming, particularly in the\ncontext of human–animal relationships\
    \ and potential objectiﬁcation. This analysis can help develop\nframeworks for\
    \ improving animal welfare and promoting sustainability in animal farming. One\
    \ of\nthe primary ethical concerns of digital livestock farming is the potential\
    \ for a digital divide between\nfarmers who have access to advanced technologies\
    \ and those who do not. This could lead to a\ndisparity in animal welfare and\
    \ health outcomes for different groups of animals. Additionally, the\nuse of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence in digital livestock farming may lead to a loss of personal connection\n\
    between farmers and animals, which could impact the animal’s well-being. Another\
    \ ethical concern\nof digital livestock farming is the potential for the objectiﬁcation\
    \ of animals as mere data points. The\nuse of sensors and other monitoring technologies\
    \ can provide valuable data on animal health and\nbehavior, but it is important\
    \ to remember that animals are sentient beings with complex emotional\nand social\
    \ needs. The use of digital technologies should not lead to neglect of animal\
    \ welfare or a\nlack of human responsibility toward animals. Furthermore, social\
    \ context becomes essential while\nintegrating technologies in livestock farming\
    \ to overcome ethics. By considering the cultural and\nsocietal norms of different\
    \ communities, we can ensure that the use of digital technologies does not\nundermine\
    \ these values. To address these ethical challenges, the development of standards\
    \ and codes\nof conduct for the adoption and implementation of digital livestock\
    \ farming tools and platforms can\nhelp ensure that animal welfare and sustainability\
    \ are prioritized. This can help alleviate the privacy\nconcerns of stakeholders\
    \ and improve sustainability in animal farming practices. Additionally, the\n\
    use of virtual and augmented reality technologies can provide a way to enhance\
    \ human–animal\ninteractions and provide more personalized care to animals, further\
    \ promoting animal welfare.\nKeywords: precision livestock farming; digital livestock\
    \ farming; smart farming; societal impacts;\ndata ownership; open access; sustainability;\
    \ animal ethics; digital divide; digital agriculture\n1. Introduction\nThe increasing\
    \ demand for animal products has led to signiﬁcant changes in animal\nfarming\
    \ practices, with a shift toward more intensive and industrialized methods of\
    \ an-\nimal production. As a result, animal welfare and sustainability have become\
    \ important\nconcerns for consumers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the animal\
    \ agriculture indus-\ntry. This has led to the development of new technologies\
    \ and farming practices, such as\nprecision and digital livestock farming, which\
    \ offer potential beneﬁts for animal welfare\nand sustainability.\nTechnologies\
    \ can be considered a double-edged sword—something that is clearly\nexempliﬁed\
    \ in livestock farming. For instance, deepfake technologies have been drawing\n\
    attention lately. Such technologies are used mostly in malicious applications,\
    \ but they can\nalso be integrated with virtual reality to enhance animal welfare.\
    \ To illustrate, suppose\nthat a calf is suffering emotionally owing to the absence\
    \ of a mother that has been sent for\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5, 488–505. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering5010032\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n489\nslaughter.\
    \ The technologies in question can be harnessed to create a digital simulation\
    \ of the\nmother cow that may provide comfort to the calf and enhance its emotional\
    \ well-being [1].\nIndeed, there are problems that are presently considered unsolvable\
    \ in the livestock\nfarming sector but that can, in fact, be solved or might become\
    \ solvable using digitization\napproaches, which make possible innovations such\
    \ as the following:\n•\nTransitioning from subjective judgments to objective methods\
    \ of measurement;\n•\nMoving from one-dimensional to multidimensional approaches\
    \ in solving problems\nfrom a holistic standpoint;\n•\nBecoming able to solve\
    \ problems by moving from a coarse-grained to a ﬁne-grained\nlevel of analysis\
    \ in order to understand, design and develop solutions;\n•\nMoving away from reactive\
    \ to predictive approaches.\nTwo such digitized approaches in livestock farming\
    \ are precision livestock farming and\ndigital livestock farming, the latter of\
    \ which has emerged from the former. Precision live-\nstock farming and digital\
    \ livestock farming are two examples of digitized approaches that\noffer beneﬁts\
    \ such as real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and automated decision-\n\
    making. The integration of digital technologies into animal farming practices\
    \ raises several\nethical concerns, particularly with regard to human–animal relationships\
    \ and objectiﬁca-\ntion. There is a need to analyze the ethical considerations\
    \ associated with digital livestock\nfarming and develop frameworks for improving\
    \ animal welfare and sustainability.\nThe research question that inspired this\
    \ opinion review is, “What are the ethical\nconsiderations associated with digital\
    \ livestock farming, and how can they be addressed\nto improve animal welfare\
    \ and sustainability?” The review aims to provide a critical\nanalysis of the\
    \ ethical challenges of digital livestock farming technologies and their potential\n\
    impact on animal welfare and sustainability. It also offers recommendations for\
    \ ethical\nconsiderations, including the development of standards and codes of\
    \ conduct for the\nadoption and implementation of digital livestock farming tools\
    \ and platforms. The review is\nintended to inform policymakers, animal agriculture\
    \ industry stakeholders, and consumers\nabout the potential beneﬁts and ethical\
    \ challenges of digital livestock farming and to\nencourage discussion and action\
    \ to promote animal welfare and sustainability in animal\nfarming practices.\n\
    2. Precision Livestock Farming, Digital Livestock Farming and Smart\nLivestock\
    \ Farming\nTo begin, let us explore the core notions that shall occupy the stakeholders,\
    \ namely\nprecision livestock farming, digital livestock farming and, in addition\
    \ smart livestock farming.\nPrecision livestock farming (PLF) terminology has\
    \ been used for over 10 years. PLF\nmay be deﬁned as “the management of livestock\
    \ production using the principles and\ntechnology of process engineering” [2].\
    \ Its purpose is to “improve the efﬁciency of pro-\nduction while increasing animal\
    \ and human welfare, via applying advanced information\nand communication technologies\
    \ (ICT), targeted resource use and precise control of the\nproduction process”\
    \ [3].\nMore recently, PLF has been deﬁned as farm management based on continuous\
    \ au-\ntomatic real-time monitoring and control of production/reproduction, animal\
    \ health and\nwelfare, and the environmental impact of livestock production [4–6].\
    \ However, as we shall\nsee presently, this is a deﬁnition that reﬂects the ways\
    \ in which PLF has been moving\ntoward digital livestock farming since it emphasizes\
    \ real-time monitoring and control,\nsomething that has been characteristic of\
    \ the digital farming transformation. Accordingly,\nthe previous deﬁnition offered\
    \ above is more appropriate for our purposes of observing\nthe distinction between\
    \ precision livestock farming and digital livestock farming.\nDespite the recent\
    \ prevalence of PLF, we are now slowly moving from PLF to digital\nlivestock farming\
    \ (DLF) and, relatedly, smart farming (SF). DLF may be deﬁned as digital\nagriculture\
    \ or farming, applied speciﬁcally to livestock farming. Digital agriculture, in\
    \ turn,\nis deﬁned as follows [7]:\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n490\nWe deﬁne digital\
    \ agriculture as the use of elaborate and detailed digital information\nin guiding\
    \ decisions along the agri-food value chain. This includes the use of high-volume,\n\
    variable source data (“big data”) that creates critical insights, modeling, actionable\
    \ analytics\nand automation for precision livestock farming. Importantly, it is\
    \ not restricted to farm\nanimal production alone but also can span all or part\
    \ of the value chain; the transforma-\ntional aspect of digitization offers a\
    \ bridge between the consumer and animal caretaker or\nthe farmer.\nThere is a\
    \ marked difference in precision and accuracy with respect to each type of\nfarming.\
    \ PLF is mostly an incremental way of ﬁnding solutions, while DLF features a higher\n\
    degree of integration and encompasses sustainability [8] and predictive possibilities\
    \ that\naccount for time-scale phenomena [9]. The primary focus of PLF is on post-data\
    \ collected\nmeasurements for supporting decision-making and directing farming\
    \ practices. By contrast,\nDLF is about real-time and predictive capabilities,\
    \ which are made possible by self-learning\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms\
    \ [10]. Digitalization is about creating actionable intelligence\nvia data and\
    \ creating meaningful value for all of the stakeholders in livestock farming,\
    \ all\nwhile ensuring the well-being of animals.\nThus, DLF incorporates and integrates\
    \ precision and smart animal farming concepts.\nAdditionally, the emphasis of\
    \ DLF is not anymore on precision, which was already achieved\nat the stage of\
    \ PLF. Instead, now that precision has been achieved, the emphasis is on the\n\
    integration of precise data into digital systems. Thus, we see that DLF goes beyond\
    \ PLF.\nOne useful way of thinking about PLF is in terms of a multi-layered structure.\
    \ First,\nwe may speak in terms of input systems, such as wearable devices, sensors,\
    \ recording\nequipment, etc. These input devices generate data, which constitutes\
    \ the second layer. On\nthe third layer, we ﬁnd data management and storage. This\
    \ is followed by a further layer\nwhich includes processing, interpretation and,\
    \ ﬁnally, feedback.\nTo clarify, however, one should bear in mind that, in certain\
    \ speciﬁc cases, some\ndigital animal farming technologies can be considered more\
    \ as an incremental acquisition\nof understanding through observation. An example\
    \ of this would be mobile, on-farm\nreal-time detection tools that measure the\
    \ health of farm animals in the form of data for\ncommercial use and to address\
    \ animal caretaker concerns.\nThere are some useful points of contrast that can\
    \ be appealed to in order to elaborate\non the differences between PLF and DLF:\n\
    In a conventional system such as precision livestock farming (PLF), sensors (wearable\n\
    and minimally invasive or non-invasive) and video monitoring technologies collect\
    \ animal\nmeasurements and send this data to a computer [11]. Algorithms process\
    \ this data and\ncreate insights or enable farmers to make decisions. This data\
    \ can be compared to a target\nvalue or a model, for example, in monitoring temperature.\
    \ If the temperature is between\ntwo given values, it is within an acceptable\
    \ range, but if it falls outside that range, there\nis something amiss that may\
    \ require some decision-making. The underlying condition\nbehind the anomalous\
    \ temperature could be variations or ﬂuctuating hormonal levels\ninside an animal.\
    \ Here, the interaction between various physiological parameters has to be\nconsidered\
    \ and evaluated. Thus, conventional PLF basically collects data based on health-\n\
    or welfare-indicating parameters after the occurrence of an event. By contrast,\
    \ with digital\nanimal farming, we have the capability to move from reactive to\
    \ predictive measurements;\neven before disease onset, the data analysis can tell\
    \ when it will occur [10,12].\nIt is also important to point out that the transition\
    \ from PLF to DLF can be analyzed\nunder a two-stage approach. The initial stage\
    \ is characterized by an emphasis on digi-\ntalization. The second stage, in turn,\
    \ involves a more precise distinction between digital\nlivestock farming and smart\
    \ livestock farming (SLF), where both of these can be regarded as\nsuccessors\
    \ to PLF. Smart farming is a development that focuses on the usage of information\n\
    and communication technology (ICT) in the cyber-physical livestock farm management\n\
    cycle [13]. Now, many of the ethical and social implications of both farming systems\
    \ will be\nthe same. However, SLF also has speciﬁc implications of its own. Some\
    \ work needs to be\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n491\ndone to give more weight to\
    \ SLF compared to DLF in discussions of new trends in farming.\nAnother important\
    \ question to explore here is whether SLF complements DLF.\nDigital and/or precision\
    \ livestock farming is an emerging area of research, and the\ntechnologies are\
    \ currently being developed rapidly without much consideration of the\nimplications\
    \ of ethics in relation to the animals and the bonding with the animal caretakers\n\
    and other social elements. There is a need for understanding the elements of ethics\
    \ from\nthe social context and from the animals’ individual needs perspective.\n\
    3. The Ethics of DLF\nEthics is a crucial dimension of analysis to consider when\
    \ discussing DLF [14]. In\nthis regard, there are multiple issues to bear in mind,\
    \ which bring to the fore the ethical\ncomplexities created by DLF. Here, we discuss\
    \ several of those issues.\n3.1. Animal Contentment\nAnimal contentment is closely\
    \ associated with productivity. As one may say, “A\nhappy cow is a productive\
    \ cow” [15]. It is the fundamental responsibility of farmers and\nfarming industries\
    \ to ensure that animals live fully in their short life span (such as by\nexhibiting\
    \ natural behavior, demonstrating playfulness and enjoying a quality of life).\n\
    DLF incorporates this concern in the development of solutions since it can be\
    \ used to\npromote animal welfare [16]. Of course, sometimes society can be considered\
    \ venal, as the\nmain focus is on maximizing proﬁts and efﬁciency, not on animal\
    \ welfare. As researchers,\nhowever, we know that it is not sustainable to consider\
    \ proﬁt alone as a goal in livestock\nfarming, and DLF serves as a powerful tool\
    \ in this ethical pursuit. Here are some ways in\nwhich DLF can help achieve this\
    \ goal:\nPrecision management: DLF can provide real-time data on animal health,\
    \ behavior,\nand performance. This information can be used to identify potential\
    \ health problems or\nchanges in behavior that may indicate stress, pain, or discomfort.\
    \ With this information,\nfarmers can intervene early to prevent or treat health\
    \ issues, resulting in better animal\nwelfare and productivity.\nEnvironmental\
    \ monitoring: DLF can also provide real-time data on environmental\nconditions,\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, which can affect animal health\n\
    and welfare. By monitoring these factors, farmers can make adjustments to improve\
    \ animal\ncomfort and reduce the risk of disease.\nEfﬁcient resource management:\
    \ DLF can help farmers manage resources more efﬁ-\nciently, including feed, water,\
    \ and energy. By optimizing the use of these resources, farmers\ncan reduce waste\
    \ and minimize environmental impact while also improving proﬁtability.\nTraceability\
    \ and transparency: DLF can provide a detailed record of each animal’s life\n\
    cycle, including its origin, breeding, feed, and medication history. This information\
    \ can be\nused to ensure the safety and quality of animal products and to provide\
    \ consumers with\ntransparency about where their food comes from and how it was\
    \ produced. In addition,\ntransparency in the use of DLF and the sharing of data\
    \ with consumers would increase\naccountability and drive positive change in the\
    \ industry.\nAnimal Welfare: To ensure animal welfare in DLF, it is important\
    \ to prioritize the use of\ndigital tools that facilitate real-time monitoring\
    \ and early detection of animal health issues.\nThis would allow for timely interventions\
    \ and treatment, minimizing animal suffering.\nDLF can certainly help farmers\
    \ optimize animal welfare, reduce environmental impact,\nand improve proﬁtability.\
    \ However, it is important to remember that DLF is a tool, and\nit should be used\
    \ in conjunction with other ethical and sustainable farming practices to\nachieve\
    \ the best possible outcomes for animals, the environment, and society as a whole.\n\
    3.2. Disruption and Critical Analysis\nDLF has the potential to be disruptive\
    \ in management [17]. Now, being disruptive does\nnot necessarily mean that technology\
    \ is negative. For example, by alleviating physiological\nuncertainty in animals\
    \ differently from how it was intended to be alleviated, predictive\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2023, 5\n492\ndigital farming tools can be self-fulﬁlling and provide their\
    \ own raison d’être. Nonetheless,\nnormative questions and a constant reﬂection\
    \ on reality are necessary for developing\nsolutions via DLF. We should learn\
    \ from our mistakes, for example, even when poorly\nsupported predictions end\
    \ up being true. That is, we do not learn from mistakes if we\ncannot recognize\
    \ mistakes as such. Proper use of digital technology has to consider and\nlook\
    \ at ways to realize and take stock of our mistakes and learn from them.\nTo avoid\
    \ the self-fulﬁlling prophecies of predictive digital farming tools and the\n\
    misuse of technology, it is essential to subject all digital tools to rigorous\
    \ ethical scrutiny\nbefore they are deployed. This should involve a multidisciplinary\
    \ approach that includes\nexperts in animal welfare, ethics, and data privacy.\
    \ The use of ethical principles such\nas the precautionary principle and the principle\
    \ of non-maleﬁcence could help to guide\ndecision-making.\n3.3. Digital Divide\
    \ and Obsolescence\n“Digital divide” is another concept that we have to consider\
    \ in connection to ethics [18,19].\nNot everyone is capable of using DLF technologies.\
    \ The digital divide between educated\nand not technically savvy users will lead\
    \ to a technological rift. Animals’ inability to access\ndigital tools in farms\
    \ may lead to detrimental isolation from social interactions and may\naffect the\
    \ nature and quality of interactions between farm animals and caretakers. A related\n\
    issue is that of obsolescence. It has been estimated that engineering knowledge\
    \ becomes\nobsolete, on average, every 5.2 years [20]. Technology obsolescence\
    \ is also a prevalent issue.\nThis may deepen the technological divide between\
    \ those who are able to keep up with the\npace of technological change and those\
    \ who are not.\nTo address the digital divide in the livestock farming industry,\
    \ stakeholders should\nprioritize providing access to digital tools and training\
    \ for all farmers. This could involve\nthe development of user-friendly digital\
    \ tools and training programs that cater to individu-\nals with varying levels\
    \ of technical proﬁciency. To mitigate obsolescence, the development\nof digital\
    \ tools should be agile and adaptable, with regular updates and support provided\n\
    to users.\n3.4. Social Considerations\nA further crucial issue to consider is\
    \ the social dimension of DLF. Of particular note\nhere is the question of social\
    \ attachment. Some groups with a more individualistic approach\nmay see social\
    \ attachment as less beneﬁcial and perhaps even as a burden. Nonetheless, a\n\
    concern for well-being in relation to technology should take into account that\
    \ users and\nfarm animals are diverse and be inclusive [21]. How to ﬁght digital\
    \ discrimination in\ntechnological adoption and build inclusion should be considered\
    \ part of the development\nof digital tools for livestock farming. This can be\
    \ done by integrating values into the design\nof those tools. Indeed, technology\
    \ is not just an artifact, it is a tool, and it can also be\nan institution and\
    \ an intermediary. Design is part, as well, of social, political, and moral\n\
    values, which may lead to some fundamental challenges that involve resolving potential\n\
    ethical conﬂicts.\nTo ensure social inclusion in DLF, it is important to involve\
    \ all stakeholders in the\ndesign and deployment of digital tools. This would\
    \ enable the integration of diverse\nperspectives and values and could help to\
    \ mitigate digital discrimination. Additionally, the\nuse of participatory design\
    \ approaches could help to ensure that digital tools are developed\nwith the needs\
    \ and preferences of all users in mind.\n3.5. Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nDigital-tool\
    \ design and deployment in modern animal farming should also consider\nthe individual\
    \ carbon footprint associated with animals, processes and facilities, as well\
    \ as\nother greenhouse emissions like methane. Greenhouse emissions are of peak\
    \ importance in\nconsidering the environmental implications of farming. This is\
    \ a particularly clear example,\namong many others, of how digital farming requires\
    \ analyzing whether the digital tools\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n493\ndeployed\
    \ improve society in addition to enhancing food productivity. Doing so should\n\
    consider various platforms and applications of those tools and the context in\
    \ which they\nare being applied. DLF offers various ways of monitoring and perhaps\
    \ reducing emissions,\nboth methane [22,23]. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ in DLF, stakeholders should\nprioritize the use of digital tools that help to\
    \ minimize the carbon footprint of livestock\nfarming. This could involve the\
    \ use of precision feeding systems that reduce feed waste\nand associated methane\
    \ emissions, as well as the use of renewable energy sources to power\ndigital\
    \ tools and other farm processes.\n3.6. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Public Policy\n\
    The uptake of artiﬁcial intelligence-enabled digital tools for livestock farming\
    \ via\npublic–private partnerships and arrangements is becoming a main policy\
    \ tool. The pub-\nlic sector is not very approachable for citizens when considering\
    \ AI algorithms, which\ntherefore become black boxes, raising questions of transparency\
    \ [24]. Relating this issue to\nfreedom of information, we may note that proprietary\
    \ information is completely different\nand varies between the public and private\
    \ sectors. The public sector emphasizes trans-\nparency, legitimacy and shared\
    \ beneﬁt for all, while the private sector focuses on efﬁciency\nand proﬁtability.\n\
    With that being said, we should bear in mind that, as is often the case, “The\
    \ medium\nis the message”. Digital tools can be perceived in both a favorable\
    \ and less favorable light.\nIt is important to consider how to create avenues\
    \ so that digital tools shape our ideas about\nmodern animal farming in a responsible\
    \ manner.\nTo ensure transparency and ethical use of AI in DLF, it is essential\
    \ to involve all\nstakeholders in the development of public policy around the\
    \ use of AI in the industry.\nThis could involve the establishment of independent\
    \ bodies that oversee the use of AI in\nlivestock farming, ensuring that AI systems\
    \ are transparent, explainable, and accountable.\nAdditionally, public–private\
    \ partnerships should prioritize shared beneﬁts and the interests\nof all stakeholders,\
    \ including farmers, consumers, and animals.\n3.7. Human–Animal Relationships\n\
    The gap between the farm animal’s and the farmer’s intellect can possibly be bridged\n\
    using the magic of visualization platforms (Figure 1) via digital technologies.\
    \ Due to\nthe complexity of the vocalization of farm animals and the verbal depth\
    \ and breadth\ninvolved, visualization tools can offer avenues for better clarity\
    \ of understanding [25–27].\nThis can lead to a more humane form of farming, which\
    \ is of vital importance, given that\nalienation and dehumanization are some of\
    \ the chief current concerns around farming.\nAdditionally, healthy human–animal\
    \ relationships are central to farming productivity [28].\nThe integration of\
    \ digital technologies in livestock farming challenges traditional human–\nanimal\
    \ relationships by changing the way humans interact with animals. With real-time\n\
    monitoring, automated decision-making, and predictive analytics, the role of the\
    \ farmer\nshifts from that of a caretaker to that of a supervisor, with less direct\
    \ involvement in animal\ncare. This raises questions about the value of human–animal\
    \ relationships and whether the\nuse of digital technologies leads to the objectiﬁcation\
    \ of animals.\nMoreover, digital technologies can lead to the reduction of human–animal\
    \ interac-\ntion, which can impact animal welfare negatively. For instance, if\
    \ animals are housed in\nautomated facilities, they may not receive the necessary\
    \ physical contact and socialization\nrequired for their well-being, leading to\
    \ decreased welfare. Therefore, it is important to en-\nsure that the use of digital\
    \ technologies does not compromise human–animal relationships\nand that animals\
    \ continue to receive proper care and socialization.\n3.8. Privacy and Data Protection\n\
    The integration of digital technologies in livestock farming requires the collection,\n\
    storage, and analysis of large amounts of data. This data includes sensitive information\
    \ such\nas animal health, behavior, and genetics, which could be used to infer\
    \ private information\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n494\nabout the farmers and the\
    \ farm’s business operations. Moreover, if this data falls into the\nwrong hands,\
    \ it could lead to issues such as cyber-attacks, fraud, or theft, compromising\n\
    the privacy and safety of farmers and animals.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5, FOR PEER\
    \ REVIEW  \n7 \n \n \nMoreover, digital technologies can lead to the reduction\
    \ of human–animal interac-\ntion, which can impact animal welfare negatively.\
    \ For instance, if animals are housed in \nautomated facilities, they may not\
    \ receive the necessary physical contact and socialization \nrequired for their\
    \ well-being, leading to decreased welfare. Therefore, it is important to \nensure\
    \ that the use of digital technologies does not compromise human–animal relation-\n\
    ships and that animals continue to receive proper care and socialization. \n \n\
    Figure 1. Implications of digital livestock farming for the animals. \n3.8. Privacy\
    \ and Data Protection \nThe integration of digital technologies in livestock farming\
    \ requires the collection, \nstorage, and analysis of large amounts of data. This\
    \ data includes sensitive information \nsuch as animal health, behavior, and genetics,\
    \ which could be used to infer private infor-\nmation about the farmers and the\
    \ farm’s business operations. Moreover, if this data falls \ninto the wrong hands,\
    \ it could lead to issues such as cyber-attacks, fraud, or theft, com-\npromising\
    \ the privacy and safety of farmers and animals. \nTherefore, it is essential\
    \ to have adequate data protection and security measures in \nplace to ensure\
    \ that data is not misused or exploited. This includes secure storage, data \n\
    anonymization, and secure data transfer protocols. Farmers must be transparent\
    \ about \ndata collection and usage and obtain informed consent from stakeholders\
    \ before collect-\ning data. \n \n \nFigure 1. Implications of digital livestock\
    \ farming for the animals.\nTherefore, it is essential to have adequate data protection\
    \ and security measures in\nplace to ensure that data is not misused or exploited.\
    \ This includes secure storage, data\nanonymization, and secure data transfer\
    \ protocols. Farmers must be transparent about data\ncollection and usage and\
    \ obtain informed consent from stakeholders before collecting data.\n3.9. Bias\
    \ and Discrimination\nDigital technologies in livestock farming rely on algorithms\
    \ to analyze data and make\ndecisions. However, these algorithms may have inherent\
    \ biases, leading to discrimination\nand unfair treatment of animals. For instance,\
    \ algorithms may not consider the diversity\nof animal breeds or account for individual\
    \ differences in behavior, leading to inaccurate\npredictions or decisions.\n\
    Therefore, it is essential to ensure that algorithms used in digital livestock\
    \ farming are\nfair, transparent, and unbiased. This includes regular testing,\
    \ validation, and audit of the\nalgorithms to prevent unintended discrimination\
    \ or biases. The development of ethical\nstandards and guidelines for algorithm\
    \ development and use is also essential to prevent\npotential discrimination and\
    \ ensure fairness.\n3.10. Environmental Impact\nDigital livestock farming has\
    \ the potential to improve environmental sustainability\nby reducing waste, optimizing\
    \ resource use, and minimizing the environmental impact of\nlivestock production.\
    \ However, the use of digital technologies in animal farming can also\nlead to\
    \ increased energy consumption, e-waste, and carbon emissions from the production,\n\
    maintenance, and disposal of digital devices and infrastructure.\nTherefore, it\
    \ is crucial to consider the environmental impact of digital livestock farm-\n\
    ing and adopt sustainable practices to mitigate its negative effects. This includes\
    \ using\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n495\nrenewable energy sources, recycling and\
    \ disposing of electronic waste appropriately, and\nreducing unnecessary energy\
    \ consumption.\n3.11. Creating New Values\nCurrent values do not sufﬁce to solve\
    \ the ethical conundrums of DLF, which calls for\nthe creation of new values.\
    \ For example, consider the issue of how digital tools bring about\nvalue changes.\
    \ Farmers can conceptualize digital tools differently based on the context\nin\
    \ which they are applied. They may see them as tools that extend their agency\
    \ or as an\nimposition [29]. It is important, therefore, to engage in careful\
    \ deliberations to interpret\nthe signiﬁcance of technology adoption among farmers\
    \ as it unfolds. This may lead to the\ncreation of new values and perspectives\
    \ that provide solutions to current problems.\nEthical issues surrounding DLF\
    \ require a multidisciplinary approach that integrates\ndiverse perspectives and\
    \ values. By involving all stakeholders in the development and\ndeployment of\
    \ digital tools, we can ensure that DLF promotes animal welfare, reduces\nenvironmental\
    \ impact, and meets the needs of all users.\n3.12. The Prospect of Monopolies\n\
    Another possible concern is that a single multinational company may take control\n\
    of the digital technology market for agriculture, creating a monopoly—something\
    \ that\nwould harm the freedom of small-scale farmers [30]. This could be a real\
    \ danger because\na monopoly would have the power to determine all sorts of crucial\
    \ factors, such as the\ninner workings of programs, digital environments and algorithms,\
    \ assumptions, modeling\ntechniques, etc., thereby compromising objectivity. Furthermore,\
    \ there needs to be account-\nability with respect to algorithms and modeling,\
    \ something that monopolies threaten. For\nexample, a model may prioritize the\
    \ achievement of certain breeding goals at the expense\nof animal well-being.\
    \ This calls for a proper balancing of values that requires inclusive\nsolutions\
    \ and scrutiny.\nThe issue described here becomes more pressing, considering how\
    \ a priority for\nfarmers clearly is to have access to economical systems that\
    \ integrate many different\nparameters and assumptions into their models. This\
    \ is due to the fact that margins are\nvery low in the farming sector. Hence,\
    \ livestock farming scientists have a responsibility\nto balance a wide range\
    \ of variables that go into modeling, a process requiring oversight\nand openness.\n\
    3.13. A Civic Approach\nWhen technologies are being developed for livestock farming,\
    \ a true civic approach to\nscience is needed that allows us to incorporate viewpoints\
    \ from the public at large, farmers\nand ethicists [19]. We cannot predict the\
    \ future; rather, we are making it, so we must all\npartake in it as members of\
    \ civil society. Of course, we hope that whatever emerges from\nnew technologies\
    \ such as DLF will be positive, but the results cannot be fully predicted\nat\
    \ the beginning of the whole enterprise. If ethicists are involved in the very\
    \ beginning\nof such new research, they could provide some valuable foresight\
    \ on the consequences\nof technological development. This is the case even when\
    \ technologies are developed\nwith good intentions since, to emphasize, the issue\
    \ is that of unexpected consequences.\nAccordingly, at the earliest stage, during\
    \ the technology’s development, ethics have to be\nconsidered and integrated into\
    \ the design and planning processes.\n3.14. Social Issues\nIn relation to issues\
    \ pertaining to the social dimension of DLF, we should mention\nhow digital animal\
    \ farming tools can be adopted and how their development proceeds,\ndepending\
    \ on how we think about them. A broader social perspective of technological\n\
    development is essential (Table 1). One example is the DeLaval brushes and other\
    \ comfort\ntechnologies available in dairy farms. There is evidence suggesting\
    \ that such technologies\nenhance cow productivity [31]. However, we may go beyond\
    \ that issue and focus on\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n496\nthe social signiﬁcance\
    \ of the technologies. What does it mean in terms of societal trends\nwhen such\
    \ devices are developed for the comfort of animals in ways analogous to human\n\
    luxuries? Is this simply a matter of pursuing productivity?\nTable 1. Overview\

    \ and disadvantages of PLF; \nThe added value of PLF has not been quantiﬁed yet,\n\
    and there is a need for Life Cycle Assessment.\n3.15. The Limits of Biology and\
    \ the Case of Dead-On-Arrival\nDigital technologies enable the development of\
    \ phenotyping and breeding of pigs\nthat will have good heart conditions despite\
    \ their body weight. Digital technologies can be\nused to derive digital biomarkers\
    \ and use such biomarkers to select desirable heart traits\nthrough breeding in\
    \ pigs. Digital biomarkers are digital measurements of phenotypes that\nare categorized\
    \ according to the intended use of the collected data [32]. Biomarkers may\nallow\
    \ for selective breeding since they facilitate the observation of phenotypes that\
    \ are\npartly determined by genes that can be selected.\nA related issue is that\
    \ of heat stress. Pigs may often die during transportation from\ncommercial farmers\
    \ to slaughterhouses due to heat stress [33]. One possible way to stop\nthis may\
    \ be to use biomarkers in order to constantly monitor pigs and take preventative\
    \ or\npalliative measures, if necessary, to reduce the incidence of dead-on-arrival\
    \ cases. Another\npossibility is to use the data from biomarkers to breed more\
    \ heat-resistant pigs. This is of\nparticular importance given how global warming\
    \ is expected to affect livestock well-being,\nwhich calls for a search for ways\
    \ to adapt [34].\nSimilarly, digital biomarkers may provide a solution in the\
    \ realm of antibiotic-related\nchallenges. Often, farmers are unable to identify\
    \ diseases in livestock before they arise\ndue to limited capacities for phenotype\
    \ observation and analysis. This means that farmers\nare often forced to apply\
    \ antibiotics to livestock, which may have a negative effect on\nsales since consumers\
    \ may be reluctant to consume meat from animals that have received\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2023, 5\n497\nantibiotics. One solution to this would be to use biomarkers in\
    \ order to identify diseases\npreventively and avoid the need to apply antibiotics\
    \ as a curative measure.\nA further example that highlights the potential uses\
    \ of digital biomarkers concerns\nso-called “exploding chickens” or broiler chickens—that\
    \ is, chickens that are raised to reach\ntheir maximum weight as early as possible\
    \ for commercial purposes. Broiler chickens raise\nsigniﬁcant concerns about animal\
    \ welfare. One common issue that affects the well-being of\nthose chickens is\
    \ respiratory problems. Biomarking can help identify such issues in order\nto\
    \ potentially address them since certain respiratory diseases are correlated with\
    \ detectable\nabnormal sounds in broiler chickens [35].\nRelatedly, the use of\
    \ biomarkers for selective breeding can lead to potential conﬂicts\nbetween the\
    \ constant drive to push the boundaries of biological limits and ethical qualms.\n\
    One may see this in the case of broiler chickens. Apart from the problems arising\
    \ from\ntheir living conditions and the physiological consequences of forcing\
    \ chickens to grow so\nquickly, we may identify a certain unease that arises from\
    \ the idea of engineering life in\norder to attain the limits of what is possible\
    \ in terms of productivity. This may lead to\nconcerns that life is being excessively\
    \ commoditized and reduced to a mere asset whose\nproductivity must be maximized\
    \ without any regard for what is natural or for the integrity\nof farm animals.\n\
    Inevitably, this leads to a conundrum that can only be solved through a delicate\n\
    balancing act. Livestock productivity is of paramount importance in order to secure\n\
    consumer demands, guarantee proﬁtability and guarantee global food security [36].\
    \ It is\nno longer possible to raise animals according to traditional methods\
    \ that used to require\nanimals to grow for extensive periods of time before being\
    \ ready for consumption. The\ndemands of productivity must, therefore, be reconciled\
    \ with animal welfare concerns about\nthe implications of the “race to the limit”\
    \ in extracting economic value from livestock. One\npossible solution may be to\
    \ develop a framework that will allow us to determine how\nmuch is too much optimization,\
    \ making sure to leave some room for farm animals to enjoy\nsome minimal levels\
    \ of quality of life and something approaching, to the extent possible, a\ncompletely\
    \ natural life cycle.\n3.16. Ethical Approaches\nThe ethical dimension of DLF\
    \ can be explored by looking at four strategies (Figure 2)\nin understanding the\
    \ impact of DLF and the way that it accounts for animal well-being.\nStrategy\
    \ 1: Sorry. If the animal becomes ill, we cannot help it, and we cannot cure it.\n\
    The only option is for it to be culled. An example is diagnosing a seriously ill\
    \ animal, such\nas a pig, as being antibiotic resistant. Most of the time, the\
    \ animal, or the particular group\nof pigs that it belongs to, is culled, as it\
    \ would not be economical for the farmer to treat\nthem and also to avoid the\
    \ possibility of contagion by other animal units within the farm.\n“Sorry” may\
    \ be considered the least ethical strategy, as it involves the culling of animals\n\
    that are deemed too costly to treat or too contagious to keep alive. While culling\
    \ may be\nnecessary in some cases, it is important to ensure that it is done in\
    \ a humane and respectful\nmanner and that alternatives to culling are explored\
    \ where possible.\nThis solution involves culling animals that cannot be helped\
    \ or cured when they\nbecome ill. While this approach may be necessary in some\
    \ cases, it can raise ethical concerns\nif animals are being culled unnecessarily\
    \ or if the reasons for culling are based purely on\neconomic considerations rather\
    \ than animal welfare. One way to address this issue is\nto improve disease prevention\
    \ measures through the use of digital tools and monitoring\nsystems, such as real-time\
    \ monitoring of animal health and behavior. By identifying and\naddressing potential\
    \ health issues early on, farmers can reduce the need for culling and\nimprove\
    \ overall animal welfare.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n498\n \nbehaviors and needs\
    \ are being respected. \nThe key to addressing ethical problems in digital livestock\
    \ farming is to balance the \nneed for productivity and profitability with the\
    \ need to ensure that animals are being \ntreated humanely and that their welfare\
    \ is being prioritized. By using a combination of \nthese four solutions, and\
    \ carefully considering the potential risks and benefits of each ap-\nproach,\
    \ it is possible to develop more ethical and sustainable practices in digital\
    \ livestock \nfarming. \n \nFigure 2. Roadmap to the digital transformation of\

    \ Four strategies for the exploration of the ethical dimensions of digital \n\
    livestock farming. \n4. Technological Change and Innovation \nAspects of DLF having\
    \ to do with technological change and innovation shall be dis-\ncussed. There\
    \ are currently some interesting novel tools and developments happening \nworldwide\
    \ under the DLF umbrella. However, we are at the tip of the iceberg, or at best,\
    \ \nwe have just started scratching the surface. DLF will be here for at least\
    \ a couple of dec-\nades, with many significant developments still lying ahead\
    \ of us. \n4.1. Market Growth \nGenerally speaking, based on market research analysis,\
    \ we can say that the precision \nagriculture market is projected to reach US$52.3\
    \ billion by 2030 at an annual growth rate \nof 10.67% [37]. This is a large number,\
    \ but it includes both the crop and livestock farming \nsectors. Focusing on livestock,\
    \ veterinary animals and farm animals alone, growth would \nbe around US$19.37\
    \ billion by 2030 [38]. The whole DLF market can be categorized into \nmultiple\
    \ \nsegments \n(animal \nmonitoring \ntechnologies, \nanimal \nbiotechnologies,\
    \ \nFigure 2. Roadmap to the digital transformation of modern livestock farming\
    \ while integrating\nsocial and ethical awareness. Four strategies for the exploration\
    \ of the ethical dimensions of digital\nlivestock farming.\nStrategy 2: Recovery.\
    \ Farmers hope that the animal can recover. Here, we can select\nanimals that\
    \ are able to recover from some condition or disease. “Recovery” is a more\noptimistic\
    \ strategy that focuses on breeding animals that are more resilient to disease\
    \ and\nbetter able to recover from illness. This strategy emphasizes the importance\
    \ of selecting\ndesirable traits and genetics and may involve the use of digital\
    \ phenotyping to identify\nanimals that are better able to recover from certain\
    \ conditions.\nThis solution involves selecting animals that are able to recover\
    \ from certain conditions\nor diseases using digital phenotyping and breeding.\
    \ By selecting desirable traits, such as\ngood heart health or heat resistance,\
    \ farmers can breed healthier animals and reduce the\nrisk of disease or mortality.\
    \ However, this approach can raise concerns about the ethical\nimplications of\
    \ genetic modiﬁcation and selective breeding. It is important to consider the\n\
    potential risks and beneﬁts of these practices and ensure that animals are not\
    \ subjected to\nunnecessary harm or suffering in the process.\nStrategy 3: Resistance.\
    \ This strategy emphasizes the importance of proactive measures\nto prevent illness\
    \ and disease rather than simply reacting to outbreaks as they occur. DLF\ncan\
    \ be used to screen for potential diseases and to monitor animals in real-time,\
    \ allowing\nfarmers to intervene early and prevent the spread of disease.\nThis\
    \ solution involves using inoculations or other forms of protection to prevent\
    \ illness\nin animals, as well as screening and real-time monitoring using digital\
    \ platforms to identify\nand prevent diseases. This approach can be effective\
    \ in reducing disease and mortality\nrates, but it can also raise ethical concerns\
    \ about the use of antibiotics and other treatments\nthat may have negative effects\
    \ on animal health or the environment. It is important to\nbalance the beneﬁts\
    \ of disease prevention with the potential risks and ensure that animals\nare\
    \ not being subjected to unnecessary harm or suffering.\nStrategy 4: Avoidance.\
    \ Here, the farm animal is not concerned with the system. By\nmanipulating the\
    \ environment, disease-causing pathogens are prevented from entering,\nthereby\
    \ protecting the animal. In this way, the animal may be shielded from becoming\n\
    ill, such as by improving hygiene or by sensor technologies that block certain\
    \ factors and\nplayers in the environment. Rather than making the animal ﬁt for\
    \ the environment, by using\ndigital tools, we adapt the environment to the needs\
    \ of the animal. “Avoidance” is a strategy\nthat focuses on adapting the environment\
    \ to meet the needs of the animal. This strategy\nemphasizes the importance of\
    \ providing a healthy and hygienic environment for animals\nAgriEngineering 2023,\
    \ 5\n499\nand may involve the use of sensor technologies to monitor and control\
    \ environmental\nfactors that can affect animal well-being.\nThis solution involves\
    \ manipulating the environment to prevent disease-causing\npathogens from entering,\
    \ using digital tools such as sensor technologies and improved\nhygiene practices.\
    \ This approach can be effective in reducing disease and mortality rates,\nbut\
    \ it can also raise ethical concerns about the impact of these interventions on\
    \ animal\nbehavior and well-being. It is important to ensure that animals are\
    \ not being subjected to\nunnecessary stress or discomfort as a result of these\
    \ interventions and that their natural\nbehaviors and needs are being respected.\n\
    The key to addressing ethical problems in digital livestock farming is to balance\
    \ the\nneed for productivity and proﬁtability with the need to ensure that animals\
    \ are being treated\nhumanely and that their welfare is being prioritized. By\
    \ using a combination of these four\nsolutions, and carefully considering the\
    \ potential risks and beneﬁts of each approach, it is\npossible to develop more\
    \ ethical and sustainable practices in digital livestock farming.\n4. Technological\
    \ Change and Innovation\nAspects of DLF having to do with technological change\
    \ and innovation shall be\ndiscussed. There are currently some interesting novel\
    \ tools and developments happening\nworldwide under the DLF umbrella. However,\
    \ we are at the tip of the iceberg, or at best,\nwe have just started scratching\
    \ the surface. DLF will be here for at least a couple of decades,\nwith many signiﬁcant\
    \ developments still lying ahead of us.\n4.1. Market Growth\nGenerally speaking,\
    \ based on market research analysis, we can say that the precision\nagriculture\
    \ market is projected to reach US $52.3 billion by 2030 at an annual growth rate\
    \ of\n10.67% [37]. This is a large number, but it includes both the crop and livestock\
    \ farming sec-\ntors. Focusing on livestock, veterinary animals and farm animals\
    \ alone, growth would be\naround US $19.37 billion by 2030 [38]. The whole DLF\
    \ market can be categorized into multi-\nple segments (animal monitoring technologies,\
    \ animal biotechnologies, sensors/wearables,\ndata (without the hardware component),\
    \ etc.). We have to look carefully at what context\nthe technologies are being\
    \ applied in while considering these numbers. Obviously, North\nAmerica will be\
    \ the dominant player in the DLF area, followed by Europe, while the core\nand\
    \ seminal R&D work will be led by EU countries.\n4.2. Adoption\nBased on surveys\
    \ done by research groups, we can conﬁdently say that farmers are\nmore than willing,\
    \ and indeed happy, to embrace DLF technologies, as it helps them to cut\ntime\
    \ in farm management and provides convenience, such as remote management and\n\
    predictive capabilities [39]. Nonetheless, there are some reservations in farmers’\
    \ minds.\nOne of the major concerns we hear from them is the narrow proﬁt margins\
    \ and questions\nabout who “owns” the data collected via these tools [40].\nWhen\
    \ mobile phones were introduced 30 years ago, they were very heavy, large\nbrick-like\
    \ objects. People had concerns about their potential to cause job loss, cancer,\
    \ brain\ndamage, and many other issues. And yet, everyone now lives with a mobile\
    \ phone for\nmultiple hours a day. Despite this, not much has resulted in terms\
    \ of disruption regarding\nhealth (generally speaking). The common public has\
    \ adapted, embraced and learned to\nlive with mobile phone technologies. Extrapolating\
    \ on this, we may perhaps conclude\nthat digital livestock farming technology\
    \ will not necessarily lead to bad outcomes down\nthe road.\n4.3. Changes in Worker\
    \ Proﬁles\nWe live in a new world, a digital world. This is a new situation where\
    \ it is not enough\nmerely to regard farmers as laborers who may have extensive\
    \ experience with phenotyping\nand may immediately detect issues affecting livestock,\
    \ together with a pertinent solution.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n500\nRather, we\
    \ must go beyond this paradigm of experience-based competency that may\nbe overly\
    \ reliant on subjectivity. Digitization can introduce a supplemental element of\n\
    objectivity in this respect. This will also reduce the work burden on farmers,\
    \ who will\nproﬁt from the ability of digital technologies and platforms to assist\
    \ in decision-making\nand animal management. If something breaks, the system will\
    \ try to ﬁx it on its own, but\nwith the intervention and approval of the human\
    \ expert or the farmer, creating a dual and\ncomplementary system. This may also\
    \ lead to a new professional class of “digital experts”\nwho may ﬁx things akin\
    \ to how a plumber or electrician may do so when a farmer is not\nable to resolve\
    \ an issue on their own.\nWith respect to more speciﬁc developments in DLF, below\
    \ are a couple of noteworthy\ndevelopments that are inﬂuencing each other:\n4.4.\
    \ Digital Twins\nA digital twin can be deﬁned as “a virtual representation of\
    \ a physical asset enabled\nthrough data and simulators for real-time prediction,\
    \ optimization, monitoring, controlling,\nand improved decision-making” [41].\
    \ In this way, the physical animal may be seen as the\nsource of the data for\
    \ its virtual twin.\nIn the past, farming was entirely based on monitoring physical\
    \ animals, but now\nwe may also use their digital twins as proxies that can be\
    \ used to monitor them without\nphysical contact or direct observation. For example,\
    \ this could replace the need for blood\nsamples, visually measuring and observing\
    \ the animals instead and integrating the sampled\ndata into their virtual twins.\
    \ This represents a gradual shift of balance, in which the “virtual\nanimal” becomes\
    \ increasingly important and inﬂuences the physical animal, as the former\ncan\
    \ be used to make predictions about the latter.\n4.5. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence can automate the development of analytical models via algo-\n\
    rithms that basically “learn” from data. The algorithms are then able to update\
    \ the models\ncontinuously and instantaneously, paving the path for real-time\
    \ predictions. This offer-\ning of real-time modeling and periodical predictions\
    \ makes AI powerful. However, the\nmodels are restricted to forecasting the effects\
    \ of data that is similar to that obtained in the\npast. AI-enabled models tend\
    \ to produce inaccurate results upon extrapolation beyond\nobserved bounds.\n\
    Biased data or missing data in modeling, with or without an AI-based and data-driven\n\
    method, can provide ﬂawed models while exploring the future based only on the\
    \ past. The\nover-dependence on data-driven models for decision-making based on\
    \ past lessons and\npast experiences in modern animal farming is risky and makes\
    \ the model fragile. This can\nbe a major shortcoming during pandemics or other\
    \ major incidents in animal farming. Data-\ndriven models can indeed be worse\
    \ when developing simulations or prediction platforms\nif they are exposed to\
    \ previously unseen events. However, AI algorithms can overcome\nthis hurdle by\
    \ enabling the prediction of situations and incidents that have never occurred\n\
    before by running hypothetical scenarios outside of conventional bounds. This\
    \ can be\ndone via enhanced theory and causal hypotheses about the farming system\
    \ by taking a\nsystematic approach, thoroughly understanding the processes involved,\
    \ and implementing\nhigh-ﬁdelity methodologies.\nGenerative adversarial networks\
    \ and self-learning approaches come in handy to enable\naccurate predictions about\
    \ various states/phases of livestock farming activity, which can\nthen match the\
    \ predicted output by simulated trajectories. Even a huge volume of “outside-\n\
    the-known-parameter” data can be generated via simulation to train the model to\
    \ such an\nextent that it becomes able to provide critical insights regarding\
    \ unknown future events [10].\nTo be able to create sensible predictions, AI-enabled\
    \ simulations have to precisely\nreﬂect the processes involved in the systems\
    \ to which they are being applied. In terms\nof hybrid modeling (consider a gray\
    \ box model), mixing various modeling paradigms\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n501\n\
    is possible via AI approaches, which allows the animal scientist to create a “bouquet”\n\
    (combining multiple ﬂowers from various plants) or a “cocktail” into a powerful\
    \ platform.\nAgent-based simulation models can account for deviations from optimization,\
    \ en-\nvironmental exploitation, or lapses of rationality. The AI models can then\
    \ predict how\nthe system can reconﬁgure itself via “adaptation” in the context\
    \ of animal farming. This\nspeciﬁc capability of AI will allow animal farming\
    \ to stay ahead of human responses and\ninterventions. Methods and technologies\
    \ to build very powerful simulations are available\nalready. The trend now is\
    \ not to rely merely on collecting data from the real world but\nto venture into\
    \ a “metaverse” or “virtual world” and create and develop various “what-\nif scenarios”,\
    \ converting the virtual digital world into trillions of terabytes of data at\
    \ a\nmeager cost.\nResource optimization can be taken to the maximum level via\
    \ digital/smart farming\napproaches. There is a remote possibility of “desire\
    \ discrepancy” due to digitalization,\nwhich may inﬂuence the next generation\
    \ of consumers to refrain from eating artiﬁcially\n“selected” meat in the future.\
    \ For example, it is known that consumers are often reluctant\nto adopt new technology-based\
    \ food, in great measure, on how the technology is pre-\nsented [42]. Due to an\
    \ evolving consciousness caused by digitalization among the Gen Z\nand Gen Alpha\
    \ cohorts, the emphasis on the transparency of meat production would matter\n\
    in making choices about food. However, these are issues that seem eminently addressable\n\
    by ﬁnding approaches to engage productively with consumer attitudes.\n5. Responsible\
    \ Research and Innovation\nResponsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is an approach\
    \ to innovation that seeks\nto integrate ethical, social, and environmental considerations\
    \ [43] into the research and\ninnovation process. It aims to ensure that the development\
    \ and use of new technologies\nalign with the values and needs of society.\nDigital\
    \ livestock farming is an innovative way of managing livestock that uses digital\n\
    technologies such as big data, sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve\
    \ efﬁciency\nand productivity. The use of sensors and big data enables farmers\
    \ to collect and analyze\ndata on various aspects of animal health, behavior,\
    \ and performance, helping them to make\ninformed decisions about the management\
    \ of their animals.\nFarmers’ perceptions play a crucial role [44] in the adoption\
    \ of innovation in agri-\nculture. Policymakers and researchers need to understand\
    \ farmers’ views and concerns\nin order to develop policies and technologies that\
    \ are acceptable and useful to farmers.\nThis requires engaging with farmers and\
    \ involving them in the innovation process. By\nunderstanding farmers’ views and\
    \ involving them in the innovation process, we can ensure\nthat the beneﬁts of\
    \ these technologies are shared equitably and that the livestock industry\nbecomes\
    \ more sustainable and resilient.\nIn a digitally focused era, RRI places emphasis\
    \ on engaging stakeholders such as\nfarmers, animal caretakers, researchers, veterinarians,\
    \ animal scientists and policymakers\nin the design and implementation of research\
    \ activities in a bid to ensure that the Digital\nLivestock Farming technologies\
    \ are ethical, safe, and beneﬁcial to society.\n5.1. Ethics, Law, and Governance\n\
    From an ethical standpoint, digital livestock farming raises issues of animal\
    \ rights and\nwelfare, as well as data privacy and security. From a legal perspective,\
    \ the use of digital\ntools for livestock management is subject to existing legislation,\
    \ as well as new laws such\nas GDPR. Finally, from a governance perspective, there\
    \ is a need to ensure that digital\nlivestock farming is regulated in a way that\
    \ is fair and effective.\n5.2. Digital & Precision Livestock Big Data\nOne of\
    \ the key aspects of digital livestock farming is the generation of large amounts\
    \ of\ndata. This data can be used to gain insights into livestock behavior, health,\
    \ and performance.\nIt can also be used to develop digital & precision livestock\
    \ farming systems, which employ\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n502\ndata-driven decision-making\
    \ to optimize animal husbandry and production. Big data\nrefers to the massive\
    \ amounts of data generated by various sources, including sensors and\nIoT devices.\
    \ The ethical dimensions of digital livestock farming and the use of big data\n\
    include privacy concerns, data ownership, and the potential for unequal access\
    \ to these\ntechnologies. It is important to ensure that the beneﬁts of these\
    \ technologies are shared\nequitably and that farmers have control over the data\
    \ they generate. The use of big data\nin digital & precision livestock farming\
    \ raises important ethical and legal considerations,\nnamely, the protection of\
    \ data privacy, data security, and transparency. Furthermore, there\nis a need\
    \ to ensure that data-driven decision-making is fair and equitable and that any\n\
    decisions made with the use of big data do not discriminate against certain groups.\n\
    In order for digital livestock farming to revolutionize the way farmers raise\
    \ and\nmanage animals and for this to happen responsibly and ethically, it is\
    \ important to consider\nthe ethical, legal and governance challenges associated\
    \ with this type of farming. The use\nof big data in precision livestock farming\
    \ must be carefully regulated.\n5.3. Micro-Innovations\nMicro-innovations refer\
    \ to small improvements or adaptations [45] made to existing\ntechnologies or\
    \ the development of new ones. In the context of digital livestock farming,\n\
    these innovations can include the use of sensors, big data, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) to\noptimize the management of livestock and improve the sustainability\
    \ of animal agriculture.\nThe ethical and social implications of digital livestock\
    \ farming are signiﬁcant and need to\nbe considered in order to ensure the responsible\
    \ and sustainable development of these tech-\nnologies. For example, privacy concerns\
    \ and data ownership issues need to be addressed\nto ensure that farmers retain\
    \ control over the data they generate and that their rights and\ninterests are\
    \ protected.\nResponsible technological innovation is crucial in ensuring that\
    \ the beneﬁts of digital\nlivestock farming are realized while avoiding any unintended\
    \ consequences that might\nnegatively impact the resilience [46] of the livestock\
    \ industry. The role of technology as a\nmediator of resilience-enhancing social\
    \ behavior should not be underestimated, as it can\nhelp animal farmers to adopt\
    \ more sustainable practices and overcome uncertainties and\nchallenges they face.\n\
    Micro-innovations in digital livestock farming have the potential to improve the\n\
    efﬁciency and sustainability of animal agriculture, but it is important to approach\
    \ these\ninnovations responsibly and with consideration for the ethical and social\
    \ implications\ninvolved. By taking a responsible and holistic approach to technological\
    \ innovation, we\ncan ensure that the beneﬁts of these technologies are shared\
    \ equitably and that the livestock\nindustry becomes more resilient and sustainable.\n\
    6. Summary\nThe ethics of digital livestock farming is an emerging ﬁeld that focuses\
    \ on the ethical\nimplications of using digital technologies in animal agriculture.\
    \ As the use of digital\ntechnologies in agriculture continues to grow, there\
    \ are several key areas where future\nresearch in the ethics of digital livestock\
    \ farming is likely to focus:\nAnimal welfare: One of the most important ethical\
    \ considerations in digital livestock\nfarming is the impact of digital technologies\
    \ on animal welfare. Future research is likely\nto focus on developing and implementing\
    \ digital technologies that can improve animal\nwelfare, such as sensors and other\
    \ monitoring devices that can detect signs of distress or\nillness in animals\
    \ and trigger appropriate interventions.\nData privacy and ownership: Another\
    \ key ethical concern in digital livestock farming\nis the collection, storage,\
    \ and use of data generated by digital technologies. Future research\nwill need\
    \ to address issues of data privacy and ownership to ensure that farmers and other\n\
    stakeholders have control over the data generated by these technologies and that\
    \ it is used\nin an ethical and responsible manner.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n\
    503\nEnvironmental sustainability: Digital livestock farming has the potential\
    \ to improve\nthe environmental sustainability of animal agriculture by reducing\
    \ waste, improving efﬁ-\nciency, and decreasing the environmental impact of livestock\
    \ production. Future research\nwill need to explore the environmental beneﬁts\
    \ and costs of different digital technologies\nand their impact on the overall\
    \ sustainability of animal agriculture.\nLabor and social justice: Digital livestock\
    \ farming is likely to have a signiﬁcant impact\non the labor market in agriculture,\
    \ and there are concerns about the impact of these\ntechnologies on farmworkers\
    \ and their communities. Future research will need to address\nissues of labor\
    \ and social justice in the context of digital livestock farming, including the\n\
    potential for automation to displace human workers and the need to ensure fair\
    \ labor\npractices and working conditions.\nEthical governance: Finally, future\
    \ research in the ethics of digital livestock farming\nwill need to address issues\
    \ of ethical governance, including the development of standards\nand guidelines\
    \ for the responsible use of digital technologies in animal agriculture and the\n\
    establishment of regulatory frameworks that can ensure that these technologies\
    \ are used in\nan ethical and responsible manner.\nTo achieve a more ethical approach\
    \ to DLF, there needs to be a shift in the goals and\nvalues of livestock farming,\
    \ moving beyond proﬁt as the sole objective. The use of DLF can\naid in this ethical\
    \ pursuit by providing tools and techniques to improve animal welfare,\nreduce\
    \ environmental impacts, and promote sustainable practices.\nResearch on the ethical\
    \ implications of DLF is a growing ﬁeld, and many organizations\nand researchers\
    \ are actively engaged in studying the impact of DLF on animal welfare,\nenvironmental\
    \ sustainability, and ethical considerations. For example, organizations such\n\
    as the World Wildlife Fund, the Humane Society, and Compassion in World Farming\
    \ are\nactively involved in researching and advocating for ethical practices in\
    \ livestock farming,\nincluding the use of DLF.\nFurthermore, academic research\
    \ in ﬁelds such as animal science, agricultural engineer-\ning, and computer science\
    \ is also exploring the potential beneﬁts and ethical implications of\nDLF. For\
    \ instance, researchers are exploring the use of digital biomarkers to monitor\
    \ animal\nhealth and welfare, the use of precision feeding systems to reduce feed\
    \ waste and improve\nnutrient utilization, and the use of predictive analytics\
    \ to improve herd management and\nreduce environmental impacts.\nAchieving ethical\
    \ DLF requires a multidisciplinary approach involving collaboration\nbetween stakeholders\
    \ such as farmers, researchers, industry organizations, and animal\nwelfare advocates.\
    \ It also requires a commitment to ongoing research and evaluation of the\nimpact\
    \ of DLF on animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and ethical considerations\
    \ to\nensure that technological advancements are used in a responsible and sustainable\
    \ manner.\nThe digital farming revolution is just beginning, and it calls for\
    \ a conscientious civic\nengagement of all the parties involved, including farmers,\
    \ scientists, ethicists, and con-\nsumers. In this way, DLF is a prime example\
    \ of the complex interconnections that make us\nall co-actors in the construction\
    \ of a common future.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\

    Abstract: The continuously increasing number of mobile devices actively being
    used in the world

    amounted to approximately 6.8 billion by 2022. Consequently, this implies a substantial
    increase

    in the amount of personal data collected, transported, processed, and stored.
    The authors of this

    paper designed and implemented an integrated personal health data management system,
    which

    considers data-driven software and hardware sensors, comprehensive data privacy
    techniques, and

    machine-learning-based algorithmic models. It was determined that there are very
    few relevant and

    complete surveys concerning this speciﬁc problem. Therefore, the current scientiﬁc
    research was

    considered, and this paper comprehensively analyzes the importance of deep learning
    techniques

    that are applied to the overall management of data collected by data-driven soft
    sensors. This survey

    considers aspects that are related to demographics, health and body parameters,
    and human activity

    and behaviour pattern detection. Additionally, the relatively complex problem
    of designing and

    implementing data privacy mechanisms, while ensuring efﬁcient data access, is
    also discussed, and

    the relevant metrics are presented. The paper concludes by presenting the most
    important open

    research questions and challenges. The paper provides a comprehensive and thorough
    scientiﬁc

    literature survey, which is useful for any researcher or practitioner in the scope
    of data-driven soft

    sensors and privacy techniques, in relation to the relevant machine-learning-based
    models.

    1. Introduction

    Mobile devices and appliances such as various wearables, handheld smartphones,

    or tablets feature certain sensors that collect a large amount of personal information
    for

    a variety of scenarios and purposes [1,2]. Additionally, the signiﬁcant increase
    of wear-

    ables’ computational capabilities makes them suitable for many real-world uses
    [3,4]. The

    ubiquitous availability of the mobile devices makes them obvious targets for cyberattacks

    designed to illegitimately gain access to personal data and resources [5].

    This survey provides the following contributions to the literature.

    •

    A comprehensive analysis of the personal data collected using mobile background
    sen-

    sors and the related machine-learning- and deep-learning-based automated methods

    that focus on sociological and demographic aspects.

    •

    A presentation of the generally considered applications and real-world use case

    scenarios related to the use of mobile devices.

    •

    An overview of the relevant sensors and the related raw data usually available
    in

    mobile computing environments and mobile devices. This particularly analyzes the

    background sensors, as they are usually perceived as harmless by the average end

    user.

    •

    A presentation of the metrics introduced in the relevant scientiﬁc and technical
    litera-

    ture.

    The scientiﬁc approaches reported in [6,7] describe particular encryption scheme

    models [8] that relate to data privacy [9]. Thus, the acquired data are consolidated
    on

    the client side [10]. The algorithmic models for the sum aggregate and the minimum

    aggregate procedures are implemented using an additive homomorphic encryption
    scheme

    in [11]. It is important to mention that these basic operations accept a set of
    values as

    input and output one value. Furthermore, they designate ﬂexible and computationally

    efﬁcient algorithms [12,13], which are considered in various other contexts that
    imply data

    processing in an aggregated manner. Thus, let us consider the queries that are
    performed

    relative to relational databases, which are structured as tables with rows and
    columns. In

    this case, the data processing is designed to take place on the client devices
    considering the

    vast majority of the existing relevant approaches [14,15]. Nevertheless, the operations
    that

    relate to the homomorphic encryption schemes usually require signiﬁcant computational

    resources [16,17]. The computational models that are reported in the existing
    literature

    are generally unsuitable for conducting arithmetic operations directly over the
    encrypted

    data in the case of large real-world use cases. Papers [18,19] examine the proper
    ofﬂoading

    of data processing routines to the cloud. Furthermore, ref. [20] described a data-privacy-

    preserving model that considers sum aggregation that conducts most of the data
    processing

    operations on the client devices. Moreover, ref. [21] described a homomorphic
    encryption

    model that conducts the sum operation. This is insufﬁcient for most of the real-world
    use

    cases. Therefore, a mechanism that allows for basic arithmetic operations to take
    place

    directly over the encrypted data needs to be designed [22,23]. Such an approach
    is generally

    known as veriﬁable computation [24,25].

    The mechanism of veriﬁable computation was described by Gennaro et al. [12]. It

    allows for data to be ofﬂoaded from mobile client devices through various third-party

    data processing applications. Moreover, the client devices are capable of verifying
    the

    accuracy of the data computation results that they receive [26,27]. The contribution
    that

    was presented in [28] relates to a veriﬁable computational model that considers
    the data

    input relative to a plain text format. Furthermore, ref. [29] proposed a data
    processing

    model that relates to homomorphic data aggregation processes in connection with
    eHealth

    information systems. It is important to note that this algorithmic approach is
    not capable

    of verifying whether the obtained results are correct, which represents a fundamental

    functional requirement of any privacy-preserving data processing approach. Furthermore,

    the article also described a publicly veriﬁable data processing model that relates
    to large

    polynomials and matrices. Consequently, ref. [30] described a veriﬁable delegated
    data

    processing scheme which is based on set structures and operations. Thus, this
    refers to a set

    union, a set intersection, and a set difference. It is important to note that
    these algorithmic

    schemes are compatible with input data that are generated in a plain text format
    [31,32].

    The European Union enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which

    deﬁnes personal data as any information that pertains to an identiﬁed or identiﬁable
    natural

    person [33]. The GDPR also deﬁnes sensitive data as a subset of personal information
    that

    includes the following categories of personal data: personal data that reveal
    racial or ethnic

    origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs; trade union
    membership

    data; genetic data and biometric data which is processed exclusively to identify
    a human

    being; personal health data, and also data that concern aspects related to sex
    life or sexual

    orientation [33]. The automated processing of personal user data, which is also
    designated

    as user proﬁling [33], may easily determine such attributes using data acquired
    from mobile

    devices. This may be determined by the request for irrelevant data access permissions,
    the

    unclear and weak deﬁnition of permission items, and the incorrect use of permissions.
    It

    is relevant to state that this is also determined by the improper aggregation
    of personal

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    3 of 31

    data [34,35]. The prevention of misuse is the objective of several Innovative
    Training

    Networks (ITN), such as PriMa [36] and TReSPAsS [37].

    Thus, the discussion may consider the problem of general privacy protection and
    sensi-

    tive personal data protection [38]. The ultimate goal is to secure personal user
    data through

    a de-identiﬁcation process and consequently prevent re-identiﬁcation [39] of sensitive

    personal identiﬁers [40], such as names, addresses, social security unique identiﬁers
    [41,42],

    etc. Nevertheless, personal data privacy protection is naturally connected to
    the realm of

    cybersecurity [43]. In essence, the goal is to securely modify the data so that
    it cannot be

    read or understood [44,45], while allowing efﬁcient data processing to take place
    in the case

    of legitimate requests [46]. It is also important to consider related discussion
    and research

    topics, such as the study of large databases, which can be assimilated in the
    category of big

    data stores [47].

    This survey considers the signiﬁcant perspectives of the General Data Protection

    Act (GDPR), article 21, which states that the subject shall have the right to
    object, on

    grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing
    of personal

    data concerning him or her.

    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, the methodological principles
    are

    fully described. Then, relevant details concerning proposals for full privacy-preserving

    models are discussed, while an overview of the sensors and the raw data usually
    considered

    in modern mobile devices is provided. Additionally, the most relevant real-world
    use-case

    scenarios are presented, and the problem of personal user data processing is examined.

    Furthermore, the methods that are useful to collect and process data are comprehensively

    analyzed, and the relevant metrics are described. Moreover, the general data privacy

    methods are discussed. The section that follows presents the authors’ analytical
    remarks

    relative to important research aspects and gaps which have been determined during
    this

    comprehensive research process. The last section concludes the paper and discusses
    certain

    problems that were encountered during our research.

    2. Research Methodology

    This survey paper provides a systematic review (SR) research model, which is struc-

    tured using the methodology designated as “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic

    Reviews and Meta-Analysis” (PRISMA) [48]. Thus, the literature review methodology

    considers the following stages: deﬁnition of research questions, research of proper
    scientiﬁc

    contributions, deﬁnition of the proper inclusion and exclusion criteria.

    2.1. Research Questions

    The survey considers the following reference research questions.

    •

    What are the sensors and the raw data commonly available on modern mobile devices,

    paying special attention to background sensors, which are often considered harmless

    by the end users?

    •

    What are the typical related real-world use case scenarios?

    •

    What are the relevant practical purposes of the data that are collected using
    mobile

    sensors?

    •

    What are the speciﬁc features and logical structure of the data, which pertain
    to the

    various analyzed real-world use-case scenarios?

    •

    What are the most frequently used data privacy and anonymization techniques?

    •

    What are the metrics that quantify the level of data anonymization processes?

    The next subsection speciﬁes the logical structure of the effective research process.

    2.2. Research Process

    The following subsection describes the exclusion and inclusion criteria considered
    to

    further ﬁlter less relevant papers in an objective way.

    2.3. Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria

    The relevance of the reviewed papers, and consequently the scientific efficiency

    of this survey paper, is further ensured by several inclusion criteria (IC) and
    exclusion

    criteria (EC). Thus, contributions that do not meet the defined EC are discarded.
    The

    IC-based filtering process follows a logical process, which is structured according
    to the

    following steps.

    •

    Step 1. Abstract-based filtering: irrelevant scientific contributions are ignored

    based on the information that is extracted from the abstract and also considering

    the keywords. Thus, papers that meet at least 50% of the relevance threshold are

    considered further.

    •

    Step 2. Full text-based ﬁltering: papers that address only a small part of the
    scientiﬁc

    scope, which is deﬁned by the abstract and the keywords, are ignored.

    •

    Step 3. Quality analysis-based ﬁltering: the remaining papers are further ﬁltered

    out if any of the following conditions are not satisﬁed: <The paper proposes a
    com-

    prehensive solution regarding the usage of data-driven soft sensors.> AND <The

    paper thoroughly describes the technical implementation of the proposed solution.>

    AND <The paper reviews related similar scientiﬁc contributions.> AND <The paper

    discusses and analyzes the obtained results.>

    Consequently, the reference inclusion criteria are described in Table 2.

    Furthermore, the reference exclusion criteria are presented in Table 3.

    The following sections thoroughly survey the vast scope of scientiﬁc papers, which

    were selected according to the principles of this scientiﬁc survey methodology.

    literature sources.

    Papers with full texts that are impossible to access.

    Papers that are only marginally relevant to the usage of data-driven soft sensors,
    related deep

    learning models, and data anonymization techniques.

    3. Data Acquisition through Mobile Devices and Sensors

    Mobile devices provide a comprehensive set of functional features, which may be
    used

    for the proper processing and collection of related data. As an example, modern
    smart-

    phones are equipped with powerful hardware components, such as multicore processors,

    sophisticated mobile graphical processing units (GPU), several gigabytes of memory,
    and a

    comprehensive set of built-in sensors. Additionally, it is possible to add new
    sensors using

    the wireless and even wired connection features of these mobile devices. The following

    subsection presents relevant contributions, which pertain to the design and implementation

    of full privacy-preserving data channels. Moreover, the possibility to conduct
    arithmetic

    operations directly over the encrypted data is discussed.

    3.1. Remarks Concerning Full Privacy-Preserving Data Computation

    The authors of [16] reported a veriﬁable data processing model that is related
    to

    encrypted input data in connection with mHealth (mobile health) software systems.
    The

    algorithmic scheme that is designated as accumulation tree was reported in [17],
    which

    veriﬁes the results of geographical proximity tests. Furthermore, ref. [18] described
    the

    results that relate to veriﬁable computation use cases, which pertain to encrypted
    input data.

    It is important to mention that most of the existing approaches consider data
    processing at

    the level of the client devices. This approach does not apply to integrated data
    management

    systems which consider personal private data.

    The advantages of cloud-based data storage and processing are obvious [49]. However,

    the design of the proper data security approaches determines a signiﬁcant problem
    that

    generates conceptual issues to the cloud service providers [20,50].

    The implied service providers aim to design and deploy layered security mechanisms.

    Nevertheless, the plain text data may still be accessed and used through proper
    intrusion

    techniques. Consequently, data must be encrypted before transmission to the respective

    external data processing modules. The relevant reviewed papers suggest a signiﬁcant

    computation overhead connected to the mobile client devices [21]. This is especially

    relevant for the personal mobile devices, which collect medical data processed
    by proper

    integrated software systems. There are, however, approaches [22] that do not specify
    proper

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    6 of 31

    data privacy mechanisms [23] when the data are transmitted through the respective
    data

    channels. The proper management of personal health information (PHI) data refers
    to

    ethical principles and formal regulations [24]. Thus, it is necessary to design
    and implement

    integrated data processing systems that consider all the relevant constraints.
    The authors

    of [25] described the general architectures and the life cycles of cloud-based
    data processing

    services.

    Ever since C. Gentry ﬁrst described the concept of homomorphic encryption in 2009
    [6],

    signiﬁcant research has focused on improving [26] this computationally expensive
    data

    processing scheme. Consequently, many relevant real-world use cases pertain to
    the use of

    proper powerful hardware resources [27]. Moreover, the initial homomorphic encryption

    approaches were particularly computationally expensive relative to the respective
    real-

    world use cases [28]. Furthermore, the algorithmic apparatus was improved through

    multiple development phases [29]. Some papers have reported improvements to the

    computational efﬁciency of homomorphic encryption. For example, refs. [30–33]
    expanded

    the initial set of algorithms. The algorithmic model presented in [34,35] and
    also in ref. [36]

    may be used during the design of data processing components that are part of relevant

    integrated data management systems [37]. It is important to note that the comprehensive

    validity evaluation that we conducted [34] proves that even certain improved homomorphic

    encryption approaches are not adequate [51,52] relative to the timely processing
    of the

    collected medical data on the client side [35,53]. Furthermore, it is important
    to note the

    papers [54,55] that are connected to the full scope of ubiquitous systems. Thus,
    ref. [56]

    described a software application deﬁned by two functional requirements. First,
    the system

    is able to conduct the semantic analysis of data that are produced by user interactions,

    which are connected to various contextual parameters that determine usual activities
    of

    daily living (ADL). This has the goal of determining the relevant behavioral patterns

    that deﬁne complex activities. Moreover, the software system is based on an algorithmic

    routine that supports the decision-making processes. Furthermore, a relevant contribution

    is reported in papers [57,58]. Additionally, ref. [59] described a general architecture
    of a

    ubiquitous system that is compatible with general medical use case scenarios and
    data

    storage models, such as the ones that are described in papers [60,61]. Moreover,
    software

    systems deﬁned by interesting architectural models are presented in papers [62,63],
    and

    also [64,65]. It is signiﬁcant to note that the authors of papers [66,67], and
    also [68] propose

    technical solutions that are relevant for the implementation of distributed personal
    data

    processing systems, which use wireless data transfer channels. Furthermore, the
    survey

    effort that is included in [69] created interesting perspectives on related scientiﬁc
    problems.

    Moreover, the authors of [70,71] proposed interesting data transmission models
    relative

    to next-generation radio networks, while [72] described a versatile data communication

    channels management system, which can be used in a variety of real-world use case

    scenarios, including vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET).

    Moreover, it is important to mention the contributions that were described in
    [73,74],

    considering that they presented one of the few existing integrated personal data
    manage-

    ment systems, which fully implements data protection mechanisms considering all
    the

    relevant stages: data collection, transportation, processing, and long-term storage.

    The survey that was conducted suggests the following requirements for any suitable

    integrated personal data management system.

    •

    The collection of personal data is conducted using mobile client devices.

    •

    The data is transferred to central data processing components.

    •

    The data are properly and securely stored, and privacy-preserving data is processed.

    •

    The system should be speciﬁed considering a ﬂexible and decoupled system architec-

    ture which would allow for an efﬁcient extension and re-structuring of the system
    in

    the future.

    •

    The legal and formal requirements that are formalized by American and European

    regulations are also considered.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    7 of 31

    •

    The efﬁcient integration of the system in the target software frameworks considers
    the

    speciﬁcs of the respective use cases, as well as all the technical and legal requirements.

    3.2. Analytical Remarks Concerning Similar Contributions

    The theoretical and practical survey presented in this paper is complemented by
    an

    analytical evaluation of existing data privacy approaches. This is contained in
    the following

    paragraphs.

    Thus, ref. [75] relates to a comprehensive review of similar data privacy mechanisms,

    with a focus on e-Health software systems. Relevant advantages and disadvantages

    of reviewed models are analyzed. The papers were selected considering the similarity

    that was observed in the reviewed literature. The authors also describe the general

    features of a technical standard, which may define an e-Health system. The paper
    also

    includes a taxonomy of cloud-based models, while the relevant personal data privacy
    and

    security requirements enforced by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability

    Act (HIPAA) [76,77] are analyzed. It is important to note that the authors describe
    a

    secure and dependable system architecture, which is compatible with electronic
    health

    scenarios that could guarantee efficiency, reliability, and a properly regulated
    access

    framework to health information. The main drawback of this architecture is its
    inability

    to deploy on distributed and structurally scalable infrastructures. Additionally,
    only

    standard asymmetric encryption models are implemented, which do not provide the

    necessary degree of health data privacy.

    The general scope of cloud-based healthcare computing has modiﬁed real-world

    healthcare in several ways. Cloud infrastructures provide a discernible advantage
    in the

    scalability of service, and the possibility to alter the related computational
    and data storage

    resources. Additionally, other articles examine the implied security and data
    privacy-

    preserving mechanisms. This is an important aspect of the overall research problem,
    as

    it determines important legal and technological aspects that should be evaluated.
    In this

    respect, ref. [78] examines several scientiﬁc approaches that miss at least some
    of the

    necessary technical features. Thus, it is important to mention the end-to-end
    private data

    transmission channels, the mandatory scalability, and the architectural compatibility
    of

    diverse technical platforms and frameworks, which concern the implied client and
    back-end

    (server) components.

    The obvious advances in the ﬁeld of information and communication technology

    naturally relate to an improved economic environment that offers higher-value
    services

    to consumers and businesses. The health sector beneﬁts from this progress. Although
    the

    cloud-based system architectures provide clear advantages, the remaining security
    and

    data privacy issues should still be considered and addressed. Thus, ref. [79]
    presented a

    distributed system that considers various data security levels and data encryption
    models.

    This heterogeneous architectural structure implies administrative, functional,
    and data

    security problems that suggest that the reported approach is not suited for real-time

    deployments of large-scale medical data processing systems.

    The continuous development of Internet of Things (IoT) as a theoretically and
    prac-

    tically relevant paradigm, which has occurred during the past twenty years, implies
    that

    novel personal data management approaches may be developed. Thus, ref. [80] presented

    an important problem, which concerns the fully secure preservation of personal
    data pri-

    vacy. The article proposes an access control mechanism for cloud-based data that
    follows

    a certiﬁcate-based authentication model. The authors describe the methodology
    of the

    approach using the results of experimental evaluation processes. This suggests
    an apparent

    enhancement of the overall system’s security and performance through the optimization

    of the time needed to specify and implement the data and service access permissions.

    Nevertheless, the proposed approach does not offer the necessary scalability or
    end-to-

    end private data transmission channels between the client devices and the back
    end data

    processing components.

    Significant progress has been made in the scope of cloud-based healthcare applica-

    tions in the past ten years, particularly due to the implied remote access features,
    among

    other advantages. It is important to note that the reviewed literature demonstrates
    the

    resistance of certain end users to the adoption of the new technologies, particularly
    in

    developing nations [81]. This article suggests that user experience constitutes
    another

    significant perspective, which should be considered in any research. Moreover,
    personal

    data collection should occur in a seamless manner without any costly modifications
    to

    client mobile devices. In this context, the contribution that is reported in [82]
    proposed a

    rather interesting data analytics framework, which considers regressive machine
    learn-

    ing techniques and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in relation to the field of
    precision

    agriculture.

    Attribute-based encryption (ABE) models represent an interesting use case in health-

    care. Patients encrypt their electronic health record (EHR), assign the attributes,
    and send

    them to the cloud. Healthcare professionals receive the encrypted EHR corresponding

    to their field of expertise from the cloud-based system. Decryption of the EHR
    data

    presumes that the medical personnel receive the secret keys from the key generation

    center (KGC). Thus, the KGC stores the secret keys of all the encrypted EHR records.

    Consequently, it is possible to decrypt the relevant patients’ records, which
    represents

    a security issue. A decentralized ABE scheme addresses this issue, but it implies
    sig-

    nificant computation and communication costs. Furthermore, unauthorized medical

    employees may be able to read the patients’ private EHR data. Additionally, the
    privacy

    of the KGC’s secret keys and the doctor’s attribute privacy determine relevant
    research

    aspects. Thus, ref. [83] presented a cloud-based privacy-preserving e-health (CP2EH)

    scheme, which addresses the issues of unauthorized access to patient records and
    the

    proper management of the doctor’s attribute privacy relative to an ABE scheme.
    The

    presented model includes the oblivious transfer (OT) and zero-knowledge proof
    (ZKP)

    protocols in the centralized ABE scheme. Thus, the OT protocol ensures the privacy
    of

    the secret keys and the doctor’s attribute. Despite the reported advantages, the
    system is

    selective concerning the accepted data acquisition devices. Moreover, it is compatible

    with only certain software frameworks, it does not scale well, and it does not
    implement

    end-to-end secure data transmission channels.

    The authors in [84] presented an attribute-based encryption (ABE) access control
    model.

    This enforces controlled and possibly multi-level access delegation policies.
    Moreover, the

    authors evaluate the possibility of deploying such a system in an e-health environment

    with the goal of safely sharing EHR data of the patients enrolled in the system.
    The authors

    assert that the proposed mechanism is safe from some plaintext attacks and from
    attacks

    based on attribute collusion [1]. Although this appears to be one of the most
    promising

    approaches that we reviewed, it also does not provide end-to-end private medical
    data

    transmission channels. Moreover, it manifests the fundamental architectural and
    functional

    problems, which have already been enumerated.

    The general problem that is approached in this paper also pertains to particularly

    relevant real-world use cases, such as smart grids, which are studied in certain
    interesting

    papers. Thus, ref. [85] intends to present an analysis of research trends that
    pertain to

    smart grids. It describes a next-generation smart grid, which is based on the
    utilization

    of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and 5G data
    networks.

    The paper also comments on the conceptual and practical challenges that this modern

    architecture faces.

    Our thorough literature review proves that although interesting contributions
    are

    described in the literature, most of the existing algorithmic and functional models
    miss some

    of the mandatory technical features. In contrast, he integrated medical data management

    system described in [74] represents one of the few approaches that fulﬁlls all
    of the necessary

    algorithmic and technical constraints.

    4. General Mobile Collection of Sensitive Data

    Mobile devices possess the hardware capabilities needed to facilitate general
    data

    collection and processing. These include powerful multicore central processing
    units

    (CPU), graphical processing units (GPU), and random access memory (RAM) which
    sustain

    powerful and versatile operating systems. The mentioned hardware and software
    features

    support efﬁcient data sensing and collection operations, together with the usual
    smartphone

    core functions.

    Consequently, the built-in mobile sensors are able to collect data considering
    an

    adequate frequency for the data acquisition interval and for the private data
    categories.

    The remarks are applicable to many types of mobile wearable devices, such as smart-

    watches, which can be assimilated to the wider scope of Internet of Things (IoT)
    devices, as

    long as they are connected to the Internet or are linked to devices that are directly
    connected

    to the Internet [86]. These devices are rapidly becoming capable of performing
    complex

    measurements, and even local data analysis processes [87]. In principle, mobile
    device

    manufacturers implement and provide the required mobile applications, which can
    be

    installed on their wearable devices. Nevertheless, although these mobile applications
    are

    adequate for general use case scenarios, specialized applications are required
    to sustain

    speciﬁc real-world scenarios.

    Figure 1 presents the sensors and raw data types used in mobile devices. The sensors

    can be grouped in two categories depending on whether the output signal is generated

    using hardware or software. The hardware sensors translate physical measurements

    into electrical signals that are converted to a digital format to be processed.
    The software

    sensors use the data previously generated by the hardware sensors to perform the
    necessary

    computations.

    Motion sensors are designed to measure both the rotational and acceleration forces

    over the three axes of the related device. Thus, the hardware motion sensors keep
    track

    of the angular velocity and acceleration, and the software sensors may produce
    an output

    according to either a continuous or an event-driven pattern. Moreover, the position
    sensors

    imply the measurement of changes in the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld related to the actual

    physical orientation, while environmental sensors are typically activated by an
    event and

    return a value measurement in the form of one scalar. These sensors may be conﬁgured
    to

    return continuous measurements, which may attain a frequency of approximately
    200 Hz,

    while their power consumption is still kept at a low level [75].

    Certain measurements that discern biological and physiological parameters are
    sup-

    ported on particular mobile devices due to specialized health sensors. As an example,
    many

    mobile devices, including smartwatches, feature optical sensors used to detect
    the changes

    in the volume of the blood ﬂowing through the arteries. Consequently, physiological
    heart

    parameters are evaluated. Additionally, studies that pertain to other health problems,
    such

    as sleep disorders in the scope of polysomnography, also use sensors [88,89].

    Data generated by user interaction with a touchscreen can be quantiﬁed by the
    number

    of “keystrokes” [90] or by analyzing the touch data generated by the user [91].
    Considering

    the former situation, the virtual keystrokes are recorded, and the timestamp and
    pressure

    data are also logged for each keystroke. The acquired data allow analysts to discern
    even

    more complex features, such as the time between keystrokes, the time allocated
    for touch

    and hold operations, and so on [92]. Supplementary to the actual keystrokes, modern

    touchscreen panels signiﬁcantly expanded the user interaction area, which includes
    the

    screen zones that are sensitive to user touch operations. Thus, it is possible
    to precisely

    determine the location of the touch points using a coordinate system relative
    to the X and Y

    coordinates of the screen. Additionally, all of the other usual gestures, such
    as pinch, tap,

    swipe, multitouch, and more advanced user interaction parameters, such as angle,
    velocity,

    trajectory, and acceleration, can be extracted [93].

    Figure 1. Sensors and raw data speciﬁc to modern mobile devices.

    Data connections represent a basic but fundamental aspect of mobile devices that

    imply the implementation and full or partial compatibility with a vast set of
    network

    protocols. The networked data connections generate private data patterns concerning
    the

    user’s daily patterns. Consequently, they can support the proﬁling of human behaviour

    and the acquisition of related sensitive personal data. Considering that the 5G
    radio

    standard is currently during its early stages of commercial deployment and that
    the 6G

    radio standard is under development, it can be asserted that the improved data
    transfer

    rates and the signiﬁcantly lower latency values will expand the functional capabilities
    of

    machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. This should essentially increase the
    research

    and commercial relevance of mobile devices [94].

    5. Real-World Sensors Use Case Scenarios

    The two mainstream mobile operating systems, Android and iOS, initially offered

    less than 500 applications for download in their application stores. Currently,
    Google Play,

    which represents the Android applications store, includes over 3.5 million applications,

    while Apple’s App Store offers approximately 2.2 million applications. It is also
    interesting

    to note that Amazon App store contains approximately 500,000 applications [95].
    The

    extensive range of applications cover various use case scenarios, the most relevant
    of which

    are discussed in the following paragraphs.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    5.1. User Authentication Systems

    Considering the mainstream user authentication systems, legitimate users are required

    to provide a secret token, such as a password or a personal identiﬁcation number
    (PIN) code.

    This authentication model is commonly known as “what you know”. Moreover, there
    are

    authentication systems based on certain physical items, such as public key infrastructure

    (PKI) cards, which are known as “what you have”. Additionally, other authentication

    systems consider users’ physical features, such as ﬁngerprints or geometry of
    the eyes, to

    perform the authentication. This is known as the “what you are” paradigm [96].

    Biometrics are common and fundamental instruments of mobile authentication sys-

    tems. The biometrics may belong to both physiological and behavioral categories
    [97].

    As an example, we may speak about entry point ﬁngerprints, or face-based identiﬁca-

    tion. Nevertheless, using such authentication models implies that the device remains

    unlocked and accessible, and any unauthorized access is possible. This shortcoming
    may

    be averted through continuous authentication schemes relative to mobile devices,
    which

    use behavioral biometric authentication mechanisms [98]. Thus, the biometric data
    are

    continuously collected through a passive model during normal use of the mobile
    device,

    which ensures that the user’s physical features correspond to those of the legitimate
    owner.

    Nevertheless, several logical or environmental features, such as scenarios, modalities,
    or en-

    vironmental traits, may adversely inﬂuence the accuracy of mobile biometric systems
    [99].

    Thus, the literature reports hybrid solutions, which combine background sensors
    [100,101],

    touchscreen devices [102], and network information [103]. This supports the development

    of higher-accuracy continuous authentication systems, which are based on behavioural

    biometric mechanisms.

    5.2. Fitness and Healthcare Systems and Services

    Mobile applications and devices play an important role in the healthcare sector.
    Thus,

    “mHealth” (mobile health) is a concept referring to a subset of eHealth that encompasses

    medical and public health procedures supported by mobile devices. Mobile applications

    support the general healthcare processes. Thus, patients may avail themselves
    of improved

    and more efﬁcient services regarding acute and chronic conditions [104].

    Mobile applications can represent real-world use cases, which are capable of analyz-

    ing body postures and generating reports concerning mental disorders [105]. They
    may

    also monitor medical conditions, such as Parkinson disease, stress, dementia,
    among oth-

    ers [106,107]. Furthermore, mobile health applications may support the improvement
    of

    a healthy lifestyle. Thus, a variety of mobile devices, such as mobile phones
    and smart-

    watches, are used to track the intensity of the measured physical activity, including
    all the

    relevant physiological parameters [108–110].

    Additionally, existing scientiﬁc studies report integrated mHealth and eHealth
    soft-

    ware systems that support the collection of personal health data using mobile
    and wearable

    devices, the processing of the data components, the format of the encrypted data
    to conduct

    arithmetic operations, and secure-long term personal health data storage. This
    type of full

    privacy preserving approach, which relates to homomorphic encryption and virtualized

    5G data channels, was described in [73,74].

    5.3. Services Based on Location Data

    Mobile devices fetch geolocation data using several sources, including the Global

    Positioning System (GPS) hardware devices. These data are used by mobile applications

    to determine the geographical position of the users for a variety of purposes,
    such as

    navigation hints data or targeted advertising [111]. The applications that consider
    geolo-

    cation data (location-aware applications) belong to the realm of the context awareness

    paradigm [112]. Moreover, radio protocols used to transmit data short distances,
    such as

    Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) and Bluetooth, allow the mobile devices to exchange
    data with

    neighbouring devices and consequently use them for their purposes. This approach
    may

    be used to specify a semantic context, which is determined by the immediate environment.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    12 of 31

    As an example, the contribution that is reported in [113] described the speciﬁcation
    and

    implementation of virtual tours in museums, which would provide relevant information

    to the visitors based on the neighbourhood of the visitors’ actual position in
    the museum.

    Furthermore, interesting relevant aspects may also be studied in [114].

    5.4. Remarks Concerning Other Relevant Use Cases

    Considering the mainstream use cases, background sensors improve the end users’

    experience in various ways. As an example, the determination of a mobile device’s
    position

    is facilitated by the background sensors, which implement the automatic change
    of the

    screen orientation. Obviously, data generated by the light sensors support the
    automatic

    adjustment of the screen brightness. Moreover, the proximity sensor manages the
    screen

    lock or unlock states in different situations, for example when placing a phone
    call. Another

    interesting use case is represented by the augmented reality (AR) applications
    in ﬁelds such

    as entertainment, commerce, and navigation [115]. The AR applications rely essentially
    on

    the data generated by the background sensors.

    The ubiquity of modern mobile devices allows for more complex but useful real-world

    use case scenarios, such as mobile participatory sensing [116]. Thus, particular
    users

    voluntarily agree to share their devices to collect data that are relevant for
    the analysis

    of various aspects of the implied reality. This mediates the collection of relevant
    data,

    which are consequently used to assess, measure, and map various phenomena through

    a crowd-sourced participatory manner [111]. These use case scenarios include,
    among

    others, monitoring urban noise and pollution levels, monitoring urban cleanliness
    levels,

    and monitoring urban road and trafﬁc conditions [117].

    6. Proper Management of Sensitive Private Data

    The automated management of data collected through mobile device use involves

    interaction with an appreciable amount of sensitive private data. It is important
    to note that

    some mobile sensors, such as GPS hardware components, microphones, and cameras,
    are

    especially difﬁcult to tamper with, as they require special access permissions.
    Nevertheless,

    other mobile sensors, devices, or resources, such as the touchscreen, accelerometer,
    and

    networking data logs, require a lower level of access permission. Additionally,
    these data

    may be used to create a backdoor to sensitive personal data, considering that
    they can be

    sufﬁcient to re-identify a particular individual through attributes, such as personal
    health

    data, particulars of daily routines, or demographic data.

    The intimate nature of sensitive personal data requires the design and implementation

    of particular secure data management mechanisms. The most deﬁning trait of this
    type

    of data relates to its uniqueness relative to the respective individuals. This
    is particularly

    relevant in relation to biometric data. Considering the wider scope of biometrics
    research,

    the main research and development challenges are represented by the mechanisms
    for

    storing personal data, the administrator or owner of the implied software and
    hardware

    data processing system, and the biometric features used to perform the authentication.

    Furthermore, the type and time reliability of the considered biometric features
    also represent

    a relevant question [118]. The next subsections discuss on the most relevant types
    of

    sensitive personal data that can be generated by the mobile devices’ sensors.

    6.1. Demographic Data

    Arguably, the most prevalent type of sensitive personal data is demographics,
    which

    includes attributes such as ethnicity, age, or gender.

    6.1.1. Sensors That Detect Movement

    The authors in [119] considered the determination of a user’s age range using
    data

    generated by an accelerometer. This was achieved during an experiment that involved

    performing a preset series of taps on a touchscreen relative to several contact
    spots. The

    experiment used the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm, which produces an accuracy

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    13 of 31

    of 85.3%. Moreover, the authors of [120] reported an algorithmic mode that discriminates

    an adult from a child through behavioural particularities captured by the mobile
    motion

    sensors. The main hypothesis states that children, who have smaller hands, are
    shakier.

    The algorithmic model produced an accuracy of 96% through the random forest (RF)

    approach. The scientiﬁc contribution reported in [121], obtained the gender of
    the end

    users by analyzing their their walking routines data, which were collected by
    mobile

    motion sensors. The proposed model produced an accuracy of 76.8% using support
    vector

    machines (SVMs), and bagging algorithms. Moreover, the authors of [122] described
    an

    approach for recognition of gender data using gait (walking) data, which were
    collected by

    the mobile sensors. The reported accuracy was 96.3%, and the process used the
    bagged

    tree classiﬁer.

    The authors of [123] reported an automatic gender recognition algorithm, which
    uses

    the data collected by a gyroscope and accelerometer. The generated accuracy was
    80%

    using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique. Moreover, the authors
    of [124]

    determined gender and age data using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Thus, the authors

    set up a competition which compared data collected by an accelerometer with gyroscope

    data using the respective mobile devices. The reported error percentage was 24.23%
    relative

    to the gender and 5.39% relative to age. The notable progress in the ﬁeld of deep
    learning

    enhanced the results, as was the case with the ﬁndings described in [125]. Thus,
    the

    authors mentioned an accuracy of 94.11%, which was obtained through the analysis
    of

    gait (walking) data as it related to gender classiﬁcation. The authors used long
    short-term

    memory (LSTM) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are suitable for capturing

    the temporal dependencies that deﬁned by the analyzed data.

    6.1.2. Touchscreen Data

    In [126], the authors categorized end users in two categories, adults and children,

    based on the mechanics of tap and swipe gestures. The authors describes an active
    user

    detection (AUD) algorithm, which generates an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, ref.
    [2]

    presented a database that stores childrens’ mobile interaction data. The considered
    touch

    interaction data allowed the children to be assigned to three categories, which
    included ages

    from 18 months to 8 years. The described model was based on the support vector
    machine

    (SVM) technique and yielded an accuracy of 90.45%. Furthermore, the authors of
    [120]

    reported a study based on the random forest (RF) technique, which used the tap
    gesture

    data to distinguish between adults and children. The model functions with an accuracy
    of

    99%. Other papers report on using touchscreen data to determine an individual’s
    gender.

    The study reported in [127] considered the prediction of soft biometrics data
    generated

    by swipe gestures. The measured accuracy was 78%, which was based on a decision

    voting scheme determined by four distinct classiﬁers: decision tree (DT), naive
    Bayes

    (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The authors
    of [128]

    collected behavioral data using mobile devices’ accelerometers, gyroscopes, and
    orientation

    sensors, which were activated during the end users’ interactions with their mobile
    devices.

    The gesture data, which determine the gender of the user, were processed using
    a k-NN

    classiﬁer with an accuracy of 93.65%.

    6.1.3. Sensor Data Related to Mobile Applications, Location, and Network

    Research has proven a correlation between geolocation data and the end users’
    de-

    mographics and usage patterns. As an example, in [129], the researchers stressed
    the

    signiﬁcance of data generated by mobile devices in the context of demographic
    model-

    ing and data measurement, while circumventing the need for traditional censuses
    and

    sociological research. This approach signiﬁcantly speeds up the related political
    decisions.

    Furthermore, the authors of [130] considered radius, eccentricity, and entropy
    as three

    parameters that deﬁne travel behavior. More precisely, the authors attempted to
    explain

    the correlation between mobile device use and personal travel behaviour, which
    further

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    14 of 31

    analyzes the correlation between the frequency of the phone calls, and certain
    demographic

    factors, such as age, gender, and the deﬁning features of the environment.

    Moreover, ref. [131] described an unsupervised, data-driven model designed to
    create

    user categories that consider high-resolution mobility data, which are acquired
    through

    mobile navigation applications. The contribution reported in [132] described a
    method for

    the inference of demographic information using social networks photos, which include

    geographic tagging data. More precisely, this shows how an individual’s ethnic
    characteris-

    tics can be obtained from collected geolocation data related to two particular
    metropolitan

    zones. The described model determines three ethnic groups, and the accuracy was
    reported

    as 72% using logistic regression (LR).

    The scientiﬁc contribution reported in [133] discussed the suitability of geolocation

    data in inferring information regarding marital status and actual residence. The
    described

    research process considered the determination of spatial and temporal features
    using hu-

    man mobility patterns, together with other features related to the geographical
    context.

    This approach offers information concerning the places visited by the individuals
    under

    analysis, such as private homes, hospitals, or leisure facilities. The obtained
    accuracy was

    80% based on an eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm [134]. The scientiﬁc
    pre-

    sentation in [135] started with an analysis of gender-related behavioral patterns
    determined

    by mobile applications, which are related to the use of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The
    authors

    reported on the possibility to predict the gender of the end users and showed
    an accuracy

    of 91.8%. The algorithm used random forest (RF) and multinomial naive Bayes (NB).
    The

    data were collected from network connection logs, and the events were sorted according
    to

    occurrence frequency. An assessment of the temporal patterns was conducted relative
    to

    the 1000 events that occurred with the highest frequency. This type of contextual
    behavioral

    information is particularly useful in various domains, such as advertisement customization

    and the personalization of home screens.

    6.2. Remarks Concerning the Study of Human Behaviour

    The literature proves that the general patterns of users’ daily activities and
    behavioural

    traits can be inferred from the data collected by mobile sensors [136]. This generates
    obvious

    problems regarding the privacy of the collected personal data, which should be
    properly

    addressed by academic and industrial research projects.

    6.2.1. Motion Sensors

    The authors of [137] described a system that is able to assess an individual’s
    spatial

    mobility status. Thus, it can evaluate whether the person is stationary, walking,
    running,

    riding a bicycle, climbing stairs, going downstairs, or driving using only the
    accelerometer

    information. Their algorithmic approach, which is based on a support vector machine

    (SVM) technique, functions with an accuracy of up to 93.2%. Furthermore, the authors

    of [108] used mobile gyroscope and accelerometer data and developed an application
    used

    to track the user’s daily routines. Their model is based on a decision tree (DT)
    classiﬁer,

    and the average area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve
    was

    over 99.0%.

    The authors in [138] considered users’ mobility while they were eating, as they
    are

    detected by the accelerometer sensor installed on smartwatches. The authors of
    [139]

    performed a classiﬁcation of human drinking behavior. This took into account the
    data

    acquired by the accelerometer sensors of the mobile phones young adults used during

    nightlife activities. The accuracy of 76.1% was based on a density-based spatial
    clustering

    of applications (DBSCAN) algorithm. The respective approach also assessed the
    amount of

    ingested alcohol.

    The assessment of user mood and physical state (sober, tipsy, or drunk) was conducted

    using the approach reported in [140] using accelerometer data. It also included
    a channel

    for users to report their own behaviour. Naturally, this was an auxiliary feature,
    which

    may not be regarded as an objective source of data. The algorithmic core was based
    on the

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    15 of 31

    random forest (RF) model, with an accuracy of 70%. Furthermore, mobile motion
    sensors

    were also used to collect data related to sleep, such as sleep habits and postures.
    The

    contribution that was reported in [141] uses accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation
    data,

    which are retrieved using a smartwatch to detect and assess sleep postures (supine,
    left

    lateral, right lateral, prone). The reported algorithmic model produced an accuracy
    beyond

    95%, which considered Euclidean distances. The described approach also evaluated
    the

    position of the users’ hand considering the following three states: placed on
    the abdomen,

    chest, or head. The described model used a k-NN algorithm, with an accuracy greater

    than 88%.

    6.2.2. Sensor Data Related to Mobile Applications, Location, and Network

    The authors of [142] used GPS data to assess whether the user was standing, walking,

    or using other means of transportation. The algorithm used a fuzzy classiﬁer,
    which

    calculated the speed and angle of the person relative to the ground. The measured
    accuracy

    was 96% considering the data, which were collected at ﬁve-second intervals. Additionally,

    it is also important to note that radio receivers and transmitters, by their nature,
    are also

    capable of providing information about users’ behavioural patterns. This is also
    susceptible

    to generating sensible personal data security issues, which should be addressed.
    Thus,

    ref. [143] used the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to determine user
    activity

    types. These were selected from the following set of states: lying down, falling,
    walking,

    running, sitting down, and standing up. The algorithmic model used a convolutional

    neural network (CNN), and the accuracy rate was 97.7%. The authors of [144] used
    three

    neural networks relative to the channel state information (CSI), which was measured
    by

    the Wi-Fi module. This technique can allegedly determine whether an individual
    is sitting,

    standing, or walking with an accuracy rate of 83%.

    6.3. Remarks Regarding Body Features and Health Parameters

    6.3.1. Motion Sensors

    The body mass index (BMI) is a mathematical ratio that correlates the body mass
    and

    height of any person. The classic modality to compute this index is providing
    weight and

    height using the formula to calculate BMI. Human gait or style of walking is sustained
    by the

    synergistic cooperation established between hundreds of muscles and joints. Consequently,

    mobile motion sensors are capable of discerning various muscle movements, which
    are

    transformed into speciﬁc patterns for the traits of the individuals, such as BMI.
    Thus, the

    authors of [145] proposed a hybrid model based on a convolutional neural network
    and

    long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) architecture. This is able to estimate BMI using
    the

    data generated by the accelerometer and the gyroscope, and the maximum determined

    accuracy is 94.8%. Considering BMI as a reference, several other health attributes
    may be

    determined [146,147]. It is interesting to note that another physiological variable
    that can be

    evaluated using accelerometer data is the level of stress. Thus, the authors of
    [148] reported

    an accuracy of 71% using the mentioned techniques and also the naive Bayes algorithm.

    6.3.2. Remarks Concerning the Touchscreen

    Data generated by mobile sensors may be used to assess, even to diagnose, certain

    medical conditions. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a person suffers
    from Parkin-

    son’s disease through the analysis of the respective users’ keystroke writing
    pattern, which

    is totally independent from the actual content of the text. The authors in [149]
    considered

    an SVM algorithm, which determines an area under the receiver operating characteris-

    tic (AUROC) of 0.88 relative to this particular problem. Furthermore, ref. [150]
    assessed

    several types of features, which are speciﬁed relative to various handwriting
    patterns.

    These are used as biometrics to study Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, in [151],
    the authors

    demonstrated that people with longer thumbs require less time to conduct swipe
    gestures.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    16 of 31

    6.3.3. Sensors Data Related to Mobile Applications, Location, and Network

    The authors of [152] described an application that detects periods of psychological

    depression using geolocation patterns, which are retrieved from the mobile devices
    of

    individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). The model uses a linear regression algorithm,

    together with a quadratic discriminant analysis algorithm. The method produced
    an

    accuracy of 85%. GPS data may also be used to detect various sleep disorders,
    such as

    sleep–wake stages and sleep-disordered breathing disorders (SRBD), such as obstructive

    sleep apnea (OSA). The model uses SVM algorithms and demonstrated accuracy of
    up to

    92.3% [153,154]. StayActive3 is an application that detects stress by analyzing
    the behavior

    of users via smartphone, using the data from the Wi-Fi, step counter, location,
    and battery

    level, among others. It is also worth mentioning the software system, which is
    referred to

    as StayActive [155]. The authors used a combination of simple relaxation scores
    that relate

    to the information acquired from the sleeping patterns of enrolled users. This
    analysis

    measures the longest time intervals during which the enrolled end users did not
    touch the

    screen, the patterns of their social interaction, and physical activity to evaluate
    the level of

    the stress.

    6.4. The Detection of Psychological Mood and Emotions

    End users’ daily activities are dependent on their psychological mood. Consequently,

    valuable related data may be collected by various sensors.

    6.4.1. Motion Sensors

    The authors of [156] researched the inﬂuence that mood may have on the recognition

    accuracy rate of mobile biometric systems. Thus, by using an RF classiﬁer, the
    authors

    discovered users with face recognition accuracy less than 70% exhibited the fewest
    psy-

    chological mood changes. The accelerometer provides useful data concerning users’
    walk

    patterns, which can be used to assess psychological mood relative to the following
    three

    states: happy, sad, or neutral. It is worth noting that the authors of [157] assessed
    mood

    using an RF algorithm, which produced a mean AUROC of 81%.

    6.4.2. Touchscreen Data

    Many studies demonstrate a correlation between users’ interaction patterns with
    the

    screens of their mobile devices and their psychological mood. Thus, the authors
    of [158]

    researched the development of psychiatric diseases using an unobtrusive setup
    deployed in

    the patients’ personal environment. The process explored the connection between
    bipolar

    affective disorder syndrome and the use of mobile devices. Considering the data
    generated

    by keystroke metadata and the accelerometer sensor, they obtained a detection
    accuracy

    of 90.31% relative to the proper detection of psychiatric conditions. The ﬁndings
    reported

    in [159] described a preventive medical treatment recommendation system, which
    may

    be useful to prevent the actual onset of clinical depression. Thus, the authors
    presented a

    mobile application, which was used to acquire the users’ psychological states
    through the

    analysis of data provided by the call logs and the applications’ usage history.
    The model

    produced an accuracy score of 86%.

    The analysis of ﬁnger strokes patterns during games [160] can help distinguish
    be-

    tween four emotional states: excited, relaxed, frustrated, and bored. The SVM
    algorithm

    produced an accuracy score of 69%. Moreover, the ﬁndings reported in [161] analyzed
    the

    pattern of ﬁnger strokes as an indication of the end user’s psychological state,
    which can

    be classiﬁed as on e of three possible values: positive, negative, or neutral.
    The detection

    performed with an accuracy of 90.47% relative to a linear regression model.

    6.4.3. Sensors Data Related to Mobile Applications, Location, and Network

    MoodExplorer is an application that collects data using various mobile sensors,
    such

    as GPS, accelerometer, and Wi-Fi components [162]. The authors inferred the correlation

    established between psychological states, which were reported by the end users
    themselves,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    17 of 31

    and the usage patterns of the respective mobile devices. The reported approach
    determines

    ﬁve types of emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear. The algorithmic

    model is called Graph Factor. The performance was evaluated using a metric designated
    as

    “match”, which featured an average value of 62.9%.

    6.5. User Tracking through Location Data

    Although mobile devices often feature dedicated GPS location devices, it is possible
    to

    determine geographic location using the data generated by other mobile sensors.

    6.5.1. Motion Sensors

    Certain scientiﬁc articles demonstrate that the geographic location of a person
    can

    be determined using data generated by several mobile sensors, such as accelerometer,

    gyroscope, and magnetometer, during the person’s daily routines that involve using
    public

    transport, walking, or driving. The authors of [163] comparatively analyzed pre-deﬁned

    routes, which were used by the end users relative to different means of transportation,
    such

    as walking, train, bus, or taxi. They compared the routes using a dynamic time
    warping

    (DTW) algorithm, which generated a Kullback–Leibler distance of 0.00057 relative
    to a

    taxi trip.

    The authors in [164] described a modality that uses accelerometer data to track
    the

    end users’ underground routes. The generated accuracy was 92% considering six
    visited

    underground stations, which were based on boosted naive Bayes (NB), and decision
    tree

    (DT) algorithms. The authors of [165] proposed an algorithmic model that determines

    the geographic location of vehicle drivers using the data generated by mobile
    motion

    sensors. The described approach considers an approximation of the related trajectory
    using

    accelerometer data. The map coordinates are correlated with the approximated trajectory

    to generate precise geographic location data. The approach that is presented allows
    for the

    end user to be located with a maximum error of 200 m. The distance is calculated
    as the

    radius between the center of the circle, which represents the actual person’s
    location, and

    the approximated geographical location.

    6.5.2. Sensor Data Related to Mobile Applications, Location, and Network

    The end users’ geographic location may also be determined using the data that
    identify

    encountered Wi-Fi networks. Thus, the authors of [166] described the indoor determination

    of the end users’ location in a real-time fashion. The geographical location determination

    was conducted with an accuracy of 85.7% through the utilization of a random forest

    (RF) algorithm.

    6.6. Logging Keystroke Data and Text Inference Using Motion Sensors

    Touchlogger [167] is an application that aims to detect the precise zone of the
    screen

    that is touched. The process considers the device’s micromovements as they are
    detected by

    the mobile gyroscope and accelerometer. The proposed approach considers a division
    of the

    screen into ten zones, which are analyzed using a probability density function
    relative to a

    Gaussian distribution. The application has shown an accuracy of 70%. It is also
    possible to

    determine the text that the end user generates based on the screen zones that
    are touched.

    Furthermore, ref. [168] a related system has an accuracy rate of 93%, by utilizing

    a hierarchical classiﬁcation scheme. Additionally, ref. [169] describes a controlled
    envi-

    ronment, which is used to detect various text patterns that are entered using
    the mobile

    devices’ touchscreen. Thus, the PIN code was correctly identiﬁed in 43% of the
    cases, while

    the unlock pattern was correctly detected in 73% of the cases. The algorithmic
    core is

    based on a hybrid model, which considers logistic regression (LR), and hidden
    markov

    models (HMM).

    7. Metrics Related to the Privacy of Personal Sensitive Data

    The general class of privacy and data de-identiﬁcation methods essentially modify

    or remove original personal sensitive data. As an example, the practical usefulness
    of this

    data should be maintained by preserving the personal attributes, which do not
    offer any

    indication about the identity of the related individuals. As an example, the gender
    may be

    preserved, while names, surnames, or social security numbers should be removed
    or de-

    identiﬁed through various anonymization techniques [170]. There are numerous domains

    that require the design and implementation of proper anonymization techniques
    [47]. The

    suitability and practical efﬁciency of these data anonymization models are quantiﬁed
    using

    certain metrics, which are presented in the following subsections.

    7.1. General Considerations

    Sensitive personal data protection models are assessed by measuring the degree
    of data

    protection obtained and the remaining data utility after anonymization or de-identiﬁcation

    procedures are applied. The former measurement is conducted using speciﬁc data
    privacy

    metrics, while the latter task is accomplished considering the quantitative decrease
    of

    classic metrics, such as accuracy or equal error rate (EER) [171].

    Sensitive personal data collected using mobile sensors can be grouped in two funda-

    mental categories. One is represented by structured data, such as high-level health
    data,

    networking data, geographical location data, and data generated by mobile applications.

    The other is unstructured data, which includes physical position data, environmental
    data,

    or low-level health data. Therefore, several metrics are necessary to properly
    evaluate

    the de-identiﬁcation process relative to the particular real-world use case or
    problem do-

    main. The following subsections present relevant aspects concerning proper data
    privacy

    assurance processes.

    This paper examines the classiﬁcation of privacy metrics considering the features
    of

    the determined output. More precisely, it is important to observe the features
    of processed

    data in relation to the respective metrics. It is also important to note that
    there is no

    universal metric that can be applied to all features. Therefore, several reported
    scientiﬁc

    studies deﬁne and use their own metrics. The following paragraphs examine the
    properties

    measured as the main classiﬁcation criterion in some studies. According to this
    criterion,

    some of the most important privacy metrics in mobile devices can be grouped in
    the

    categories described in the following paragraphs [172].

    7.1.1. Metrics That Relate to Data Anonymity

    Some of the related metrics originate into the basic model of k-anonymity [173].
    This

    is deﬁned as the impossibility to identify a certain individual from another k−1
    individual,

    provided that the relevant information is released. Sensitive private data are
    grouped into

    equivalence classes that include at least k individuals, which cannot be distinguished
    from

    their sensitive personal attributes. It is important to note that k-anonymity
    is independent

    of the particular technique used for the extraction of personal data. This is
    also useful

    to quantify the degree of similarity between the original and the de-identiﬁed
    datasets.

    Nevertheless, k-anonymity has some limitations, which have led to the development
    of

    new metrics based on the original anonymization model. The new metrics are aimed
    at

    overcoming some of k-anonymity’s issues by imposing additional requirements.

    Thus, m-invariance [174] customizes k-anonymity to allow the processing of multiple

    versions of the same dataset. Moreover, (α, k)-Anonymity [175] speciﬁes a threshold
    for the

    maximum occurrence frequency relative to the sensitive attributes that are part
    of a class to

    prevent the disclosure of essential attribute data. Furthermore, L-diversity [176]
    is designed

    to block linkage attacks by specifying the minimum diversity inside an equivalence
    class.

    For a malformed set of sensitive attributes, t-closeness [177] and stochastic
    t-closeness [178]

    are described They consider the principle that the distribution of private values
    that belong

    to an equivalence class must be as similar as possible to the values’ distribution
    at the

    scale of the entire dataset. Furthermore, the characteristics of the original
    distribution

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    19 of 31

    are required to compute this metric. Moreover, considering the initial distribution
    of the

    data, the (c, t)-isolation [179] refers to the number of data samples, which exist
    near a data

    sample that is inferred from the de-identiﬁed data. It is relevant to mention
    another data

    anonymization model, (k, e)-anonymity [180], which concerns the semantic of the
    distance

    that exists between private user data items. This requires the data range of private
    data

    attributes that belong to any equivalence class to be greater than a precalibrated
    “safe”

    value.

    It is important to note that in spite of the mentioned shortcomings, the family
    of k-

    anonymity metrics is actively used today in various real-world use case scenarios,
    especially

    for low-dimensional structured data [181]. This is justiﬁed by the inability of
    k-anonymity

    de-identiﬁcation methods to provide a sufﬁcient degree of data privacy in the
    case of

    high-dimensional data.

    7.1.2. Differential Metrics

    Differential privacy is a fundamental technique used in the scope of data anonymiza-

    tion processes. It states that the individual user will not be affected in any
    adverse manner

    as a consequence of their sensitive personal data usage in any research study
    or other type

    of analysis, regardless of the existing experimental or scientiﬁc data available
    [182]. Thus,

    the implementation of differential privacy mechanisms is normally performed through

    the addition of noise to the original clear text data. Consequently, it is necessary
    to have

    access to the original data, which are not de-identiﬁed. Initially, differential
    privacy was

    proposed in the realm of databases as a technique that would prevent the various
    database

    queries outcomes to be distinguished. Consequently, it has been adapted to other
    real-

    world use cases that involve the usage of low-dimensional data, such as biometrics
    and

    machine learning systems. Thus, irrespective of the presence of a particular data
    subject,

    the probability for any sequence of query responses to occur is determined by
    a parameter

    that we can deﬁne as ϵ. This is calibrated considering a proper balance between
    the degree

    of data privacy and the possibility to use the de-identiﬁed data. Relative to
    a speciﬁc

    computational context and a certain value of ϵ, various differential algorithms
    may be used,

    which generate variable levels of accuracy.

    In a similar way to the referenced k-anonymity method, the differential privacy
    model

    determines several relevant metrics, which include approximate differential privacy
    that

    has weaker privacy guarantees but nevertheless ensures a greater usefulness of
    the de-

    identiﬁed data [183]. Joint differential privacy [184] determines the software
    systems,

    which are characterized by private data subjects that can access their own data
    items

    but not other persons’ data items. Thus, relative to the privacy of geographical
    location

    data, geo-indistinguishability [185] is determined by the addition of noise that
    complies

    with the differential privacy requirements for a particular geographical location
    within a

    speciﬁed distance. Furthermore, computational differential privacy [186] involves
    a weaker

    adversary model that values the accuracy and practical utility of de-identiﬁed
    sensitive

    personal data items. The proper consideration of computational differential privacy
    relates

    to the distribution of posterior data [187], which is recovered using the transformed
    data.

    Additionally, an adequate level of information privacy [188] is achieved in this
    context if

    the probability distribution of the related sensitive personal data does not vary
    relative to

    the output of any database or dataset query.

    7.1.3. Metrics That Consider Entropy

    Relative to the scope of information theory, the entropy designates the degree
    of

    uncertainty, which determines the output or outcome of a random variable [189].
    The

    metrics that are determined by entropy generally include the estimated distribution
    of

    the reference data, which are computed from the de-identiﬁed data. This assertion
    is

    true even considering that supplementary descriptive information may be required
    for a

    certain metric, such as the original reference data or the parameters used during
    the data

    de-identiﬁcation process. The estimation of sensitive personal data using the
    available

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    20 of 31

    anonymized user data implies that a high degree of uncertainty usually determines
    a high

    degree of personal data privacy. Nevertheless, the sensitive personal data may
    still be re-

    identiﬁed using certain information, which has not been properly de-identiﬁed.
    Thus, the

    research reported in [190] suggests that the degree of data privacy is quantitavely
    assessed

    using cross-entropy, which is also designated as a likelihood. This process considers
    the

    estimated and the original data distribution relative to the clustered data, which
    are derived

    from the original data.

    The authors of [191] described a hybrid model of entropy, which relates to the
    scope

    of geographical data privacy. This measures the amount of entropy that can be
    gathered

    on a route that is taken, through a series of independent sections. The concept
    of inherent

    privacy [192] relates to another metric that is determined by entropy, which considers
    the

    number of possible distinct variants relative to a number of binary guesses. Furthermore,

    mutual information and conditional privacy loss [192,193] represent further entropy-based

    metrics. The former describes the amount of information that is common to two
    random

    variables, which can be calculated as the difference between entropy and conditional

    entropy. This is also referred to as equivocation, a technique that is particularly
    useful to

    calculate the amount of information required to describe a random variable, which
    implies

    proper knowledge about another variable that is part of the same dataset. Moreover,
    the

    latter metric is determined by a similar structural logic, but it implies the
    ratio established

    between the plain data distribution and the amount of information is offered by
    another

    variable, which is de-identiﬁed in a proper manner.

    7.1.4. Metrics Based on the Probability of Success

    This class of performance metrics does not refer to the data properties; rather,
    it

    considers the success of private information extraction attempts. Low success
    rates suggest

    a data privacy model, which ensures a high degree of data protection. Nevertheless,

    particular users’ personal data may still be illegitimately accessed. The research
    reported

    in [194] considered the original data and the estimated data, and a privacy problem
    was

    determined by the reconstructed probability of an attribute as the value of the
    actual

    computed probability is greater than a speciﬁed threshold. This principle is further
    enriched

    by the scientiﬁc model that was presented in [195] through the description of
    (d, γ )-privacy,

    which is determined by additional bounds that are proposed to calculate the ratio
    between

    the true and reconstructed probabilities in a more precise manner.

    Furthermore, the metric called δ-presence [196] assesses the probability of determining

    whether the personal data items of an individual are part of certain public datasets.
    This

    presumes the existence of a third-party database, which stores the sensitive personal
    data

    of all the implied persons. Additionally, it is important to note that hiding
    failure (HF) [197]

    represents a data similarity metric, which may be chosen to determine sensitive
    personal

    data patterns. This metric is calculated as the ratio between the sensitive patterns,
    which

    are detected in the de-identiﬁed dataset, and the sensitive data patterns that
    are detected in

    the original dataset. Thus, a dataset that is perfectly protected is characterized
    by a value

    of zero for this metric.

    7.1.5. Metrics Based on the Concept of Error

    This class includes metrics that quantify the effectiveness of the sensitive personal

    data extraction process, generally considering the distance between the original
    data and

    the related estimate. Thus, insufﬁcient levels of data privacy are observed relative
    to small

    estimate errors. Considering the geographical location privacy, the respective
    estimation

    error assesses the correctness of the inference through the computation of the
    expected

    distance between the actual location and the estimated location through the utilization
    of a

    proper distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance [198]. Moreover, high-dimensional
    or

    unstructured data, as an example of data that are collected by mobile background
    sensors,

    may be processed through a comparison that considers the traditional performance
    metrics,

    which relate to the sensitive private attribute extraction methods using de-identiﬁed
    and

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    21 of 31

    original data. Thus, accuracy is a traditionally used metric in this context.
    It is relevant to

    note that an important drop in performance constitutes a clear indication that
    the respective

    data anonymization technique is valid.

    7.1.6. Metrics Based on the Concept of Accuracy

    This class includes metrics that assess the accuracy of the inference model. This
    is

    based on the principle that inaccurate estimates usually suggest a higher degree
    of data

    privacy. The width of the conﬁdence interval designates the quantitative degree
    of data

    privacy, considering the estimated interval that includes the valid results [41].
    This metric

    is quantiﬁed in percentage form relative to a particular conﬁdence level. Thus,
    (t, δ) privacy

    violation [199] offers information concerning the susceptibility of a data classiﬁer’s
    [200]

    version public release to constitute a privacy threat, which is determined by
    the number of

    training samples that are at the disposition of the adversary algorithm. In essence,
    the data

    samples considered to train the model logically connect the publicly available
    data to the

    sensitive private data of the reference individuals. Thus, the basic data privacy
    principles

    are infringed as it becomes possible to discern sensitive information out of the
    publicly

    available data in the case of the persons that are not part of the data training
    samples.

    Considering geographical location data privacy, the size of the region that contains

    uncertain data determines the lower size of the region, which a certain target
    user belongs

    to, and the coverage of the region that contains private data assesses the degree
    of over-

    lap between a user’s sensitive regions and the region that contains uncertain
    data [201].

    Moreover, another relevant contribution was presented in [202], which presents
    a possible

    method for the customization of the data region accuracy, which the end users
    are part

    of during the data submission process to an Internet-based service. Consequently,
    the

    accuracy of the obfuscated data region is proportional to the degree of data accuracy
    which

    is obtained.

    7.1.7. Metrics Based on the Concept of Time

    This speciﬁc type of metrics assess the time that is necessary to extract the
    required

    sensitive private data. As an example, relative to geographical location data,
    the assessment

    of a reference data privacy technique can be conducted by measuring the longest
    time

    interval within which it is possible to successfully break the enforced data privacy,
    through

    successful user tracking. This is achieved by calculating the maximum tracking
    time [203]

    or the mean time to confusion [204].

    8. Analytical Discussion Concerning Relevant Research Aspects and Gaps

    The comprehensive scientiﬁc literature, which was surveyed, suggests that in spite
    of

    the progress realized, numerous theoretically fundamental and practical problems
    require

    further research be conducted. Consequently, this section analyzes the scientiﬁc
    experience

    gathered during this scientiﬁc research through a discussion concerning the observed

    relevant scientiﬁc research aspects, which require further investigation.

    Thus, it is important to observe the correlation between the different sensitive
    data

    attributes. This is useful to identify the particular attributes, which may be
    used to infer

    the plain text meaning of other sensitive data attributes. As an example, the
    end user’s

    geographical location, as determined using the Wi-Fi device, may also suggest
    valuable

    data regarding the daily activities that the user attends.

    It is important to note that the inferable attributes, which have been extensively
    ana-

    lyzed in this paper, may accept diverse sets of values relative to the size and
    number of

    attributes, which are speciﬁc to any particular subject. As an example, the existence
    of a

    medical condition or the gender of a particular individual represent unique individual

    features, which may be compatible with a binary or limited set of values. Moreover,
    other

    personal attributes, such as age, occupational proﬁle, or geographical location,
    imply differ-

    ent data collection, processing, and anonymization models. Considering the conﬁguration

    of the attribute output categories and the greater system complexity, which is
    computation-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    22 of 31

    ally expensive, it is possible to obtain a superior level of relevant information
    related to the

    private data subject. This generally determines a reduced level of personal data
    privacy.

    Consequently, considering the problem of personal data protection, it is appropriate
    to infer

    that proper data anonymization techniques should be designed, properly implemented,

    and used. This implies that data anonymization techniques determine a fundamental

    scope of research, which has not provided a proper solution for all the real-world
    use

    cases. Thus, an adequate balance should be determined between the level of generated

    data anonymization, the implied computational resources, and also the possibility
    to safely

    restore the original plain text format of the de-identiﬁed data ﬁelds, if this
    is required by

    legitimate use cases.

    The creation of digital data storage mediums and communication channels, together

    with the continuously increasing computational capacities, has turned the automatic
    pro-

    cessing of very large databases into a concrete possibility, so that relevant
    data and corre-

    lations are determined orders of magnitudes faster than before. Consequently,
    the data-

    driven soft sensors, which are used for data collection in a variety of real-world
    use cases,

    should be conﬁgured to gather the data that pertain to just the required data
    ﬁeld. This en-

    sures that all subsequent processes, which include data anonymization (de-identiﬁcation),

    re-identiﬁcation, and the effective data processing routines, optimally use the
    available

    computational resources and generate a pleasant end user experience. This implies
    the

    existence of low data request latencies and, ideally, the complete reliability
    of the related

    software systems, which is translated through the generation of correct data processing

    results. It also implies the continued operation of the implied data processing
    modules.

    These represent design and implementational details, which are often overlooked
    in the

    literature.

    Furthermore, the ethical aspects are also important. This relevance is suggested

    not only by signiﬁcant regulations, such as the European GDPR [33], or the American

    HIPAA [76,77], but also by direct research and practical experience. Thus, even
    if the data

    are collected through a legitimate process, the generated results may be inﬂuenced
    by

    inadvertent data alteration factors. These may be either subjective, such as a
    mistake that is

    introduced by a human operator, or determined by software bugs or hardware failures.
    As

    an example, the authors of this paper designed and implemented an integrated personal

    health data management system, which uses both hardware [205] and software sensors,
    to

    collect data about the physiological parameters that are monitored [206]. Full
    data privacy is

    ensured through homomorphic encryption routines, which were illustrated by the
    authors

    of [73,74]. The initial incorrect implementation of certain homomorphic encryption
    routines

    determined the triggering of false health warnings in the case of individuals
    who were not

    suffering from the particular medical conditions. This is just one example, chosen
    from the

    authors’ real-world experience, which precisely suggests that the balance between
    the level

    of generated data anonymization, the implied computational resources, and the
    possibility

    to safely restore the original plain text format of the de-identiﬁed data ﬁelds,
    is mandatory

    during the design and implementation of any such relevant software systems. Such
    risks

    are further exacerbated by the software systems, which use deep learning models
    that do

    not process the end users’ sensitive personal data in a transparent manner through
    their

    internal intermediate layers. Consequently, it may be asserted that fairness in
    the scope of

    artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) represents a novel, but very intense subject of scientiﬁc
    research,

    which determines several important real-world aspects, including the implementation
    of

    effective personal data privacy models.

    Further Remarks

    Built-in sensors in mobile devices collect a variety of real-world data. Consequently,
    a

    typical constraint of mobile device-based data computation is robustness. As an
    example,

    regarding the interpretation of sensitive personal information, the property designated

    as “position invariance” may ensure a negligible effect on the algorithmic data
    processing

    performance relative to the changes in the position of the end user. More precisely,
    the

    Sensors 2023, 23, 294

    23 of 31

    algorithmic routines should be able to accurately determine the predeﬁned user
    attributes’

    values, regardless of the actual mobile devices’ position or usage pattern. This
    represents

    another practical aspect that is not always properly considered.

    It is also relevant to determine whether the end users are involved in the sensitive

    personal data attributes labeling process. If the answer is affirmative, it is
    essential to

    make sure that the respective individual is capable to act in an objective manner,
    particu-

    larly considering certain use cases, such as psychological mood recognition. Furthermore,

    relative to 3D data that are collected by motion sensors over time, the labeling
    process may

    be computationally expensive and complicated. Therefore, the improvement of the
    exist-

    ing labeling processes represents an essential research topic, which directly
    influences the

    machine-learning-based data processing approaches. Thus, a potential solution
    may be

    represented by the consideration of self-supervised learning (SSL) models, a paradigm

    that favors the training of the feature extraction algorithms through an unsupervised

    process.

    The literature dealing with mobile device sensors suggests that it may be important
    to

    assess how internal physical sensors features inﬂuence the efﬁciency and safety
    of the data

    collection and anonymization. This is a consequence of the variability in the
    data collection

    sensors’ technical speciﬁcations and physical features, such as full-scale values,
    resolution,

    sampling frequencies, and so on.

    Regarding mobile devices, time-based constraints are usually important in the
    real-

    time applications and can determine a superior end user experience. Consequently,
    it

    is essential that the data anonymization processes not introduce signiﬁcant overhead

    relative to the overall computational time efﬁciency. This represents another
    conceptual

    and practical problem, which is not properly addressed in the literature.

    It is worth mentioning that an important research aspect concerns the storage
    of the

    necessary algorithms. Thus, the collected raw data may be transmitted to powerful
    cloud-

    based data processing infrastructures to support the data processing models’ training,

    which is usually computationally expensive. Therefore, the transmitted data are
    exposed

    to more signiﬁcant risks of unauthorized interception during the transmission
    phase or to

    risks of unauthorized access during the data storage phase. Therefore, full data
    privacy

    preserving models, such as the homomorphic encryption-based algorithmic routines,
    may

    be required in a variety of real-world use cases. It is rather interesting to
    observe that a

    preoccupation with full privacy preserving data processing models is not substantial
    in

    either the surveyed papers or in the general scientiﬁc literature.

    The scientiﬁc gaps that were identiﬁed in the surveyed literature suggest that
    the

    preservation of personal data privacy should be ensured, implemented, and quantita-

    tively analyzed through the utilization of a uniﬁed data anonymization framework,
    which

    includes the required metrics that evaluate the data privacy, as determined by
    the imple-

    mented data anonymization mechanisms. This represents an important but insufﬁciently

    approached problem, which may ensure the time-efﬁcient and safe operation of any
    soft-

    ware system that uses data-driven soft sensors for sensitive private data collection.

    9. Conclusions and Open Questions

    This survey demonstrates that seemingly harmless personal data collection pro-

    cesses may help isolate essential personal data items, which must be protected
    according

    to the general technical specifications of relevant data protection regulations,
    such as

    GDPR and HIPAA. This paper offers a state-of-the-art survey concerning classic
    and up-

    to-date scientific papers, which address the isse of data privacy. The reviewed
    scientific

    literature suggests that certain research questions remain unanswered and need
    further

    consideration. These include: the detection of correlation between sensitive attributes,

    efficient data modification algorithms for privacy protection, unified quantitative
    assess-

    ment metrics related to data anonymization methods, and the study of relevant
    ethical

    implications.

    Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in
    critical infrastructures, necessitates strict security and

    privacy standards. Owing to data proliferation, Cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely
    on computing platforms for the provision of services

    and resources. The futuristic “Beyond 5G” (B5G) enabled critical IoT infrastructures
    cannot run on centralized systems due to their

    security vulnerabilities that compromise the basic Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability
    (CIA) triad. Blockchain technology (BCT) is

    emerging as a key enabler in addressing IoT’s security challenges, and it is compliant
    with the Fog-IoT architecture. The Ethereum

    platform has ushered an unprecedented development in BCT by facilitating application
    development. Blockchain (BC) connects the

    users’ chain identity to the transactions associated with their tokenized digital
    assets and confers the ability to audit the system. The

    history of canonical transactions is recorded in an immutable fashion facilitating
    data tracking and deterrence of data repudiation. A

    Consensus mechanism (CM) governs the state transitions and the node behavior in
    building trust relationships between various entities

    in the absence of a central authority. Through Smart Contracts(SCs), distributed
    and trustworthy access control can be achieved for

    IoT systems besides enhancing automation. We argue that BCT adoption is inevitable
    in securing futuristic B5G enabled IoT critical

    infrastructures for ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control, authentication,
    communication, and data security. Various challenges

    are associated with their adoption, such as the rising cost of Ethereum and constraints
    in the IoT environment. To facilitate BC solutions

    for IoT security, the functionality of BCT must be complemented with other technologies
    such as Machine Learning (ML), Edge

    Computing (EC), and InterPlanetary Filesystem(IPFS).

    Keywords: Blockchain, IoT, Edge Computing, Consensus, Security, Privacy, Smart
    contracts, IPFS B5G, Access control.

    1. INTRODUCTION

    The industry is rapidly evolving into a holistic network

    of intelligent systems capable of making data-driven deci-

    sions. Many technologies have aided this transition, with

    IoT being at the core. IoT connects devices and couples

    them to the internet forming a CPS. IoT is at the center

    of intelligent applications in and outside the industry. IoT

    offers the remote control and monitoring of equipment

    and catalyzes data-driven automated decision and action-

    taking capabilities, resulting in increased system efficiency

    and throughput while lowering costs. IoT is causing a

    major upward shift in the revenue pool, and its growth

    can be assessed by the increase in the number of practical

    applications across regions.

    IoT enables a pervasive interconnection of virtual and

    physical objects for accelerated data sharing and collection.

    Sensing capabilities are embedded in intelligent devices

    such as smartphones, laptops, and fitness monitors, while

    intelligence is built into traditional sensors for extensive

    data monitoring. As per the Ericson report, by 2050, there

    will be 24 billion interconnected IoT devices [1]. The data

    streams are generated continuously with volumes reaching

    exabytes; thus, the data is referred to as IoT Big data. At

    present, Cloud Computing and Fog Computing are the most

    popular provisions to handle the high-end computing and

    storage demands of IoT big data [2].

    IoT aims to create intelligent, unified, fully distributed,

    secure, and cost-efficient systems. Reliable storage, data

    awareness, ease of access, scalability, and channel security

    are important parameters while adopting a wireless system.

    IoT systems come with inbuilt security measures that can

    be bypassed due to their intrinsic traits.Various factors are

    responsible for hindering the pace of IoT security. These

    include:

    1)

    Any end- end encryption technique employed to

    provide data security in networks is challenging to

    be embedded in IoT networks due to the constrained

    98

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    nature of the devices.

    2)

    IoT devices are lodged in uncontrollable, heteroge-

    neous, complex, open, untrustworthy environments,

    which magnify the attack space.

    3)

    Lack of standard architecture, a common address-

    ing scheme limits the integration and replication of

    security measures from other IoT systems.

    4)

    IoT is an ever-growing field, and the security features

    of constrained devices are not evolving at the same

    pace as the system itself.

    5)

    The adoption of computing platforms forces frequent

    transfer of data. Implementing robust cryptographic

    algorithms is expensive and increases the overall cost

    of the system.

    6)

    IoT systems communicate across different domains

    and require fine-grained Access control(AC) mecha-

    nisms for collaboration.

    Cloud and Fog platforms are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and

    fail to meet the demand for flexible cross-domain interop-

    erability across multiple systems with distributed resources.

    The Data Management (DM) systems are centralized and

    prone to hackers who can manipulate the database, thereby

    compromising data integrity. The overreliance on a central-

    ized database causes the “Single point failure” problem. The

    monetary transactions require the intermediation of a third

    party, which incurs verification costs and increases privacy

    concerns. These centralized architectures are prone to secu-

    rity threats that disorder the regular operation of systems.

    These include Denial of Services(DoS), Distributed Denial

    of Services(DDoS), Ransomware attacks, Eavesdropping,

    Side-channel attacks, Spoofing, Routing attacks, Man in the

    middle attack, SQL injection, and Phishing [3].

    With the advancement in B5G technology, IoT is set to

    transform the existing digital landscape, but its inadequate

    security features have limited its adoption. B5G mobile

    communication technologies aim to provide high-speed

    transmission network support and enormous access points

    to maximize IoT capabilities [4]. The security measures of

    such applications need enhanced security and efficient DM.

    BCT is emerging as a promising paradigm for bringing

    disruptions in IoT security and is highly compliant with

    the Fog-like system of architecture [5].

    BCT has created a paradigm shift by enabling trusted and

    anonymous transactions. BCT establishes trust between the

    communicating nodes, and the decision-making is based

    on CMs suitable in distributed environments. Owing to its

    unique propensities– Immutability, Transparency, Traceabil-

    ity, Resilience, and Encryption, the adoption of BCT is

    suitable for the realization of futuristic peer-peer, trustless

    applications. BCT supports tokenized assets, and the nodes

    in the network interact automatically without the interven-

    tion of any central authority. This increases the privacy of

    the network and eliminates the management cost.

    BCT is creating major reforms in IoT management and se-

    curity. The IoT transactions are encrypted and secured using

    digital signatures and cryptographic keys. BCT eliminates

    the security threats with a distributed CM and provides a

    Figure 1. Centralized Vs. BC-based IoT

    true system state upon which every legitimate user agrees.

    With the integration of BCT, IoT applications are becoming

    decentralized, transactions are trusted and anonymous, and

    cross-domain interaction is enhanced. The system security

    is increased through ownership records, encrypted trans-

    actions, distributed storage, consensus, and authentication

    mechanisms. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between a

    centralized and BC-based IoT system.

    There are multiple challenges concerning the BC integrated

    IoT systems, such as network complexity, limited band-

    width, computation capabilities, data diversity, scalability,

    and throughput. Conventional CMs consume huge amounts

    of resources to slow down the access rate of new blocks and

    protect the BC network from attacks, which is too expensive

    for resource-limited IoT devices. Further, the capacity of a

    new block is limited, and transactions per second (TPS)

    are usually limited to 20 to 30 TPS in Ethereum, rendering

    the system unable to respond to the influx of transactions

    [6]. With tradeoffs between adversity tolerance, latency,

    and energy consumption, research on IoT suitable CMs is

    growing.

    BC itself suffers from security and privacy issues. Imple-

    menting longer chains is challenging, and the SCs can prove

    to be a double-edged sword. The cost of Ethereum is rising

    continuously, making the storage and transactions expen-

    sive for large-scale adoption. The underlying technologies

    powering BCT consume high power and are not suitable for

    IoT. BCT can revolutionize IoT, but enabling technologies

    such as IPFS, ML and EC must be integrated with BC to

    outweigh its current limitations.

    IPFS is a distributed file system that can resolve BC

    –IoT big data problems. Instead of storing the data on

    the chain, IPFS hashes identifying the files are kept in

    the BC. The hash on the BC assures that the file has not

    been tampered with. File hashes can be used to link files

    to their owners and access rights.Solving complex puzzles

    such as Proof of work consumes a significant amount of

    CPU time and energy, making it unsuitable for resource-

    constrained IoT nodes. EC enables edge devices to carry out

    data resource incentive transactions and can be leveraged for

    performing consensus. Information hidden in IoT big data

    can be harnessed by feeding them to ML models, producing

    more generalized results on big data.The integrity of the

    data can be maintained by feeding trustworthy data to ML

    99

    through BC. Conversely, more security can be imparted into

    BC through ML.

    BCT is regarded as a promising technology for IoT because

    it provides significant solutions for decentralized networks

    that address trust and security concerns. Although BC

    outperforms centralized solutions in network security, BC-

    IoT integration is still in its early stages of adoption. Many

    challenges such as cost, compatibility, and privacy issues

    hinder the widespread adoption of BC security solutions

    in IoT. To realize the full potential of BC-based IoT,

    exhaustive research is necessary for exploring the enabling

    technologies for BC in lightweight( LW) environments.

    A. Objective and Contribution

    This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview

    of the potential and challenges of BC-based IoT security

    solutions and enabling technologies, open issues, possible

    solutions, and future research directions. There are four

    focal research points of our study, and are listed below-

    1)

    Firstly, to highlight the problems in centralized-based

    IoT solutions and understand why shifting to BC-

    based solutions is necessary.

    2)

    Since the robustness of a BC-based system is highly

    dependent on its underlying consensus mechanism,

    the aim is to conduct an in-depth comparative anal-

    ysis of CMs that are IoT suitable.

    3)

    Thirdly, to critically review the existing BC-based

    IoT security solutions in view of five IoT security

    tasks-

    a)

    Key Management and Access control.

    b)

    Device Authentication.

    c)

    Routing Security.

    d)

    Malware Prevention. and

    e)

    Data Protection and Secure Database Manage-

    ment.

    4)

    Fourthly, to highlight the open challenges in the

    BC-IoT integration and list out key future research

    directions.

    The main contributions of the paper are as follows:

    1)

    We have conducted a thorough survey of recent

    surveys(2019-early 2022) on BCT applicability in

    IoT. Other researchers may find this pool useful as

    a starting point for their research.

    2)

    We have discussed BC as a key enabling technology

    for IoT and three technologies that power BC-IoT.

    3)

    We have reviewed CMs in light of IoT.

    4)

    A primary literature review of the recent BC inte-

    grated IoT solutions in perspective of five specific

    IoT security tasks.

    5)

    We have discussed the cost analysis of IoT storage

    through SCs, network traffic modeling, SC vulner-

    abilities, BC transactional privacy, and other chal-

    lenges.

    6)

    We have thoroughly discussed the open issues and

    presented strong research directions.

    B. Paper Organization

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In

    Section 2, the scope of the survey is presented. Section

    3 presents the security vulnerabilities of six critical IoT

    applications and lays the rationale for moving toward de-

    centralized architectures. In Section 4, we briefly provide

    an overview of BCT, its architecture, and CMs. Section 5

    presents the highlights of the recent surveys (2019-early

    2022). Based on the study in section 5, we discuss BC as

    a key facilitator for IoT and technologies that accelerate

    BC adoption in IoT in Section 6. In Section 7, a detailed

    study of BC integrated IoT security architectures and a

    comparison of various CMs, their adoption, and tradeoffs

    is discussed. In section 8, a literature review of BC-based

    security solutions is presented. In section 9, we present a

    thorough overview of the challenges associated with BC

    adoption in IoT, point out the open issues and possible

    solutions, and suggest promising research directions

    2. Scope of the survey

    We begin our review with a study of the prevalent

    centralized IoT architectures and discuss their security vul-

    nerabilities. We identify five primary security tasks, evaluate

    them against centralized solutions, and determine their

    limitations and the need to shift to decentralized solutions

    such as Blockchain. We then discuss the fundamentals of

    Blockchain. The working of the SCs have been excluded,

    and instead, their security vulnerabilities and applicability

    has been discussed. Considering the vastness of BC appli-

    cability, especially in IoT security, we shortlist a pool of re-

    cent survey papers (2019-early 2022) and comprehensively

    highlight their key focal points. The research papers have

    been shortlisted based on keywords, the number of times

    cited, and relevance to one of the five domains- General

    IoT security, IoT suitable CMs, BC-based IoT applications,

    BC for B5G applications, and integration with Machine

    Learning and BC- Edge computing. Other researchers may

    find this pool useful as a starting point for their research.

    Based on our secondary survey, we broadly discuss the

    reason for merging BC with IoT, how BC is a key enabling

    technology for IoT and what technologies drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in

    IoT. We have discussed three enabling technologies for

    powering BC adoption in IoT- EC, IPFS, and ML. We

    then discuss the BC-IoT integration in great detail and

    present the technicalities of BC adoption in IoT. Since a

    BC network is only as good as its consensus, we conduct

    a detailed comparative analysis of CMs in light of IoT

    goals and related tradeoffs. Based on the study, we shortlist

    IoT suitable CMs and BC platforms. We then review the

    recent BC-based IoT architectures and evaluate them against

    the previously identified security tasks. We have filtered a

    subset of research papers(2018-early 2022) where the focal

    points are specifically the five IoT security tasks mentioned

    in subsection 1(A). Each paper’s experimental work and re-

    sults have been carefully studied, and the aim, architecture,

    pros, and cons of each solution have been comprehensively

    summarized. Finally, based on the literature review of BC-

    100

    IoT architectures, we thoroughly discuss the challenges in

    BC-IoT integration and present research issues and future

    research directions.

    3. Security vulnerabilities of Centralized IoT applica-

    tions:

    IoT’s centralized architecture has three major network

    components-a) End devices: These are devices with sensing

    and actuating abilities coupled to the CPS. They amass

    data in the environment that they are lodged in and take

    action. b) Gateways and Data acquisition systems (DAS):

    DASs acquire data from sensors, and the gateways enable

    the Device-Cloud interactions working on different network

    protocols. c) Computing platforms: The data is relayed

    to platforms that provide storage, processing, hardware,

    software, and analytical support to the system.

    A. IoT Goals

    IoT architecture must satisfy the following primary

    goals:

    1)

    Low Power consumption: IoT devices are con-

    strained and require low-powered communication

    protocols to increase the network’s lifetime.

    2)

    Adaptability: The addition of new devices, frequent

    changes in the network conditions, and mobility of

    devices are essential factors in an IoT network. IoT

    architecture must be flexible to changes that the

    network encounters.

    3)

    Interoperability: Heterogeneity is a prime character-

    istic of IoT data. Well-defined standards and middle-

    ware are necessary to ensure ubiquitous computing.

    4)

    Latency prevention: The data processing must be

    done in a timely manner, especially in critical ap-

    plication domains.

    5)

    Accuracy: The data must be consistent and accurate

    throughout the process. The veracity of the data must

    be ensured, and the communication should be non-

    lossy.

    6)

    Fault tolerance: The architecture must contain a

    distributed and decentralized system to ensure ro-

    bustness and resilience.

    7)

    Security protection: Data must be protected against

    malicious cyberattacks. The transmitted data must

    not be altered at any level.

    8)

    Privacy Preservation: The transmitted data must only

    be available to the users participating in exchanging

    information.

    9)

    Low cost: The overall cost of deployment, network

    communication, storage, and maintenance should be

    low. Affordability is an essential factor in making

    IoT a viable business paradigm.

    10)

    Scalability: IoT is an ever-growing field. New de-

    vices are added to expand the existing networks. The

    architecture must be flexible to the growth of the

    network

    1) IoT Security Goals

    An IoT network must satisfy the following security

    goals:

    1)

    Confidentiality: Data transmitted must be accessible

    only to authentic users. Encryption mechanisms must

    be employed to protect the data.

    2)

    Integrity: The data transmitted must be trustworthy.

    The data received must not be modified in an unau-

    thorized manner.

    3)

    Availability: The data must not be lost in transit. DoS

    must be avoided.

    4)

    Authenticity: The data must originate only from

    trusted sources only. The Authentication issue in-

    cludes the capability to identify the devices in the

    IoT-based system.

    5)

    Non-Repudiation: The data transfer must be bound

    by proof of data ownership. The sender and receiver

    must acknowledge the transfer of data and not deny

    it at a later stage.

    6)

    Authorization: This refers to granting permissions to

    access data or perform an operation on authenticated

    objects and persons.

    B. Security of Centralized IoT applications:

    The number of IoT applications has increased signifi-

    cantly as a result ofthe development of open-source cloud

    platforms, such as Azure IoT Suite, Amazon Web Services,

    and Oracle IoT. IoT is at the root of various critical applica-

    tion infrastructures such as Smart Home, Smart City, Smart

    Health, Smart Agriculture, Smart Retails, Supply Chain

    Management, Finance, Industrial Control Systems, Commu-

    nication Networks, Smart Grids, and Smart Transportation

    [7]. These applications generate personal and sensitive

    information, raising the need for secure DM. Centralized

    schemes are susceptible to attacks, and a hacker can modify

    the AC policies to gain control of the system. Decentralized

    schemes are necessary for securing IoT Applications. The

    centralized nature of the application is vulnerable to various

    security threats at all levels, as depicted in Figure 2. In this

    subsection, we discuss six critical application domains:

    1)

    Smart city (SCT): SCT has Information and Com-

    munication Technology (ICT) at the core of its

    infrastructure. SCT provides several innovative and

    advanced services to its citizens to improve their

    quality of life. Intelligent information is provided

    to its citizens in real-time by fully enabling the

    control of the physical objects. Various SCT appli-

    cations include Healthcare, Smart buildings, Public

    safety, Smart Governance, and Smart agriculture.

    SCT faces large-scale security and privacy risks. The

    resource-constrained devices used, such as sensors

    and cameras which collect and share sensitive infor-

    mation, are very vulnerable to attacks by hackers.

    Most of the resource-constrained devices have no

    adequate security or privacy mechanism. The com-

    munication technologies used by IoT devices like

    RFID, NFC, WiFi, LPWAN (Low Power Wide-area-

    network), 6LoWPAN 3G,and 4G mobile technolo-

    gies are highly susceptible to attacks. The presence

    of multiple links between many system components

    exposes them to many security risks [8], [9], [10].

    2)

    Smart HealthCare (SHC): One of the major do-

    mains in the IoT-based infrastructure is SHC. Wear-

    able and mobile devices in IoT-based SHC have

    added tremendous value to the healthcare domain.

    SHC is responsible for making healthcare person-

    alized, more convenient, and efficient. The various

    applications of SHC include assisting diagnosis and

    treatment, health management, disease prevention,

    risk monitoring, virtual assistants, smart hospitals,

    and assisting drug research. SHC is highly vulnera-

    ble to security breaches and faces many malignant

    attacks, including privacy leakage, data tampering,

    and forgery. SHC deals with sensitive and personal

    data. The data collected through sensors are both

    static or have dynamic behavior. The breach of such

    data is considered a severe breach in data protection.

    The connected devices capture, aggregate, process,

    and then transfer the data to the cloud. These devices

    are vulnerable to tag cloning, spoofing, RF Jamming,

    and cloud polling. SHC has a centralized dataset that

    contains personal information such as family history,

    electronic medical records, and genomic data that

    must be secured from malicious software. Wireless

    networking technology deployed in the healthcare

    environment like Wi-Fi, BLE, and ZigBee results

    in an increased threat of eavesdropping, sybil, and

    sinkhole attacks [11], [12], [13].

    3)

    Smart Grid (SG): SG constitutes one of the most

    critical applications of the IoT. SG entails integrating

    the data communications network and the power

    grid to analyze the data collected from transmission

    lines, distribution substations, and consumers. The

    transmission and distribution of the power networks

    in SG are intelligently monitored at a fine granularity

    for high accuracy. Several IoT architectures have

    been proposed to be integrated with SG. Layer 1

    architecture consists of the Smart meters, Network

    Devices, and Communication protocol in the general

    three-layered architecture. Layer 2 contains devices

    responsible for receiving data at the central system.

    Layer 3 includes artificial intelligent systems to

    provide information to decision and billing systems.

    IoT-based SG as a cyber system faces security

    challenges at all three levels. The attacks can be

    categorized into four main types: Device attack, Data

    attack, Privacy attack, and Network availability at-

    tack. Authentication, user privacy, and data integrity

    are essential in SG. Only the intended recipients

    must access the data stored or transmitted. Secure

    authorization and control access is an important issue

    for IoT-based SG. Only a certified and authorized

    person should be granted the necessary access to

    perform any configuration of the smart meter [14],

    [15], [16].

    4)

    Smart Home (SH): An IoT-based SH refers to the

    environment of living that consists of highly intelli-

    gent and advanced automatic systems. Smart services

    are provided by various heterogeneous electronic

    devices networked together to provide smart ser-

    vices. An IoT-based SH performs various function-

    alities such as controlling and monitoring lighting,

    home temperature, appliances, intrusion detection,

    and energy management. Convenience and secu-

    rity are considered two key factors influencing the

    decision of the users in adopting IoT-based SHs.

    An SH must satisfy five security goals- Authenti-

    cation, Authorization, Integrity, Confidentiality, and

    Availability. SH faces many security-related issues

    owing to its basic architecture, such as eavesdrop-

    ping. An attacker can capture the traffic in infras-

    tructure among the different components of SH,

    thus violating confidentiality. The data captured can

    lead to an impersonation attack where an adversary

    masquerades as an authentic user and accesses IoT

    resources. DoS attacks can be performed by crafting

    malformed messages, resulting in provided service

    not processing the data properly, thereby compro-

    mising the availability [17], [18], [19].

    5)

    Smart Farming/Agriculture (SF/SA): IoT-based

    SF solutions refer to the system in which the crop

    field is monitored with the help of sensors, and

    the irrigation system is automated. The monitoring

    of the farm can be done from anywhere by the

    farmer. In IoT Smart Agriculture (SA), far advanced

    sensors are utilized, connected to the cloud via

    cellular and satellite networks. Thus the real-time

    data received assists in making effective decisions.

    However, there remain many security and privacy

    issues which are critical to the performance of

    SA/SF. Wireless sensors are used abundantly in SA

    to give up-to-date information to the farmer in real-

    time. Centralized systems store the information and

    have control over it, compromising the privacy of

    the system. Furthermore, communication plays a key

    role in SA/SF. The vulnerable nature of wireless

    102

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    technology results in the interception of data packets.

    The data is susceptible to modification while relaying

    them to their destinations, compromising the CIA

    triad and leading to incorrect decision-making [20],

    [21], [22].

    6)

    Smart Transportation: With the rapid develop-

    ment in smart sensors, smart vehicles, and vehicular

    communication technology, the Internet of Vehicles

    (IoV) is proposed to be the future of the trans-

    portation critical infrastructure system. The evolu-

    tion of the IoV can be considered from its parent

    branch of IoT, with the focus on Vehicular Adhoc

    Networks. With sensors embedded in the vehicles,

    mobile phones, and the devices installed in the

    city, there is a possibility to offer an optimized

    suggestion of routes, easy parking reservations, eco-

    nomic street lightning, prevention of accidents, and

    autonomous car driving. Due to the dynamic nature

    of the vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to

    vehicle (V2V) communication, the real-time traffic

    state information measured and shared is essential

    in providing efficient and secure service in IoV.

    Since this communication is deployed in an open

    environment and topologies change over time, many

    vehicles enter the IoV system in a given time slot,

    making it challenging to identify and authenticate

    the legitimacy of each vehicle. This nature of the

    IoV network makes it difficult to ensure security and

    non-repudiation. As a result, the malicious attack can

    be easily launched to disrupt the services provided,

    leading to low traffic efficiency and compromising

    the safety of passengers. The high availability of

    IoV is important due to its safety-critical nature,

    which requires fail-safe, resilient, and fault-tolerant

    operations to be performed [23], [24], [25].

    C. IoT Security Tasks:

    The Security tasks can be broadly classified into five cat-

    egories spanning different IoT infrastructure levels. These

    include:

    1)

    Key and AC management: Only authorized person-

    nel must be given access to perform an operation or

    to access data. Fine-grained AC mechanisms must

    be devised in a heterogeneous environment, where

    cross-domain interoperability is a must.

    2)

    Authentication of Devices: It is a must that the

    legitimacy of every node participating in the network

    is proven to the root. The devices must also verify

    their data integrity and provide non-repudiation of

    the messages while interacting with other nodes.

    3)

    Data sharing and Routing security: IoT system pro-

    vides untethered access to information by transmit-

    ting data through uncertain and insecure channels.

    Securing the data and routing operation from cyber-

    attacks during transit is essential.

    4)

    Prevention against software failures: IoT systems

    are susceptible to Malware threats that can disrupt

    the entire functionality of the system. Adware, Ran-

    somware, Spyware protection is necessary to protect

    the IoT ecosystem.

    5)

    Secure and privacy-preserving data storage and man-

    agement: A central authority controls a centralized

    system that has complete control over the users’

    data. IoT systems require secure, tamper-resistant,

    and privacy-preserving database storage and man-

    agement.

    4. Blockchain Technology

    Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger consisting of a

    series of time-stamped blocks linked together through a CM

    forming a decentralized and distributed network [26]. A set

    of rules guides the transactions, and the system is free of

    any central authority. Instead, a peer-peer (p2p ) network is

    responsible for maintaining and updating the ledger. Con-

    ceived originally to prevent the “double-spending” problem

    in commercial transactions, the first widespread application

    of BC was the cryptocurrency Bitcoin’. However, since its

    inception in 2008, BCT has found applications in various

    other sectors such as Banking, Asset Management, Health-

    care, IoT security, Identity management, and Insurance [27].

    The World Economic Forum estimates that the BC would

    store 10 % of global GDP in the coming decade.

    Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that contains trans-

    actional records.The information that is contained in the

    ledger is in digital format. A large number of transactions

    are contained in the block of the BC.For every transaction

    that occurs in the BC, the author’s digital signature is re-

    quired, and every participant’s ledger is updated.By the very

    inherent design of the BC,the chain’s data is highly secure,

    which guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of the

    data.This generates trust without the need for some other

    third party. The validation and tamper-resistant transactions

    are managed by a large number of nodes[28].BC can also

    be described as distributed ledger technology that provides

    certificates to prove that information has not been tampered

    with[29].

    Four crucial technologies are guiding BCT. These include

    Hashing, Cryptography, Digital signatures, and Consensus.

    Hash function takes data of indefinite sizes as input and

    gives a value of definite size in the output. Even a minor

    change in the input leads to a completely different hash

    value. BCT is based on the SHA-256 hash function.The cor-

    responding hash is computed in the encryption block when

    a transaction is made, and the blocks are connected through

    the hashes [30]. For secure interaction, BCT employs

    public-key asymmetric cryptography [31]. Cryptography

    ensures confidentiality, accessibility, and integrity,assuming

    that the attack is computationally bound (the probability of

    which is high). Membership services governed by protocols

    maintain and manage the unique chain identity of the user.

    BCT uses a public key –private key mechanism for the

    identification of devices and signing transactions. A wallet

    contains information about public and private keys and

    tokenized digital assets associated with the client. Every

    transaction on the chain is digitally signed, thus associated

    with the on-record identity of the client.The CM governs

    network synchronization in the open network and ensures

    that the system verifies any transaction initiated. These

    four technologies enable the following in BCT-based open-

    access systems: [32]

    1)

    Decentralization:

    The

    transactions

    are

    validated

    without the interference of a central authority. The

    system is decentralized, and the information is dis-

    tributed and replicated across multiple nodes. The

    nodes agree upon the actual state of the ledger

    through a CM.

    2)

    Auditability: The records and transaction history on

    the chain serves as proof of ownership of the client’s

    digital assets and the transactions associated with

    them. The historical timestamp associated with the

    data is permanently stored in the BC.

    3)

    Integrity: The blocks are linked in chronological

    order with hashes. Thus, any malicious attempt to

    tamper with a block is readily detected.

    4)

    Transparency: BCs impart trust in a trustless environ-

    ment. A copy of the transaction information is visible

    to all the nodes. Any node can join an open BC

    system and access the network. The data is visible

    to everyone in the chain involved in the verification

    of transactions.

    5)

    Immutability:A record, once written, takes up a

    permanent place in the ledger. The ledger holds

    these records perpetually, imparting verifiability in

    the system.

    BCs are of 3 types- Public BCs, Private, and Consortium

    BCs. Public/ Permissionless BCs allow any user to join the

    network based on the consensus protocol, e.g., Bitcoin. Pub-

    lic BC has the capability of turning into a global network.

    A Private/Permissioned BC allows a specific set of nodes to

    be added to the chain providing a closed and more secure

    network [33]. Private BC is centrally controlled, and such a

    network is ideal for transmitting and sharing data within an

    organization. E.g., GemOS is a private BC. Finally, a hybrid

    approach that is partially centralized with lesser validators

    is called a consortium/Federated BC, where the control is

    distributed across a set of computers. Ethereum is a platform

    for building consortium BCs [34]. A comparison of the

    characteristics of the three types of BCs is depicted in Table

    I.

    A. Blockchain Framework:

    A Blockchain system has three layers- Data layer, Con-

    sensus Layer, and Application layer.

    1)

    Data Layer: Data layer governs the block creation.

    Secure identities are provided to each node, and

    dependence is created through network protocols.

    The network protocols govern the formation of p2p

    networks and secure transmission over links. The

    blocks contain two prime components- Chain of

    blocks and Transaction array.

    a)

    Chain of Blocks: BC is a distributed database

    containing a sequence of blocks that stores

    records of value and interest. Each block has a

    Block header(BH) and a Block body(BB). The

    BH stores the block version, which specifies

    the block validation rule set, a nonce which

    acts as a counter to verify the hash, a times-

    tamp to denote time, a Merkle root which

    stores the hash of all the underlying hashes

    of all the transactions in a cryptographic data

    structure called Merkle tree, the current block

    hash and the hash of the previous block. The

    BB contains the transaction data, an object

    recorded on blocks, organized by the Merkle

    tree [35].

    b)

    Transaction array: Every transaction is stored

    in the transaction array before adding it to the

    block. The transactions refer to exchanging

    value assets such as sending money, data,

    values, and messages. The basic skeleton of

    a Blockchain is shown in Figure 3.

    2)

    Consensus layer:This layer performs the core func-

    tionality of a BC system, i.e., bringing agreement on

    the system state in a trustless environment through

    consensus. The consensus is generally achieved by

    choosing a miner who packs the transactions into

    a new block and broadcasts it to the network.

    Figure 4 shows the steps involved in BC-based

    transactions. The four most popular BC CMs are

    Proof of Work(PoW), Proof of stake(PoS), Delegated

    104

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    Figure 3. A basic skeleton of Blockchain.

    Proof of stake(DPoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault

    Tolerance(PBFT). In PoW, the stakeholder(s)/miners

    compete to mine the block by calculating hashes

    until one node has the relevant value. In two

    nodes attaining the value simultaneously(rare) and

    the chain branches, the longest chain after the next

    block is taken as the real chain making the chains

    metastable. PoW requires complex computation and

    power resources. In PoS, a stakeholder/validator is

    chosen through a quasi-random process depending

    on his wallet credit, making the system run on low

    energy and computing resources but encouraging

    the nodes with nothing at stake to misbehave. In

    PBFT, the majority must agree on the network’s

    state, i.e., for a client transaction to commit, 2/3rd

    of the network must validate it. In DPoS, the nodes

    /delegates are chosen through voting to add a block

    to the root chain. In case of abnormal behavior

    by the delegate node, the other nodes can vote it

    out. However, the delegates are significantly less

    than the network and govern consensus, encourag-

    ing centralization. Some more CMs are Proof of

    Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance(DBFT), Proof

    of Burn(PoB), Proof of Capacity(PoC), Proof of

    Elapsed time(PoET), Dirted Acyclic graphs(DAG),

    Proof of Activity(PoA), Proof of Importance(PoI),

    and Leased Proof of Stake(LPoS) [36].

    3)

    Application layer: The Application layer provides

    interfaces for Distributed applications(DApps) that

    run on top of the BC system. At this level, SCs

    are integrated to guide the clauses’ execution with-

    out human intervention. SCs are digitized versions

    of paper-based contracts that allow terms reliant

    on decentralized consensus by self-execution [37].

    SCs are deterministic, autonomous, rule-based, and

    have unique addresses on the chain. The terms in

    the contract are converted into code that gets in-

    voked automatically in case of contract violation.

    SCs identify frauds and malicious attempts in the

    Figure 4. BC-based transactions.

    system, thereby increasing security. The results are

    deterministic and have high accuracy. SCs are in-

    voked independently and autonomously, mitigating

    the transaction costs by reducing human interference.

    Many BC communities are integrating interfaces for

    SCs, e.g., Ethereum provides a platform for writing

    SCs, written in a Turing complete language called

    Solidity [38].

    5. Related Surveys:

    IoT security is a vast domain, and many research and

    survey papers are available in the literature spanning various

    security aspects such as data encryption, intrusion detection,

    active attacks, passive attacks, device authentication, AC

    mechanisms, and channel security. AI and ML have comple-

    mented IoT security in recent times by providing improved

    real-time detection rates and attack detection accuracy. BC

    is a very recent addition to IoT security. BC addition to

    IoT is an up-and-coming solution to augment the pace

    of futuristic secure IoT networks. Due to the vastness of

    the domain and applicability beyond security, exhaustive

    survey papers are not available. Table II presents the recent

    (2019-2022) surveys available in the literature for BC-IoT

    integration. The surveys have been broadly classified into

    BC-based IoT Security, BC-based CMs for IoT, BC-IoT

    applications, BC-ML for IoT, and BC-EC integration. The

    focal points of each survey have been highlighted.

    6. Blockchain as a key enabling technology in IoT

    IoT is the focal point of enabling the pervasive inter-

    connection of virtual and physical objects that have sped

    up data sharing and collection. This capability makes IoT

    one of the essential architectures for providing services in

    various fields. This section discusses BC as a key enabling

    technology for IoT and the technologies that drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in IoT.

    1)

    Addition of BC features: BCT offers unique char-

    acteristics such as auditing capability, traceability,

    immutability, interoperability, accessibility, and ac-

    countability, which are imparted in IoT systems

    with its adoption. The IoT data streams from di-

    verse, heterogeneous environments are transformed

    into uniform coding. BC enables IoT and physical

    systems to collaborate through uniform access, fa-

    cilitating cross-domain interactions [77]. BCs enable

    fine-grained access mechanisms and SCs to prevent

    unauthorized access making the systems open to

    interactions from other physical systems. Further, BC

    has a 160-bit address space higher than IPV6, aiding

    it to be more scalable. The IoT data is stored as

    transactions permanently in an immutable fashion on

    the network. Every transaction initiated by a node is

    associated with the corresponding information. Any

    misbehavior or fraud can be traced back to the user

    imparting the audit capacity in the system, which can

    highly complement IoT verticals [65].

    2)

    5G and 6G enabled Industrial IoT: The advance-

    ments in faster communication networks are revolu-

    tionizing network services and making IoT systems

    faster. B5G technologies are key facilitators in inno-

    vating futuristic open access with low cross-domain

    barriers. The B5G systems need efficient communi-

    cation mechanisms with enhanced security, robust-

    ness, privacy preservation, and improved mobility.

    5Gs employ network slice brokers to enable media-

    tion between vertical service and resource providers.

    BC can operate independently in slices enabling

    secure and anonymous transactions [4], [78]. 5G ap-

    plications such as 5G-powered drones need security

    and enhanced privacy [79]. Various BC-based solu-

    tions have been presented for securing B5G and 6G

    systems. In [80], the authors present a BC sidechain-

    based decentralized hierarchical scheme for 5G to

    provide secure communication and authentication.

    The authentication is done at the edge of the network

    to reduce latency. In [81], the authors propose a BC-

    enabled clustered architecture for validating blocks

    in IoTs for B5G applications.

    3)

    Enhanced automation with SC applicability: With

    the help of SCs, BC is imparted with decision-

    making capabilities that drastically reduce human

    effort, and the applicability of IoT systems is in-

    creased [82]. The transactional clauses of SCs are

    digitized and tamper-resistant and cannot be mod-

    ified. SCs eliminate the need for an intermediator,

    minimizing management costs. SCs detect breaches

    and misbehavior in the system and automatically

    take decisions depending on the clauses pre-agreed

    upon by the system’s stakeholders. The decisions

    have higher accuracy and reliability and improve

    the overall security and efficiency of the system.

    SCs make distributed access decisions to enable

    legitimate users to query the BC and work better with

    data-driven interactions. SCs are deterministic and

    autonomous, thereby accelerating the inception of

    Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs). In

    IoT systems, SCs facilitate flexible AC, secure DM,

    prevent DDoS attacks, and provide secure identity

    management, strengthening security further.

    The three primary driving forces for BC-IoT adoption

    are:

    1)

    Edge computing: EC is a major driver for IIoT, and

    the integration of BCT into edge provides enhanced

    reliability, privacy, data integrity, reliable AC, and

    automated resource allocation. Conversely, the edge

    networks provide computational, storage, and side

    chain-based consensus facilities to IoT devices [70].

    Due to the constrained nature of IoT end-devices,

    they communicate data to the edge where the mod-

    erately intensive CMs and functions are done. The

    nodes store partial data such as time-stamp informa-

    tion to validate the authenticity of the other nodes.

    At the same time, the complex functions, strong

    CMs, and high storage requirements are offloaded

    to the edge. Various architectures have been present

    for BC-based edge computing. In [83], the authors

    propose a mobile BC-assisted IoT application con-

    sisting of Small cell base stations with mobile edge

    computing (MEC) deployed at them. In [84], the

    authors present a prototype for BC-based EC for

    mining and edge resource management for mobile

    BC. In [85], the authors present a DPoS based double

    auction cross-server edge resource allocation frame-

    work for mobile EC. BC functionality can be further

    extended for network management by designing BC-

    based Software-defined networks [32].

    2)

    Integration with ML: BCs provide secure data

    storage, and the outputs can detect anomalies in

    IoT systems [86]. The integration of ML and BCT

    in IoT can enable various tasks such as - secure

    storage of correct data, monetization of ML skill set

    through SCs, feeding correct data into algorithms,

    creation of better learning models through incentive-

    based competitive modeling, Making BCs secure

    from attacks, enabling automated signing of BC

    systems [71], [87], [88], [89]. In [90], the authors

    proposed a BC-assisted collective learning method

    to guide the secure exchange of learning results

    at the IoT edge. The model employs BC on the

    top of the edge devices where the nodes securely

    share learning results using BC-assisted collective

    3)

    IPFS powered BC for IoT: In critical IoT sys-

    tems, distributing data in a tamper-proof and trace-

    able manner is necessary. BCs provide the service,

    but they work inefficiently while handling big data

    considering the transactional processing limitations.

    IPFS can complement BC and provide a secure

    storage mechanism for IoT data. IPFS is a content-

    addressable, p2p version-controlled file system that

    can assist the formation of a decentralized IoT

    system [91]. IPFS, based on cryptographic hashes,

    is a potential alternative to address BC big data

    issues. BC is duplicated on multiple nodes; thus,

    most storage spaces are required without immediate

    use, particularly if the node operator does not need

    to examine every file saved on BC. With IPFS, BC

    only saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down

    the chain development drastically because hashes

    are typically less than the data they represent. For

    example, if SHA256 is employed, the on-chain stor-

    age required for a file of any size is lowered to 32

    bytes [92]. For any modifications in the content, the

    hash value changes each time. The authors of [93]

    offer a decentralized IIoT data management system

    108

    based on BC and IPFS. The authors of [94] propose

    a network architecture that uses BCand IPFS to

    provide IoT data privacy. SCs perform AC in the

    proposed “modular consortium” architecture while

    also providing accountability for data owners and

    third parties to whom users grant access.

    7. Blockchain Integrated IoT systems.

    IoT aims to design a distributed system offering scalabil-

    ity, security, privacy, reliability, real-time data delivery, and

    high adaptability. With the rapid advancements in B5G, IoT

    systems are becoming faster, expanding over longer ranges,

    and requiring enhanced security solutions. BC has distin-

    guished intrinsic features of non-intermediation, immutabil-

    ity, data transparency, and tamper-resilience, which mitigate

    security concerns in an untrusted cross-domain open envi-

    ronment. BCs are envisioned as the future of open-access

    systems requiring distributed storage, efficient data and

    resource management, secure KM, and AC mechanisms. By

    design, a BC-based architecture can ensure confidentiality,

    integrity, availability, user control, and authorization in any

    system [95]. The integration of BC into IoT offers increased

    data trust, imparts verifiability, eliminates intermediation,

    provides transparency, and increases user control of the

    user data in the systems. IoT and BC’s collaboration can

    resolve the issues of data organization, data maintenance,

    communication security, intra-domain collaboration, and

    privacy in IoT. We shall refer to such systems as BC

    integrated IoT (BIIT) systems throughout the rest of the

    paper.

    A. Technicalities of Blockchain IoT integration:

    The world is moving towards becoming “smart” with

    IoT technology, necessitating more attention to data security

    and privacy concerns. IoT security solutions are typically

    complicated due to a lack of safe hardware and software

    design, development, limited resources, and established

    standards. Furthermore, the diversity of resources available

    in the IoT has hampered efforts to develop a comprehensive

    global strategy for protecting IoT systems at all levels. The

    main challenge is data management and securely providing

    services without compromising the privacy of the underly-

    ing personal information. One of the IoT security solutions

    is to develop a fine-tuned AC mechanism for data protection

    and privacy by ensuring that only authorized and authen-

    ticated users may access data. However, this is hindered

    by the vastness of the connected devices. Furthermore, the

    traffic created by the massive amount of data generated by

    these devices makes satisfying quality-of-service standards

    difficult. loT devices have low storage, computation power,

    and bandwidth restrictions.

    With all of the interactions between people, data, and

    devices, IoT promises direct connectivity between devices

    and data interchange. In the IoT economy, sensors and

    devices should be able to conduct monetary transactions

    in exchange for services without the involvement of a third

    party. With the introduction of the 5G network, transactions

    and exchanges will predominantly occur over the internet

    Figure 5. Interaction between IoT and Blockchain

    network, which billing and payment systems must account

    for. However, financial institutions can still not receive

    real-time information on pledged assets due to ineffective

    management for accessing, sharing, and analyzing asset

    information across stakeholders. There are no chattel asset

    tracking and monitoring systems capable of validating and

    quantifying chattel assets pledged for loans.

    BCT has the capability of bringing reforms in these sectors

    as it enables safe, immutable, and anonymous transactions

    using a decentralized distributed ledger system. BC-enabled

    loT systems can monitor and track chattel assets in transit

    or warehouses in real-time. The combined approach aids

    in the resolution and avoidance of unnecessary risks in

    the financial industry. Some attacks on loT systems can be

    addressed using BCT. BC research as a security mechanism

    has resulted in various transformative benefits that were

    previously unattainable or unavailable. Figure 5 depicts the

    interaction between IoT devices and BC platforms.

    Figure 6 illustrates a simple BC-based security level

    evaluation mechanism for IoT. The authors of [96] illustrate

    the steps involved in an IoT network based on BC. First,

    IoT device manufacturers pre-verify software that is loaded

    on IoT devices and create the whitelist. A SC is produced

    by combining a manufacturer’s whitelist and the agent’s

    initial agent hash value(IAHV) installed in an IoT device.

    IoT device manufacturers can access SCs via decentralized

    applications or internally through an Application Program-

    ming Interface(API). IoT device manufacturers use SCs to

    update the White List. Manufacturers use the whitelist SC

    to record the whitelist and IAHV of the agent installed in an

    IoT device in the BC. By inquiring about the information

    recorded in the BC via the whitelist SC, the IoT device

    can verify that the agent’s IAHV matches the device agent

    hash value of the installed agent. It validates that the agent

    has not been forged or fabricated by comparing it to the

    agent hash value stored in the BC; as a result, the security

    evaluation process of IoT devices via the agent may be

    trusted. The IoT device’s agent checks to see whether any

    Figure 6. A simple BC-based security level evaluation mechanism

    for IoT.

    untrusted programs have been installed. The agent evaluates

    the security status of the IoT device and transmits it to

    the scoring SC. Manufacturers receive rewards in return for

    updating the whitelist SC.

    1) Recent proposed architectures:

    Two main features of the BCT include Trust and De-

    centralization [97], [98], [99]. By design, the data on a BC

    is secure and tamper-resistant, making it a key disruptor for

    IoT. BCs can be utilized to improve IoT in the following

    ways:

    1)

    Impart data integrity: The nodes in the BC have iden-

    tical copies of the ledger. When transactions occur,

    all network members are responsible for validating

    them, and once verified and stored in the ledger, the

    transaction cannot be manipulated or removed.

    2)

    More Addressing space than IPV6: BC addresses are

    160 bits long, while IPV6 addresses are 128 bits.

    When compared to IPV6, BC has higher addressing

    space (4.3 billion addresses).

    3)

    Trusted accountability: Every operation is docu-

    mented in the ledger; thus, it is possible to identify

    and trace all operations.

    4)

    Fault tolerance: Decentralized systems rely on mul-

    tiple separate components; they are more fault-

    tolerant. Because of the point-to-point decentralized

    structure, BC has no single node failure concern.

    5)

    Eliminating third-party liabilities: BC runs without

    third-party intermediaries and is free of any risks or

    dangers posed by third parties.

    The decentralized. peer-to-peer architecture is the most no-

    table characteristic of BCT. The distributed ledger contains

    Figure 7. Overview of Blockchain –based IoT architecture

    all transactions, and all network members must agree to

    approve the transaction. This feature enables the imple-

    mentation of end-to-end traceability. Data provenance was

    previously difficult to obtain, but it is now a possibility

    with the BCT’s distributed ledger option. Owing to these

    benefits, many BC-based architectures have been proposed

    for IoT; an overview of the same is provided in Figure 7.

    The authors of [100] propose the solutions to overcome

    the centralized solutions and security measures in IoT.

    The data-driven decentralized mechanism is used, which

    provides energy-efficient solutions for detecting attacks on

    the IoT-based Sensor Networks. In [101], the authors aim

    to facilitate the data searching and extraction of public and

    private BCs deployed at the MEC server of the 5G MEC

    smart grid. IoT device identifier is built as a BC explorer.

    In [102], the vulnerability of the massive data produced in

    IoT networks for smart transportation is solved by the BC

    and IoT, which provide a decentralized data management

    system. In [103], the authors propose using the Identity

    Based Encryption (IBE) algorithm to enhance health care

    data security.The BC-based IoT architecture uses IBE to

    provide enhanced security. In [104], the authors address

    the privacy, security, and scalability issues in a centralized

    system for IoT and resolve them with a lightweight archi-

    tecture for BC-based identity management. In [105], Mobile

    edge-cloud computation offloading is used in delay-sensitive

    IoT applications. An effective, trustworthy access control

    mechanism is introduced, which involves an advanced deep

    reinforcement learning algorithm using a double dueling

    Q-network. The work in [106] proposed using BC, SCs,

    and IoT devices to integrate different kinds of IoT devices

    in pre and post-harvesting agriculture segments. This work

    in [107] proposes the integration of the Software-Defined

    Network with the BC system. A BC-based architecture is

    used for proposing the new routing protocol witty cluster

    structure for the IoT networks.

    B. Tradeoffs in Consensus mechanisms for IoT suitability

    BIIT systems:

    Consensus is the principal mechanism that makes the

    BCs secure by design. A CM governs the rules that pivot

    on the network’s nodes to agree on the ledger’s true state.

    Consensus achieves trust in a heterogeneous, uncontrolled

    environment by providing a mechanism to validate the data

    communicated by the nodes in the network. CMs eliminate

    the central authority, validate the data communicated by

    the nodes in the network, establish trust among nodes and

    ensure a system state agreed upon by the network members.

    With the increase in BC-based applications, various CMs

    have been proposed and adopted by systems, but their adop-

    tion is met with challenges. The choice of the consensus

    algorithm significantly affects the network’s performance,

    and there exists a tradeoff between scalability, energy

    consumption, bandwidth requirement, network overheads,

    computation overheads, security, privacy, and latency.

    The robustness of a BC-based system is highly dependent

    on its underlying CM. The security provided by a CM

    is directly proportional to computational and bandwidth

    requirements, as is the case with PoW. IoT’s computational

    and communication abilities are bound by constrained re-

    sources; thus, applying a generic CM in IoT is difficult.

    Inter-domain cross consensus poses additional challenges

    [108]. Over the past few years, CMs have been customized

    particularly for LW environments. Since IoT networks are

    constrained, the CMs have been modified over the last

    few years to increase their suitability in LW networks.

    This, however, comes at the cost of compromising security

    and other factors. CMs with strong fault tolerance and

    immunity to attacks require the computation of intensive

    hash operations that consume energy, bandwidth, and other

    resources. CMs that work on low power do so at the cost of

    decreasing the network’s size or moderately compromising

    data integrity. An ideal CM for IoT would ensure increased

    decentralization, adversity tolerance, scalability, throughput,

    and decreased latency, energy consumption, storage, com-

    putation, and network overheads.

    A comparative study of the existing CMs in light of IoT

    goals is presented in Table III [109], [58], [55], [53] and

    [60]. The values High, Moderate, and Low under different

    columns(to different methods) are assigned based on dif-

    ferent criteria. For the energy consumption, computational

    resource requirements, storage overheads, and Throughput,

    the values are assigned bydirect comparison with PoW

    and IoT suitability. The numerical criteria for assigning

    latency values is Block creation time. For example, the

    block creation time in PoW is approximately 10 minutes,

    while it is only 4 minutes in PoC. Although the time is

    considerably lower than PoW, it is still not suitable for

    real-time IoT environments, and compared to other CMs

    that take only seconds, the time taken by PoC is high.

    Thus, the value “Moderate” has been assigned based on

    the combined criteria. DPoS can process 100,000 TPS, and

    the block is added in under 3 seconds to the chain, which

    is still not suitable for real-time IoT systems that require a

    block creation time of the order of milliseconds.

    While designing a new consensus algorithm for an LW

    system, the following tradeoffs need to be considered:

    1)

    Security and Computational requirements: Strong

    cryptographic methods provide high security and

    decentralization to the system, and improve data

    integrity and confidentiality but are computationally

    intensive and require high power systems for imple-

    mentation.

    2)

    Privacy and Latency: To achieve privacy, the adopted

    system should be free of a central authority, and

    the consensus should be achieved in a p2p fashion.

    However, private chains are adopted by systems that

    encourage centralization to decrease the system’s

    latency, thereby increasing privacy concerns.

    3)

    Convergence rate and Adversity tolerance: The con-

    vergence of the algorithm affects the adversity tol-

    erance of the network. For IoT real-time systems,

    for the consensus to converge faster, the number of

    nodes involved in consensus is decreased, making it

    easy to compromise the network and decreasing the

    system’s fault tolerance.

    4)

    Latency and Scalability: For cross-domain access,

    the number of validations to perform transactions in-

    creases, increasing the network overhead. To reduce

    latency in real-time applications, the number of the

    communicating nodes needs to be capped.

    5)

    Throughput and Scalability: As the network size

    increases, simultaneous communication attempts to

    access resources and Block addition increase con-

    siderably. This affects the system’s throughput sig-

    nificantly as more nodes access the limited resources

    of the system

    1) BIIT suitable Consensus mechanisms and Blockchain

    platforms:

    1)

    Hyperlegder Fabric with PBFT: Hyperledger fab-

    ric has a modular architecture and can create private

    chains. The system’s latency is less but is associated

    with significant network overhead, suitable for small

    private networks, limiting the network’s scalability.

    Hyperledger fabric is suited for private networks,

    works on PBFT, and has a pluggable CM. To achieve

    consensus, the majority of the nodes must agree

    on the block addition. For writing SCs, the frame-

    work supports the “Go” language and “Chaincode”

    [135]. The framework provides data confidentiality,

    efficient processing, and identity management and is

    suitable for low-scale IoT implementation.

    2)

    Hyperledger Sawtooth with PoET: Designed by

    Intel, this framework is suitable for low-powered

    systems. The nodes solve a hash problem, and

    the winning node is chosen randomly on a ran-

    dom waiting time using Intel’s softguard extension.

    The contracts on Sawtooth can be written in any

    language, and various CMs can be plugged into

    the same chain [136]. It usually employs PoET,

    which offers low computational requirements, High

    ization. Hyper ledger Sawtooth platform is suitable

    for permissioned and permissionless BCs and pro-

    vides features such as live data streams suited for

    IoT environments. The framework, however, suffers

    from Security and Privacy issues.

    3)

    IoTa with Tangle: Tangle is a distributed communi-

    cation protocol that does not work on transaction fees

    suitable for IoT. Tangle enables a parallel transaction

    verification mechanism which decreases the conver-

    gence time and reduces latency in the system. How-

    ever, the framework suffers from storage and security

    problems and is prone to centralization. IoTa uses

    DAG, which minimizes the system’s network and

    transaction overhead [132]. The latency is low and

    has been specifically designed for IoT applications.

    Iota enables high throughput but does not support

    SCs and suffers from privacy issues.

    C. Security architecture of BIIT systems

    BCT is evolving as a key paradigm in addressing these

    issues of IoT. In BIIT systems, BC is added at the security

    level and works on a distributed consensus scheme where

    each IoT transaction is verified, and every message can be

    traced to the origin. BIIT systems work in a p2p distributed

    manner, and each entry is time-stamped. The data blocks

    are integrated using cryptographic hashes, and the Merkle

    tree stores all atomic transactions. The tree’s root hash is

    verified to secure all the transactions underlying it.

    To understand the BIIT system’s security mechanism, the

    Hyperledger fabric for IoT BC security architecture has

    been considered, consisting of five levels: [137]

    1)

    Perception layer: The IoT node layer collects the

    data from heterogeneous environments and is pre-

    processed, transformed, and stored on BCs.

    2)

    Network Layer: All nodes are given equal priority

    and transmit the data. Each node contains the data

    authentication protocol information and block net-

    work mode.

    3)

    Consensus layer: The layer works on the PBFT

    algorithm, suitable for constrained IoT environments

    because of less energy consumption and lower com-

    putational overhead.

    4)

    Smart Contract Layer: The SC layer stores contracts,

    incentive mechanisms, and other scripts. SCs are set

    up in the certification authority.

    5)

    Application Layer: The layer is responsible for col-

    lecting, storing, verifying, and processing the data

    blocks. The IoT application interface enforces the

    node transaction process and provides AC services.

    Mechanism: The devices are registered and granted AC

    rights which are defined in the SC. Various sensing devices

    collect data of various types and in varying formats. This

    data is pre-processed, and preliminary information is ex-

    tracted through a hash function and asymmetric encryption.

    The heterogeneity is removed by transforming the data into

    a fixed-length base to keep a uniform format. The data is

    time-stamped, stored in a block, and broadcasted to the

    whole network. The gateway nodes hash the data, storing

    the table in the block. The time-stamp archives the key

    block information such as the source, and digital signature,

    which imparts traceability. Any node can act as a miner to

    carry out authentication. A block node validates the received

    data according to the data structure, source, time-stamp,

    and other information. The data from a legitimate source is

    added in chronological order, and the transmission from

    a malicious node is restricted. The data is stored in an

    immutable fashion on the chain.The IoT transactions are

    verified using a PBFT consensus algorithm, ensuring that

    no false data is stored on the system. The SCs are triggered

    in case of an event, and the contract clauses are invoked to

    handle the misbehavior by one or more nodes. SCs enable

    cross-domain interoperability by implementing scripts for

    various states. The SCs also eliminate human/third-party

    intervention for invoking the rules in case of a malicious

    attempt. At the top, application services are provided, and

    access rules for cross-domain interactions are maintained.

    The architecture has five prime advantages-Improved secu-

    rity, increased cross-domain interoperability, data integrity,

    data traceability, and automated decision making.

    8. BIIT systems and IoT Security tasks

    More and more devices are being connected in the

    IoT application domains with advancements in sensing and

    actuating technologies. Verifying the legitimacy of the com-

    ponents for secure communication, authentication schemes,

    and secure routing protocols (RP) are essential criteria in

    IoT sensor networking. In Table IV, the literature study of

    the recently proposed security architectures of BIIT systems

    has been summarized vis-`a-vis security tasks identified in

    Section 3.3.

    A. Primary Study of the BC Solutions:

    In [138], the authors propose a BC-based distributed KM

    scalable architecture with fine-grained auditing capability

    for hierarchical AC. The architecture consists of 3 main

    components- A device layer containing the CPS devices,

    a BCT-based security access manager (SAM) network at

    the fog layer, and multiple BC networks on the cloud

    for KM. The user keys are secured and not under the

    control of a key generation center, and the information

    is instead stored on the SAMs, which act as the miners

    on the chain employing a PoW consensus algorithm. The

    information is offloaded to a BC-based cloud for access

    across multiple domains and reduces the blocks’ burden.

    The cross-domain operations are allowed after the cloud

    manager verifies it and sends it to the SAM. In the case of

    frequent accesses, the information is stored in the BC with

    the same deployment domain. The target difficulty in the

    model is 17 bits for a SAM device, and the average time

    consumption decreases with transaction collection time (Tc)

    with the assumption that there are enough power resources

    to carry out the verifications. The performance evaluation of

    the model for cross-domain operations shows that the time

    consumption in carrying them out is the same during each ½

    Tc period. The architecture provides fine-grained auditing,

    but its performance evaluation runs on various assumptions,

    such as that all the management domains have the same

    number of user equipment. The mining is done after the

    propagation procedure ends, and the SAMs have the same

    transmissibility to propagate transactions and mining time.

    In [139], the authors propose a theoretical architecture for

    BC-based AC mechanisms with enhanced trust mechanisms

    and increased portability. The architecture consists of 3

    prime layers- Resource layer (RL), BC layer (BL), and

    Application layer (AL). The model aims to formulate an

    AC mechanism for defending against attacks in an untrusted

    environment. The model adopts the PBFT algorithm for

    consensus, an endorser makes endorsements for the trans-

    action, and a transaction handler executes the chain codes.

    Users communicate with ALs through a client application

    for registration and requesting AC. BL is at the core and

    is deployed on every component in the private network.

    It consists of 3 components – web controller, transaction

    handler, and ledger. All the actions such as identity creation,

    executing access protocol creation, and resource creation

    happen in the BC. All the requests are saved in the BC in an

    immutable and non-resistant manner. The model’s security

    analysis shows resistance to AC message tampering until at

    least 1/3 nodes of the network is not compromised. The

    model is suitable only for the low-scale implementation

    and is compromised if the network complexity increases,

    creating latency and storage problems.

    In [140], the authors propose a BC-based AC mechanism

    for verifying IoT end-points and providing access tokens

    for querying resources. The architecture is gateway-based,

    where IoT devices communicate with the gateway instead

    of the internet, and conversely, any communication to

    IoT devices goes via gateways. The gateway serves four

    purposes- protocol bridge, AC, secure communication, and

    proxy BC. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) act as the

    gateway approver, vendor device authentication is done by

    the vendors, and the gateway acts as an authorization server.

    The AC state is distributed across all nodes and stored on

    the SCs. A trusted administrator does the SC deployment,

    and signing of ISPs and vendors. The AC is carried out in a

    few stages- gateway authentication done by an ISP, vendor

    authentication of devices by the owner under each domain,

    and the gateway handles outside requests by verifying and

    granting access requests. The outside requestors need to

    build secure channels with gateways before communicating

    to IoT for access. The ISPs are discredited in case of

    untrusted behavior, and the domain owner has complete

    control over the requests coming through the gateway. The

    model is evaluated over trust, security, and performance.

    The security analysis shows that the attacks can happen

    if the attacker leverages massive computational resources,

    which are costly or compromise the approvers, mitigated by

    using a certification authority for vendors. The architecture

    is centralized and needs a trusted intermediary. The authors

    argue that IoT systems cannot be entirely decentralized and

    employ trusted approvers for authenticating end-points. The

    architecture relies on ISPs to route traffic carrying security

    verifications, while BC provides validation.

    In [141], the authors propose an SC-based data sharing and

    AC mechanism for end-point communication in IoT devices

    to resolve trust issues. The proposed system consists of

    SCs for DM in an untrusted environment. Three SCs are

    used – Access control contract (ACC), Register Contract

    (RC), and Judge Contract (JC). ACC maintains the AC for

    any requester and oversees the overall communication AC

    and data sharing between IoT devices. RC is responsible

    for the authentication of requests and registers them. The

    behavioral analysis is done by JC, which checks the node

    for misconduct and generates alert messages. An ACC

    is invoked when an AC request is sent, and the request

    is forwarded based on the access permission level. After

    objects accomplish the request, the corresponding transac-

    tion is stored on the chain. The security analysis shows

    that the proposed system is open access and secure, and

    the trustworthiness is maintained throughout using SCs.

    The model is evaluated against cost and shows that ACC

    consumes more execution and transaction energy than other

    SCs.

    In [142], the authors propose a BC-based AC mecha-

    nism with secure delegation services, an integrated BCT

    network for eliminating a central delegation service, and

    event and query-based services. The device is assigned

    to a private group, and subsequent permissions are given

    through a delegation mechanism performed by a BC. The

    architecture consists of low-powered IoT devices, powered

    user devices with computation and storage capacity, an

    application manager for user interface and registration, an

    IoT manager for data filtering and query management, a BC

    Manager (BCM) for SCs and AC management. The BCM

    registers the IoT devices and deploys an SC for each device.

    BCM allows delegates to activate or deny the permission

    stored in the SC. The SC stores devices’ platform hashes

    and delegation policies. The BC miners verify before any

    permission activation. The proposed model is for private

    networks for increased throughput and reduced latency, but

    the model cannot be replicated on large-scale IoT systems

    without affecting the network performance.

    In [143], the authors propose a BC-based privacy-preserving

    and rewarding private data sharing scheme, a BC-based

    incentive mechanism for private data exchange.The data

    owner publishes private data and receives a payment anony-

    mously in the BC, while data consumers obtain licenses

    anonymously through SCs, where licensing technology en-

    sures access control for multi-sharing. The authors leverage

    Monero technology to ensure the untraceability and un-

    linkability of DUs while getting private data, ensuring that

    no one can develop a dat user behavior profile database.

    The authors incorporate the non-frameability characteristic

    into the anonymous incentive data sharing scheme. Honest

    data consumers can refute the frame up using a deniable

    ring signature without revealing their genuine identity. The

    authors present the security model, provide the formal secu-

    rity proof using the random oracle model, and demonstrate

    the model’s feasibility in real-time IoT architectures. The

    authors have proved the effectiveness of their technique and

    compared it to various undeniable ring signature schemes.

    The results reveal that the computational cost increases

    linearly as the number of ring members increases.

    In [144], the authors propose an efficient BC-assisted secure

    cross-domain device authentication mechanism, inducing

    inter-domain trust and privacy in IIoT applications. Identity-

    based signatures induce authentication in this mechanism,

    and privacy is induced by designing the identity manage-

    ment mechanism. The cross-domain authentication privacy

    perseverance also introduces a key negotiation mechanism

    to prevent eavesdropping on the insecure channel by negoti-

    ating session keys. The architecture consists of four layers.-

    Entity layer(EL), Agent layer(AL), BC Layer (BCL), and

    Storage Layer(SL). EL consists of a key generation center

    (KGC) and IIoT devices. KGC is responsible for the gener-

    ation of private keys for IIoT devices. AL consists of the BC

    Agent Server (BAS)and Authentication Agent Server(AAS).

    The model employs three types of authentication- Unilateral

    authentication, where users authenticate a device, Mutual

    authentication, where two devices authenticate each other;

    and cross-domain authentication, carried by KGC, BAS, and

    AAS. The domain-specific information is encapsulated into

    the consortium BC node in transactions and is acquired

    by other domains for authentication. The authentication

    agent server executes signature generation and verification

    operations on behalf of requesting devices. With an increase

    in the number of endorsing and validating nodes, the BC

    consensus time increases, introducing latency in the system.

    In [145], the authors proposed an out-of-band two-factor

    authentication scheme to prevent impersonation attacks on

    large-scale IoT devices using “device relationship” and

    BCT. The out of band performs the secondary authentication

    to distinguish home IoT devices from the malicious IoT de-

    vices. There are four components of the said authentication

    scheme- Authentication Subject(AS), which is any device

    that wants access to resources, Related Device(RD) that

    performs secondary authentication, BC that stores the ‘Re-

    lationship information’ for every authentication subject with

    the related device and Authentication Executor (AE) which

    coordinates the two factors out of band authentication. A

    relationship contract stores the mapping of AS address

    to ‘Relationship data’. When an AS requests access, AE

    retrieves the corresponding information from the BC, selects

    the RD in the AS neighborhood, and sends the correspond-

    ing action sequence. The corresponding RD invokes SC to

    send the verification result to BC, and finally, AE checks

    BC for verification results utilizing SC. The model has not

    been implemented on commercial IoT devices due to close-

    sourced hardware and software, and there are considerable

    CPU and memory overheads in the authentication stage.

    In [146], the authors propose a BC-based authentication

    mechanism for the low-power sensor nodes that are part

    of p2p networking using the sequence number of sensor

    nodes. This paper proposes verification through SHA 64-

    bit hash function to confirm confidentiality and integrity

    without compromising performance. The sink node(SN)

    assigns the sequence numbers by a broadcast-response-

    based mechanism for registering legitimate devices. The SN

    keeps a record of the other node’s identity in the form of the

    Ids, sequence number, and hash value; therefore, the sink

    detects a malicious node by verifying the sequence number

    and the hash value. A mutual level node authentication

    model is used where a node and its sequence number store

    all other nodes’ sequence numbers. The node identifies the

    particular node for communication, compares the corre-

    sponding sequence number, and verifies the message by

    comparing the transmitted hash value. Thus neighbors’ hash

    function detects a malicious node and secures the model

    from impersonation. However, as the network complex-

    ity increases, the sink node has to store many sequence

    numbers. Further, the sink node acts as a point of failure,

    and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow other

    malicious nodes to transmit the messages.

    In [147], the authors propose an authorization and au-

    thentication mechanism for LW IoT devices that improve

    the IoT network’s performance. The proposed mechanism

    is based on the public BC mechanism and uses a fog

    computing network to achieve the desired task. The system

    architecture is divided into two layers: the device layer

    and the fog layer. The device layer consists of the many

    low-powered and low computational devices responsible for

    generating the data in the network. The IoT devices can

    116

    be grouped depending upon the customized functionality

    they perform. The fog nodes in a particular group perform

    the same functionality. On the other hand, the fog layer

    is a BC-enabled fog device connected to the internet for

    working together. The fog nodes perform the CM execution

    to validate the transactions and create the blocks. The

    mechanism proposes three phases -The initialization phase

    consists of registering the system and devices with the

    closest BC-enabled fog nodes. The device authentication

    phase involves authenticating the devices with the BC-

    enabled fog node by mapping the system ID, device ID, and

    public address. Device-to-device communication involves

    the secure transmission of the message between the same

    system’s fog nodes or different systems. Before the device-

    to-device communication, both the devices are authenticated

    by the BC-enabled fog node. After that, a block is created

    in the BC, and subsequently, a secure channel is established

    between the devices. However, this mechanism assumes that

    fog nodes and admin are trusted and that communication

    between fog devices and nodes is secure.

    In [148], the authors propose a node authentication model

    for the IoST(Internet of Sensor Things) based on the BC

    mechanism. The base station validates any node’s creden-

    tials whenever it performs any action in the network.The

    authors have employed identity authentication with PoA

    as the consensus approach to reduce computational costs.

    The miners are pre-selected, and following the authenti-

    cation request, the registered nodes are authenticated.The

    request contains IDNode(Node ID), MACAddrNode(MAC

    address), and ReputationNode(the reputation value assigned

    to a certain node based on its previous history in the

    network ), which are already stored on the BC. The au-

    thentication is carried out by comparing the credentials of

    nodes previously stored in the BC. The BC determines

    whether or not the credentials provided by nodes match

    the credentials currently stored in the BC. If the credentials

    match the information provided, the nodes are authenticated

    and broadcast as legitimate nodes. A SC is deployed on the

    base stations that track all the network transactions. The

    system model is predicated on two assumptions: Firstly,

    base stations are accepted as legitimate and provide secure

    services to consumers, and secondly, symmetric keys are

    securely transferred in the network.

    In

    [149],

    the

    a

    strategy

    based

    on

    BC-enabled

    fog

    nodes

    that

    inter-

    face with Ethereum SCs to authenticate users to access

    IoT devices.The major stakeholders include Administra-

    tors(responsible for controlling access permissions for IoT

    devices), End users(interested in requesting an IoT de-

    vice service), Fog nodes(for localized storage), and cloud

    servers(storing IoT data), all having direct access to SCs via

    an Ethereum client in the case of fog and cloud nodes, or via

    a front-end application/wallet in the case of administrators

    and end-users. IoT devices have unique Ethereum addresses

    (with public and private keys), but they lack connectivity

    and do not interact with SCs. The system interactions

    are divided into off-chain and on-chain. In the on-chain

    interactions, the admin constructs the SCs, registers the

    IoT devices, maps them to a fog node, and may grant

    end-users access to certain IoT devices. The SCs check

    the list of authorized users, and the user receives a SC

    acceptance token which it uses to authenticate itself off-

    chain. The authors have provided the security analysis of

    the architecture,but the cost analysis of utilizing Ethereum-

    based SCs is unaccounted for.

    In [150], propose a decentralized BC-based architecture

    with SCs to allow edge computing nodes to store IoT

    data and securely interact with one another.The archi-

    tecture is composed of 4 layers- Information aggrega-

    tion layer(consisting of IoT-like devices), Edge computing

    layer(consisting of edge devices with fair computation capa-

    bilities), Service supporting layer(responsible for provision

    of services), and Application layer.The collaboration with

    other edge computing nodes must first be certified by the

    edge computing nodes, which will result in the exchange of

    MicroCoins(introduced cryptocurrency) between members.

    The model uses a publish-subscribe mode, allowing users

    to access data across domains. The users or application

    developers first subscribe to the data publisher from the

    edge computing node pool for data exchange. The data

    publisher then supplies the subscription data and submits

    a transaction to the BC-enabled SC to manage the pre-set

    business model while providing the required data. The au-

    thors introduce a new CM called Proof-of-Edge computing

    to reach consensus among all edge computing nodes and

    avoid centralization. All corresponding operations must be

    documented in BC to obtain self and other domain audits.

    In [151], the authors propose integrating Network Function

    Virtualization(NFV), software-defined network(SDN), and

    BC to create a flexible and reliable routing architecture

    for IIoT. SDN and NFV are responsible for creating pro-

    grammable forwarding devices that create the network’s

    optimal routing policies. The controllers are secured using

    BCT and take decisions and collect the data from the

    nodes to detect mistrust. A secure path is acquired by

    adequately removing the malicious node from the IIoT

    network by periodic monitoring and collecting network

    data. Each controller has a distributed ledger, and malicious

    nodes are identified by calculating the network’s trust value

    during behavior authentication stored in the BCs. The

    synchronization reaches a consensus among various ledgers

    transmitted through a control channel. Different controllers

    handle routing requests through an access point. The exper-

    imental evaluation shows that the model outperforms the

    state-of-the-art systems in average delay over attacks and

    packet loss rate. However, the frequent calculations of trust

    values lead to substantial computational power, bringing

    overheads in the system, which must be addressed without

    compromising the model’s security.

    In [152], the authors propose a routing protocol for the

    wireless sensor network that uses BCT to make routing

    more efficient and secure. The nodes present in the network

    are treated as the coins, and the routing path for the message

    is treated as the transaction, which is subsequently added to

    the BC. Initially, all the nodes are owned by the sink and

    considered inactive, and the rest are active. When an event

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    117

    occurs, the nodes access the BC to find the optimal path to

    the sink. Dijkstra’s algorithm obtains the message’s optimal

    path by a cost function determined by signal and interfer-

    ence. This optimal path is the transaction to be added to the

    BC and transmit the message after eliminating malicious

    nodes detected by the BC security mechanism. The routing

    process is made secure by trusted cryptographic algorithms

    such as ECDSA224 and SHA512. While transmitting the

    message to the sink, the node seeks the ‘ownership’ of

    the path’s nodes transferred back after successfully sending

    the message. However, the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages. Complex calculations are involved in

    finding routes that increase the computational overhead and

    network cost.

    In [153], the authors propose a BC-assisted secure routing

    algorithm for a network based on 5G new radio for the

    swarm Unmanned Aircraft System(UAS) to prevent the

    disruptive attacks committed on UAS networking. The BC

    performs two main functions -Selecting the secure next

    hop for transmission of a packet from one to another

    and the authentication and verification of UASs. The BC

    distributed updated block digests to the whole swarm after

    a UAS is authenticated. The BC used is LW, which is

    different from the conventional BC distribution. Instead of

    using conventional mechanisms, the traffic status of UASs

    is leveraged to achieve a consensus known as Proof of

    Traffic(PoT). The neighborhood of UAS is decided based

    on the destination and record of the digest in BC, and each

    UAS in the swarm delivers packets to its neighbors with

    beamforming. The block digest records are checked so that

    the unauthenticated UAS are not chosen as hops. The attack-

    ers need the specific BC digest to launch an attack, which is

    computationally very expensive. PoT employs the passive

    broadcast for block synchronization, unlike conventional

    algorithms, which reduces the system’s overheads suitable

    for LW environments. However, the model assumes that the

    hackers cannot compromise a UAS in joining the swarm

    UAS networking. The untrusted UAS cannot recuperate

    the signal with side lopes leakage of beamforming without

    directional transmission.

    In [154], the authors propose a malware detection technique

    in IoT devices using Deep Learning (DL)and BCT, where

    SCs detect malicious applications. SC guides users’ and

    end-developers’ interactions, stores information about new

    apks, and enables tracking of malicious apps on the net-

    work. The malware features are shared and trained on DL

    models in android IoT devices. After the user uploads an

    app to the network, it is stored in an IPFS where the DL

    models extract features. The hash values obtained from the

    training models are stored in an immutable fashion on a BC

    network to prevent decompilation and repacking attacks by

    reverse engineering methods. When a user downloads a new

    app, the user sends the hash to the network for verification,

    where an SC decides whether the app is malicious or not.

    The model has been evaluated on 18,850 android appli-

    cations and 10,000 malware android packages and shows

    considerable efficiency. However, the analysis of bandwidth

    consumption by the IPFS based storage is not given, which

    is important, especially in the case of metered connections

    In [155], the authors propose a BC-based framework for

    detecting malware in mobile applications before down-

    loading. The model relies on dynamic and static analysis

    for detecting malware. The model uses two external and

    internal BCs. The internal private BC(IPB) contains feature

    extractors(FEs) to extend the dedicated internal private

    BC(DIPB). FE extracts information during the lifetime of an

    app. These features can be static, extracted from the file, or

    dynamic and extracted by monitoring the run time behavior.

    Each FE component is connected to a DIBP that tracks

    each app using the behavioral information. A dedicated

    external private BC(DECB) for each application contains

    scanning information of application versions. A determinant

    agent(DE) is part of the BC and based on the data in the

    BC, it classifies the app as malicious or not. DEs attach their

    decisions to DEPBs with relevant information. Although

    the dedicated BC for each app reduces the computational

    burden of one BC, it also increases the system’s overall

    complexity.

    In [156], the authors propose a distributed anti-malware

    protection mechanism to support a hybrid signature and

    anomaly-based detection model. When a new file is added,

    the users make a signed hash of the file corresponding

    hash is sent to the BC ledger. The verification is done on

    signature-based detection, and the system process and ports

    are checked for malicious activity. However, the signature-

    based verification suffers from detection evasion if the hash

    of the malicious file is changed. To avoid this, if the hash

    comparison does not match, a notification is sent to the

    users, and the system process and network ports are con-

    tinued to be examined. If any suspicious activity is found,

    the file is blocked from self-executing. The BC is updated

    with the hash of the malware file detected. This can prevent

    DDoS attacks where the malicious app may attempt to gain

    access to IoT devices. However, the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but not for resource-constrained IoT

    devices.

    In [157], the authors propose a three layer parallel dis-

    tributed architecture for storing and sharing IoT data-

    BC layer, Node layer, Distributed storage layer aimed to

    improve the scalabilty of BC-based systems. The data

    generated by IoT devices is encrypted, and the hash value

    of the data is generated and stored in the BC as its unique

    identity. BC is the system’s control layer and is responsible

    for validating transactionsand data access control and also

    provides a platform for SCs to support various applications.

    The raw data is encrypted locally and stored in multiple

    storage nodes across the distributed network using the

    Kademlia method so that the data host has no access to

    the original data. The encryption technique used is AES

    (Advanced encryption standard). The data owner adds a

    digital signature to the data block’s digest, allowing the

    data’s ownership to be authenticated. The efficiency analysis

    reveals that in a network of 2n nodes, retrieving any data

    requires a maximum of n steps.

    118

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    In [158], the authors propose a BC-based solution for the

    decentralized storage mechanism and secure data transmis-

    sion, in this case, a sensing image, in IoT networks. This

    paper proposes using an encryption algorithm for secure

    data transfer and an intelligent verification algorithm for

    data storage and signature verification. A blocking algo-

    rithm is employed for sensing an image, and an intelligent

    sensor divides the image using image sensing and block

    data partitioning. A public key generation algorithm is

    leveraged, and the smart image sensor securely transmits

    the key information to BC. The sensor signs the data

    blocks with different keys at different intervals and transmits

    the message to the server, where a signature verification

    algorithm is employed. If the signature is verified, the data

    block is stored. The theoretical analysis shows that the

    model is resistant to counterfeit, theft, replay, and DoS

    attacks. The BC uses only one public key to authenticate

    different blocks, reducing the cost, but the intelligent sensor

    calculates n+1 keys for n blocks and stores n keys.

    In [159], the authors propose a theoretical prototype of

    BC-based IoT architecture using a design science research

    approach. The approach aims to design a prototype for data

    center decision-making, simplicity, complete digitization,

    tamper resistance, heterogeneity, and authentication of BC

    data. The Raspberry Pi is configured as a client node

    for the Ethereum BC, containing the storage and compu-

    tational configuration layer. The model has three prime

    components- IoT data logger(senses the data), SCs (stores

    data, chain address of the devices, and records events),

    and the monitoring dashboard component(displays data to

    end-users, communicates with the SCs, and behaves as a

    mining node). The system considers Ethereum BC, where

    SCs are executed on a virtual machine to reduce costs. The

    accounts on Ethereum are classified as contract (contain

    balance and contract storage executed via a transaction sent

    to its unique address)and externally owned(refer to external

    agents and contain only balance). The prototype is designed

    for high data availability, parsimony, and modularity in

    IoT ecosystems essential for efficient DM, but the design

    encounters high operational costs and scalability issues.

    In [160], the authors propose a trusted DM scheme for

    sensitive data distribution and storage in EC. The ar-

    chitecture is divided into three layers- Edge device(Fog

    nodes), BC Network(to which data is committed), Edge

    nodes(provides services), and Cloud center layer(complex

    problem solving). BlockTDM is reliant on a multi-step mu-

    tual authentication scheme based on certificates. A modified

    PBFT - broadcast multi-signature-based CM is employed

    where a client commits the message to the endorsing

    pairs (EPs) and the management pair(PM). PM verifies the

    signature, the endorsing pairs simulate, and the result is

    broadcasted to an ordering service peer and delivered to

    the bookkeeper. A multichannel matrix-based architecture

    is considered for data protection for blocks on different

    channels and user-defined data encryption for interchannel

    security. The scheme employs Hyperledger Chaincode as

    an SC connected to the EPs and is invoked to process

    transactions and query over the protected BC data. SCs are

    designed for data of various kinds, such as multimedia and

    documents, to support specific block DM. The model is

    highly secure but has O(n2) communication complexity.

    In [161], the authors propose a BC and Deep reinforcement

    learning(DRL) based scheme for efficient DM to achieve

    high-quality data collection with limited mobile terminal

    (MT) energy resources and sensing range and secure data

    sharing in Industrial IoT. The model proposes collecting the

    data through a DRL approach fed to the BC network. The

    connection of each MT is validated, and data is encrypted

    using keys and digital signatures. BC integration ensures

    data security and reliability when MTs share data and

    prevents the systems from attacks. Multiple Ethereum nodes

    are distributed across a private chain that interacts with the

    SC deployed on the chain. A certification authority is set up

    to maintain the data’s reliability and authenticity to avoid

    fraudulent transactions by MTs. The model is tested on the

    severity of DoS and DDoS attacks, and it is that DDoS

    attacks have a 0.1 % worse impact than DoS attacks. The

    increase in MTs does not impact the network, but both

    the attacks affect the database as the transaction frequency

    increases affecting the data storage.

    1) Critical Analysis of the proposed architectures:

    The evaluation of these studied techniques reveals that

    a tradeoff exists between IoT security and other perfor-

    mance criteria. Most of the proposed frameworks have been

    carefully verified against several security metrics, but the

    cost issues for customers or businesses are not addressed.

    The model in [145] cannot be implemented on commercial

    IoT devices due to close-sourced hardware and software,

    and there are considerable CPU and memory overheads in

    the authentication stage. In the architecture presented in

    [146], the sink node has to store many sequence numbers

    as the network complexity increases. In [151], the frequent

    calculations of trust values lead to substantial computational

    power, bringing overheads to the system. In [152], complex

    calculations are involved in finding routes that increase

    the computational overhead and network cost. In [154],

    the analysis of bandwidth consumption by the IPFS-based

    storage is not given, which is important, especially in the

    case of metered connections. In [155], the dedicated BC

    for each app increases the system’s overall complexity. In

    [160], the model has a communication complexity of O(n2).

    Many architectures have ignored or not completely ad-

    dressed the issues of latency, scalability, energy consump-

    tion, computational power, or the security aspect of privacy

    leakage. Most methods restrict to a certain aspect of IoT

    security while ignoring the computational overheads of

    implementation on a large scale. The architecture of [139] is

    suitable for the low-scale implementation, but the network

    performance is compromised if the network complexity

    increases, creating latency and storage problems. The model

    is resistant to AC message tampering until one-third of

    the network is not compromised. The proposed model in

    [142] is for private networks and cannot be replicated

    on large-scale IoT systems without affecting the network

    performance. The architecture proposed in [144] suffers

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    119

    from latency issues when the number of endorsing and

    validating nodes increases. The design in [159] encounters

    high operational costs and scalability issues.

    The authentication, trustworthiness, and authorization in

    many BC-based architectures are achieved through SCs,

    introducing transactional costs. In [141], ACC consumes

    high execution and transaction energy. In [149], the security

    analysis is provided in-depth, but the cost analysis of

    utilizing Ethereum-based SCs is unaccounted for. Many

    architectures provide security but are not suitable in con-

    strained environments. In [156], the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but cannot be replicated for IoT

    devices.The architectures are not truly decentralized and

    run on some form of central scheme and are prone to

    security issues. In [146], the sink node acts as a point of

    failure, and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow

    other malicious nodes to transmit the messages. BC-based

    systems incur high storage costs too. In [161], the increase

    in MTs does not impact the network, but both the attacks

    affect the database as the transaction frequency increases

    affecting the data storage.

    Many architectures rely on assumptions that may not be

    practically true. The architecture presented in [138] runs

    on various assumptions, such as that all the management

    domains have the same number of user equipment, the min-

    ing is done after the propagation procedure ends, the SAMs

    have the same transmissibility to propagate transactions and

    mining time and that there are enough power resources to

    carry out the verifications. The architecture of [148] runs on

    the assumption that base stations are always legitimate and

    that symmetric keys are securely transmitted in the network.

    In [147], the mechanism assumes that fog nodes and admin

    are trusted and that communication between fog devices and

    nodes is secure. In [152], the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages.

    B. Security benefits of BIIT systems :

    Despite the limitations, there are significant benefits of

    BIIT systems. The information created by IoT frameworks

    is broadly significant and confidential, and BCT substan-

    tially increases the security in distributed networks. BIIT

    systems offer the following security merits:

    1)

    Data integrity and confidentiality: The transactions in

    BIIT systems are verified through a CM, and all the

    nodes have an identical copy of the ledger. The data

    and transactions are highly encrypted by leveraging

    cryptographic mechanisms intrinsic to the BC.

    2)

    Data provenance: BIIT systems offer traceability by

    keeping a historical record of the timestamp in the

    BC.

    3)

    Fault tolerance: In BIIT systems, the data is dis-

    tributed across multiple devices, and a single node

    failure does not disrupt the system’s functionality.

    This eliminates a single point of failure and makes

    the BIIT systems more robust than centralized IoT

    systems.

    4)

    Secure communication and resistance to attacks: CM

    prevents the malicious nodes from corrupting the

    system. Launching an attack requires leveraging high

    computational resources.

    5)

    Trust management: BCs bring trust in the commu-

    nicating nodes and, through SCs, provide rules that

    guide a user’s authorization. SCs invoke clauses in

    the event of mistrust and penalizes the user for the

    breach.

    6)

    Access control: BIIT systems provide uniform access

    across multiple IoT systems. In BIIT systems, the

    IoT device is coupled with a unique identifier, and

    efficient KM and AC mechanisms for interoperability

    are available.

    7)

    Removing third-party risks: BCs decentralize the

    structure authority and provide secure DM with a

    decentralized architecture. Thus, the data is not under

    the control of a private organization but distributed

    across a plurality of nodes.

    BIIT systems offer higher security than centralized IoT

    architectures. A comparison is given in Table V.

    9. Challenges, Open Issues, and Research Directions:

    BCT is emerging as a key paradigm for establishing

    trust, imparting security, auditing capability, and verifia-

    bility in systems. BIIT systems are secure but require a

    scalable architecture with sufficient throughput and low

    latency. IoT systems are constrained, and designing less

    intensive security measures for low-powered devices with

    low storage, computational, and network overheads are in

    progress. The constrained nature of IoT and other factors

    hinders the deployment of BIIT systems, briefly discussed

    below:

    1)

    Cost of IoT storage through SCs: In Ethereum SCs,

    the amount of computational work required to com-

    plete an operation in a transaction is measured in

    Gas units. The currency to pay for Gas units is Ether/

    gwei (1 gwei= 10-9 ethers). There is no fixed price

    set for the gas, and the sender enforces a gas limit

    in the transaction and specifies the gas cost. Miners

    mine the blocks which specify high gas prices. The

    price of Ethereum has risen from a single-digit USD

    value in 2015 to touching 2500 USD in 2021 [162].

    Suppose a transaction requires 100 million gas units

    with 1 gas unit set at 25 gwei; the corresponding

    price in dollars to complete the transaction would

    be 108x25x 10-9x2500=6250 USD. With more de-

    vices in the network, data storage complexity also

    increases. BCs store an immutable, permanent record

    of data, and with the increase in the nodes, the

    size of the chain also increases, which causes stor-

    age/memory concerns. Although BC eliminates the

    management costs in a system, it is considerably

    expensive to store data in a BC. Ethereum costs

    76000 USD per GB, which is very expensive for

    120

    IoT applications. The research is moving towards

    cost analysis and solutions for IoT storage through

    BC SCs. In [163], the authors investigate the storage

    costs of numeric data on BC through SCs. The data

    storage is conducted using two strategies. In scenario

    1, the data is stored in an array, and in Scenario

    2, the data is encoded into one variable using two

    methods- Encoding within SC and encoding outside

    SC. The experimental results show that encoding the

    data outside SC into one variable is cost-efficient

    compared to storing data in an array or encoding it

    into a variable within SC.

    2)

    Power consumption: IoT devices applyenergy-saving

    strategies such as “Sleep and Wake up” scheduling

    to increase the network lifetime. However, due to

    BC’s unique way of storing and continuous data

    processing, the energy consumed by such a system is

    considerably higher than conventional systems. The

    authors in [164] estimate the energy consumption of

    various cryptocurrencies. The processing power is

    measured in hash rates. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 and

    has a rated power network of 4291,366 KWwhich an

    IoT node cannot support. Mining is computationally

    expensive, which necessitates specialized machinery

    and massive quantities of electricity.It is challenging

    to run BC as a full node on IoT devices. Recent solu-

    tions suggest using edge computing to enable mobile

    devices to offload the mining work to the cloud.

    Edge computing can be incorporated to help mobile

    devices offload mining work to cloud resources.

    The authors in [165] propose a 4-layer BC-based

    framework for IoT where the devices and servers

    participate in BC via p2p communication. The end

    devices handle simple operations while more pow-

    erful servers support the complex operations in the

    top tiers at the edge/cloud.

    3)

    Network model in BC systems: The expansion of

    the BIIT system creates new requesting blocks. The

    requesting block and the state data must lead to

    a consistent system state, and the newer clients

    synchronize with the existing state. The majority

    of the BC-based traffic models are p2p. The au-

    thors of [55] categorize it into three types- Gos-

    sip Protocol, Kademlia Algorithm, and DAG. The

    gossip-based BCs offer relatively less latency and

    energy consumption but achieve data integrity at

    the cost of large message overheads [166]. The

    Kademlia algorithm works with lesser communica-

    tion overhead, and the resource location in DAG is

    guaranteed. Ethereum also employs p2p networking

    with no trusted intermediary. The nodes themselves

    act as the service and the service providers to en-

    sure data synchronization [167]. Ethereum follows

    a discovery protocol that allows the nodes to find

    each other. BlIT systems must satisfy consistency

    in an asynchronous network with reduced latency

    and increased security. The security of consensus

    depends on the underlying network. Studying the

    network extensively to determine what affects the

    performance of a p2p network is an important issue.

    In [168], the authors study the network structure

    of Ethereum by running a customized version of

    Ethereum’s Go client, GETH, for seven months.

    4)

    BC Security and Privacy vulnerabilities: BC-based

    systems provide high security to systems by making

    data tamper-proof. However, BC itself exhibits secu-

    rity vulnerabilities. The adversity tolerance is further

    reduced with modifications in CMs for LW environ-

    ments. Common security threats to BC include Pro-

    tocol attacks, Ellipse attacks, the chance of double-

    spending, Consensus protocol attacks, SC Vulner-

    abilities, Programming frauds, Private Key Leak-

    age, DDoS attacks, and other security issues[169],

    [170]. Employment of communication security pro-

    tocols such as Datagram transport layer security

    is resource-intensive and not suitable. Further, all

    transactions in the BC are transparent. By analyz-

    ing the patterns of transactions from a user, the

    anonymity of a user can be compromised and lead to

    potential front-running. For private communications,

    protocols such as Telehash or Whisper can be inte-

    grated. Privacy leakage can be countered through pri-

    vacy protection mechanisms such as Zero-knowledge

    proof, Attribute-based Encryption [171]. However,

    these cryptographic algorithms are highly resource-

    intensive and unaffordable in LW environments.

    5)

    SC Vulnerabilities: A fault in the SC could be caused

    by a simple typing error, a misinterpretation of the

    specification, or a more severe programming error.

    BC is irreversible, and a minor glitch has many

    ramifications for SC security and functionality. For

    example, the quantity of gas that the transactions

    contained in the block can utilize is limited to

    prevent the chains from growing beyond a point. If

    data is stored in variable-sized arrays and accessed

    through loops, the gas can get exhausted before

    committing a transaction. Miners are compensated,

    but the transaction is reversed. As a result, testing

    mechanisms for SCs is a critical problem. The test

    mechanism must inspect the SC on enough data

    for all malicious and non-malicious inputs before

    deployment to detect anomalies. Furthermore, be-

    cause IoT systems are distributed across multiple

    locations, retrieving data from various sources can

    cause the SCs to become overburdened. It’s difficult

    to fine-tune SCs for IoT LW applications. SCs are

    associated with a variety of other challenges. The

    legal enforcement of SCs, for example, is currently

    restricted. Dual integration of SCs with real-world le-

    gal contracts is one solution that has been proposed.

    6)

    IoT specific Consensus: The abilities of the existing

    CMs are limited when applied to IoT and have not

    been tested thoroughly. Conventional CMs, such as

    PoW, is resource-intensive and cannot run on IoT

    devices. Even a powerful IoT node such as Rasp-

    berry pi3 can only achieve 104 hashes per second,

    122

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    while a Bitcoin network can conduct around 1019

    hashes per second. Integration of full BC nodes in

    IoT is in the nascent stage. Malicious attacks on

    lightweight CMs with low adversity tolerance can

    prevent valid transactions. A potential solution is

    to limit the consensus to the edge / decentralized

    cloud, while IoT nodes save only the hash values,

    but this increases the storage overheads on the edge.

    Furthermore, the interoperability and authentication

    standards for edge devices are limited.

    7)

    Throughput, Latency, Scalability, and Network com-

    plexity:BC systems do not scale well if the network

    size increases massively. The network efficiency re-

    duces as the network scales up and more authen-

    tication requests are handled, leading to network

    congestion. The growth of the chain further leads

    to bandwidth problems. The mobility of IoT devices

    also affects BC performance. BCs are inherently

    latency tolerant, and the mining time is induced to

    secure the networks further, which is unacceptable

    in real-time IoT systems such as IoV. A poten-

    tial solution is to integrate IPFS, AI, and ML to

    complement the BC. Off-Chain solutions can be

    integrated to increase the transaction throughput.

    IoT big data is posing challenges in real-time data

    delivery. Integration of ML in BIIT systems for IoT

    Big data analytics is hindered by storage, latency,

    scalability, and other challenges. Further investiga-

    tion is required to analyze the overheads introduced

    in BC-IPFS integration. Normalization and compres-

    sion techniques explicitly designed for BIIT systems

    where BC power is leveraged are required.

    8)

    Compatibility and Adoption: BC is an emerging

    technology and lacks standardization laws. Access

    control legislation is an issue in public BCs. IoT data

    is heterogeneous, and the diversity of IoT devices

    implies the need for different network protocols. Pro-

    tocol conversions to enable smooth communication

    are especially costly in BIIT systems. The large-

    scale adoption of BIIT applications needs significant

    infrastructural changes. A generic BC-IoT architec-

    ture is needed to bridge the gap between IoT service

    providers and BC. IoT service providers must modify

    the underlying naming and discovery schemes to

    comply with the BC mechanism. Laws and regula-

    tions concerning information security govern the IoT

    domain, and many countries have strict legislative

    rules regarding cryptocurrencies.

    A. Research Directions

    We present the following research directions based on

    our thorough study of the domain.

    1)

    1. Cost reduction strategies: The rising cost of

    Ethereum is impeding the use of BC in IoT. More

    research into strategies to lower the cost of BC

    adoption in IoT is needed. Given IoT Big data’s con-

    cerns, more efficient data representations that allow

    low-cost SC operations require further investigation

    to make large-scale IoT-BC systems commercially

    viable.

    2)

    IoT-BC Traffic Models: Performing large-scale data

    collection and traffic analysis of growing-BC chains

    is an understudied topic due to large-scale simulation

    and time requirements. The security of the consensus

    protocols is based on the assumption of efficient

    p2p overlay network operations. More research is

    needed to understand the parameters that influence

    the properties of p2p networks.

    3)

    Testing Mechanisms for SCs: The voids in the

    SCs can expose BC security. SCs are vulnerable to

    mining pool attacks because they are open source

    to all parties involved. Once deployed, the SC is

    irreversible and cannot be repaired in the event of

    a virus or a hacking attack. Thus, validating and

    devising unerring testing mechanisms for SCs and

    running them on sufficient data is an important

    research direction.

    4)

    At the Edge Consensus: IoT devices have limited

    computational and networking capabilities; thus, run-

    ning BC as a full node is difficult. It is critical

    to protect IoT suitable CMs from attackers from

    gaining control of the majority of hash power. De-

    signing IoT suitable mechanisms with good adversity

    tolerance and low latency is an open issue and a

    strong research direction.

    5)

    Integration with computing platforms:Due to the

    constrained nature of IoT devices, Fog /Cloud

    servers are added at top tiers, storing the entire BC

    information for transaction validation. It is necessary

    to enable IoT devices to push transactions to the

    BC without centralized block endorsement groups.

    Designing architectures for such integration without

    compromising the security and privacy concerns is a

    strong research direction.

    6)

    Network Configuration: There is no standard archi-

    tecture for BIIT systems. Integration of the cloud

    and the edge at a higher level is critical. Config-

    uring BCs at the node, edge, and cloud levels and

    load balancing and network congestion control for

    addressing increased validation requests are open

    research issues.

    7)

    Convergence of BC and ML: BC-based systems

    can benefit from the addition of MLalgorithms. SCs

    can be used to create a reward-based mechanism

    for training ML models. The potential of ML-BC

    integration has yet to be fully realized, but it is a

    promising future direction.

    8)

    Convergence of BC and IPFS: With IPFS, BC only

    saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down the

    chain development drastically. Through SCs, BC can

    allow access-controlled file sharing and secure stor-

    age of cryptographic hashes of IPFS. It is crucial to

    analyze the latency introduced in the IPFS primarily

    due to the contact with BC and the consequences on

    LW operations.

    9)

    Securing BC and Transactional privacy: Pattern anal-

    ysis of transparent transactions exposes users’ pri-

    vacy. More research is needed to protect BC-based

    AC systems from security threats. Thus, a potential

    research direction is developing LW cryptographic

    algorithms for BCs to protect transactional and user

    privacy in BC-based IoT systems.

    10. Conclusion

    The disruptive attacks on IoT networks are predicted to

    be more severe in the future due to the advanced capability

    of B5G and 6G networks. The unique properties of BCT

    for enabling a p2p network with no centralized stakeholder

    controlling the system enable it to be a perfect security

    solution. BCs, through SCs, provide fine-grained AC by

    providing global functions of authentication, authorization,

    and KM, besides providing a distributed architecture for

    secure storage of hashes, verification rules, sensor data, and

    other information. However, IoT devices are constrained

    and require an LW implementation of CMs to bear the

    computational, storage, power, and network overheads. This

    paper presents a comprehensive comparison of BC solutions

    for IoT systems and concludes that BC can provide efficient

    KM and AC, node authentication, routing security, and se-

    curely store the domain-specific information. A detailed sur-

    vey of recent research on security enhancement, consensus,

    applications, integration with ML, and computing platforms

    is presented. We discuss IPFS, ML, and EC can facilitate

    BC as a crucial enabling technology for IoT. Through IPFS-

    enabled BCs, the growth of the chain is restricted by only

    storing hashes on the BC, and the AC list is maintained

    by SCs, enforced by the updated IPFS software. MEC is

    being considered to be a potential approach for achieving

    consensus for mobile users, facilitating BC applications in

    future mobile IoT systems.

    The convergence of BC and ML for IoT can enable ac-

    curate data analytics. 6G systems are expected to create

    a massive convergence of IoT, AI, EC, Quantum ML,

    and BCT for fast and secure systems that can support

    a plethora of devices. IoT systems are rapidly evolving,

    and as the number of network nodes grows, the tradeoffs

    between energy consumption, security, latency, throughput,

    and scalability become more complex. We conclude that

    BC and IoT technology have evolved separately and for

    futuristic IoT systems to reach their full potential, exten-

    sive research is needed in two domains- a) Blockchain as

    enabling technology in IoT and b)Enabling technologies

    for BC-based IoT. Challenges such as the rising cost of

    Ethereum, power consumption of IoT nodes, SC security,

    and legislation issues are hindering the large-scale adoption

    of BC-based IoT. Extensive research is needed on the

    parameters affecting the network properties, cost reduction

    strategies, encoding, traffic modeling, off-chain solutions,

    network configuration, transactional privacy, SC testing, and

    BC security, especially in LW environments.

    to 5G-enabled wireless access networks for social robots in public spaces (SRPS).
    The use of social robots (SR) in public areas requires specific Quality of Service
    (QoS) planning to meet its unique requirements. Its 5G threat landscape entails
    more than cybersecurity threats that most previous studies focus on. This study
    examines the 5G wireless RAN for SRPS from three perspectives: SR and wireless
    access points, the ad hoc network link between SR and user devices, and threats
    to SR and users’ communication equipment. The paper analyses the security threats
    to confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorisation, and
    privacy from the SRPS security objectives perspective. We begin with an overview
    of SRPS use cases and access network requirements, followed by 5G security standards,
    requirements, and the need for a more representative threat landscape for SRPS.
    The findings confirm that the RAN of SRPS is most vulnerable to physical, side-channel,
    intrusion, injection, manipulation, and natural and malicious threats. The paper
    presents existing mitigation to the identified attacks and recommends including
    physical level security (PLS) and post-quantum cryptography in the early design
    of SRPS. The insights from this survey will provide valuable risk assessment and
    management input to researchers, industrial practitioners, policymakers, and other
    stakeholders of SRPS. Security Threats to 5G Networks for Social Robots in Public

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations

    Get rights and content Abstract Drones have recently become one of the most important
    technological breakthroughs. They have opened the horizon for a vast array of
    applications and paved the way for a diversity of innovative solutions. Integrating
    drones with the Internet has led to the emergence of a new paradigm named the
    Internet of Drones (IoD). Several works dealt with the security of the IoD, and
    various surveys have been published on this topic over the past few years. The
    existing surveys either have limited scope or offer partial coverage of cybersecurity
    countermeasures. To address these gaps, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive
    survey related to the cyber and physical security of IoD. Differently from many
    surveys that only provide a classification of attacks/threats, we also propose
    three taxonomies that are related to (1) the assets of drones, (2) attacks, and
    (3) countermeasures. The first taxonomy is a two-level classification of the assets
    in the IoD. The first level considers the coarse-grained assets, which refer to
    the IoD''s tangible elements, and the second level considers the fine-grained
    assets, which refer to the elements composing the coarse-grained assets. Based
    on the asset classification, we propose a taxonomy of attacks targeting the coarse
    and fine-grained assets, which allows a finer level of granularity to identify
    threats, and thus ensure better security. Also, we evaluate the risk of cyber
    and physical attacks by introducing a novel concept, named Chain of Impact, which
    connects four types of impacts, namely, Direct, Mission, Drone, and Environment.
    We propose a taxonomy of technical and non-technical countermeasures according
    to two implementation phases: Pre-incident, and Post-incident (or recovery). The
    pre-incident countermeasures are further classified as: preventive and detective.
    In addition, we present the countermeasures along with their performance and limitations.
    Finally, open research challenges are identified and ranked according to the level
    of attention they should receive from the research community. Also, future research
    directions and suggestions are presented for the security of the IoD. Previous

    assessmentCountermeasure 1. Introduction The Internet of Drones (IoD) has recently
    emerged as a new paradigm where a set of flying vehicles/devices communicate among
    themselves with a Ground Control Station (GCS) using the Internet to perform a
    variety of tasks in different domains, such as disaster management, smart agriculture,
    environmental monitoring, surveillance, military, smart city management, healthcare,
    and more recently, controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [28], [161]. For instance,
    some companies like Amazon adopted drones in their delivery systems, which helps
    them in ensuring fast delivery of parcels and lightweight freights and increasing
    the delivery rates. The IoD can also be used in rescue operations by delivering
    medical supplies and goods to people in remote and isolated areas. In precision
    agriculture, farmers can make real-time decisions based on data collected from
    drones. IoD has helped decrease the spread of COVID-19 infection by quickly delivering
    protective equipment and transporting the blood tests to laboratories. In general,
    the IoD offers reduced costs, time-efficiency, and high coverage surveillance
    and monitoring operations. Fig. 1 presents different application domains of IoD.

    Fig. 1. Application domains of IoD. According to the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA), [261], more than 900,000 drones were registered in the USA in August 2021.
    This number is continuously increasing due to the variety of benefits the IoD
    brings. As the IoD is utilized in different application domains, it has been targeted
    by attackers to cause harm to cyberspace, drones, people, and properties. The
    drones could be the target of an attack, or a means to perpetrate attacks and
    crimes. Therefore, the research community has paid increasing attention to IoD
    security, how to manage it securely, and address the cyber and physical attacks
    targeting them. The deployment of IoD encompasses several challenges, particularly
    concerning the safety of operations. Several issues must be considered when deploying
    networked drones over the Internet. For example, a loss of connectivity may lead
    to fatalities. Furthermore, the drones'' communication and networking system is
    heavily exposed to cyber security attacks and threats, which may result in disasters
    if not adequately addressed. In this survey, we address the above challenges and
    discuss their countermeasures. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive overview
    of the IoD, starting from the drone system itself, and going through the different
    architectural models, applications, requirements, communication systems, and cloud
    integration. In the literature, there are some surveys [14], [21], [62], [64],
    [110], [141], [173], [193], [307], [318], [325] that cover different aspects of
    IoD security. However, most of the surveys are short or restricted to a single
    security sub-topic. Others do not cover countermeasures or physical security.
    These gaps have motivated us to propose a more comprehensive survey on IoD security.
    Differently, this survey covers the cyber and physical security of the IoD, assesses
    the risks, and proposes three fine-grained taxonomies that are related to (1)
    components of drones (i.e., assets), (2) attacks, and (3) countermeasures. It
    assesses the cyber and physical risks of the IoD. It also provides a more comprehensive
    review by covering novel security topics such as operating system security. In
    particular, the main contributions of our survey are the following: 1. We present
    existing IoD-related surveys that cover several areas, including communication,
    cyber-physical systems (CPS), path planning, optimization, flight control, and
    security. Moreover, we compare the previous IoD security surveys and outline the
    key novelties of our survey. 2. We propose a two-level classification of the components
    in the IoD. The first level considers the coarse-grained assets, which refer to
    the IoD''s tangible elements, and the second level considers the fine-grained
    assets, which refer to the elements composing the coarse-grained assets. This
    classification allows a finer level of granularity to identify threats; hence,
    better security can be ensured. 3. Based on the asset classification, we propose
    an attack taxonomy that considers the cyber and physical attacks targeting the
    coarse-grained and fine-grained assets. 4. We evaluate the risk of cyber and physical
    attacks, by introducing a novel concept, named Chain of impact that connects four
    types of impacts, i.e., Direct, Mission, Drone, and Environment. 5. We propose
    a taxonomy of countermeasures according to two implementation phases: Pre-incident,
    and Post-incident (or recovery). The pre-incident countermeasures are further
    classified as preventive and detective. We provide better coverage of countermeasures
    by describing them and analyzing their strengths and limitations. We also cover
    novel topics, such as operating system security. 6. We identify ranked research
    challenges and recommend future research directions. The survey structure is shown
    in Fig. 2. The rest of the survey paper is organized as follows: In Section 2,
    we present non-security and security-focused related surveys on IoD and identify
    the main differences with our survey. Section 3 provides an overview of the IoD.
    Section 4 presents the two-level asset-based and attack-based taxonomies and the
    cyber and physical risks that could affect the different components of the IoD.
    In Section 5, we provide a taxonomy of countermeasures and describe the different
    techniques. Section 6 identifies open issues and recommends some suggestions and
    future research directions. Finally, Section 7 concludes this survey. Download

    Structure of the survey. 2. Related surveys In the literature, several surveys
    have covered various areas of IoD. Table 1 presents the different IoD surveys,
    and their corresponding focused research areas. Many surveys focused on communication
    and networking [34], [92], [102], [111], [130], [206], [258], [339], and flight
    control [150], [168], [169], [280], [332], [345]. Some surveys paid attention
    to cyber-physical aspects [272], [310], channel modeling and identification [142],
    [159], [327], path planning, mobility, and trajectory mining [101], [103], [219],
    [324], [346], traffic monitoring [133], vision, and target identification [66],
    [131], [178], optimization [47], [52], [227], and collaboration [19], [60], [312].
    The rest of the surveys [41], [160], [204], [220], [273] were not limited to a
    specific area, but they either covered different areas or provided a general overview
    of the IoD. Table 1. Non-security surveys on Internet of drones. Research topic

    find some surveys in the literature that cover different aspects of IoD security.
    As shown in Table 2, we classify the IoD security surveys concerning the following
    criteria: • Taxonomy: It indicates whether the survey provided a taxonomy that
    organizes and classifies the state-of-the-art into different categories. In general,
    a taxonomy could help the research community better understand a research topic,
    identify issues at a high level of granularity, and guide future research efforts.
    • Cyber security: It indicates whether the survey considered the cyber security
    aspect of IoD. • Physical security: It indicates whether the survey considered
    the physical security aspect of IoD. • Risk assessment: It indicates whether the
    survey provides an assessment of risks against IoD. This assessment helps identify
    the risks that require more attention from academia and the industry community.
    • Countermeasure: It indicates whether the survey presented countermeasures to
    protect the IoD. • Open issues & future directions: It indicates whether the survey
    discussed open issues and provided recommendations for future research. • Observation:
    It states any observations related to the survey. Table 2. Security-focused surveys

    privacy, and safety regulations of drones for smart city applications. Altawy
    et al. [21] described the cyber and physical threats to civilian drones. They
    also identified the corresponding security field for each threat that should be
    adopted, as well as research challenges and future research directions. He et
    al. [110] presented a short overview of threats and countermeasures related to
    IoD. Choudhary et al. [62] proposed a taxonomy to classify attacks with respect
    to the compromised security property, including confidentiality, integrity, availability,
    privacy, and trust. In [64], a short survey on intrusion detection systems (IDSs)
    in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) environments is presented. The authors proposed
    a taxonomy to classify the state-of-the-art IDSs according to different criteria:
    (a) information-gathering sources (i.e., sensors, communication links, GCS, UAV),
    (b) deployment strategies (i.e., ground-coordinated and autonomous), (c) detection
    methods (i.e., specification, signature, and anomaly-based), (d) detection states
    (i.e., on-site and off-site), (e) IDS acknowledgment (i.e., instant and periodic
    acknowledgment), and (f) intrusion types (i.e., malware, message forgery, routing
    attacks, etc.). The authors also provided research challenges and future research
    directions for IDS in the UAV environment. Lin et al. [173] presented security
    solutions against some attacks, such as privacy leakage (i.e., identity and location),
    forward and backward security, insider attacks, and untrusted cloud service providers.
    Kharchenko et al. [141] analyzed and assessed the network vulnerability of IoD
    using the Intrusion Modes and Effects Criticality Analysis (IMECA) technique.
    Each vulnerability is assessed according to the occurrence probability and severity.
    In [318], authentication protocols for IoD are presented and compared with ensured
    security properties, communication cost, and computational cost. Open research
    challenges in the field of IoD authentication are identified. Yaacoub et al. [325]
    presented the threats that target drone systems and the threats that could arise
    from using drones to commit crimes and damage the physical environment. They also
    gave their countermeasures and proposed recommendations to improve drone security.
    Alladi et al. [14] surveyed many blockchain applications in UAV networks. Although
    security is not the main topic of this survey, the authors presented the different
    scenarios where blockchain can be used to secure UAV networks. Mehta et al. [193]
    focused on security issues in UAVs with a 5G communication network. They classified
    the security issues with respect to compromised security property, including authentication,
    privacy, integrity, and availability. They also presented blockchain-based security
    solutions in UAVs and proposed future research directions toward integrating blockchain
    with 5G-enabled UAV networks. Yahuza et al. [326] classified the attacks against
    drone systems into two major categories: attacks that lead to localization errors
    of drones and attacks targeting security and privacy requirements. The attacks
    of the second category are further classified into subcategories with respect
    to integrity, availability, confidentiality, authenticity, and privacy. The authors
    also presented mitigation countermeasures for each attack subcategory. 2.1. Comparison
    with related surveys Most of the IoD security surveys are short [110], [141],
    [173], [307], or restricted to one security sub-topic such as IDS [62], authentication
    [318], and blockchain [14], [193], and some surveys do not present countermeasures
    [62], [141]. Our survey differs from the earlier-mentioned works in the following
    points: • Novel taxonomies: Differently from many surveys that only provide a
    classification of attacks/threats, our survey proposes three taxonomies that are
    related to (1) components of drones (i.e., assets), (2) attacks, and (3) countermeasures.
    The proposed taxonomies allow a finer level of granularity for asset identification,
    which permits broader identification of possible attacks, and determines where
    to implement the countermeasures at the fine-grained level. It also determines
    when to implement the countermeasures. • Risk assessment: There are no surveys
    that provide risk assessment related to IoD, except for [62], which presents a
    partial assessment by only considering the impact of threats. This assessment
    is based on a new concept called chain of impact. It aims to help researchers
    from academia and industrial communities identify the risks that require more
    attention and stronger countermeasures. • More coverage of countermeasures: We
    provide a more comprehensive survey than the related surveys regarding countermeasures.
    Only two surveys consider physical security [21], [325]. The same surveys [21],
    [325] only give a summary description of the countermeasure solutions. On the
    other hand, our survey presents the technical and non-technical countermeasures
    covering the three cybersecurity layers, i.e., preventive, detective, and recovery.
    It also discusses the solutions and presents their limitations. • Operating system
    security: Our survey is the first one that discusses the security aspects of drones''
    operating systems. • Ranked open issues: This survey is the first one that provides
    a ranking, which prioritizes the open issues in the IoD that require attention
    from the research community. It defines three priority and ranking levels, i.e.,
    high, medium, and low. 3. Overview of Internet of drones 3.1. Physical structure
    of a drone An unmanned aerial system is composed of a rigid body called a frame,
    and multiple motors are attached to this frame to generate the required thrust
    to lift the system in the air. There are different types of drones, depending
    on the number of motors attached to them, as shown in Fig. 3. • Tricopter: It
    has three motors, where two motors are brushless, and one is a servo motor. The
    brushless motors are typically used in small UAVs, and they are called so because
    they have no brushes in their commutator. They have higher efficiency as compared
    to brushed motors. The servo motor is a device that has an internal encoder, which
    allows converting any motion into a digital signal. The role of the servo motor
    in the Tricopter is to control the orientation (i.e., yaw) of the UAV. They present
    the advantage of being low-cost but are less reliable and robust than the other
    types. • Quadcopter: It is the most common type of drone and has four brushless
    motors attached to each of its four wings and deviated by 90 degrees from each
    other. There are two possible configurations: (i) Quad-X, where the front direction
    of the UAV is in the middle of the two front motors, and (ii) Quad-Plus, where
    the forward direction of the UAV is looking at the first motor of the quadcopter,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3. The motors rotate either in a clockwise direction (CW)
    or a counter-clockwise direction (CCW). For the Quad-X, the top-left and right-bottom
    motors must rotate in CCW, and the top-right and left-bottom motors must rotate
    in CW. Quad-X configuration is preferred for First Person View (FPV) applications
    because it provides a better camera view. • Hexacopter: It has six motors attached
    to its frame. The angle between two consecutive wings is 60 degrees. This model
    has the advantage of providing 50% more thrust than a quadcopter model, thanks
    to its other two motors, but at the expense of higher energy dissipation from
    the two extra motors. This allows to carry heavier payloads and ensures a more
    reliable flight due to the redundancy but results in a 35% reduction of the flight
    time using the same battery as a quadcopter model. It also has two possible configurations:
    Hex-X and Hex-Plus. • Octocopter: The Ocotocoper model has eight motors attached
    to its frame. The angle between two consecutive wings is 45 degrees. It is used
    for heavy payloads, such as carrying water tanks in smart agriculture or firefighting
    scenarios. This model is highly reliable as it can tolerate the power of any two
    non-consecutive motors without losing the ability to fly. It is also suitable
    for aerial photography. The Ocotocoper model is substantially more expensive than
    all other frame models due to the cost of extra motors and higher-capacity batteries.
    It also consumes much more energy due to the extra motors and the heavier weight.
    Similar to Quadcopters and Hexacopters, Octocopters can also be configured as
    Oct-X and Oct-Plus. Download : Download high-res image (325KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Multicopter models. 3.2. Architecture of the Internet
    of drones This section presents the concept and architecture of IoD and its main
    components. The objective is to provide the reader with the general technical
    background to understand the different actors in an IoD ecosystem. In [99], the
    authors presented a generic abstract architecture that can be implemented by any
    IoD system while they focused on the concept of the layered networked control
    architecture. In this section, we present the architecture of the IoD ecosystem
    using a multi-layer system approach, where each layer identifies an actor in the
    system. The proposed architecture is also generic and instantiated on any specific
    IoD platform. The general architecture of the IoD is presented in Fig. 4. We decompose
    an abstract IoD system architecture into the following five major layers: • The
    Drone Layer: This layer refers to the flying aerial unmanned systems, which are
    equipped with: (i) sensors to collect data from the environment, and (ii) actuators/containers
    to carry the payload between different locations. The drone''s sensors depend
    on the type of data to collect. RGB camera sensors are used for collecting images
    and videos in applications such as inspection, surveillance, AI-based computer
    vision [36], photogrammetry, and aerial surveys. Multi-spectral cameras are used
    in agriculture use cases to improve the efficiency of large farming operations,
    including plant health assessment, disease detection, and plant counting. Thermal
    cameras are used in search and rescue operations and structural health monitoring.
    Weather sensors can be used to collect atmospheric data. In the IoD context, each
    drone must be identifiable, i.e., it has a unique ID. It is essential to track
    every drone in the ecosystem and send it to control commands through the network.
    Furthermore, a unique ID is crucial from a security perspective in case of crashes
    or any hazards caused by the drone''s operation. Drones must also be securely
    connected to the Internet to allow their secure tracking and monitoring in real
    time. • The Communication Layer: It refers to the communication protocols used
    to connect drones with the other actors and components of the system. Typical
    broadband communication systems are used, such as satellite communication, telecommunication
    networks (3G/4G/5G) [156], long-range WiFi [42], WiMAX [69], and IEEE 802.15.4
    [153]. In the case of mission-critical or military applications, the communication
    layer may use private and proprietary protocols to avoid possible threats, such
    as jamming and interference. The communication protocols must also be secure,
    in particular encryption, to avoid unauthorized access to the data. The communication
    layer must provide reliable and secure services to the drone layer considering
    the criticality of the drone''s operations. The required communication bandwidth
    depends on the application type. For high throughput applications, such as real-time
    drone video streaming and vision-based applications, the communication layer must
    provide high bandwidth channels to ensure streaming quality [154]. Bandwidth requirements
    are less stringent for IoT-like applications collecting low-rate data streams.
    • The Network Layer: A network of drones can be organized in different topologies
    and architectures depending on the application''s requirements. We can categorize
    the network layer into two main categories: (i) centralized architecture: a server
    or a ground station acts as a central node and coordinates the communication between
    the drones and users. This architecture is typically used in cloud-based UAV systems,
    where the cloud orchestrates and manages the UAV missions [156], and (ii) distributed
    architecture: there is no central entity that manages the communication between
    UAVs, but the communication is fully distributed and ad hoc. A UAV Swarm is a
    team of drones that communicate in an ad hoc manner to perform the desired mission
    [44]. In a typical scenario, one drone leader is chosen to coordinate the tasks
    of the drones without any intervention from external users, centralized ground
    stations, or servers. The distributed architecture is challenging because it requires
    the complete coordination of the drones in the swarm. However, this is hard to
    achieve because it involves broadcasting messages among the drones, resulting
    in flooding problems. Furthermore, the distributed architecture will require advanced
    ad hoc routing protocols, which is hard to accomplish due to the highly dynamic
    nature of drones'' motion in swarms. Security is a concern for centralized and
    distributed networking architectures because messages must travel via multiple
    hops. Routing protocols must embed security mechanisms to avoid any data compromise.
    • The Cloud Layer: The cloud layer is used for providing computation and storage
    services to drones and users. As UAVs are typically used to collect visual data,
    image frames are streamed to the cloud, which processes them using deep learning
    algorithms (i.e., convolutional neural networks) that are computation-intensive
    and storage-greedy and cannot be executed on typical drones. These algorithms
    might perform object detection and image segmentation and execute generative models,
    which are pretty demanding in terms of resources. The cloud also permanently stores
    the UAV flight mission data for possible scene reconstruction and analysis. The
    cloud can specify the business logic and constraints governed by the authority
    and applied by drone operators to coordinate drone missions, including flight
    schedules, mission planning, geofencing, and law enforcement. The cloud also regulates
    the traffic through the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) system, which manages
    drone operations and traffic among stakeholders (Client Layer). On the other hand,
    cloud storage and processing often represent a major concern regarding data privacy.
    Privacy-preserving approaches such as homomorphic encryption [12] were used with
    deep learning for aerial image processing to avoid disclosing private data on
    the cloud. Besides, the cloud should provide security features, including authentication,
    data integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation for all actors in the IoD
    ecosystem, including users, operators, and drones. • The Client Layer: This layer
    refers to the end-users who use and manage the system through the Internet. It
    relies on software Application Program Interfaces (APIs) using Web services to
    interact with the cloud. The users monitor the UAVs through dashboards and remotely
    send commands to control them. Users can also perform video surveillance as UAVs
    stream their collected video frames through the cloud. The client application
    may provide several services and business rules for drones'' missions (implemented
    in the cloud back-end), such as traffic management, geofencing, and path planning.
    There are different types of end-users (depending on the application and usage
    of IoD), which are referred to as stakeholders at the client layer. Let us consider
    a classic use case of a drone delivery mission, where a user requests a delivery
    mission of a package from a drone service provider. This scenario implies three
    types of users, including: – Operators: they represent drone service providers
    that operate drone missions, such as drone delivery missions, surveillance, and
    inspection. – Basic Users: these users interact with the cloud to request drone
    delivery services from the operators. – Authority: it represents the regulatory
    board that specifies the policies and by-laws of drone operations in the airspace.
    This may include civil aviation and defense authorities, as examples. The authority
    is responsible for validating the mission before the operator is allowed to execute
    the delivery mission. Other types of applications may imply other types of users.

    Fig. 4. Internet-of-Drones Architecture. 3.3. Communication paradigms in the Internet
    of drones There have been several research works dealing with communication paradigms
    for IoD. Nowadays, the use of UAVs is widespread in civil/military applications.
    The complexity of communication systems in IoD varies; it can be as simple as
    a single UAV communicating with a ground station to carry out the objectives for
    a mission [58], [79], [236], [284], and as complex as swarms of UAV systems cooperatively
    carrying out various aspects of joint missions [27], [146], [203], [211], [217],
    [302], [311], [331]. As UAVs are generally resource-constrained devices, they
    must consider various factors when addressing IoD communications, including energy
    efficiency, latency, and security. Here we present works addressing the IoD communication
    systems at two different levels: (i) Mobile Edge-Cloud Drone Communications and
    (ii) Decentralized Flying Ad-Hoc Networks. i) Mobile Edge-Cloud Drone Communications:
    Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides cloud computing capabilities and services
    at the edge of the network. A UAV flying within the radio range of the MEC device
    can communicate with the device and provide access to a user over the cloud. This
    concept is extended to the Internet of Drones, where multiple drones connect to
    MEC device(s), effectively creating a mobile ad-hoc network within the line of
    sight. The IoD ensures highly efficient network operation and service delivery
    quality and, as a result, improves the user experience. A cyber-physical system
    (CPS) based system was proposed by Narang et al. in [217]. The researchers presented
    the system architecture of the CPS-UAV integrated solution that is deployed as
    part of a large-scale disaster response system. The authors focus on network topology
    optimization and address communication issues within the mobile edge infrastructure
    and the multi-drone network. Authors in [203] presented a UAV-based Internet of
    Things platform used in the context of a crowd surveillance application. The proposed
    architecture of this system allows UAVs to capture real-time video and offload
    this video stream to a MEC device. Leveraging the underlying LTE/5G communication
    infrastructure, the video stream is transmitted to the cloud, where the image
    recognition system processes the data. The authors in this work demonstrate the
    working of the multiple-UAV cluster implementation. Wang et al., in their work
    in [311], demonstrated a bandwidth-efficient video analytics system using UAVs.
    The proposed system architecture minimizes the communication latency overhead
    by utilizing MEC. The MEC device captures the video stream from the drones in
    proximity, compressing the video data stream, and resulting in an optimized payload.
    The communication between the MEC device and the cloud utilizes an opportunistic
    approach to reduce latency and bandwidth usage. In [308], authors presented the
    Internet of Flying Things (IoFT) and discussed the opportunities and challenges
    for airborne MEC devices. A prototype for a Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) is developed
    leveraging the fly-in and fly-out infrastructure for servers, where the flying
    UAV serves as an airborne mobile edge device. With this prototype implementation,
    it remains to be seen how the secure communication and load balancing between
    multiple MEC devices within the network would affect the system''s performance.
    The air-to-ground mobile edge network for UAVs is presented in [58]. Cheng et
    al., in this work, proposed the optimization of a multi-dimensional channel-based
    approach to drone management. The authors study the effects of the network''s
    topological changes on message transfer, scheduling, and device control. Tian
    et al. in [303] utilized a predictive authentication approach for IoD using a
    MEC device for secure communication. The drones use a lightweight online/offline
    signature to authenticate with the MEC device. The MEC manages and controls the
    authentication parameters within the MEC-drone network and serves as a secure
    communication device within the IoD. Furthermore, a predictive authentication
    approach was utilized to further reduce the cost of authentication within the
    UAV-MEC communication. ii) Decentralized Flying Ad-Hoc Networks: Another communication
    aspect in IoD communication is UAV-UAV communication. The communications between
    flying drones can essentially be mapped to a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) [212].
    Similar to the vehicular network problem studied in the context of Vehicular Ad-hoc
    Networks (VANETs), drone-to-drone communications can be realized. Each device/node
    within a FANET can store the information or relay it to the next device in a multi-hop
    configuration. Furthermore, a drone can also work as a data mule to carry the
    information to another part of the network or even to a different network. Using
    the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN), this information can be relayed to other devices
    such as drones, MEC, or even a GCS. Due to the delay-tolerant capability, missions
    can be completed opportunistically in different time frames. Flying ad-hoc network
    architecture is presented in [34]. Bekmezci et al. presented the potential advantages
    and disadvantages of ad-hoc communication between flying drones by classifying
    them into UAV-UAV, ground-UAV, and satellite-UAV communication challenges. They
    developed a protocol based on the work presented in [35]. This communication protocol
    focused on reducing the communication overhead by periodically broadcasting the
    link state updates. Similar to Bekmezci et al.''s approach to utilizing MANET
    protocols for IoD communications, many recent works have addressed IoD communication
    issues, taking the lead from works in the context of MANETs and VANETs. Due to
    high mobility within FANETs, the network topology frequently changes, necessitating
    periodic route discovery. A route-switching algorithm was presented in Yanmaz
    et al. [216]. This algorithm tracks all possible routes from a source to all destinations
    within a FANET, similar to the AODV routing protocol [214] for MANETs. Furthermore,
    due to high mobility and ever-changing network topology and avoiding the risk
    of broken routes, the proposed protocol switches to risk-free routes, when possible,
    to avoid route failure. This mechanism is based on the earlier TSODR routing protocol
    [89] for MANETs. The Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) [301] addresses FANET communications.
    A crowd of drones serving as relay nodes within the network is considered a zone.
    The communication within the zone is proactive, whereas a reactive protocol is
    used for inter-zone communication. In [174], researchers presented the GPMOR protocol,
    which predicts the movement of UAVs utilizing a Gaussian-Markov mobility model.
    This protocol considers the position of a UAV to determine the next hop in FANETs.
    It also addressed the communication delay due to network congestion by reducing
    the communication overhead. This protocol is also based on an earlier MANET protocol;
    namely, TORA [233]. The publisher-subscriber model for routing was used for MANET
    routing in [301]. Authors in [146] develop a communication protocol for FANETs
    using a data-centric approach based on this model. A UAV carries data and transports
    it to a destination utilizing the load-carry-deliver approach popular in DTN networks.
    Performance evaluation results from this protocol showed increased throughput;
    however, increasing the coverage area yields negative results in terms of overall
    performance. In [211], authors couple intrinsic properties of DTN routing with
    FANETs outlining the load-carry-deliver routing mechanism. Another work [27] similarly
    takes benefit of DTN routing protocols for MEC-UAV communication. 3.4. Cloud integration
    and computation offloading In this section, we describe recent advances in cloud-based
    IoD systems with a focus on offloading computation from drones to the edge of
    the cloud [190]. UAVs have been used as aerial Base Stations (BSs). Compared to
    ground base stations, the aerial base stations provide better maneuverability,
    can be deployed on-demand, and can relocate to positions suitable to different
    environments. Drones generally have limited onboard resources for processing information,
    and limited storage [47]. Off-the-shelf UAV devices are usually resource-constrained
    regarding three aspects, i.e., size, weight, and power [154]. These UAVs are typically
    battery-powered and can carry a limited payload. A small UAV is usually limited
    in terms of battery capacity available onboard and a maximum flight time of around
    25-50 minutes [274]. Applications or platforms requiring heavy computation may
    further drain the already limited power [154]. An IoD system may offload some
    energy-taxing computation-intensive tasks to a resource-rich drone or even to
    a Mobile Edge device within the cloud. In the context of IoD, several criteria
    can define offloading computation to the cloud ranging from fast processing of
    large information on-the-go to storage of information for a long period [47].
    Here, we describe recent works focusing on (i) latency issues, (ii) energy and
    load balancing, (iii) data management and storage, and (iv) safety, security,
    and privacy. Table 3 presents a summary of works describing task offloading in
    IoD. Here, we briefly describe the related works: Table 3. Research works in Computational

    al. [322] proposed a three-layer architecture to address the efficient task offloading
    between a UAV and MEC. They presented two algorithms: i) UAV position optimization,
    and ii) a task prediction algorithm. The proposed algorithms consider energy efficiency
    in task offloading for the UAV-MEC network considering various parameters, including
    UAV hovering parameters and accurate payload size for offloading tasks. Simulations
    validate the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the proposed algorithms
    reduce energy consumption. The authors also proposed using better optimization
    techniques to further improve the task placement on UAV-MEC systems. Wang et al.
    [314] proposed an agent-based task offloading for a UAV-aided mobile edge cloud
    system. The proposed system architecture considers latency and energy aspects
    of scheduling tasks to be offloaded to a mobile edge or cloud. The agent is designed
    to select an offloading strategy based on various parameters, including payload
    size, available resources on user devices, UAV''s available resources, and the
    MEC. An extensive simulation study is carried out to assess the impact of the
    task delay and energy consumption for offloading. The results show that an efficient
    task placement strategy is essential to improve the performance of task offloading
    to the cloud compared to scenarios with the absence of the agent. Sedjelmaci et
    al. [265] presented an efficient cyber defense framework for UAV-edge computing
    networks. The authors addressed the security vulnerabilities on task offloading
    to a MEC, including a Denial-of-Service attack to put the UAV and the MEC out
    of service. They presented a Stackelberg game-based security framework where they
    model (i) the attack behavior of latency to offload tasks and (ii) the energy
    consumption in the UAV. A MEC-based agent detects and predicts malicious behaviors
    based on various parameters. The framework is validated using simulation studies,
    and the results show that as the number of attackers increases, the prediction
    rate for malicious nodes also increases. However, a large portion of energy consumption
    is attributed to detecting and preventing malicious behaviors. Mukherjee et al.
    [213] proposed an intra-UAV swarm processing offloading scheme to address latency
    in processing-intensive tasks. They proposed a weighted-offloading technique that
    uses a Nash bargaining game between the probabilities of nodes processing the
    data or offloading to nodes by a queuing theory-based analysis of the network
    traffic in the UAV swarm. This work builds various datasets based on real-life
    hardware metrics calculated from a swarm of four UAVs in the context of rural
    farming. The authors extended this work by further carrying out an extensive simulation
    study with a large number of UAVs following various network topologies. The results
    show that the proposed scheme is highly scalable and performs faster than the
    star network topology. Koubaa et al. [156] presented a service-oriented cloud-based
    drone management system. The Dronemap project discussed in this work addresses
    the control, monitoring, and communication of drones over the Internet. Dronemap
    utilizes the ROSLink protocol [152] for seamless inter-drone communication over
    the Internet. The system incorporates the cloud offloading mechanism in Dronemap
    to offload heavy computations [154] from the drone to the cloud. This is materialized
    by the use of Web services (SOAP and REST), where the user can schedule drone
    missions to accomplish the task at hand. In this work, the authors demonstrated
    a proof-of-concept implementation of the system in various scenarios showing that
    it is scalable and can be seamlessly deployed anywhere. In another work by the
    same authors [155], DroneTrack is presented. This system develops real-time Internet-enabled
    object tracking using a UAV. The DroneTrack leverages the Dronemap planner [156],
    which is a cloud-based system that can be deployed to control and manage UAVs
    over the Internet. The authors conducted an experimental study with three scenarios.
    The experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.
    4. Cyber and physical attacks In this section, we present the security requirements
    of the IoD. Then, we provide a novel classification of assets in IoD systems.
    This classification is later used to propose a taxonomy for attacks and countermeasures.
    The proposed classification adopts the risk assessment approach, which organizations
    have widely adopted to identify all possible risks to assets, evaluate them, determine
    their impact, and make decisions on them to prioritize the implementation of security
    countermeasures. Specifically, we apply this approach by identifying the IoD''s
    possible components (or assets), i.e., where exactly the different attacks could
    compromise the IoD. This will also help us know which vulnerability is exploited,
    the magnitude of the risk, its impact, and later identify its corresponding countermeasures.
    Additionally, it will guide the academia and industry community to prioritize
    research efforts and focus more on attacks with high risks. 4.1. Security requirements
    An IoD is a cyber-physical system that needs to ensure security regarding information
    and control. In our context, security could be defined as the ability of the IoD
    to correctly perform the intended operations without unauthorized access, alteration,
    disclosure of information, or loss of assets. It is required that IoD meets different
    security requirements, including authentication, confidentiality, availability,
    non-repudiation, integrity, and privacy. • Authentication: It ensures that only
    authorized users (e.g., operators and end-users) and authorized devices (i.e.,
    drone and GCS) are granted access to IoD resources. If authentication is not ensured,
    a malicious entity can impersonate a drone, get confidential information, and
    inject malicious commands and data. • Confidentiality: It ensures that information
    is not disclosed to unauthorized users. In IoD, we can find different types of
    information: (i) data and commands that are exchanged among the different components
    of IoD, (ii) data that are captured by the drones (e.g., sensed values, captured
    images), (iii) data that are transferred over the network, and (iv) data that
    are exchanged among the subsets of the components such as system states that are
    sent on the communication channels among the sensors, controllers, actuators,
    and the transmission system. • Availability: It ensures that all components of
    the IoD should perform the required operations correctly (i.e., monitoring, computation,
    control, actuation, transmission, and storage) and should be available when it
    is requested. • Integrity: We consider two integrity properties: data integrity
    and system integrity. Data integrity ensures that no malicious or accidental modification
    or deletion of data, such as telemetry data and commands, is performed. Failure
    to satisfy data integrity could also lead to the compromise of availability, e.g.,
    a flight control system that receives wrong GPS information, which negatively
    affects the mission planning of the drone. On the other hand, system integrity
    ensures that the deployed software and firmware are trusted and free from malicious
    codes. • Non-repudiation: This requirement pertains to legal issues. As drones
    are involved in different types of applications, tracking user activities is necessary
    to determine liability in case of an accident or an incident caused by drones.
    In the case of communication, non-repudiation ensures the prevention of a sender
    from denying the generation of messages or a drone from denying sending images
    or messages. Also, piloting drones carelessly can result in physical damage and
    loss. Non-repudiation aims to ensure that the drone and the drone operators cannot
    deny their activities. • Privacy: The drone mission can reveal user-specific information,
    such as visited locations and captured data. Therefore, drone missions must be
    protected against traffic analysis or data capturing to preserve user data privacy.
    Moreover, if drone-collected data is processed and outsourced (such as in a cloud
    system), adequate cryptographic techniques (such as homomorphic encryption) need
    to be set up to preserve user privacy [173]. The compromise of any security requirement
    could consequently compromise the safety requirement. By safety, we mean that
    drones can fly without causing human and physical damage. Integrating IoD with
    civil airspace makes it essential to ensure that drones can safely operate within
    the commonly shared aviation system and environment. A drone must avoid colliding
    with other drones, properties, and people. 4.2. Two-level asset-based classification
    An asset is a concept primarily used in risk assessment methodology, which refers
    to any tangible or intangible objects that have value to the organization. Asset
    identification represents the first step in risk assessment. It helps identify
    the threats that could harm the assets and consequently identifies the countermeasures
    that can be put in place to mitigate these threats. In the IoD context, an asset
    means any element of the IoD required to operate the IoD and its applications
    (Fig. 5). Therefore, it needs to be protected against cyber and physical threats.
    For better protection of the IoD, we adopt a fine-grained asset identification
    approach, which allows broader identification of possible threats, and hence better
    security can be achieved. To this end, we propose a two-level asset-based classification.
    In the first level, we find coarse-grained assets, which refer to the tangible
    elements of the IoD and the wireless communication media that interconnect these
    elements. In the second level, some coarse-grained assets can be divided into
    multiple fine-grained assets. Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. IoD assets. More precisely, in the IoD context,
    we propose the two-level asset-based classification, which considers the following
    coarse-grained and fine-grained assets, as shown in Table 4. • Drone: It consists
    of the following fine-grained assets: – Flight control system: It is the CPU that
    allows the pilot to fly the drone using steering commands and signals provided
    by the embedded sensors. It also provides the actuators'' updated information
    to adjust their speed and trajectory. – Transmission system: It represents the
    communication interface that allows the drone to communicate with the ground control
    system and other drones. – Sensors: The drone includes different sensors to sense
    its physical environment, like an accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic orientation
    sensor, barometer, and camera. The data from sensors are used to compute the driving
    force of the motor, the movement direction, and the altitude for the drone to
    fly. – GPS receiver: It is a device that calculates the drone''s geographical
    position based on signals received from satellites'' navigation systems. – actuator:
    It is a device that helps the drone to make the right movement decision. This
    is done by converting energy into mechanical actions. The drone''s motor is one
    of the best examples of an electromechanical actuator. – software: It is the component
    that connects the user to the drone''s hardware. The generic software architecture
    of a drone consists of (a) system software, which includes firmware, device driver,
    and operating system, and (b) application software that runs different functions
    such as: taking pictures, vision processing, video streaming, navigation, and
    mission execution. • Ground control station: It is a land-based control station
    that consists of the following fine-grained assets: – Ground control system: It
    is a software system that allows human operators to remotely control the drone
    during its operations. – Transmission system: It is used to exchange data and
    commands between the drone and the ground control system. – Mission planning system:
    It provides the flying trajectory for a single or group of drones to perform their
    missions. • Cloud: It is used to store, process, and analyze data collected by
    the drones and comprises the following fine-grained assets: – Stored data: It
    represents data obtained during drones'' missions. – Data processing model: It
    is used to analyze the stored data to get insights from the drones'' missions.
    • Wireless communication medium: It is used by communicating entities to transmit
    messages in the form of electromagnetic signals. Two types of messages are transmitted:
    – Information transmitted from drones to the ground control station or exchanged
    among the drones. – Commands that are transmitted from the human operator to the
    drones. • People: We identify two types of people: – Operators: They perform activities
    related to the drone''s mission, like piloting the drone through some commands.
    – Pre-operators: They represent people who contribute to developing the required
    software to operate the IoD. • Payload: It represents the object that is carried
    by the drone. Table 4. Two-level asset categorization. Coarse-grained asset Level-1

    HM  Payload PHO Payload PHO The coarse-grained and fine-grained assets can also
    be classified according to Level-1 type and Level-2 type, respectively, as presented
    in Table 4. More specifically, the coarse-grained assets can be classified with
    respect to Level-1 type as follows: • Physical systems (PHS): They represent all
    tangible elements with computation and communication capabilities, such as drones,
    ground control stations, and cloud systems. • Physical objects (PHO): They represent
    all elements that have neither computation nor communication capabilities, such
    as carried payload. • Wireless communication channels (WCM): They represent the
    different Wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, and 4G, which are
    used to exchange information among the physical systems of the IoD. • Human (HM):
    They represent all persons who have a role in developing, implementing, deploying,
    and operating the IoD. In addition, the fine-grained assets can be classified
    with respect to Level-2 type as follows: • Cyber fine-grained assets (CY) : They
    refer to the fine-grained assets that belong to the cyber world, such as transmitted
    and stored data and all the components that perform either computation, control,
    or communication operations. • Cyber-physical fine-grained assets (CP) : They
    refer to the fine-grained assets that connect the cyber world with the physical
    world, such as sensors and actuators. In our classification, as People and Payload
    cannot be divided into smaller entities, we consider them as both coarse-grained
    and fine-grained assets. Thus, Level-1 and Level-2 of the different types of People
    are Human. Similarly, Level-1 and Level-2 of Payload is Physical object. 4.3.
    Classification of attacks In the literature, the attacks against IoD are classified
    according to different criteria. Kim et al. [143] identified three types of attacks:
    hardware attacks against the UAV autopilot components, wireless attacks performed
    through a wireless communication medium, and sensor attacks spoofing that injects
    false data through the sensors of UAV. In [220], the attacks are classified with
    respect to the target layer, i.e., physical, data link, network, transport, perception,
    and application layers. In [156], the target layer criterion is also used to classify
    the attacks. Specifically, the attacks can be launched against three layers, i.e.,
    the proxy layer, the cloud layer, and the drone layer. In [325], the threats are
    classified as threats that target drones and threats that use drones. On the other
    hand, many works [62], [193], [326] categorized the IoD attacks based on the compromised
    security properties such as attacks on confidentiality, integrity, availability,
    privacy, trust, and other properties. However, an attacker could compromise more
    than one security property. Differently from the attack classifications mentioned
    above, we use the two-level asset-based classification, which is proposed in Section
    4.2 to introduce a novel classification of attacks in IoD. This classification
    considers the Targeted Coarse-grained Asset, and the Targeted Fine-grained Asset
    in addition to other criteria. More precisely, we classify the attacks with respect
    to different criteria, as presented in Fig. 6. The main classification criterion
    is Nature of Attack, and accordingly, two classes are identified. The first class
    covers the cyber attacks, which are presented in Section 4.4. The second class
    covers the physical attacks, which are presented in Section 4.5. The other classification
    criteria, i.e., Target, Compromised Security Requirements, and Impact, of cyber
    and physical attacks, are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 respectively. In more
    detail, the attacks are classified according to the following criteria: • Nature
    of attack: The attack can be classified as cyber or physical. – Cyberattack occurs
    when there is cyber manipulation of the system without physical access. – By physical
    attack, we mean that an adversary gains physical access to an asset to damage
    it. • Target: It specifies the asset that is targeted by the attacks. We identify
    two types of targets: – Targeted coarse-grained asset: It indicates the coarse-grained
    asset that is targeted by the attack. – Targeted fine-grained asset: It indicates
    the fine-grained asset targeted by the attack. • Compromised security requirements:
    It specifies which attack compromises security requirements. The attack can take
    two types of behavior: passive and active. Passive attacks mainly compromise the
    confidentiality requirements, whereas active attacks compromise the rest of the
    security requirements. • Impact: The attacks can inflict different types of negative
    impacts and undesirable consequences, and one impact can lead to another one.
    To this end, we introduce a novel concept, named Chain of impact, which connects
    four types of impacts: direct impact, mission impact, drone impact, and environmental
    impact, as shown in Fig. 7. – Direct impact: It compromises the following impacts
    that can lead to a situation where the IoD fails to accomplish its mission: *
    Data compromise: It includes data disclosure, data loss, and data manipulation.
    * Disruption of cyber and cyber-physical operations: The execution of some operations
    in IoD, such as computation, communication, control, sensing, and actuation, could
    be disrupted through false data or vulnerable functions. This could result in
    mission failure due to compromised trajectory, hijacking of drones, drone crashing,
    and drone collision. * Loss of communication and GPS signals: The mission of the
    IoD could be disturbed due to the absence of communication or the GPS signals.
    – Mission impact: It represents the negative effects of the attack on the mission
    of the IoD. It is characterized by the disruption of cyber and cyber-physical
    operations of IoD, such as computation, communication, control, and sensing, which
    could lead to drone hijacking. Some false information (flight commands and GPS
    signals) could also result in drone hijacking. Once the drone is hijacked, it
    could be later captured by the adversary or damaged due to a crash or collision
    with other objects. The mission could fail due to compromised trajectory, hijacking
    of drones, drone crashing, and drone collision. – Drone impact: It represents
    the attack''s negative effect on the drone''s physical availability. The drone
    could be lost when captured by an adversary or damaged when it crashes or collides
    with other drones or objects. – Environmental impact: It represents the harmful
    effects of compromised IoD on the environment. It occurs when one or more processes
    and physical assets are compromised, which can damage the environment. It includes
    human loss and physical damage to properties when drones collide with stationary
    and moving objects. Download : Download high-res image (154KB) Download : Download

    impact can be expressed, as shown in Table 5 and Table 6, as regular expressions

    the chain of impact: (1) choice among alternatives, which is indicated by the
    character “|”, and (2) concatenation, which is indicated by juxtaposition (without

    DT PL 4.4. Cyber attacks 4.4.1. Attacks targeting drones • Attacks targeting flight
    control system – Manipulation of captured footage: This attack targets low-altitude
    UAVs, which rely on the video captured by their cameras for navigation and collision
    avoidance. An attacker with a high level of knowledge of the flight control system
    can replace the genuine footage with a fabricated one. – Manipulation of flight
    controller: If the attacker can manipulate the parameters of the flight controller
    by injecting false information or through malicious software, it is possible to
    disrupt the drone''s operations. • Attacks targeting transmission system – Flooding
    attack: In this attack, the intruder floods the drone with random commands, which
    prevents its transmission system from processing legitimate commands. This denial
    of service attack might discharge the drone''s battery. Moreover, the attacker
    can prevent communication and consume the bandwidth by continuously sending random
    commands or control signals [188]. • Attacks targeting sensors – False sensor
    data injection: By injecting false sensor data, an attacker can disrupt the operation
    of the drone [3]. Examples of sensors that can be manipulated are infrared, radar,
    and electro-optical sensors. This attack targets the drone sensors asset and needs
    a high knowledge of the drone parameters to succeed. • Attacks targeting GPS receiver:
    As GPS signals are unencrypted and unauthenticated, they could be targeted by
    GPS spoofing and GPS jamming attacks. – GPS spoofing: An attacker could send fake
    GPS signals to make the GPS receiver compute the wrong geographic coordinates.
    In this way, the attacker could hijack the drone and take control of its flight
    trajectory. – GPS jamming: It is possible to jam the GPS signals and prevent them
    from reaching the drone, which leads to the drone crashing. 4.4.2. Attacks targeting
    ground control station - Manipulation of flight control commands: If the attacker
    can access the ground control system, it is possible to send malicious flight
    control commands to the drone, which could disturb its mission and could lead
    to a drone crash. - Compromising the mission planning system: The role of the
    mission planning system is to assign and schedule flight missions of the drone
    or a fleet of drones. If the logic of the mission planning system is compromised
    through malware, the mission of the UAV system will fail. 4.4.3. Attacks targeting
    wireless medium - Unauthorized disclosure of communication: As drones communicate
    through the wireless medium, interception of the exchanged message is an easy
    task, especially for attackers equipped with adequate materials. These intercepted
    messages, i.e., telemetry feeds and GCS commands, can be analyzed; hence, critical
    and confidential data might be revealed. An eavesdropping attack is difficult
    to detect as the attacker does not alter the exchanged message. However, deploying
    a strong encryption mechanism can mitigate this kind of passive attack. - Signal
    spoofing: As signals are unencrypted and unauthenticated, the transmission systems
    cannot confirm their authenticity, and hence spoofed signals from the drones to
    GCS or vice versa could negatively disrupt the drone operations. - Signal jamming:
    Signals are easily jammed, and the attacker interferes with communication between
    drones or between a drone and the ground control station, which could disable
    the communication and therefore put the system out of service. It could also disrupt
    drone operations as important command messages could not reach the drone, leading
    to crashes or collisions. 4.4.4. Attacks targeting people Social engineering attacks
    such as phishing and spear phishing aim to lure drone operators into clicking
    on malicious links and downloading malicious attachments, compromising their devices.
    A Watering hole attack is also a social engineering technique where the attacker
    infects existing websites that users visit. This way, the users could download
    malware or be redirected to other websites to access the operator''s device or
    network. 4.4.5. Attacks targeting the cloud For IoD, the cloud system comprises
    two components: (1) a database of information sent by the drones and (2) the processing
    model to analyze the drones'' data. The database could be compromised in the cloud
    due to many attacks [282]. Also, adversarial learning could target the processing
    model by injecting specific malicious input to mislead the model into making wrong
    decisions. 4.4.6. Attacks targeting many assets - Identity spoofing: an attacker
    can spoof the identity of a legitimate user to get access to the IoD system. Moreover,
    an attacker can deploy a malicious drone with a spoofed identity to interact with
    other drones or the GCS. The lack of an efficient authentication mechanism allows
    an attacker to claim a legitimate identity and therefore access drones'' carried
    data or request malicious action. - Man-in-the-Middle attack: In this attack,
    a malicious deployed drone (or malicious GCS) tricks the communicating parties
    by making all exchanged messages pass through it. In this attack, which is generally
    launched between a drone and the GCS, the malicious entity first intercepts the
    message sent by the GCS (respectively sent by the drone) and then sends a modified
    version to the drone (respectively sent by the GCS). The communicating parties
    believe that they communicate directly with each other; however, the reality is
    that each one is communicating with a malicious entity. MIM can have several impacts
    ranging from eavesdropping the communication to taking control of the drone. -
    Malicious Software: Malware such as Trojans, backdoors, and keyloggers can target
    the different assets of IoD systems, such as drones and GCSs, and result in disastrous
    impacts. There is an already available malware that targets the IoD, known as
    Maldrone [21]. Maldrone first opens a backdoored connection with its botmaster,
    thus enabling the reception of commands and taking control of the drone. The developer
    could initially implement the malicious software into the drone or access the
    drone through a malicious update of the firmware, operating system, and other
    installed applications. The drone vendors releasing software updates could be
    infected by attackers so that the drone software is also infected. - Denial of
    service attack: It aims to disturb the drone or network operation or to exhaust
    drones'' resources through the following: – Jamming attack: the attacker interferes
    with communication between drones or between a drone and the ground control station.
    A jamming attack stops the drone and ground controller communication, putting
    the system out of service. – Denial of Service (DoS): Drones are characterized
    by limited resources. An attacker can exploit this characteristic to launch a
    DoS attack through excessive utilization of resources. DoS attacks can also be
    achieved by sending successive unnecessary requests to the drone, making it unable
    to respond to legitimate user requests. – Commands flooding: In this kind of DoS
    attack, the intruder floods the victim drone with random commands, consuming the
    victim''s computation power and possibly discharging its battery. Moreover, the
    attacker can prevent communication and consume the bandwidth by continuously sending
    random commands or control signals [188]. 4.5. Physical attacks Besides the cyber
    attacks investigated above, IoD is also vulnerable to many physical attacks/threats.
    These types of attacks target the hardware components. For example, an attacker
    gains physical access to the IoD environment to destroy IoD devices and obtain
    sensitive information, leading to IoD devices malfunctioning or preventing the
    accomplishment of their missions. Their presence poses an additional risk that
    should be considered. This section presents possible physical attacks targeting
    the IoD environment''s physical assets (IoD devices). • Weather condition threats:
    Drones are vulnerable to bad weather conditions since they may lead to deviations
    in their trajectories. Strong winds put the drone out of balance, and rain can
    damage the circuits. Harsh weather conditions, such as icing, freezing rain, thunderstorms,
    and clouds, can impact the drone''s stability, operation, and travel distance,
    and eventually cause accidents due to its lightweight design and battery dependence.
    Furthermore, weather conditions, turbulence, and ice storms can significantly
    affect cyber performance, resulting in GPS failure or a lost link state. • Civic
    challenges: Dynamic obstacles or the presence of civic constituents pose a challenge
    to UAVs and may ultimately cause damage to the drone if they are hit. Civic components
    such as trees, buildings, street lights, electric cables, and poles are essential
    examples of such challenges as they may interfere with the drone path. • Battery
    depletion: In the IoD environment, resources are limited; thus, an attacker can
    exploit excessive resource utilization. To do so, the attacker enables excessive
    services, which increase the resource depletion rate (battery) and thereby reduce
    the performance of the IoD in the target missions. This could lead to mission
    failure, drone crashes, and damage to its components. • Node tampering: The attacker
    physically accesses the drone and tampers with its data and its software to get
    full control over the IoD environment and get sensitive and confidential information.
    • Physical capture attack: Drones are not physically protected in the IoD environment.
    Therefore, drones are prone to physical capture attacks. An attacker having physical
    access to the drone can damage the drone''s components, hence affecting the drone''s
    operation. Another scenario is that the attacker can use the extracted data stored
    in the captured drones to disrupt communication between other nodes in the IoD
    environment. In this case, the drone will send false alerts to interrupt the correct
    functioning of the IoD. In such situations, an attacker may capture the IoD devices
    and switch off the services assigned to the entire IoD or alter the configuration
    settings, resulting in multiple mission failures and collisions. • Malicious node
    injection: The attacker physically adds a fake node between legitimate nodes in
    the IoD network. Hence, the attacker grants access to sensitive information and
    controls data exchanged between IoD nodes. • Physical damage: The attacker physically
    damages IoD components, thereby causing the unavailability of services. • Malicious
    code injection: This attack focuses on physically introducing a malicious code
    into the IoD nodes, allowing the attacker to gain access to the IoD environment.
    • Malicious code modification: With malicious code modification, the attacker
    can gain unauthorized access to the IoD network. The difference between this attack
    and the malicious code injection attack is that the attacker does not inject new
    malicious codes into the physical component; instead, it modifies the current
    algorithms. The adversary exploits this attack to access the drone''s control
    unit to alter its configuration, thereby interrupting its correct functioning.
    This attack can be cascaded to a UAV swarm. • Theft and vandalism: As the drones
    fly within a visual distance, it makes them a prime target for theft and vandalism,
    which can be achieved using different methods ranging from an anti-drone rifle,
    and hostile drones, to a simple dart gun. The attacker uses these tools to destroy
    the drone and perform illegal activities such as stealing the package/cargo handled
    by the drone. • Interceptor drone: Another approach to disable and crash drones
    is adopting another drone (“Interceptor Drone”) equipped with interception tools.
    The interceptor drone attaches a net gun to it to stop the propellers from turning
    and causing the drone to crash, thereby causing harm to people and destroying
    facilities and the drone itself. Other drones are equipped with laser guns that
    emit a high-energy laser beam that causes a drone to burn in the air, fall to
    the ground, and possibly cause harm to third parties. • Physical social engineering:
    The drone and the ground station are vulnerable to malicious hardware attacks.
    Whenever the attacker is granted access to the UAV flight control system and ground
    control unit, he can install additional components that give him control over
    the IoD and get sensitive data. Such an attack is conducted during the maintenance
    of the drone. On the other hand, hardware trojans, like backdoors, are inserted
    in the UAV''s computation chips to compromise security mechanisms and lead to
    catastrophic consequences. 4.6. Risk assessment Table 8 and Table 9 present the
    risk assessment of the different cyber and physical attacks respectively, which
    can target the IoD. The risk [248] is expressed as a function of the likelihood
    of the attack and the corresponding impact. To estimate the likelihood of the
    attack, we need to determine the extent to which the threat agent can exploit
    the vulnerability successfully. We assign two values to likelihood: • High: The
    threat actor requires minor or no knowledge about the target system, limited expertise,
    and limited resources to exploit the vulnerability. • Low: The threat actor requires
    detailed knowledge about the target system, a high level of expertise, and significant
    resources to exploit the vulnerability. We assign the following values to impact:
    • Low: In case of direct and mission impact. • Moderate: In case of drone impact.
    • High: In case of environmental impact. Based on the likelihood and impact values,
    we assign fives values to the risk, i.e., insignificant, low, medium, high, and
    extreme, as shown in Table 7. Table 7. Risk matrix. Likelihood/Impact Low Moderate
    High Low Insignificant Low Medium High Medium High Extreme In Table 8, we can
    notice that the risks, which are related to Flooding attacks, GPS spoofing, and
    GPS jamming, are extreme, as it is easy for the adversaries to access and compromise
    their corresponding assets, i.e., Transmission system and GPS receiver, and these
    attacks can damage the environment. This indicates that the above-mentioned attacks
    require greater attention and stronger countermeasures than other attacks. We
    can also notice that the risk related to a False data injection attack is insignificant
    since access to the cloud database is difficult and requires expertise and effort.
    Only stored data are compromised if the attack occurs, and the impact does not
    move to the drone or the environment. The rest of the risks are either low or
    medium. Table 8. Risk assessment of cyber attacks. Coarse-grained asset Fine-grained

    Identity spoofing Low High Medium  Drone, GCS, People Flight control system, Software,
    Ground control system, Pre-operator Malicious software Low Moderate Low In Table
    9, weather conditions threats, and civic challenges are considered extreme risks.
    For instance, weather condition threats can easily affect the flying trajectory
    of the drone, damage its circuit, and damage the environment. Civic challenges
    can also cause damage to the drone and the environment. The risk related to interceptor
    drones and payload theft is high, especially when the drone flies within the visual
    distance of the adversary or the range of interception tools. The likelihood of
    these attacks is low because they require knowledge, expertise, and resources
    that are only within reach of the experts. As for drone security, physical access
    to the drone and tampering with its data and software is difficult and requires
    knowledge and expertise; thus, the likelihood of the attack is low. In case of
    a successful physical access attack, the impact can be either direct or mission,
    and therefore the risk is assigned an insignificant value. The risk could increase
    if another attack is launched to exploit the compromised data and software. As
    the ground control station is a secure facility, the likelihood of launching successful
    attacks is low. The risk is insignificant in the case of malicious node injection,
    malicious code modification, and physical and social engineering. In case of node
    tampering and physical capture, the mission of drones, which are associated with
    the ground control station, is affected, and hence the risk increases to low.

    countermeasures In this section, we discuss the security features provided by
    the drone operating system. We also present the cyber and physical countermeasures
    proposed in the literature for IoD and propose a taxonomy that classifies them.
    5.1. Taxonomy of countermeasures We classify the countermeasures, as shown in
    Fig. 8, as follows: • Drone operating system security countermeasures: They represent
    countermeasures that provide security to the drone operating system and test its
    security properties. The description of these countermeasures is presented in
    Section 5.2. • Technical countermeasures: A countermeasure is considered technical
    if it involves technologies such as cryptographic tools and IDSs. Technical countermeasures
    can be classified as: cyber and physical countermeasures. – Cyber countermeasures:
    We categorize them as: pre-incident and post-incident. * Pre-incident countermeasures:
    They represent the countermeasures implemented and deployed before the occurrence
    of security incidents and can be classified as: preventive and detective. · Preventive:
    They correspond to the actions required to prevent the attack from occurring.
    We can find three types of countermeasures: 1. Cryptography and key management:
    These countermeasures are described in Section 5.3.1, and summarized in Table

    system security The drone operating system represents an interface between the
    drone hardware and the application software/user. The operating system manages
    the drone hardware and other external devices, e.g., it controls the flight controller
    and takes input from the other instruments. It also embodies instructions for
    executing the application software. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) require secure,
    reliable, and compact software platforms. A real-time operating system (RTOS)
    is specially developed for resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments
    [181]. RTOS is used in systems requiring a response within very specific time
    limits. The system''s reliability depends not only on the correctness of results
    but also on how fast the response is provided by the system [337]. Rani et al.
    [243] implemented and tested a hacking procedure on a commercial UAV known as
    Parrot AR.Drone by performing a cyber attack to take complete control over the
    UAV and expose the security vulnerabilities in commercial UAVs. The communication
    system''s weaknesses were exploited to access the device, where the Robot Operating
    System (ROS) tools were used to control it by altering the flight path. It was
    demonstrated that a hacker could cause irrecoverable damage to the UAV and take
    over the UAV by compromising the communication links between the UAV and the operator.
    The hacker joystick was used in the experiments to control the Parrot AR.Drone,
    and various new commands were executed when the user was disconnected from the
    system. The authors also concluded that no system is completely secure because
    of the inherent shortcomings in the operating system that can lead to potential
    vulnerabilities. Pike et al. [238] focused on software integrity attacks related
    to modifying the control flow of a program. Code injection and return-to-libc
    attacks are examples of conventional methods for launching attacks against software
    integrity. Attacks related to control flow are pretty common, and various protection
    methods have been introduced to tackle such attacks, for example, canaries [93]
    and address-space layout randomization [271]. However, researchers have developed
    various ways to bypass these protections using methods such as return-oriented
    programming. Another technique, known as control-flow integrity (CFI) [2], is
    considered hard to exploit. It uses run-time checks to ensure that a program follows
    its static control-flow graph. The research community has recommended this technique
    as a potential candidate for protecting program integrity. Hence, the authors
    in [238] proposed a CFI-aware real-time operating system, called TrackOS, to provide
    CFI protections for critical embedded software in real-time embedded systems.
    In TrackOS, there is built-in support to perform CFI checks over various tasks,
    and these tasks do not need any specific run-time modifications or instrumentation
    to be examined. TrackOS overcame the delay and jitter issues associated with CFI
    program instrumentation. Instead of instrumenting a program, a separate monitor
    task performs the CFI checks on various untrusted tasks. The monitor task is a
    privileged task scheduled by the TrackOS, and it has access to the memory of other
    tasks. Dey et al. [74] studied security vulnerabilities related to Parrot Bebop
    2 and DJI Phantom 4 Pro drones that use BusyBox, which is a Unix-based operating
    system. They also presented some defense mechanisms against the identified security
    vulnerabilities. They concluded that the Phantom 4 Pro is a highly secure and
    robust commercially available drone; however, it still requires further improvements
    and extensive security analysis. On the contrary, Parrot Bebop 2 drone lacked
    security measures; hence it is unsafe for personal or commercial usage. Lee et
    al. [166] proposed a security framework that operates in ROS for a UAS and explained
    the vulnerabilities. The framework focuses on security issues related to flight
    missions and the overhead caused by using additional security elements. The performance
    of the proposed framework is evaluated in both native and non-native ROS environments.
    The ROS uses a publisher-subscriber model for communication between different
    components that constitute the robot. Two nodes that exchange node information
    via the master node communicate messages using the publishing and subscribing
    functions as required. The security analysis shows that ROS lacks the essential
    security elements, and malicious nodes can also be connected in addition to the
    normal nodes. Moreover, breaking into the network is simple, and false injection
    and masquerade attacks are also possible. The false data can be transferred to
    the subscriber if the attack publisher establishes communication (through the
    master node) with the subscriber about the topic. In case of a successful attack,
    the attacker can destroy the system if the flight controller cannot control the
    altitude and exact position in the underlying environment. 5.3. Cyber countermeasures
    5.3.1. Cryptography and key management As explained in Section 4.4 and Section
    5.2, the communication links in IoD are unencrypted and could be compromised.
    To deal with this issue, it is important to deploy cryptography-based mechanisms
    that ensure secure communication among the entities of the IoD. IoD''s cryptography
    and key management solutions are summarized in Table 10. Ozmen et al. [230] proposed
    IoD-Crypt, a lightweight self-certified cryptographic system that aims to meet
    the requirements of resource-constrained IoD. IoD-Crypt is shown to ensure authentication
    and confidentiality of communication. It also reduces the certification overhead,
    i.e., it incurs up to 13 and 48 times less energy consumption than public-key
    primitives on two common drone processors, namely 8-bit AVR and 32-bit ARM, respectively.
    Haque et al. [106] proposed an Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) that offers better
    overhead efficiency as it does not need to use certificates as in public-key systems.
    It also employs a selective encryption algorithm that only encrypts some parts
    of the messages, which incurs less overhead. In addition, data hiding is also
    used to improve the confidentiality of messages. Wang et al. [309] proposed a
    handover key management scheme for the LTE-based UAV control network. To perform
    initial authentication, they employed the authentication and key agreement procedure
    and root key agreement between a UAV and Ground Relay Station (GRS). When a UAV
    moves from a GRS to a neighboring GRS, a new Access Stratum (AS) key is established
    between the UAV and the new GRS and is separated from the old AS. Security analysis
    has shown that the scheme does not reveal the AS key, as it ensures (a) one-hop
    forward and backward key separation and (b) key separation under the compromise
    of the first and the last GRS. Sahingoz [254] proposed a key management system
    for WSNs that leverages a UAV to distribute asymmetric keys to sensor nodes. Neighboring
    sensor nodes authenticate each other through their respective public keys. After
    that, they use the public keys to agree on the pairwise session key for the rest
    of the communication. Chen et al. [57] focused on decoupling the IoD cloud data
    that are stored in the cloud from the owner''s pseudonyms. To this end, they proposed
    a two-tier coding method to mix the user identity with watchword/seed and then
    generate two keys: one key for certification and another one for anonymization.
    Compared to the secure hash-based pseudonym scheme, the network coding method
    can provide unlinkable pseudonyms to unconditional security level for Real-time
    Object Tracking Application (ROTA) [155]. It can also reduce more than 90% of
    processing time and 10% of energy consumption. Demeri et al. [72] designed and
    implemented Secure Aerial Data Delivery with Lightweight Encryption (SADDLE) on
    Fo450ARF quad-copter drone. SADDLE is a combined public and secret key secure
    data delivery system to generate bi-nodal secret session keys. To this end, some
    encryption primitives are used, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
    exchange protocol and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128). Alrayes et al. [17]
    applied Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (AGTO) algorithm with an ECC-Based
    ElGamal encryption technique to generate an optimal key. The latter is used by
    drone-based emergency monitoring systems to encrypt the transmitted images. Simulation
    analysis showed that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the mean square
    error (MSE) were improved under all images compared to other optimization algorithms.
    5.3.2. Authentication and access control As shown in Section 4.4, the signals
    are unauthenticated, and it is impossible to confirm their authenticity, which
    allows the injection of spoofed signals. To deal with this issue, it is important
    to deploy authentication mechanisms that ensure the authenticity of only legitimate
    entities in the IoD. The authentication and access control solutions for the IoD
    are summarized in Table 11, Table 12 and Table 13. Sun et al. [296] proposed a
    data authentication scheme based on the message authentication code (MAC) for
    UAV communication. The scheme uses two phases: (1) data authentication and (2)
    cluster watermark authentication. The data authentication phase is used at the
    cluster head node to filter out fake packets, while the cluster watermark authentication
    phase is used at the sink node to verify the authenticity and integrity of the
    data. The security analysis shows that Sun et al.''s scheme [296] is robust against
    five attacks, namely data transmission delay, packet forging, data tampering,
    data replay, and selective forwarding. To solve the problem of deauthenticating
    the drone in a hijacked environment, Yoon et al. [333] proposed an authentication
    system for UAV communication. The network model comprises three elements: middleware,
    ground station, and UAVs. The basic idea of the system is to use encrypted channels
    between these parts. Shoufan [279] designed a continuous authentication for UAV
    communication and considers a network model that contains three elements: a UAV,
    a UAV operator, and a radio-control transmitter. The scheme authenticates the
    behavior of the UAV operator defined by the sequence of flight commands sent from
    the operator to the UAVs. Based on the assumption that each operator has a unique
    behavioral pattern, it is possible to identify authorized operators aiming at
    hijacking the UAVs. Cho et al. [61] proposed a secure authentication framework
    named SENTINEL for the IoD infrastructure. SENTINEL framework creates a flight
    profile code for a UAV with a flight schedule. It records the flight profile code
    and its flight schedule in a centralized database accessible by the ground terminals.
    To authenticate the communication between drone and drone, Pu et al. [240] proposed
    a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme, named PMAPD2D, which is used
    to establish a secure session key between drone and drone. Srinivas et al. [289]
    proposed TCALAS, which is a temporal credential-based anonymous lightweight user
    authentication scheme for IoD. TCALAS uses three authentication factors: password,
    mobile device, and biometrics. Ali et al. [11] revealed that Srinivas et al.''s
    scheme [289] cannot withstand stolen verifier attacks. Hence, they proposed an
    improved IoD scheme, iTCALAS, based on the temporal credentials and lightweight
    symmetric key primitives. In order to provide data confidentiality and mutual
    authentication for mobile sinks used in the IoD applications, Ever [80] introduced
    a secure authentication framework, which is based on elliptic-curve cryptosystems.
    Chen et al. [53] proposed a traceable and privacy-preserving authentication, which
    combines hash function, digital signature, and elliptic curve cryptography for
    UAV applications. Mandal et al. [187] presented a user access control scheme based
    on certificateless-signcryption, named CSUAC-IoT. The scheme uses the following
    three authentication factors: a mobile device, personal biometrics, and user''s
    password. To provide the authentication with privacy preservation for IoD, Tian
    et al. [303] proposed an authentication scheme using mobile edge computing. More
    precisely, Tian et al.''s scheme [303] considers three significant elements, i.e.,
    UAVs, mobile edge computing devices, and a trusted authority. Based on the online/offline
    signature, one-time random nonces, and timestamps, Tian et al.''s scheme can detect
    replay attacks and provide security on repudiation threats. Besides, to authenticate
    the IoT devices in air-ground collaborative surveillance operations, Cao et al.
    [45] proposed a lightweight authentication scheme, which is based on covert channels
    in the physical layer. The network model considers two types of devices, namely,
    1) smart devices and 2) dumb devices. To resist against four attacks, including
    man-in-the-middle attack, message replay attack, impersonation attack, and eavesdrop
    attack, Cao et al.''s scheme [45] combines the benefits of two concepts: covert
    channels and physical layer fingerprints. Zhang et al. [344] proposed a lightweight
    authentication and key agreement scheme based on the bitwise XOR operations and
    only secure one-way hash function. Wang et al. [309] provided an LTE-based architecture
    to enhance the coordination of UAV control. Then, they presented a scheme of transfer
    key control for the LTE-based UAV control network. The security analyses show
    that the proposed scheme ensures the security of a communication key of a ground
    relay station in service, although the neighboring GRSes are affected. To support
    user revocation, non-repudiation, and authenticated key agreement for the IoD,
    Won et al. [321] proposed a certificateless signcryption tag key encapsulation
    mechanism named eCLSC-TKEM, which is based on a certificateless data aggregation
    protocol. Wazid et al. [317] proposed a lightweight user authentication system
    where a user in the IoD environment requires access to the data directly from
    a UAV. The proposed system can resist node/sensing device/drone impersonation
    attacks. Alladi et al. [13] proposed a two-stage lightweight mutual authentication
    scheme for SDN-backed multi-UAV networks, which can provide independent aliasing,
    perfect forward secrecy, and perfect backward secrecy. Hong et al. [113] proposed
    a data aggregate authentication scheme, named IBE-AggAuth, for unmanned aerial
    vehicle cluster networks. The IBE-AggAuth scheme uses ID-based encryption and
    the elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman method to reduce computation and
    communication costs and provide data security. To enable real-time performance
    for autonomous safety flight, Cheon et al. [59] do not keep the secret keys for
    encryption on the drone. Instead, they proposed a linearly homomorphic authenticated
    encryption scheme named LinHAE. This scheme is secure against eavesdropping and
    forgery attacks. Bera et al. [38] proposed ACPBS-IoT, an access control protocol
    for battlefield surveillance in drone-assisted IoT. ACPBS-IoT ensures mutual authentication
    between a drone and a GCS and shares a session key. Security analysis shows that
    ACPBSIoT can resist different attacks, including impersonation, privileged-insider,
    replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and Ephemeral Secret Leakage (ESL) attacks.
    Ko et al. [147] proposed a security protocol for military applications, consisting
    of two components: the first establishes authentication among the UAVs, and the
    second ensures authentication between a UAV and the GCS. Formal security analysis
    shows that the protocol can ensure mutual authentication, non-repudiation, perfect
    forward secrecy, and perfect backward secrecy. It can also resist man-in-the-middle
    and DoS attacks. Jan et al. [128] proposed an authentication protocol for IoD
    based on a hash message authentication (HMACSHA1). The protocol incurs less overhead
    with respect to computation and storage and is also formally analyzed and shown
    to be resistant against known attacks such as stolen verifier attacks, privileged
    insider, denial of service, replay, and spoofing attacks. Zhang et al. [341] proposed
    three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol for IoD. The protocol employs
    an elliptic curve function named FourQ and a pre-calculation technique called
    Boyko-Peinado-Venkatesan (BPV). The security analysis shows that the protocol
    ensures essential security properties such as perfect forward secrecy. Experimental
    tests on Raspberry Pi B+ demonstrate that FourQ is five times faster than the
    conventional elliptic curve. Tanveer et al. [300] proposed RAMP-IoD, Robust Authenticated
    Key Management Protocol for IoD. RAMP-IoD is based on two lightweight cryptographic
    primitives: Authenticated Encryption with Associative Data (AEAD) and elliptic
    curve. RAMP-IoD is secure against different attacks, including replay, man-in-the-middle,
    stolen smart device/card, and password-guessing attacks. It also incurs low computation,
    communication, and storage overheads. Khalid et al. [139] proposed a two-factor
    authentication scheme for drones based on an asymmetric cryptographic method.
    The authors showed that the proposed scheme offers less computation cost than
    RAMP-IoD [300] and is resistant to many attacks, such as replay, impersonation,
    and available session keys. Hussain et al. [120] proposed an authentication scheme
    between a pair of users and drones based on symmetric encryption and elliptic
    curve cryptography. Based on formal security analysis, the scheme provides anonymity
    and untraceability and is secure against different attacks, including user/GCS/drone
    impersonation, offline password guessing, and password change. In [323], it was
    shown that Hussain et al.''s scheme is vulnerable to drone capture, privileged
    insider, and session key disclosure attacks. Chaudhry et al. [51] designed GCACS-IoD,
    a certificate-based access control scheme that provides two types of authentication:
    inter-drone and drone to the ground station. The scheme can resist replay, drone
    capture, drone impersonation, man-in-the-middle, and temporary secret leakage
    attacks. In [70], it was proved that GCACS-IoD is insecure against private key
    leakage of the control server. Nikooghadam et al. [223] proposed an authentication
    scheme for drone-assisted smart city surveillance. The scheme is based on elliptic
    curve cryptography, which considers three elements: users, drones, and control
    servers. It provides anonymity and perfect forward secrecy while incurring low
    computation and communication overhead. Jan et al. [127] proposed a scheme focusing
    on information authentication instead of identity authentication. They assumed
    that initially, the users, the drones, and the ground control station mutually
    authenticate each other. The scheme is resistant to drone capture, man-in-the-middle,
    stolen verifier, replay, user impersonation, server impersonation, and privileged
    insider attacks. It also incurs less storage and computation overheads. 5.3.3.
    Blockchain-based solutions Blockchain technology can be effectively applied in
    almost all domains, especially for the IoD [14], [82], [84], [87]. To address
    the security vulnerabilities in the IoD, the blockchain technology [193] is a
    feasible solution with enormous potential. Sharma et al. [276] proposed a neural-blockchain
    combination for edge-enabled UAV networks. The blockchain network is used for
    reliable communications using distributed ledgers, which can help flatten services
    on the IoD. To maintain the reliability requirements of the blockchain network,
    a hybrid neural model is proposed. The operating drones in the defined network
    are configured via the drone caching framework based on the blocks. Ferrag and
    Leandros [83] proposed an intrusion detection and blockchain-based delivery framework,
    named DeliveryCoin, for drone-delivered services. The hash functions and short
    signatures are employed by the blockchain for achieving privacy preservation,
    while the machine learning techniques are employed for intrusion detection. In
    addition, a UAV-aided forwarding mechanism, named pBFTF, is adopted for achieving
    consensus inside the blockchain-based delivery platform. Islam et al. [126] proposed
    a blockchain-enabled data acquisition scheme to provide security and data integrity
    through unmanned aerial vehicle swarm and blockchain technology. Specifically,
    the unmanned aerial vehicle swarm shares a shared key with the IoT devices to
    maintain communications before initiating data acquisition. The digital signature
    algorithm and hash bloom filter are employed in order to resist and avoid two
    types of man-in-the-middle attacks: manipulation and eavesdropping. Fernández-Caramés
    et al. [81] proposed a drone-based and blockchain-based system for Industry 4.0,
    where the drones are used to collect the inventory data, and the blockchain technology
    is used to enable the creation of smart contracts. Aggarwal et al. [7] designed
    a secure data dissemination scheme based on blockchain technology and game theory
    for the IoD. A forger node selection algorithm and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm
    are employed to verify and validate blocks. Throughout evaluation performance,
    the proposed scheme shows that it can provide identity anonymity, data integrity,
    accountability, authorization, and authentication, compared to four related schemes
    [135], [171], [173], [277]. Bera et al. [37] introduced an access control system
    based on blockchain technology, which can enable safe interaction between UAVs
    as well as between UAVs and the ground station server. The protected data collected
    by the ground station server are used to form transactions, and the latter is
    used to create blocks. The blocks are then added to the blockchain through the
    cloud servers connected to the ground station server via the ripple protocol consensus
    algorithm. Lei et al. [167] proposed an advanced and systematic approach based
    on blockchain technology that incorporates on-demand verification, forwarding
    strategy, and interest-key-content binding to detect poisonous content efficiently.
    In order to support decentralized interest-key-content binding storage and enable
    the detection of internal attackers, the authors developed an adaptive and scalable
    delegated consensus algorithm over named data networking for mission-critical
    unmanned aerial vehicle ad hoc networks. Islam and Shin [124] proposed a secure
    outdoor health monitoring system based on blockchain technology and UAV consolidated
    with MEC. In the proposed system, Health Data (HD) are collected from sensors
    carried by the users, and this health data is forwarded to the next MEC server
    via a UAV. Before being transmitted to MEC, the health data is encrypted to protect
    against cyber attacks. García-Magariño et al. [97] designed an agent-based approach
    based on the blockchain technology and trust policies for ensuring the surveillance
    and security of UAV networks as well as to detect compromised UAVs. For disaster
    rescue, Su et al. [293] proposed a lightweight framework, named LVBS, for secure
    data sharing based on blockchain technology and unmanned aerial vehicles. The
    LVBS framework adopts a credit-based consensus algorithm to safely and immutably
    track node behavior and record data transactions with increased efficiency and
    security to achieve consensus. Islam et al. [123] proposed an intelligent surveillance
    architecture based on blockchain technology, in which a drone monitors and uses
    a two-phase authentication process to check vehicles at sea. The experimental
    results demonstrate that the proposed authentication scheme is significantly faster
    and uses less power than existing authentication schemes. Islam and Shin [125]
    proposed a blockchain-based data acquisition scheme, in which data are first encrypted
    and then transferred to the MEC server with the help of a UAV. Han et al. [105]
    used blockchain technology to detect global navigation satellite system signal
    attacks for UAV networks. Mitra et al. [199] implemented a public blockchain-based
    testbed for drone-assisted wildlife monitoring. The drones collect data from IoT
    devices, which are attached to animals. The collected data of each flying zone
    is sent to its corresponding Ground Station Server (GSS). The latter creates blocks
    and validates them using the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus
    algorithm. To this end, the GSS broadcasts the block to the P2P network of GSS
    nodes. Alsamhi [18] focused on the synergy between federated learning and blockchain
    in IoD. The drones collect data from the smart environment, run local models,
    and share the models with their neighbors and ground server to allow collaborative
    learning and improve model accuracy. The role of blockchain is to allow privacy-preserving
    data sharing in the IoD. Irshad et al. [122] proposed a BOD5-IOD, blockchain-oriented
    Data Delivery and Collection (DDC) system to ensure authentication between drones
    and their corresponding ground control servers. The DDC records all the transactions
    among the system nodes and generates their private blocks. In [23], the blockchain
    model was proposed to hide the identity of drones during message exchanges. Sing
    et al. [283] defined an architecture named blockchain of drones, where each drone
    creates blocks and communicates with other drones and the ground station. They
    proposed the Advanced Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT) protocol as a consensus
    mechanism for blockchain. ABFT offers higher scalability than other Byzantine
    Fault Tolerance (BFT) systems like PBFT (Practical BFT), hBFT, and ReBFT. Nguyen
    et al. [221] proposed a blockchain-based architecture for conducting search and
    rescue missions using IoD. The architecture consists of small and big drones and
    edge servers to perform offloading operations. Allouch et al. [15] proposed UTM-Chain,
    a blockchain-based solution for unmanned traffic management. UTM-Chain provides
    secure sharing of data between UAVs and their ground control stations. In [71],
    blockchain and EdgeDrone concept [210] are integrated to ensure secure data delivery
    for forest fire surveillance applications. The authors in [195] proposed PROACT:
    a lightweight consensus protocol for IoD based on accumulated trust [196]. The
    blockchain is maintained and updated by the GCSs and the cloud servers. Certain
    GCSs are selected to become BC miners based on their trust ratings. Each GCS validates
    the transactions that it receives from drones before forwarding them to the set
    of trusted GCSs (TGCSs), which act as miners. The trusted GCSs assume the responsibility
    of mining new blocks, while all GCSs participate in the process of block validation.
    Each GCS accumulates trust points in order to become a TGCS. Each time a GCS validates
    a transaction correctly, it receives positive trust points and vice versa. When
    the GCS accumulates enough trust points over a sufficiently long period, it is
    selected by the TGCSs to become a BC miner. One of the TGCSs acts as the blockchain
    orderer that receives block requests from the TGCSs and orders the corresponding
    blocks in the blockchain, which allows multiple TGCSs to produce their blocks
    and add them to the blockchain in parallel. A TGCS collects the transactions from
    its drones, sends a request to the blockchain orderer, creates its block, and
    waits for its turn to add the block to the blockchain. When its turn arrives,
    the TGCS adds the previous block''s hash to its block and broadcasts the latter
    to the TGCSs to add it to the blockchain. 5.3.4. Intrusion detection systems As
    presented in Section 4.4, some attacks against IoD, such as DoS attacks, cannot
    be prevented. Hence, there is a need for an intrusion detection system (IDS),
    which is the second line of defense when the intruder has already entered the
    network and tampers with its performance. IDSs can generally be classified as
    rule-based or misuse detection, where the former lie on specific rules that define
    the presence of an intruder, and the latter learn the regular operation of the
    system and trigger an alarm once a deviation happens. Most of the traditional
    techniques mentioned in the literature suffer from either poor performance or
    high overhead [73]. Once an IDS is deployed in such a complex system, like the
    IoD, the produced alarms must be both highly accurate to improve the security
    system''s performance and minimal in order not to affect the correct performance
    of control applications that run over the medium. Recently, several works have
    investigated the efficiency of an IDS for detecting attacks in a UAV environment.
    The different IDS methods, which are proposed for securing UAVs, are presented
    in Table 14. Yu et al. [335] applied snort for DoS and GPS spoofing attack detection
    in a simulated environment comprising a GCS and a limited number of UAVs. Condomines
    et al. [67] conducted both simulated and emulated tests, using paparazziUAV [1],
    an open-source drone hardware and software project encompassing autopilot system
    to better represent realistic scenarios and test the efficiency of their proposed
    defense mechanism. They used network traffic datasets that include anomalies to
    construct digital signatures in three dimensions for DoS attacks and used those
    signatures to detect future attacks. Although the proposed method is designed
    to detect both constant and progressive flash crowds, it was tested under simplistic
    scenarios with one attack and a limited number of valid nodes. Hoang et al. [112]
    presented an IDS that combines OCSVM and K-means clustering in a UAV-aided wireless
    system, an idea that was presented a couple of years ago for detecting anomalies
    in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) [183]. The proposed method is tested on a
    scenario consisting of three nodes: one of them is the attacker, and only a passive
    attack occurs (i.e., the eavesdropping attack). Arthur [26] presented a lightweight
    system that can be embedded in modern UAVs for providing accurate detection of
    GPS spoofing and DoS attack, as well as consuming little energy from the UAV.
    The IDS combines Self-Taught Learning (STL) with a multiclass SVM to detect the
    attacker. It is tested in a realistic environment that consists of twenty UAVs,
    four Ground Stations, and a Control Station, making the results valuable. To secure
    UAVs that carry out explorations in isolated areas and to collect and send critical
    information about the conditions of these areas, Sedjelmaci et al. [266] implemented
    and tested several IDSs that can deal with many different attacks, achieving good
    accuracy with low false positives. Fotohi [90] proposed a novel IDS that can secure
    UAVs against several attacks, but at the cost of high communication overhead among
    nodes, to identify secure routes. Also, the proposed IDS assumes that this secure
    route will not change in the next communication attempt, which is not so realistic
    in highly mobile environments like UAVs. Sun et al. [295] proposed an IDS based
    on the Bayesian Nash equilibrium theory. The proposed IDS performs well in terms
    of accuracy, detection rate, and overhead compared to other methods, but the validation
    was based on probabilistic models rather than realistic datasets. In another work
    [292], the authors presented a theoretical model of IDS based on a Blackboard
    architecture, but no validation or evaluation results are provided. Zhang et al.
    [342] presented an IDS based on Wavelet Leader Multifractal analysis for creating
    signatures of traffic and evaluated their method in a hybrid experimental system
    using real traces. The method performs well under DoS service attacks showing
    high similarity rates, but no comparison with other methods is presented. Deep
    learning can achieve better performance as compared to traditional machine learning
    IDSs, especially when massive data analysis is required [336], and thus can be
    used to develop IDSs for modern complex systems where massive, high-dimensional,
    nonlinear data must be used for training, and testing [299]. Authors in [85] conducted
    a comparative study of several deep learning IDS techniques using novel datasets
    and tried to showcase the pros and cons of each method. As also stated in [10],
    [86], [306], no method can be considered as the ‘winner’ for all attacks'' scenarios,
    and smart combinations of techniques could be used to detect most of the abnormal
    situations inside the system accurately. Ramadan et al. [241] proposed a distributed
    IDS that is deployed on drones and the base station. Each drone runs the LSTM-RNN
    model to detect the attacks on the drone itself. The base station also runs the
    LSTM-RNN model to confirm the detected attack and notify the other drones. The
    authors tested their model on different datasets such as KDDCup 99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15,
    Kyoto, CICIDS2017, and TON_IoT. Recently, the authors in [228] proposed a model
    based on machine learning techniques and a multi-agent system that is capable
    of detecting DoS attacks against drones. The detection of DoS attacks is an important
    countermeasure that can be used to ensure the high availability of drone systems,
    especially those used in emergencies. The proposed method was tested using the
    CICIDS2017 dataset and was proven to be very accurate. In another recent work,
    [30], the authors applied machine learning-based classification techniques to
    detect several attacks against drones. The authors used the DJI Phantom 4 drone
    dataset acquired from VTO Labs in this work. This dataset comprises DAT files
    of flight logs obtained from various flights undertaken by a single drone. The
    evaluation of several methods showed the superiority of the random forest algorithm.
    Finally, the authors in [320] combined principal component analysis (PCA) and
    one-class classifiers to detect attacks to be able to train the IDS using only
    normal data. The proposed MAVIDS can be deployed on every UAV allowing for fast
    detection and potential mitigation of cyber attacks even during communication
    errors with the GCS. 5.3.5. Drone forensics Drone forensics is an emerging field
    within digital forensics aiming to extract and analyze evidence from a UAV and
    its components to identify attackers and their malicious actions [8]. Drone forensics
    is essential as the drone flies above populated areas and can be manipulated by
    radical forces and perpetrators to launch illegal activities. Although forensics
    investigation is well established in traditional fields, there is a lack of a
    standard regarding the procedures of collecting and processing evidence for a
    security incident in the IoD field [189]. Due to the nature of the IoD environment,
    several challenges obstruct the standardization of forensics procedures. First,
    several drone platforms and architectures make it difficult to build a standard
    procedure that can be applied to these various architectures and platforms. Moreover,
    the presence of several components and devices in the drone expands the complexity
    of the investigation, as the forensics analysis will have to handle the supporting
    devices and find and correlate the evidence collected from these different devices.
    Furthermore, IoD systems are generally linked to the cloud to offload resource
    taxing tasks [47]. This property moves the processing and handling of data from
    the drone to the cloud, and therefore, extends the perimeter of the incident investigation.
    Moreover, cloud service providers rarely cooperate with investigators, and even
    if cloud providers are willing to cooperate, the data may be stored across different
    servers and countries. This requires the permissions granted to different entities
    and authorities [189]. In what follows, we present the main forensics methods
    proposed for drones. These methods are summarized in Table 15. Clark et al. [65]
    noted that the DJI Phantom III drone was used in several illegal activities such
    as dropping bombs, remote surveillance, and plane watching. This motivated the
    authors to develop a DRone Open source Parser called DROP, which can analyze proprietary
    encrypted DAT files extracted from the drone''s internal storage. The extracted
    data can identify drone locations over time and the flying time. However, this
    work is limited to only DJI drones. Renduchintala et al. [245] proposed a more
    comprehensive forensic framework. The authors first divided drone forensics into
    two categories: digital forensics and hardware/physical vehicle forensics. Digital
    forensics includes analyzing network traffic exchanged by drones, system logs,
    sensor readings, file storage systems, and camera recordings. As for hardware
    forensics, it includes: identifying drone type, checking for customization, carrying
    loads, fingerprints, and location. The authors proposed a forensic model to examine
    the drone''s physical components. They developed a Java-based application to analyze
    and visualize the flight logs of the drones. However, this work is limited to
    only log files in CSV file format. Iqbal et al. [121] investigated a Parrot Bebop
    2 drone to acquire flight data, extract drone-pruned media, and establish ownership.
    However, their work is limited to small-scale drones. Barton and Azhar [32] and
    [29] used Kali Linux to provide open-source forensic tools to perform forensic
    analysis using two drones, namely DJI Phantom 3 and A.R Drone. To visualize the
    flight path, the open-source GeoPlayer tool was used. To this end, the authors
    analyzed and investigated the recorded flight logs on both the internal memory
    of the UAV and the controlling application. Horsman [114] provided the results
    of a digital forensic investigation of a test Parrot Bebop UAV and was able to
    recover flight data using Android and iOS devices. Roder et al. [247] proposed
    a guideline for drone forensics using DJI Phantom 3 drone as a case study. Salamh
    et al. [256] discuss the static and live digital evidence challenges related to
    UAV and possible Anti-UAV forensic techniques. In [255], the authors presented
    a technical forensic process for analyzing digital evidence, which is extracted
    from the Yuneec Typhoon H drone. Kao et al. [134] collected and analyzed artifacts
    from the recorded flight data extracted from the DJI Spark drone and its associated
    devices, such as SD cards and mobile phones. Stanković et al. [290] conducted
    a forensics investigation of DJI Mini 2 and its associated data, which are stored
    on mobile devices and SD cards. Yousef et al. [334] extracted and analyzed data
    from four drones: DJI Mavic 2 Pro, DJI Mavic Air, DJI Spark, and DJI Phantom 4.
    The analysis results indicate that applying forensics on these drones is not easy
    due to their improved security. Hence, it is essential to develop novel forensic
    processes and tools. In [231], the authors analyzed the digital evidence like
    log files, pictures, and videos from the storage of the Yuneec Typhoon drone.
    Kumar et al. [161] focused on analyzing GPS logs from drones to identify the crime
    location and previous flight paths. To this end, they developed a tool designed
    for three drone models: DJI Phantom 4 Pro, Yuneec Typhoon H, and Parrot Bebop
    2, which converts GPS data to an understandable format. Husnjak et al. [119] found
    a significant amount of data by applying a forensic investigation on DJI Mavic
    Air and its associated mobile app DJI GO 4. Salamh et al. [257] tested available
    forensic software tools on two drone models: Phantom 4 and Matrice 210. In [75],
    different open-source tools are applied to the GCS of a Parrot Bebop drone. 5.4.
    Physical countermeasures Collision avoidance is one of the challenges faced by
    UAVs. In shared airspace, a UAV can collide with both stationary and moving obstacles
    and other aircraft, which would endanger its mission. On the other hand, when
    assigning a mission to UAVs with a planned path over multiple waypoints to a drone
    connected to the Internet, the UAV could encounter obstacles not considered in
    the planned trajectory. Indeed, several collision avoidance methods have been
    put forward for the collision problem. In addition, the extensive use of drones
    has created safety threats, which have increased the number of drones that cause
    accidents and unforeseen incidents. These issues have highlighted the need for
    methods intended to track and detect drones used for malicious activities. 5.4.1.
    Collision avoidance methods The collision avoidance methods fall into four categories,
    namely path planning approach, geometric-based approach, potential field approach,
    and vision-based approach. (i) Path planning approach: It aims to find a short
    and collision-free flight trajectory towards the desired target where obstacles
    are static and pre-known. In general, path planning approaches are further divided
    into the following three categories of algorithms [244], [286], [330], [346]:
    • Graph-based algorithms: Graph-based search algorithms have become popular in
    route planning. This method divides the search space into a grid and represents
    the grid by a set of cells. Among the most relevant methods, we can find Djikstra''s
    algorithm [192], [215], A* [184], Lazy θ* [218], D*-Lite [96], [115], [207], and
    the Kinematic A* [6]. These algorithms are applied to the UAV path planning [192]
    because they provide fast search capabilities but do not produce smooth trajectories
    and are not suitable for large areas. • Randomly sampling search algorithms: In
    this category, the environment is sampled into a set of nodes that randomly search
    for a free-collision path. Algorithms like Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)
    [94], [260], [328], [329], Dynamic Domain RRT (DDRRT) [328], RRT* [76], [319],
    Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) [6], Rapidly exploring Random Belief Tree (RRBT) [5],
    and Visibility Graph [117] belong to randomly sampling search algorithms and have
    been used in the UAV domain. Random sampling search algorithms give the advantages
    of having a simple structure and dealing with a complex environment. • Learning
    based algorithms: They have become the most popular way to perform UAV path planning.
    The key idea in learning-based algorithms is to use a training process to guide
    the UAV in a given state. Learning-based methods give the advantage of solving
    complex and multi-objective problems. Some evolutionary methods have been adopted
    for the solution of UAV path planning. For instance, genetic algorithms have been
    used for single and multiple UAV path-planning [200], [222], [235], [253], [288],
    [316], which led to satisfactory results. The successful application of reinforcement
    learning for UAV path planning can be found in [49], [237], [313], [315], [340],
    [343]. Other interesting approaches include the usage of neural networks in UAV
    path planning [98], [137], [158], [172]. (ii) Geometric approach: This approach
    aims to avoid conflicts, and collisions based on geometric characteristics analysis
    [40], [232]. There are two geometric collision avoidance techniques: collision
    cone and velocity obstacle. The collision-cone-based technique is suitable for
    detecting and avoiding collision between UAVs and obstacles. Both of them move
    in a dynamic environment [46], [68], [209], [270]. Velocity obstacle techniques
    are successful at computing collision-free trajectories in a dynamic environment
    [16], [88], [129], [163]. (iii) Potential field approach: One successful approach
    used in collision avoidance is the potential field approach. Many researchers
    use it to solve the collision avoidance problem among UAVs and obstacles. This
    approach treats each UAV as a charged particle, and the repulsive forces between
    aircraft generate collision avoidance maneuvers. The potential field method has
    the advantage of simple implementation and low computational complexity and is
    a good solution for real-time implementation. Indeed, it was applied to UAV navigation
    [4], [55], [56], [145], [176], [179], [182], [208], [234], [246], [251], [268],
    [294]. However, it is not appropriate for a dynamic environment due to the existence
    of local minimum risks and poor performance. (iv) Vision-based approach: Different
    vision-based obstacle detection methods have been proposed to tackle the collision
    avoidance problem. Many researchers utilized images captured by cameras mounted
    on UAVs to solve the collision avoidance problem in the indoor environment [262].
    Other works, such as in [48], [115], [186], [191], [242], [263], used a technique
    based on stereo cameras to predict the closeness of the obstacles to the UAV.
    This method requires a high computational cost, which is unsuitable for handling
    real-time situations. Due to the heavy computational capabilities, a simple vision-based
    collision avoidance approach was proposed in [9], [22], [95], [138], [148], [202],
    [252], which uses a monocular camera to generate a collision-free trajectory,
    where heavyweight computations are performed off-board. 5.4.2. Drone detection
    methods The drone detection methods are divided into the following two categories:
    acoustic and optical. (i) Acoustic detection: Several works have proposed the
    use of acoustic sensors, as an efficient technology, to detect drones. Some studies
    compare acoustic signatures generated by drone''s motors and rotating propellers
    with other collected sound signatures [24], [39], [50], [109], [198], [267], [278].
    Other studies detect the sound of propellers and motors based on special microphones
    [108], [144]. The sound is analyzed, and acoustic features are extracted. However,
    weather conditions and noise affect the accuracy of detection. Moreover, the detection
    range is limited. (ii) Optical detection: It is worth mentioning that most of
    the literature has considered image data and video streams collected from cameras
    for drone detection. As an example, studies in [175], [250], [298] focus on detecting
    drones through image processing based on machine learning algorithms. Other studies
    detect UAVs by detecting motion cues [116], [249], visual marks [259], shape descriptors
    [305] and flight pattern. In terms of advantages, camera-based detection enables
    long-range detection. However, detection performances are poor in bad weather
    conditions. 5.5. Regulations and standards In order to protect both safety and
    privacy of the citizens, the EU and USA are putting into force regulations and
    laws. Besides safeguarding their citizens'' lives, drones'' free circulation within
    their territories is one of the primary targets of these regulations. In the EU,
    new drone rules came into force on the 1st of July, 2020. To be allowed to fly
    over the EU, both technical and operational requirements define minimum safety
    capabilities that a drone must have, like identification, certification, and remote
    pilot requirements. Moreover, operators of drones have to register in any of the
    Member States [201]. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US has issued
    several restrictions on drone operations compared to the European environment.
    Pilots must obtain a Part 107 (certificate for commercial drone operations) certificate
    and register their UAVs to be allowed to fly over USA [197]. On top of the rules
    mentioned above, the UAV sector, especially in the EU, is affected by other regulations.
    These include the Recommendation on Cybersecurity of 5G Networks, General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR), the NIS Directive (involves the aviation sector),
    the Electronic Communications Code (involves electronics communications), and
    the Cyber Security Act (involves cyber security certification of devices and applications)
    that cover different aspects of security and privacy, which are all directly or
    indirectly connected to a UAV. Especially regarding the cybersecurity Act, UAVs
    will need to be certified by a National Certification Authority in terms of cyber
    security, following the certification framework that the EU is building [33].
    6. Open issues and future directions Although several solutions have been proposed
    to address the security and safety of IoD, some issues are still open and need
    the efforts of researchers and industry personnel. 6.1. Tracking and compliance
    for drone-to-everything services using blockchain technology The tracking of components
    that go into drone-to-everything services is critical for ensuring safety and
    regulatory compliance. Blockchain technology can be used to store IoT data on
    shared blockchain ledgers, enabling all parties to identify the origin of components
    throughout the drone''s life. The security and privacy of sharing this information
    should be carefully investigated. The key security issue is performing secure,
    easy, and cost-effective access authentication and authorization for drone-to-everything
    services. In addition, the drivers'' mobility pattern is a crucial privacy issue
    that an attacker can learn and use for tracking the component that goes into drone-to-everything
    services. Thus, exploring efficient and privacy-preserving schemes based on blockchain
    technology is crucial to secure component tracking and compliance. 6.2. Novel
    intrusion detection systems Most IDS solutions in IoD focus on detecting intrusions
    related to wireless communications among UAVs and the ground station, but they
    do not cover other intrusions associated with the compromise of the ground control
    station, the drone, or intrusions that bypass the cloud system to manipulate stored
    data. Thus, future research should focus on designing novel IDSs that consider
    the following: • Extension of IDS research: It is recommended that future research
    extend the IDSs to secure other components of IoD, such as drones, ground control
    systems, and cloud servers, and investigate their performance in detecting attacks.
    Another important aspect is the constant change of the network topology, similar
    to a vehicular network [151]. Methods that can cope with the highly dynamic situations
    must be developed [291] and tested in realistic scenarios, taking into consideration
    the interconnection with other systems as well. • IDS Dataset for IoD: Most IDSs
    are tested on network simulators or evaluated using real experiments. They are
    not tested on drone datasets, except for Baig et al. [30] that used DJI Phantom
    4 drone dataset. As presented in Section 5.3.4, the IDSs for IoD are tested under
    non-IoD network traffic datasets such as KDDCup99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto,
    and CICIDS2017. Similar to IDSs in different fields [140], [149], [165], [269],
    the research community needs to create a Benchmark IDS dataset [281] for IoD,
    which consists of attacks and legitimate traffic and considers specific features
    of a UAV. This will help attract research attention in designing, evaluating,
    and comparing different IDS solutions for IoD. • Adversarial learning: Adversarial
    machine learning is a technique that aims to deceive the learning model by manipulating
    the input data, which causes the model to misclassify the data. Adversarial attacks
    on IDSs in IoD must also be investigated, similar to the work presented in [25],
    where attackers manipulated the IDS itself to report false alarms, either negative
    or positive. As many IDSs are designed based on machine learning, future research
    should focus on fortifying the IDS by generating adversarial samples through Generative
    Adversarial Networks (GANs) and training the IDS model on them. 6.3. Security
    and safety co-engineering lifecycle management Secure software development lifecycle
    (SSDL) is a framework that integrates security into the different phases of the
    software development lifecycle, i.e., requirements, design, implementation, verification,
    and release. Development of safety and security co-engineering lifecycle has already
    been addressed in cyber-physical systems and embedded systems [239], [264], [285],
    [304], which integrates safety and security development lifecycle in a coordinated
    way. Likewise, this integration could be considered as a research direction in
    the context of IoDs by focusing on three levels: risk analysis, countermeasures,
    and testing. 6.3.1. Interdependent security and safety risks The interdependencies
    between cyber and safety risks examine how cyberattacks affect the physical world
    and compromise safety properties. Similarly, they examine how safety risks compromise
    cyber security objectives. In [157], several risk analysis approaches integrating
    security and safety risks have been proposed for cyber-physical systems. In the
    context of IoD, it is recommended to follow the same approach by jointly analyzing
    aspects related to security and safety. To this end, many formal methods can be
    leveraged, such as fault tree analysis and attack tree analysis, that consider
    both security and safety. 6.3.2. Interdependent security and safety countermeasures
    Kriaa et al. [157] defined four types of security-safety interactions, i.e., conditional
    dependency (fulfillment of security requirements conditions safety and vice versa),
    mutual reinforcement (fulfillment of safety requirements contributes to security,
    or vice-versa), antagonism (safety and security requirements or measures lead
    to conflicting situations), and independency (there are no interactions between
    security and safety). Research efforts should consider conditional dependency
    and antagonism interactions. One example of security conditioning safety is that
    an IPS/IDS incorrectly classifies regular messages as malicious. Hence, it could
    affect the correct functionality of drones and compromise their safety. 6.3.3.
    Combined security and safety testing Before deploying the different components
    of IoD, it is of paramount importance to test them to ensure that security and
    safety requirements are met. It has been shown in [157] that there are four types
    of interactions between security and safety. Similar to other domains [285], it
    would be recommended to develop testing and validation methodologies that combine
    security and safety properties in IoD. 6.4. Formal verification of IoD security
    As discussed in this survey, the IoD represents a complex cyber-physical system
    that combines diverse multidisciplinary techniques. Therefore, governing the security
    issue of this system remains challenging. One research area that needs the focus
    of academic and industrial researchers is the formal validation of designed protocols
    and techniques, especially those related to security and safety. More precisely,
    proposed security and safety solutions must be formally proved secure to avoid
    disastrous consequences, primarily when IoD is used in civilian applications.
    The modeling of security solutions must consider the complex aspects of the UAV
    as a standalone system and the network aspects when drones operate as a connected
    fleet. The actual adoption of IoD in civil applications has revealed that drones
    can operate well alone but fail to handle network-based attacks. 6.5. UAV integration
    with other networks The IoD is integrated with different networks, such as 5G,
    IoT, Wi-Fi, and vehicular networks. This integration allows using drones as a
    supporting platform to improve communication performance and network coverage.
    On the other hand, the combined network will be exposed to emerging and complex
    attacks originating from IoD to harm other networks and vice-versa. These emerging
    attacks should be investigated using different methods, such as attack trees and
    attack graph analysis. This integration also requires rethinking the protocols
    to cope with the resource-constrained drones. We identify two types of protocols:
    the drones could switch to different networks during their missions, and hence
    they should ensure seamless, secure communication and continuous connectivity.
    The IoD could play the role of a relay between nodes in a network, e.g., vehicular
    networks. It is crucial to design an integration architecture that considers end-to-end
    communication and authentication protocols executed across heterogeneous networks.
    6.6. Lightweight cryptographic operations In IoD, messages are continuously exchanged
    between the drones and the GCS, which incurs high communication overhead. As drones
    operate on battery and can fly long distances, they require lightweight cryptographic
    protocols to secure IoD communication. To this end, some techniques could be investigated
    such as single-round function [224], or lightweight quantum cryptography [162],
    [170]. As IoD is characterized by highly dynamic topology, a dynamic cryptographic
    approach could also be investigated [194]. It has been recommended in [173] that
    drones should use homomorphic encryption to aggregate several ciphertexts into
    a single ciphertext without the need for decryption. More efforts could be made
    to further improve the efficiency of homomorphic encryption algorithms in IoD
    by getting inspiration from other works [104], [107], [287]. 6.7. Malware detection
    and prevention It has been shown that drones could be infected by malware [226].
    However, there is no existing research on detecting drone malware. In [297], the
    malware classification model is proposed for ground control stations, but it was
    not tested on a drone malware dataset. Instead, it was tested on the Microsoft
    malware classification challenge dataset [225]. Malware detection is an old topic
    that has been well-investigated by academia and industry. The detection of malicious
    software depends on the operating system and requires specific detection features.
    For instance, to detect a WIN32 malicious application, the anti-malware solution
    [100] needs to use features like opcodes, bytecodes, Portable Executable (PE)
    metadata, and API calls. In the case of Android OS, anti-malware solutions [136]
    extract features like permissions, intents, and API calls to distinguish between
    benign and malicious mobile applications. The embedded applications in the drone
    run on specific operating systems such as RTOS [181]. Hence, to detect malicious
    drones, the anti-malware solution has to consider features specific to the drone
    OS, such as API calls and drone navigation state with respect to altitude, position,
    velocity, acceleration, and orientation [132]. Therefore, it is recommended that
    the research community investigate the topic of drone malware detection. In fact,
    there is still room for contributions by taking inspiration from other solutions
    in the literature. They can explore different approaches, such as malware detection
    using static and/or dynamic analysis of the code, signature-based detection, anomaly-based
    detection, supervised and unsupervised learning, etc. Cybercriminals have widely
    used ransomware against desktop, mobile, IoT, and vehicle platforms [31], [54],
    [118], [205], [229]. The aim is to encrypt data or lock access to a system until
    the victim pays a ransom. We predict that a ransomware threat that targets drones
    could emerge in the short term, but by taking another form, i.e., the cybercriminal
    hijacks the drone and releases it when a ransom is paid. The research community
    could think about this issue in advance, inspired by earlier works, and come up
    with a malware detection system that monitors the behavior of the compromised
    application, and identifies the suspicious API calls in the early stages before
    the ransomware attack happens. Building a public dataset for drone malware is
    also an option to boost this research direction, as done in other domains such
    as mobile malware [164], [185], [347] and IoT malware [149], [180]. 6.8. Fleet
    of drones security In a fleet of drones, the drones must cooperate to accomplish
    the group mission. If some drones are compromised or faulty, the mission will
    be affected. To deal with this issue, future research efforts should focus on
    three aspects: trust management, federated learning, and privacy-preserving collaborative
    learning. 6.8.1. Trust management To secure IoD security and ensure the fulfillment
    of its mission, it is important to detect compromised/faulty drones and isolate/repair
    them. This can be achieved by implementing a trust management mechanism that observes
    the behavior of drones and assigns trust or reputation values to them, which helps
    identify trustworthy and rogue nodes. Trust management in IoD is not well-investigated
    [91]. To this end, researchers could get inspiration from trust management solutions
    in other fields, such as IoT [20] and vehicular networks [78]. 6.8.2. Federated
    learning Federated learning is a technique that trains machine learning techniques
    across different devices holding local data without exchanging them. The devices
    exchange parameters, i.e., weights and biases in the case of deep learning, to
    build a global model shared by all nodes. For instance, each drone has a different
    mission experience and is targeted by other attacks. Thus, future research should
    investigate how to leverage federated learning and build a more robust collaborative
    IDS by combining the different local models. 6.8.3. Privacy-preserving collaborative
    learning Fleets of drones have to adopt a collaborative model to accomplish their
    missions. This collaboration should ensure the privacy of sensitive data and learning
    models. In [43], three privacy concerns are identified, i.e., concerns related
    to sensitive input data during model training, model prediction, and model sharing
    with other participants. If the learning process in IoD comprises private information,
    these concerns need to be addressed in the future work. 6.9. Policies and regulations
    Governments should adopt some regulations to ensure the safety of people and properties:
    • Firmer laws: Strict laws must be considered to give licenses and authorization
    to people who want to fly drones. Also, there should be punishments for the illegal
    use of drones or when drones fly over vital or forbidden areas. • Implementation
    of in-depth controls: In-depth controls should be implemented to protect people
    and properties from the threats coming from drones, which could result in physical
    damage and human casualties. To this end, controls could be implemented through
    in-depth defense layers: deterrent, preventive, detective, and corrective, i.e.,
    they occur when an issue is detected. • Security governance in IoD: A security
    governance approach should be applied by the organizations that own or operate
    IoD to ensure their cyber and physical security. It involves people''s roles and
    responsibilities, implementation of countermeasures, security and safety testing,
    and incidence response plans in case of a security breach or mission failure.
    Another aspect of security governance is to provide drone security training for
    drone operators so that they can understand the cyber and physical threats, how
    to deal with cyber and physical incidents, how to make the drone return home safely,
    and how to protect the critical infrastructure and assets of the organization
    against malicious drones. 6.10. Incident response and mission continuity Incident
    response and business continuity plans are the key components of security strategies
    in organizations. The incident response aims to respond to and recover from incidents,
    whereas business continuity aims to limit the impact of incidents and ensure the
    timely resumption of essential operations. In the context of IoD, we can inspire
    security strategies to develop an incident response plan that indicates how to
    deal with all incidents that could occur in IoD. As the objective of IoD is to
    accomplish their missions, we can also think about mission continuity instead
    of business continuity to deal with how drones could ensure the timely resumption
    of their operations and missions. To this end, it is vital to think about designing
    fault-tolerant and attack-tolerant solutions that ensure mission continuity. 6.11.
    Ranked open issues in IoD In this section, we suggest ranking the above-mentioned
    topics related to open issues, as shown in Table 16, to identify which topics
    require greater attention from the research community. To this end, we propose
    a formal approach that considers two parameters: • Risk Value: Each one of the
    above topics aims to address some attacks. We give priority to the topics that
    are associated with attacks of higher risk values. We use the risk values that
    are defined in Section 4.6, and range from Insignificant to Extreme, and are assigned
    the following values: Qualitative value Quantitative value Insignificant 1 Low
    2 Medium 3 High 4 Extreme 5 • Countermeasure Effectiveness: Research efforts should
    focus on proposing security countermeasures with higher effectiveness. The countermeasures
    are classified as: preventive, detective, and recovery. – The preventive countermeasures
    are the most effective, as they prevent the occurrence of the incident. – The
    detective countermeasures act when the incident occurs. – The recovery countermeasures
    act after an incident occurs. For each countermeasure type, we assign the following
    effectiveness values: Countermeasure Countermeasure Effectiveness Preventive 3
    Detective 2 Recovery 1 Table 16. Prioritized open issues in IoD. Open issue topic
    Risk Countermeasure Priority Priority Value Effectiveness Importance Ranking Tracking
    and compliance for drone-to-everything services using blockchain technology Insignificant
    Preventive 3 Low  Novel Intrusion Detection Systems Extreme Detective 10 Medium  Security
    and safety co-engineering lifecycle management Extreme Preventive 15 High  Formal
    verification of IoD security Extreme Preventive 15 High  UAV integration with
    other networks Extreme Preventive 15 High  Lightweight cryptographic operations
    Extreme Preventive 15 High  Malware detection and prevention Medium Preventive
    9 Medium  Fleet of drones security Extreme Detective 10 Medium  Policies and regulations
    Extreme Preventive 15 High  Incident response and mission continuity Extreme Recovery
    5 Low We define the Priority Importance using the following formula: Based on
    the Priority Importance value, we define the Priority Ranking of the topic as
    follows: From Table 16, we can observe that most of the topics are associated
    with Extreme risks, which target the drone and its fine-grained assets, as shown
    in Table 8 and Table 9. The risk associated with tracking and compliance for drone-to-everything
    services using blockchain technology topic is insignificant, as it targets blockchain
    services, which are deployed in secure environments. In Table 8, the risk of compromising
    the drone, specifically the flight control system, is Medium. Our proposed ranking
    approach shows that: • The following five topics require high attention: – Security
    and safety co-engineering lifecycle management. – Formal verification of IoD security.
    – UAV integration with other networks. – Lightweight cryptographic operations.
    – Policies and regulations. • The following three topics require medium attention:
    – Novel intrusion detection systems. – Malware detection and prevention. – Fleet
    of drone security. • The following two topics require low attention: – Tracking
    and compliance for drone-to-everything services using blockchain technology. –
    Incident response and mission continuity. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we have
    provided a comprehensive survey related to the cyber and physical security of
    the Internet of Drones (IoD). Previous security-focused surveys on IoD had a limited
    scope and focused on classifying the various attacks and threats with partial
    coverage of cybersecurity countermeasures. We have attempted to address these
    gaps in this survey and presented various novelties that are not present in the
    existing literature. Specifically, we have proposed three taxonomies that are
    related to (i) assets of drones, (ii) attacks, and (iii) countermeasures. The
    proposed taxonomies allow finer-level of granularity for asset identification,
    which enables broader identification of possible attacks. Additionally, we have
    evaluated the IoD risks and identified their impacts using a novel concept, named
    Chain of Impact. We have also proposed a taxonomy of technical and non-technical
    countermeasures according to two implementation phases: Pre-incident and Post-incident.
    In addition, we have presented the countermeasures along with their performance
    results and limitations. Finally, we have identified the open issues and suggested
    future research directions for IoD security. We have ranked the identified open
    issues according to the level of attention they should receive from the research
    community. Particularly, the interaction between security and safety, formal verification
    of IoD security, UAV integration with other networks, lightweight cryptographic
    operations, and policies and regulations should be given the highest priority.

    The emergence of precision and digital livestock farming presents an opportunity
    for sustainable animal farming practices that enhance animal welfare and health.
    However, this transformation of modern animal farming through digital technology
    has several implications for the technological, social, economic, and environmental
    aspects of farming. It is crucial to analyze the ethical considerations associated
    with the digitalization of modern animal farming, particularly in the context
    of human-animal relationships and potential objectification. This analysis can
    help develop frameworks for improving animal welfare and promoting sustainability
    in animal farming.One of the primary ethical concerns of digital livestock farming
    is the potential for a digital divide between farmers who have access to advanced
    technologies and those who do not. This could lead to a disparity in animal welfare
    and health outcomes for different groups of animals. Additionally, the use of
    artificial intelligence in digital livestock farming may lead to a loss of personal
    connection between farmers and animals, which could impact the animal''s well-being.
    Another ethical concern of digital livestock farming is the potential for objectification
    of animals as mere data points. The use of sensors and other monitoring technologies
    can provide valuable data on animal health and behavior, but it is important to
    remember that animals are sentient beings with complex emotional and social needs.
    The use of digital technologies should not lead to neglect of animal welfare or
    a lack of human responsibility towards animals.Furthermore, social context becomes
    essential while integrating technologies in the livestock farming to overcome
    ethics. By considering the cultural and societal norms of different communities,
    we can ensure that the use of digital technologies does not undermine these values.
    To address these ethical challenges, the development of standards and codes of
    conduct for the adoption and implementation of digital livestock farming tools
    and platforms can help ensure that animal welfare and sustainability are prioritized.
    This can help alleviate the privacy concerns of stakeholders and improve sustainability
    in animal farming practices. Additionally, the use of virtual and augmented reality
    technologies can provide a way to enhance human-animal interactions and provide
    more personalized care to animals, further promoting animal welfare. Keywords

    Footnotes Abstract: Big Data empowers the farming community with the information
    needed to optimize resource usage, increase productivity, and enhance the sustainability
    of agricultural practices. The use of Big Data in farming requires the collection
    and analysis of data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and farmer
    surveys. While Big Data can provide the farming community with valuable insights
    and improve efficiency, there is significant concern regarding the security of
    this data as well as the privacy of the participants. Privacy regulations, such
    as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU Code
    of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed
    EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide
    specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations.
    To make confidential agricultural data widely available for Big Data analysis
    without violating the privacy of the data subjects, we consider privacy-preserving
    methods of data sharing in agriculture. Synthetic data that retains the statistical
    properties of the original data but does not include actual individuals’ information
    provides a suitable alternative to sharing sensitive datasets. Deep learning-based
    synthetic data generation has been proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing.
    However, there is a lack of compliance with documented data privacy policies in
    such privacy-preserving efforts. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
    enforcing privacy policy rules in privacy-preserving data generation algorithms.
    We explore several available agricultural codes of conduct, extract knowledge
    related to the privacy constraints in data, and use the extracted knowledge to
    define privacy bounds in a privacy-preserving generative model. We use our framework
    to generate synthetic agricultural data and present experimental results that
    demonstrate the utility of the synthetic dataset in downstream tasks. We... (Show

    Location: Sorrento, Italy SECTION I. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) [1], food production needs to be raised by 70% by 2050 to feed
    the projected population of 9.6 billion by 2050. To meet the growing needs of
    an expanding population, the farming community needs efficient ways to enhance
    agricultural productivity, optimize resource utilization, and implement sustainable
    farming practices. Technology plays an essential role in meeting these goals.
    Specifically, the use of Big Data in agriculture enables us to model large volumes
    of crowd-sourced data, sensor measurement data, and environmental information
    to understand emerging patterns in agriculture. This helps us stay ahead of modern
    challenges such as changing climate, farmland depletion, etc. However, sharing
    data from multiple sources raises privacy concerns. Privacy regulations, such
    as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [2], have specific
    requirements on when and how such data can be shared. Even in the absence of specific
    regulations, individuals may have significant concerns about sharing their private
    information. We need privacy-preserving methods of sharing agricultural data that
    abide by policy regulations and encourage the farming community to participate
    in collective study. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    is one of the most comprehensive data protection regulations globally and has
    implications for agricultural data in EU member states. However, it does not specifically
    address data sharing in agriculture. The EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data
    sharing by contractual agreement [3] was created as an addendum to the GDPR. This
    code of conduct (Code) was designed to promote data-sharing leads in agriculture
    by setting transparent principles, clarifying responsibilities, and creating trust
    among partners. The EU A.I. Act proposed in Apri12021 by the European Commission
    proposed as the first EU regulatory framework for AI. It is the first regulation
    of its kind to define and classify AI used in different applications according
    to the risk they pose to users. AI models that pose higher risks require stricter
    regulation. In this study, the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing
    by contractual agreement [3], and the E.U. A.I. Act [4] have been identified as
    relevant privacy policies that can help us understand privacy concerns related
    to Big Data in agriculture. Privacy in shared data has been discussed in prior
    work focusing on anonymization and encryption of data. However, these methods
    can be costly and not easily scalable. Privacy-preserving data generation refers
    to the process of creating new synthetic data that maintains privacy while retaining
    useful characteristics and statistical properties of the original data. Privacy-preserving
    data generation is a robust way of protecting sensitive data while still making
    them useful for wide-scale sharing. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
    one of the well-known models for generating synthetic samples that can have the
    same distributional characteristics as the original data. Synthetic data generated
    using privacy-preserving versions of GAN have been shown to replace real data
    for statistical and analytical purposes while protecting sensitive information
    [5]–[8]. While previous studies have successfully generated privacy preserving
    of synthetic data, they do not consider the requirements of privacy regulations.
    Thus, there is a gap between data privacy as defined by the privacy policies and
    the privacy constraints in the privacy-preserving methods. To create a secure
    and privacy-preserving version of agricultural data that aligns with the regulations
    outlined in policy frameworks, we present an innovative framework. This framework
    is designed to generate data while strictly adhering to the guidelines established
    in agricultural privacy regulations. By incorporating the definition of privacy
    from these regulations into our model, we establish privacy constraints that specifically
    address the nuances of shared agricultural data. The resulting synthetic dataset
    serves as a privacy-preserving alternative to confidential data, ensuring compliance
    with the principles outlined in agricultural codes of conduct. Our proposed framework
    effectively mitigates a range of threats, including privacy leakage, re-identification,
    side-channel, linkage, and attribute inference attacks. Through extensive experimentation,
    our model demonstrates resilience against various privacy threat models. Importantly,
    it achieves this while maintaining both statistical similarity to the original
    data and practical utility in downstream tasks. The remainder of this paper is
    organized as follows. Section II establishes the background and motivation for
    our work in the context of potential threats against privacy-preserving framework,
    privacy policy regulations, and privacy-preserving data generation efforts. Section
    III presents our framework for policy enforcement in privacy-preserving data generation
    through rule extraction from privacy regulation and attribute regulation in generative
    models. Section IV presents the results of our experimental work on policy-enforced
    data sharing Agricultural data. Section V presents the literature review on privacy
    regulations and methods to secure agriculture data from potential threats. The
    conclusion and future work are shown in Section VI. Figure 1: Overview of Potential
    Threats. Show All SECTION II. Background and Motivation A. Privacy Threat Models
    in Agriculture In the agricultural domain, privacy-preserving mechanisms are designed
    to protect individuals’ sensitive information while allowing data to be analyzed
    and utilized for various purposes. However, these mechanisms can also be vulnerable
    to specific attacks that attempt to compromise the privacy they aim to preserve.
    Here are some potential threats against privacy-preserving measures, where threats
    are categorized as intentional and unintentional threats. 1) Deliberate Threats:
    Attribute inference attack: In attribute inference attacks, an attacker tries
    to reconstruct the original training data or extract sensitive information from
    the model’s parameters. This type of attack is particularly concerning when the
    model is used to process private or personal data. Re-identification Attacks:
    Even if individual data points are anonymized, attackers could use auxiliary information
    from other sources to link seemingly anonymous data back to specific individuals,
    thereby breaching their privacy. Membership Inference Attacks: These attacks attempt
    to determine whether a specific data point was used during the training process.
    By analyzing the model’s outputs, an attacker can infer whether a particular data
    point was part of the training dataset, potentially revealing sensitive information
    about the data owner. Side-Channel Attacks: These attacks focus on exploiting
    unintended information leakage during the execution of privacy-preserving algorithms.
    By analyzing execution time, memory usage, or power consumption, attackers might
    gain insights into the data being processed. 2) Inadvertent Threats: Data Leakage:
    Confidentiality breach in agricultural data refers to a situation where sensitive
    or private information related to agriculture is unintentionally disclosed to
    unauthorized individuals or entities. This breach could involve the exposure of
    data such as farming practices, crop yields, land ownership details, financial
    information, and other sensitive information that farmers or agricultural organizations
    would prefer to keep confidential. Configuration Error: A configuration error
    as an unintentional error in agricultural data refers to a mistake or oversight
    made during the setup or arrangement of technology systems and software used in
    the agricultural context. These errors occur due to misconfigurations or incorrect
    settings that lead to unintended consequences or outcomes in the collection, storage,
    processing, or sharing of agricultural data.For instance, in precision agriculture
    where data-driven technologies are used to optimize farming practices, a configuration
    error could involve setting incorrect parameters for sensors, drones, or automated
    machinery. This might result in inaccurate data collection, leading to flawed
    decisions about irrigation, fertilization, or pest control. Inaccurate Encryption:
    Inaccurate encryption as an unintentional error in agricultural data refers to
    the incorrect implementation or utilization of encryption techniques meant to
    secure sensitive information related to agriculture. Encryption is a process of
    converting data into a secure, unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access
    or data breaches. However, when encryption is applied improperly or inaccurately,
    it can lead to unintended consequences and compromise the confidentiality of agricultural
    data.For instance, if encryption keys (the codes required to decrypt the data)
    are managed inadequately, there’s a risk of unauthorized parties gaining access
    to the decrypted information. Additionally, using weak encryption algorithms or
    outdated encryption methods might render the data susceptible to decryption by
    attackers with sufficient computing power or knowledge.Inaccurate encryption practices
    in agriculture data could also involve failing to encrypt all necessary data fields
    or overlooking specific data sources, leaving certain parts of the information
    vulnerable to exposure. This can be particularly concerning when dealing with
    sensitive data such as crop yield projections, land ownership details, or financial
    records. Unauthorized Access: Unauthorized access as an unintentional error in
    agricultural data refers to situations where individuals or entities gain entry
    to sensitive agricultural information without proper authorization or permission.
    This error occurs due to vulnerabilities in data security measures, misconfigured
    access controls, or inadvertent lapses in safeguarding agricultural data.For instance,
    if an agricultural database containing information about crop yields, pricing
    strategies, or proprietary farming techniques lacks proper access controls, unauthorized
    individuals could gain access to this information. This could happen due to weak
    passwords, lack of encryption, or overlooking permissions that restrict data access
    to only authorized personnel.Unintentional unauthorized access might also occur
    if a legitimate user inadvertently shares login credentials or access links with
    unintended parties or if attackers exploit a software vulnerability to gain entry
    to sensitive agricultural databases. B. Privacy Regulations in Agriculture Code
    of Conduct describes contractual relations and guides the use of agricultural
    data, particularly on the rights of use and access of the data. Code was a collaborative
    step between massive institutions representing various enterprises producing animal
    fertilizers, seeds, feed, or farm machinery and agents of animal breeding organizations
    as well as farmer’s cooperatives in the EU associated with the Council on Ethical
    & Judicial Affairs (CEJA) [9] and Copa-Cogeca (that concentrates on young farmers
    up to 40 years of age). In establishing the Code, it was highlighted by the parties
    that “the Code promotes the advantages of data sharing and allows agribusiness
    models, including agri-cooperatives and other agri-businesses, to shift into an
    age of digitally enhanced farming swiftly.” [3] The European Parliament has also
    launched a substantial amount of work in AI. Recently, “The AI ACT” [4] has been
    proposed to protect user’s data from AI risks. The European Parliament has also
    launched a substantial amount of work in AI. Due to extreme technological transition
    in recent years and potential challenges, the EU desires balanced practices. The
    Union aims to preserve the EU’s technological supervision and assurance that Europeans
    can benefit from new technologies designed and performed according to Union rules
    and regulations. Figure 2 shows the relation between the EU Code and the AI Act.
    C. Synthetic Data in Privacy Various approaches have been proposed for privacy-preserving
    data sharing. Some common approaches towards privacy use differential privacy
    [10], K-anonymity [11], L-diversity [12] and t-closeness [13]. Privacy-Preserving
    Generative Models use Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    to generate synthetic data that closely mimics the original data distribution.
    This synthetic data can be shared without revealing actual individual data thus
    providing privacy. Generative adversarial Networks (GANs) is a class of deep learning-based
    generative model in AI. GANs are extremely accurate in synthetic data generation
    and translation, particularly for image and text data [14]–[17]. The principal
    architecture in a GAN framework involves a generative model G that captures the
    data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability
    that a sample came from the original distribution rather than G. The training
    procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. As the training
    progresses, the generator gets better at generating new examples that plausibly
    come close to the samples from the original distribution. The idea behind GAN
    can be formulated as a two-player min-max game with value function V(G, D): min
    G max D V(G,D)= E x∼ p data a (x) [logD(x)] + E z∼ p z (z) [log(1−D(G(z)))] (1)
    View Source Figure 2: EU Code of Conduct Vs. AI Act Show All For agricultural
    data, the data is usually tabular i.e. a mix of discrete and continuous values.
    Additionally, the continuous values are not arbitrarily random and usually follow
    a specific distribution within a given range. To account for this, we need specialized
    versions of GAN that can accurately replicate system data that is collected over
    our digital twin. In an unconditioned generative model, there is no control over
    the modes of the data being generated. Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets
    (CGAN) [18] introduces the concept that by conditioning the model on additional
    information, it is possible to direct the data generation process. The objective
    function of the two-player minimax game is rewritten as: min G max D V(G,D)= E
    x∼ p data  (x) [logD(x∣y)] + E z∼ p x (z) [log(1−D(G(z∣y)))] (2) View Source To
    ensure that the synthetic dataset is distributionally close to the original dataset,
    and provides privacy protection by the principle of t-closeness, Kotal et al.
    [8] propose the use of Earth Mover’s distance (EMD). he The EMD of the distribution
    of features in the synthetic is calculated w.r. t. the original dataset. The sampling
    process continues to sample from the trained generator till the generated distribution
    is within a threshold distance of the original distribution. To address the challenges
    of tabular data, the model uses three key steps during generation: (1) Mode-specific
    normalization, (2) Conditional Generator, and (3) Training by sampling. SECTION
    III. Privacy Preserving Data Generation with Policy Enforcement The various models
    proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing do not take into regulations on Information
    Privacy. While they can provide privacy protection for data, there is still a
    gap between privacy as ensured by these models and privacy as required by the
    law. Bridging this gap requires translating legal privacy requirements into machine-enforceable
    values and mechanisms. This involves understanding the key principles of data
    protection regulations and incorporating them into designing and implementing
    privacy-preserving models. This work proposes a novel framework for Policy Enforcement
    in privacy-preserving data generation. We process the relevant privacy regulations
    and extract privacy rules from the human written document. The rules are converted
    into a machine-readable and enforceable format. The privacy rule sets are then
    used to guide the privacy-preserving data generation model. Figure 3 demonstrates
    the overall architecture of our proposed framework. A. Rule Extraction from Privacy
    Regulations We use a Deontic Logic Rule-based approach to extract relevant rules
    from Privacy regulations into a machine-enforceable format. First, we create a
    predefined list of modal verbs used to express obligation types in legal domains.
    Next, we tokenize each token in the set and use the Python library to get dependency
    analysis and POS (part of speech) tags. The algorithm searches for predefined
    triggers within a given sentence to extract its position (starting index), each
    mention of the trigger, and its dependency tags. Deontic modality [19] [20] is
    predominantly used in legal documents to describe vendors’ prohibitions, obligations,
    and permissions. For instance, ‘may’, ‘must’, and ‘must not’, frame ‘permission’,
    ‘obligation’, and ‘prohibition’ respectively. Table I defines all the deontic
    types, and Table II has all the model verbs associated with each deontic type.
    Modality guides the linguistic ability to express alternative forms the world
    could be and is generally represented by modal auxiliaries such as must, can,
    shall, will, and may. Below are some examples from the EU Code of Conduct for
    agriculture. Permission Rule 1: The farmer can provide data to land owners, potato
    processors, the government, paying authorities, etc. [3] Permission Rule 2: Unless
    otherwise agreed in the contract, the data originator can transmit this data to
    another data user. [3] Obligation Rule 1: Contracts must not be amended without
    the prior consent of the data originator. [3] Obligation Rule 2: Parties may not
    use, process, or share data without the consent of the data originator. [3] Prohibition
    Rule 1: Data cannot be owned in the same way as physical assets. [3] Prohibition
    Rule 2: Parties may not use, process, or share data without the consent of the
    data originator. [3] Figure 3: Framework for Privacy-Preserving Data Generation
    in Agriculture with Privacy Policy Enforcement Show All Table I Deontic Types
    Taxonomy B. Policy enforcement in Data Generation The rules extracted from policy
    documents in Section III-A form a rule set. This rule set is used to guide the
    data generation process. We use the Privetab model [8] for privacy-preserving
    data generation. The principle of privacy used in the model is t-closeness [13]
    which stipulates that the distributional similarity between the original and synthetic
    data should be within a threshold to ensure privacy. The threshold value is not
    pre-determined and often determined based on the needs of an organization. To
    ensure that these privacy constraints meet the requirements of the privacy regulations,
    we use two key steps: Table II Modal Verbs For Deontic Types 1) Determine Attribute
    Sensitivity: According to the EU Code of Conduct and “The AI Act” all the features
    in the dataset are associated with the relevant rule and risk level. We use the
    rule set extracted from the privacy policy to determine the risk level of each
    attribute in the original data. Attributes are categorized into three levels of
    sensitivity: low, medium and high. Highly sensitive attributes are extremely risky
    to share and thus require the highest privacy protection. Attributes with low
    sensitivity are less risky and thus can be shared with minimal risks. 2) Enforce
    privacy threshold based on Sensitivity category: When generating the privacy-preserving
    synthetic dataset, we have to ensure that the privacy threshold is satisfied.
    The value of the privacy threshold can be tuned. Based on the attribute sensitivity
    of the dataset determined from privacy regulations, we modulate the privacy threshold
    for each attribute. The high-risk attributes have the strictest threshold for
    privacy. The privacy threshold for low-risk attributes is less strict. This ensures
    that the privacy requirements of the regulations are met in this process while
    maintaining the utility of the generated data for downstream tasks. SECTION IV.
    Experimental Results Our framework for privacy-preserving data generation with
    policy enforcement can be used for sharing sensitive datasets. We demonstrate
    the use of our framework for Agricultural Big Data as a proof-of-concept. In this
    section, we use our framework to generate a privacy-preserving version of the
    ITM4Impact dataset [21]. The implementation of our policy-enforced privacy-preserving
    data generation framework is made available in a library1. We provide the experimental
    results to demonstrate that our framework provides a privacy-preserving alternative
    for sensitive datasets that is still useful in downstream tasks. A. Dataset In
    this experiment, we use the ITM4Impact dataset [21] collected by the ILRI institute
    to measure and determine the impact of infection and treatment method (ITM) on
    farmers. This dataset was anonymized for public release. We observe that some
    of the information shared in this dataset is privacy sensitive and poses a risk
    towards re-identification of participating farmers. In the ITM4Impact dataset,
    there are around 800 attributes. Approximately more than 140 groups segregate
    these attributes into multiple categories. According to the EU Code of Conduct
    and “The AI Act”, all the features in the dataset are associated with the relevant
    rule and risk level. More than 500 attributes are related to the farmer PII data
    or the data generated in the farming environment and categorized with a “High”
    privacy level. More than 270 attributes, as per regulation, fall under “Medium”
    risk, and only around 30 features can be public and can be shared with the public.
    However, we see that many breaches have happened often, and people end up paying
    huge penalties for not securing the information by adhering to the regulation
    policies. As mentioned in the regulatory document, it is crucial that this data
    should be secured and cannot be shared unless the individual has permission. Below
    are some of the rules extracted from the regulation for applying them to the relevant
    attributes in the dataset: The data originator can store data in a primary location,
    in a data platform, or cloud-based storage platforms. [3] The datasets should
    only be kept for as long as is strictly necessary for the relevant analyses to
    be carried out. [3] If the data is being used to make decisions about the data
    originator “as a natural person” the GDPR applies. For instance, the rights regarding
    data produced on the farm or during farming operations are granted to (“owned
    by”) the farmer and may be used extensively by them. [3] B. Fidelity Results Evaluating
    the fidelity of synthetically generated data is a critical step in assessing the
    effectiveness of your privacy-preserving data generation framework. By measuring
    the realisticness of synthetic data, we can determine how closely it resembles
    real data and its potential for utility in downstream tasks. We provide two fidelity
    metrics for our model. 1) T-SNE Visualization: For utility in downstream tasks,
    it is important that the synthetic dataset provides the same data coverage as
    the original dataset. As observed in Figure 4 for privacy-preserving data generation,
    there is minimal loss in coverage from the original dataset from both with and
    without policy enforcement in the generation process. Figure 4: Comparison of
    T-SNE projection of Original and Privacy-preserving Synthetic Data Show All 2)
    Statistical Similarity: We provide an of the statistical resemblance between the
    original and synthetic datasets for attributes at the 3 different risk levels.
    In general, the metrics demonstrate a strong consistency between the synthetic
    datasets generated with our framework and the original dataset. Figure 5, 6 and
    7 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) graphs comparing the original
    and synthetic data for three attributes at low, medium, and high privacy risk
    level respectively. The average KS statistic, which measures the maximum difference
    in CDFs between the original and synthetic data is 0.04 for a113 attributes. Figure
    5: Comparison of CDF for Original vs Synthetic data in Low Risk Attribute Show
    All Figure 6: Comparison of CDF for Original vs Synthetic data in Medium Risk
    Attribute Show All C. Utility Results It is important that the resultant dataset
    of our framework is still useful in replacing the original dataset for downstream
    tasks. One of the most important use cases of big data is in the field of Machine
    learning (ML). We show here that the data generated from our framework can replace
    the original dataset for ML prediction tasks. We evaluated ML models trained on
    the original dataset against ML models trained on the generated data. Consistent
    performance across both models would signify that the synthetic data retains relevant
    information for the task. It is important to note here the test set should be
    the same to compare the performance of both models. One of the use cases of ML
    prediction for agricultural data is farmer category prediction. We use 4 ML predictive
    models here: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF),
    and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC). As observed in Figure 8a and Figure 8b,
    the ML prediction models have comparable performance on data generated both with
    and without policy enforcement. The average accuracy of ML models trained on the
    original data is 0.95. The average accuracy of ML models trained on synthetic
    data generated without policy enforcement is 0.9. The average accuracy of ML models
    trained on synthetic data generated without policy enforcement is 0.895. The average
    loss in accuracy for ML models trained on synthetic data generated without policy
    enforcement is 0.05. The average loss in accuracy for ML models trained on synthetic
    data generated without policy enforcement is 0.055. Thus there is an average loss
    of 0.005 in accuracy of data generated with vs without policy enforcement. Thus
    the data generated from our framework retains the most relevant information for
    downstream ML tasks. Figure 7: Comparison of CDF for Original vs Synthetic data
    in High Risk Attribute Show All D. Privacy Results 1) Attribute Inference Attack:
    In attribute inference attacks, an attacker tries to reconstruct the original
    training data or extract sensitive information from the model’s parameters. In
    this setting, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training records and
    access to a model trained on those records and infers the unknown values of a
    sensitive feature of those records. Attribute inference attacks typically use
    ML models to learn about the original dataset from the predictions of the trained
    model and try to predict the values of unknown sensitive attributes with a confidence
    score. Efficient Attribute Inference attacks can break privacy-preserving efforts
    by un-masking the values of sensitive attributes. The lower accuracy of attribute
    inference attack models proves that privacy-preserving algorithms are efficient
    in evading these attacks. In Figure 9, we compare the results of a re-identification
    attack against privacy-preserving datasets generated with and without policy enforcement.
    For a113 risk levels, the accuracy of the attribute inference attack model is
    lower for the dataset generated with our framework of policy enforcement. for
    privacy-preserving data generated without policy enforcement, the average attribute
    inference attack accuracy is 0.35 across the 3 privacy risk levels. For privacy-preserving
    data generated without policy enforcement, the average attribute inference attack
    accuracy is 0.3 across the 3 privacy risk levels. Thus, there is a 0.05 increase
    in accuracy loss for data generated with policy enforcement. For attributes with
    high privacy risk, the increase in accuracy loss is 0.08. This shows that the
    dataset generated with our approach is more resistant to attribute inference attacks.
    Figure 8: Prediction performance with the model trained on Original vs Privacy-preserving
    Synthetic Data Show All 2) Re-identification Attack: Re-identification attacks
    are variations of linkage attacks where even if individual data points are anonymized,
    attackers could use auxiliary information from other sources to link seemingly
    anonymous data back to specific individuals, thereby breaching their privacy.
    Efficient re-identification algorithms use ML to infer information about anonymized
    datasets with partial knowledge of the original dataset or auxiliary information.
    It is then used to predict de-anonymized values of sensitive attributes in a dataset.
    Higher accuracy of re-identification attacks in de-identified datasets shows that
    the dataset still contains considerable privacy risk. In Figure 10, we compare
    the results of the re-identification attack against privacy-preserving datasets
    generated with and without policy enforcement. Data generated without policy enforcement
    has a consistent accuracy against re-identification attacks for the 3 risk levels
    of attributes ( ≈ 0.50). For attributes with low privacy risk, the re-identification
    attack model has comparable accuracy (0.51) against our framework with policy
    enforcement. However, for attributes with medium and high privacy risk, our framework
    with policy enforcement works better with an average accuracy loss of 0.07 in
    re-identification attacks. Thus the dataset generated with our approach is more
    resistant against reidentification attacks. Figure 9: Comparison of Accuracy of
    Attribute Inference attacks against privacy preserving data generation with vs
    without policy enforcement Show All Figure 10: Comparison of Accuracy of Re-identification
    attacks against privacy preserving data generation with vs without policy enforcement
    Show All SECTION V. Related Work In the absence of precisely elaborated rules
    on the appropriate ways to deal with the legal implications of digital farming
    technologies on agricultural companies and relation-ships, farmers and their agribusiness
    organizations who deliver digital farming technologies started to shape their
    policies to enhance agricultural data management techniques and provide a foundation
    for reliable data sharing. Agricultural security and privacy principles and codes
    of conduct have been developed in different parts of the world. In 2014, in the
    U.S., the American Farm Bureau’s Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data
    (2019) [22] was the foremost to draw awareness to some of the problems farmers
    had about how their information was being collected and shared. After this initiative
    was 2014 New Zealand’s Farm Data Code of Practice [23], and more recently, in
    2019, we noticed the E.U. Code of Conduct launch on agricultural data sharing
    by contractual agreement [3]. With the recent advances in Big Data, there is a
    gap between the computational capabilities and the data available for research.
    Data scientists are invested in gathering large volumes of data with secure and
    privacy-preserving approaches. Privacy-preserving methods and the impact of privacy
    policies on data sharing have been an ongoing avenue of research [24]–[28]. There
    has been significant research in designing privacy-preserving data-sharing methods.
    However, most approaches have a caveat associated with them. Among these various
    privacy approaches, differential privacy [10], K-anonymity [11], L-diversity [12],
    and t-closeness [13] are worth noting. It has also been shown that achieving one
    of the privacy metrics can ensure others [29]. Synthetic data can provide anonymity
    to original data with-out loss of accuracy in downstream data analysis tasks.
    In general, there is a lot of evidence of GANs being used for synthetic data generation
    and translation in image and text data [14]–[17]. However, the properties of system
    or device data make it distinct from image and text data. The system data is usually
    tabular i.e. contains a mix of continuous and discrete variables, and in some
    cases, the sequence of consecutive rows in the data is important. A conditional
    generator model can address the issue of mixed attributes in tabular data by seeking
    to minimize the distance between generated and real data given a fixed value of
    the discrete variable [8], [30]–[34]. While there are privacy-preserving models
    for data sharing, these models do not take into account the rules stated in privacy
    policies such as GDPR [35] [36], EU code of conduct [3] etc. Hence, there is no
    mechanism to ensure that data shared through these frameworks are compliant with
    the privacy policies. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that learns
    rules from the privacy policies and inducts the information in the generation
    process of a privacy-preserving GAN to ensure that the data generated is privacy-preserving,
    secure to share, and compliant with the data policies. Gupta et al. [37] presented
    a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming
    environments. This research [38] proposed PrivySharing, a blockchain-based innovative
    framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment.
    West [39] introduced a principles-based framework to assess cyber-attack vulner-abilities
    and also constructed a precision agriculture system protected from cyber-attacks.
    Coble et al. [40] discussed a set of analytical techniques that are increasingly
    relevant to solving security and privacy issues. Kumar et al. [41] proposed a
    Secured Privacy-Preserving Framework (SP2F) for smart agricultural Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs), which handles various cyber attacks. In addition, several security
    models for protecting big data in various domains are discussed in [42]–[48].
    SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Work Technology, particularly the integration
    of big data analysis, data processing, cloud computing, and IoT devices, plays
    a pivotal role in enhancing agricultural output both quantitatively and qualitatively.
    Utilizing these technological advancements enables the agricultural sector to
    address intricate challenges by effectively analyzing large volumes of crowd-sourced
    data. However, the sharing of data across various sources raises privacy concerns.
    While GDPR and similar general privacy regulations provide a foundation for digital
    data sharing, the specific privacy risks pertinent to agricultural data remain
    unclear. Defining agricultural big data is still an ongoing debate, making it
    challenging to delineate privacy concerns. This study delves into the EU Code
    of Conduct on agricultural data sharing, established through contractual agreements
    as an extension of GDPR and the E.U. A.I. Act, to comprehensively understand privacy
    concerns in the realm of agricultural data. Though there have been privacy-preserving
    efforts in data sharing, there is a lack of policy enforcement in such efforts.
    To address the challenge of data sharing while ensuring consistency with privacy
    regulations, this paper introduces a novel frame-work for enforcing policy rules
    in privacy-preserving data sharing. This approach not only mitigates privacy risks
    like leakage and re-identification but also bridges the gap between privacy-preserving
    methods and policy-defined privacy requirements. The experimental results show
    that this framework retains substantial statistical similarity with original data
    and retains utility in downstream tasks while being resistant to privacy threat
    models. In conclusion, the proposed framework showcases a promising direction
    for reconciling agricultural data sharing and privacy concerns, ensuring a sustainable
    and secure future for agricultural research and advancement. In the future, we
    would like to extend this framework for policy enforcement in other domains that
    need privacy-preserving efforts in data sharing, such as health, security, etc.

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.

    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time

    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

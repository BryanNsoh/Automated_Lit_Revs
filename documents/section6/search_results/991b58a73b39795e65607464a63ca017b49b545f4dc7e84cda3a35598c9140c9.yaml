    all metrics Abstract Precision agriculture is the mechanism which controls the
    land productivity and maximizes the revinue and minimizes the impact on sorroundings
    by automating the complete agriculture processes. This projected work relies on
    independent internet of things (IoT) enabled wireless sensor network (WSN) framework
    consisting of soil moisture (MC) probe, soil temperature measuring device, environmental
    temperature sensor, environmental humidity sensing device, CO2 sensor, daylight
    intensity device (light dependent resistor) to acquire real-time farm information
    through multi-point measurement. The projected observance technique consists of
    all standalone IoT-enabled WSN nodes used for timely data acquisitions and storage
    of agriculture information. The farm history is additionally stored for generating
    necessary action throughout the whole course of farming. The work summarizes the
    optimum usage of irrigation by the precise management of water valve using neural
    network-based prediction of soil water requirement in 1 h ahead. Our proposed
    irrigation control scheme utilizes structural similarity (SSIM)-based water valve
    management mechanism which is used to locate farm regions having water deficiency.
    Moreover, a close comparative study of optimization techniques, like variable
    learning rate gradient descent, gradient descent for feedforward neural network-based
    pattern classification, is performed and the best practice is employed to forecast
    soil MC on hourly basis together with interpolation method for generating soil
    moisture content (MC) distribution map. Finally, SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency
    is calculated to manipulate the specified valves for maintaining uniform water
    requirement through the entire farm area. The valve control commands are again
    processed using fuzzy logic-based weather condition modeling system to manipulate
    control commands by considering different weather conditions. Similar content

    2020 A Survey Towards Decision Support System on Smart Irrigation Scheduling Using
    Machine Learning approaches Article 09 May 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) are constantly used from the scientific community since the potential
    of ecological monitoring software composed of cost-effective possibility to construct
    and process all kinds of information with greater resolution, these systems are
    regarded as a important part of ubiquitous computing [1, 2]. Therefore, using
    IoT-driven WSN platform in precision agriculture can revolutionize the information
    assortment in agricultural area and encourage the sought after exceptionally machine-driven
    agriculture method which demands intensive understanding of ecological conditions
    in the base level and speedy communication of the information to a distant or
    local server where the source of storage and process, identification of insects
    inside the plants, burial or hyperbolic moist, the alternative generating, and
    so the direction of plantation instrumentation is completed instantly (automatic
    propulsion apparatus such as sprinklers, foggers, valve-controlled irrigation
    method, and so forth is used for management irrigation, and fertilization and
    pest control in order to offset the negative states forming wireless sensor in
    addition to actuator network (WSAN). The above system is accessible globally due
    to the involvement of IoT technology [3,4,5]. A fast evaluation and observation
    of soil moisture content (MC) of this massive area is necessary so that optimum
    irrigation will be possible at agriculture plantation region. Gravimetric method
    is called the standard to determine soil water content version, but it is not
    effective in providing large-scale fast data collection and can be limited to
    a compact dimension quantity. Geophysical techniques like ground penetrating radar
    (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) quantify a bigger sample quantity and
    therefore are accommodated to cover huge areas economically, which could not triumph
    from different procedures [6,7,8]. Additional techniques of spectroscopic scanning-based
    soil moisture material discovery are most frequently used to find soil MC map
    of a huge agriculture property, but utilizing this way is frequently expensive
    work, and also they are not used to find soil MC variations through the summertime
    [9, 10]. Within exactly the same circumstance, wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    land MC evaluation can be utilized for real-time observation and evaluation of
    dirt MC dynamics throughout the whole cropping time. Liang et al. [11] have suggested
    a plan and employ a real-time irrigation forecast using GPRS and WSN system .
    The addition of the general system uses WSN to obtain soil MC information. The
    backend system employs the hereditary back-propagation neural system to assess
    in addition to process sensor information with simulated annealing algorithm to
    maximize the outcome for real time forecast. The experimental results reveal that
    the system suggested by Liang et al. [11] gets the benefits of low-cost, higher
    precision and suitable maintenance. The process implied by Liang et al. [11] is
    a straight sensing of soil MC using WSN platform, and this content does not signify
    the mechanism for water conservation by simply contemplating weather conditions.
    Similarly, the work does not emphasize on remote access like IoT-enabled control
    [12, 13]. At the similar circumstance, additional property-associated parameters
    and ecological parameters might impact the irrigation demands. Timely forecast
    of soil moisture content may soon demonstrate much improved irrigation optimization
    by considering all of the crucial parameters that impact the soil water flow.
    Further, the prediction methodology for a large agriculture land requires high
    computing resources which is possible in a cloud-enabled services. Thus, IoT comes
    into the picture with data analytics and machine learning framework [14,15,16,17,18].
    The suggested method is determined by establishing wireless sensors in the farm
    to acquire real-time observation and evaluate soil moisture content (MC) in the
    test site. The test site is of length 50 m and width 50 m. It is implanted with
    Bermuda grass that is generally used as an ayurvedic medicine for colitis and
    gut infections. The distributed sensor network nodes are utilized to acquire real-time
    soil as well as environmental parameters. The general parameters considered are
    soil moisture content (MC), soil temperature, temperature of the surrounding,
    humidity level of the surrounding, CO2 level of air, as well as sunlight intensity
    level. The WNS environment is configured as nine numbers of wireless sensor nodes
    and a single gateway node (GN) or the coordinator node. The gateway node is also
    called as the coordinator node and others behave as router nodes. The coordinator
    node is responsible to collect all the sensor information and forward it to the
    cloud platform for necessary prediction of soil water requirements. The coordinator
    node is designed with Raspberry Pi3, Zigbee tranceiver (S2 series) and wifi circuitry
    (On board). Further, gateway node connects the internet application via the wifi
    network for the prediction of the soil water requirements. The essential data
    set is obtained over wifi connectivity to the internet server unit for the estimation
    of soil MC. Further, it is used obtain the soil MC distribution map of the land.
    With this work structural similarity index (SSIM)-based soil MC deficiency is
    calculated to manipulate irrigation valves to maintain the required water content
    uniform over the farm area. The performance of two different optimization algorithms
    such as VLRGD and GD-based neural network (NN) data prediction strategies is compared
    by computing few statistical errors like RMSE, R-squared error and MSE. Similarly,
    Majone et al. [19] have used wireless sensor network to supervise MC dynamics
    of the top soil in both time and space that is appropriate to examine the relationship
    between MC dynamics and plant physiology. The wireless sensor network deployment
    consists of twenty-seven locations (in verticals direction) configured by multi-hop
    configuration. The every wireless node contains 5 numbers of soil moisture sensor
    probes those are deployed in the varied depths like 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80, along
    with a temperature sensing device (temperature sensor PT100) at a distance downwards
    25 cm [3, 17]. The method projected by Majone et al. [19] does not provide the
    mechanism for site-specific irrigation valve control for maintaining efficient
    irrigation requirement. Irrigation scheduling and decision support system will
    provide better control over farm land water requirement. And also the water requirement
    is not precisely controlled by considering site-specific weather data. There are
    several weather condition-dependent irrigation controllers available commercially.
    All these instruments are based on few environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and solar radiation [20,21,22,23,24]. But other environmental parameters
    like wind speed, CO2 and soil-related parameters are also affects the farm irrigation
    requirements [25,26,27]. The complete intelligent weather-dependent irrigation
    control scheme is also discussed in this article. In the similar perspective,
    Lenka et al. [28] projected the MC prediction using partial-least-square-regression
    and fuzzy logic technique to manage the land irrigation requirements. The method
    produces MSE about 0.183193 and RMSE about 0.428011. The method proposed by Lenka
    et al. [28] controls the farm irrigation valve in a real-time approach, but zone-wise
    irrigation map is not included in the work. Similarly Lenka et al. [28] proposed
    BFGS-quasi-newton feedforward NN to forecast MC level in 1 h advance, and it is
    integrated with fuzzy logic model to generate appropriate irrigation valve control
    commands. The land soil moisture requirement map is not proposed in this work
    which will be produce better zone-wise as well as crop-wise irrigation control.
    The moisture map shows a better view over the soil moisture content deficiency
    of the farm land [29, 30]. The irrigation requirements can easily be addressed
    quickly by the IoT-driven decision support system (DSS). Our SSIM-based zone and
    crop specific irrigation control mechanism will produce added advantage for efficient
    irrigation control scheme over a large farming area. 2 Proposed methodology The
    main aim of the research work described in this article is to design a precise
    irrigation monitoring and control mechanism consisting of the following objectives.
    Development of a low-cost and high accuracy distributed IoT-enabled wireless sensor
    network environment for accurately monitoring the soil and environmental parameters
    which are used for predicting timely water requirements. Development of a precise
    optimization mechanism for timely forecast of MC level. Development of a robust
    mechanism for generating soil moisture content distribution map using interpolation
    technique. The distribution map is generated by measuring soil moisture content
    at nine positions of the farmland using IoT enabled WSN environment (land dimension
    is defined in the experimental site section of the article). Structural similarity
    index (SSIM) mechanisms that associate interpolated data for generating zone-specific
    irrigation control commands to control irrigation valves. Implementation of the
    weather condition-dependent irrigation control mechanism using fuzzy logic-based
    weather model. The detailed explanation of the above methodology is explained
    in the rest of the sections. 3 Experimental site The test site is situated at
    Bhubaneswar (Latitude: 20.351323, Longitude: 85.806547) in the eastern region
    of India. The cultivated farm has an area of almost 5000 m2. The profile consists
    of a layer of soppy soil, quite 2 m deep with sandy loam surface. Here the key
    top soil quality was found by laboratory study of untouched sample of 3.5 kg.
    Further, the dry bulk density and consistency of the soil sample are about 1.43
    g-cm−3 and 0.46 g-cm−3, respectively. The deployment of WSN nodes is shown in
    Fig. 1 where all nodes are connected with each other using multi-hop mesh network.
    The architecture of a single WSN node is shown in Fig. 2. All sensors are interfaced
    with the node via internal eight channels analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of
    the microcontroller (ATMEGA328P-PU). The microcontroller communicates with the
    Zigbee S2 unit via RS232 interface. Each Zigbee S2 device is configured using
    mesh network topology. The digital out pin of the Zigbee S2 is used to activate
    corresponding sprinkler valve unit. In this work, the irrigation mechanism consists
    of sprinkler pipe lines with sprinkler heads at 0.41 m spacing as well as with
    a flow of 2.2 Lh−1. Fig. 1 Deployment of wireless sensor network nodes in a Bermuda
    grass (Cynodon dactylon) planting site located at Bhubaneswar (latitude: 20.351323,
    longitude: 85.806547) Full size image Fig. 2 a Single node architecture of the
    WSN environment b proposed Single node fabricated for acquiring farm data. The
    IP67 housing used for the sensor node is shown in the right side figure Full size
    image 4 Proposed IoT-driven WSN system The battery capacity and backup are two
    major factors of the WSN nodes. All sensors are connected to the analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. The battery capacity chosen in this work
    is of 6 V/4.5 A/h lead acid type. The solar panel provides necessary charging
    current to the batter unit during day time. The solar panel chosen in this work
    is of 7 V/250 mA. The fabricated WSN node is shown in Fig. 2b. Similarly, the
    energy supply is also monitored in a real-time approach via ADC of the controller.
    The data acquisition is carried out in every 10 min and during non-transmitting
    mode the Zigbee modem is kept in a sleep mode which eventually increases the battery
    backup. During deep sleep mode, the Zigbee generally consumes a very low current
    as 0.02 µA. The Zigbee transceivers are configured in a mesh network pattern by
    updating the device firmware. Finally, the gateway is responsible to send the
    data to the internet web server for real-time analysis of sensor parameters. The
    complete unit is enclosed in a IP65 enclosure and mounted in a panel box. The
    solar panel is inclined at 45° for maximum power efficiency. In the similar context,
    Yunseop James et al. (2008) have proposed a 295-m-long linear movement irrigation
    system at Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley, NE [26]. It is observed that Bluetooth
    radio has many limitations as compared to Zigbee. The wireless nodes are utilized
    to acquire sensor data and forward it to the sink node for storing in its own
    database. The detailed architecture of the sink node is shown in Fig. 3. In this
    work, MATLAB is used to communicate with the sink node for collecting all data
    which is used for soil MC prediction and irrigation valve control using SSIM technique.
    Fig. 3 Sink node architecture of the WSN environment Full size image 5 Proposed
    soil MC prediction and irrigation control methodology The proposed MC prediction
    methodology is based on feedforward neural network where the input parameters
    are the real-time wireless sensor data [31, 32]. In this article, the performance
    analysis of the training algorithms such as VLRGD and GD is deliberated for implementation
    of IoT-WSN bidirectional DSS (decision support system) in PA (precision agriculture)
    mechanism. After the successful prediction of soil MC at every location of the
    WSN nodes connected in the field area, bilinear interpolation is used to generate
    soil MC distribution throughout the farm land. The soil MC distribution map generated
    using interpolation is compared with required soil MC using SSIM, which plays
    an important role in controlling zone-specific irrigation valves. The valve control
    command generated using SSIM is used to evaluate the actual necessity of water
    by implementing fuzzy logic-based weather-dependent irrigation mechanism. A detailed
    flow model of the methodology is shown in Fig. 4. Further, the performance analysis
    of the above two prediction methodologies is listed in Table 1A (Fig. 5). Fig.

    Variable learning rate gradient descent (VLRGD) The neural network performance
    depends on learning rate; therefore, the error rate converges soon. The bigger
    learning rate may converge the error rate of the neural network training. But
    much bigger learning rate will make the neural network unstable. Similarly, much
    smaller learning rate will take long time to converge [14, 33]. To improve the
    convergence time, the VLRGD neural network assumes bigger learning rate \(\alpha\).
    Further, the new weight vector \(V_{i + 1 }\) is modified with a varying \(\alpha_{i}\).
    Again,\(g_{k}\) is the gradient of the error with respect to the weight matrix
    [14, 34,35,36]. There is momentum (μ) of gradient descent for a varying \(\alpha_{k
    }\) [33]. Normally, the updated weight vector \(V_{i + 1 }\) is defined in Eq.
    1. $$V_{i + 1} = V_{i} - \alpha_{i + 1} g_{i} + \mu V_{i - 1}$$ (1) $$\alpha_{i
    + 1} = \beta \alpha_{i}$$ $$\beta = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {0.75 \;{\text{if
    updated error}} > 1.05\, \left( {\text{for previous error}} \right)} \\ {1.05
    \;{\text{if updated error}} < 1.05\, \left( {\text{for previous error}} \right)}
    \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ 6.1 Gradient descent This optimization technique updates
    the weight matrix and bias values in the direction of the negative gradient [28].
    The updated weight matrix is based on Eq. 2. $$w_{k + 1} = w_{k} - \alpha_{k}
    g_{k}$$ (2) The updated weight matrix depends on three factors such as current
    weight matrix (wk), updated weight matrix (wk+1), learning rate (α) and gradient
    error (\(g_{k}\)) with respect to the weight matrix [28, 37, 38]. The negative
    sign of the weight matrix signifies that it is following the opposite direction.
    6.2 Bilinear interpolation on the grid data The bilinear transformation is a type
    of linear interpolation technique where the interpolation of two variables (x
    and y) on a 2D plane. This interpolation first performs in one direction and then
    again in another direction. For example, an unknown function ‘f’ at two different
    points (a, b) need to be interpolated where four discrete points are available
    which is mentioned below. D11 = (a1, b1), D12 = (a1, b2), D21 = (a2, b1), and
    D22 = (a2, b2) Firstly, the interpolation is performed in the x-direction and
    then in y-direction according to Eqs. 3 and 4. These yields. $$f\left( {a,y_{1}
    } \right) \approx \frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{11} } \right)
    + \frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{21} } \right)$$ (3) $$f\left(
    {a,y_{2} } \right) \approx \frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{12}
    } \right) + \frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{22} } \right)$$ (4)
    Further, the interpolation is performed from y-direction to estimate the interpolated
    data according to Eq. 5. $$f\left( {a,b} \right) \approx \frac{{b_{2} - b}}{{b_{2}
    - b_{1} }}f\left( {a,b_{1} } \right) + \frac{{b - b_{1} }}{{b_{2} - b_{1} }}f\left(
    {a,b_{2} } \right)$$ (5) Finally, the same result is used to interpolate the values
    in x-direction. 6.3 Structural similarity (SSIM) index The SSIM conveys the visual
    characteristics by calculating a similarity measure between two spots such as
    x and y. The SSIM is calculated by multiplying mean m(x, y), variance v(x, y),
    along with cross-correlation r(x, y) as mentioned in Eq. 6 [39]. $${\text{SSIM}}\left(
    {x, y} \right) = m\left( {x, y} \right)^{\alpha } \times v\left( {x, y} \right)^{\beta
    } \times c\left( {x, y} \right)^{\gamma }$$ (6) $$\quad \qquad= \left( {\frac{{2\mu_{x}
    \mu_{y} + C_{1} }}{{\mu_{x}^{2} + \mu_{y}^{2} + C_{1} }}} \right)^{\alpha } \times
    \left( {\frac{{2\delta_{x} \delta_{y} + C_{2} }}{{\delta_{x}^{2} + \delta_{y}^{2}
    + C_{2} }}} \right)^{\beta } \times \left( {\frac{{\delta_{x} \delta_{y} + C_{3}
    }}{{\delta_{x} \delta_{y} + C_{3} }}} \right)^{\gamma }$$ where \(\mu_{x}\) is
    mean of x, \(\mu_{y}\) is mean of y, \(\delta_{x}\) is standard deviation of x,
    \(\delta_{y}\) is standard deviation of y, \(\delta_{xy}\) is cross-correlation
    (inner product) of the mean shifted matrix x–\(\mu_{x}\) and y–\(\mu_{y}\), as
    well as the Ci for i = 1, 2, 3 are small positive constants. 6.4 Fuzzification
    and defuzzification Fuzzification is that the practice of building a sharp fuzzy
    set. This is sometimes accomplished by simply recognizing that a number of these
    amounts will be thought about to be eloquent and settled that are really not deterministic
    whatsoever. Uncertainty that is clear is carried by them. In the event the form
    of doubt occurs to appear as a consequence of ambiguity; then the factor could
    be portrayed by means of a membership function. Similarly, defuzzification is
    the transformation of a fuzzy figure into an explicit amount, as fuzzification
    is the conversion of an equal amount to some fuzzy quantity. Similarly, the output
    of a fuzzy method may be the logical union of 2 or additional fuzzy membership
    functions outlined on the universe of discourse of the output variable. The fuzzy
    logic is a rule-based model where the inputs and outputs are bounded to the rule
    sets. The outputs of the model are mathematically bounded to the input parameters.
    In this article, we have considered the real-time sensor parameters as the inputs
    to the model and valve control commands are generated according to the rule set
    defined in the fuzzy logic model. In this work, the weather information as well
    as the predicted soil MC is used to generate appropriate irrigation valve control
    commands. The fuzzification and defuzzification process is shown in Fig. 4. 6.5
    Proposed flow model for irrigation valve control The proposed flow model of the
    irrigation control scheme is depicted in Fig. 6. The irrigation control mechanism
    takes into account of all the IoT enabled WSN node data for analyzing soil MC
    distribution using bilinear interpolation. Finally, precise irrigation valve control
    is done using SSIM index of the interpolated data with the reference soil MC.
    The agriculture irrigation valve control is efficiently performed using real-time
    acquisition of IoT-enabled WSN data, neural network prediction module and fuzzy
    logic-based decision-making module. The DSS model is integrated with a GSM modem
    for SMS sending. The interfacing is done using suitable AT command sequences through
    RS232 interface with the server station. Fig. 6 Flow chart of the irrigation control
    mechanism using hybrid decision model Full size image 7 Results and discussions
    The optimization techniques utilized within the scope of this neural network-based
    prediction methodology are variable learning rate gradient descent and gradient
    descent. The parameters used to establish a relationship between wireless sensor
    data and soil MC in 1 h advance are shown in Table 1A. Further, the crop water
    need can be studied from Table 1B where the water requirement of some seasonal
    crops are listed. The performance analysis of the prediction algorithm is done
    by evaluating R-squared, MSE and RMSE. It is observed that VLRGD-based feedforward
    NN pattern classification generates minimum MSE, RMSE, and better R-squared value.
    Finally, this is used for the generation of MC distribution map of the farm land
    by taking all the IoT enabled WSN node data. Few input parameters such as sunrise
    time, UV index, and air flow rate are taken from weather forecast data, and soil
    type is taken from manual soil test of the farm land. VLRGD and NN pattern classification
    is used to predict soil MC by obtaining soil and environmental information. The
    soil MC prediction performance in addition to error graph is shown in Fig. 7.

    the performance of VLRGD-based NN pattern classification training is shown in
    Fig. 8. The accurate training performance is found after 2000 epochs. The training
    state of VLRGD-based NN pattern classification is shown in Fig. 9. It is observed
    that the best training was performed after 1999 epochs. Fig. 8 Variable learning

    is performed to analyze training performance. The soil MC prediction response
    and error graph of GD-based NN pattern classification model is shown in Fig. 10.
    The GD optimization-based NN pattern classification training performance is shown
    in Fig. 11. The accurate training is performed after 2000 epochs. Fig. 10 Actual

    neural network pattern classification technique. Furthermore, the validation check
    of GD optimization for water requirement is shown in Fig. 12. Then, the performance
    analysis is established by evaluating general statistical errors like MSE, R-squared
    value and RMSE which is shown in Table 2. The MSE and RMSE are required to analyze
    the behavior of the two prediction techniques during the estimation of required
    soil moisture content. Less is the MSE and RMSE, more better is the performance
    of the prediction algorithm. Similarly, R-squared value more closely to 1 represents
    the better estimation of the target values during the training of neural network
    algorithm. Fig. 12 Training state of the gradient descent optimization neural
    network pattern classification training Full size image Table 2 Different errors
    obtained prediction of soil MC Full size table Gradient descent (GD) has higher
    MSE and RMSE than VLRGD-based neural network soil moisture content prediction
    algorithm. Similarly, the variable learning rate gradient descent (VLRGD) produces
    less MSE and RMSE compared to GD-based neural network soil moisture content prediction
    algorithm. It is found from Table 2 that the performance of the VLRGD is far better
    than simple GD-based neural network pattern classification method. This method
    is used to calculate MC in 1 h advance of all the farm regions wherever IoT-enabled
    WSN nodes are connected. The predicted MC using VLRGD-based neural network pattern
    classification of all the regions is stored for generating soil MC distribution

    in Fig. 20. A sample valve control command matrix for single region soil MC deficiency
    is shown in Table 5. It is observed from Table 5 that the valve control commands
    are generated in a matrix format where 0 and 1 are used. The ‘0’ represents OFF
    condition of the valve, and ‘1’ represents the ON condition of the valve. Fig.

    contemplating soil MC prediction technique utilizing VLRGD-based optimization
    algorithm. A comparative analysis between VLRGD and GD is also formed by acquiring
    MSE, RMSE and R-squared value. During this test, we found that VLRGD has a much
    reduced MSE and RMSE such as 0.0468 and 0.0021, respectively. Similarly, GD-based
    NN prediction system produces much higher MSE and RMSE values such as 0.1111 and
    0.0123, respectively. The comprehensive soil MC requirement map is obtained using
    bilinear interpolation and SSIM-based approach. The irrigation valve control commands
    are generated successfully with fuzzy logic weather model to fulfil uniform farm
    irrigation requirement almost all the weather conditions. References Panchard

    Abstract: The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview
    of the recent ad-

    vancements in the use of deep learning (DL) in the agricultural sector. The author
    conducted a

    review of studies published between 2016 and 2022 to highlight the various applications
    of DL in

    agriculture, which include counting fruits, managing water, crop management, soil
    management,

    weed detection, seed classiﬁcation, yield prediction, disease detection, and harvesting.
    The author

    found that DL’s ability to learn from large datasets has great promise for the
    transformation of the

    agriculture industry, but there are challenges, such as the difﬁculty of compiling
    datasets, the cost of

    computational power, and the shortage of DL experts. The author aimed to address
    these challenges

    by presenting his survey as a resource for future research and development regarding
    the use of DL

    in agriculture.

    1. Introduction

    In the contemporary era of globalization, the role and contributions of agriculture
    are

    crucially important. Over the years, agriculture has suffered from different challenges
    in

    fulﬁlling the ever-increasing needs of the world population, which has increased
    by twofold

    in the past ﬁve decades. There are different predictions for this unprecedented
    growth

    in the population, which is likely to reach approximately 9 billion people in
    the world

    by 2050 [1]. In addition, the estimates show an increase in the number of people
    living

    within urban areas, along with a signiﬁcant drop in the percentage of the population
    who

    are retired or working [1,2]. This means that agricultural productivity around
    the world

    must be increased considerably, and there is a need for a human labor force. To
    address

    this sort of problem, technologies such as tractors were introduced into agriculture
    over a

    century ago. At present, mechanical technology is showing an incredible evolution,
    and

    a signiﬁcant number of technologies are available. Existing technologies, such
    as remote

    sensing [3], robotic platforms [4], and the Internet of Things (IoT) [2], have
    recently become

    widespread in industry, particularly in the agricultural sector, leading to the
    phenomenon

    of smart and efﬁcient farming [5,6]. Schmidhuber (2015) states that deep learning
    (DL) is a

    modern approach that is successfully being utilized as part of various machine-learning

    techniques [7]. It is comparable to artiﬁcial neutral networks (ANNs) but with
    enhanced

    learning capabilities; therefore, it has higher accuracy [8]. In recent years,
    DL technologies,

    such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), recurrent neutral networks (RNNs),
    and

    convolutional neutral networks (CNNs), have been widely implemented and investigated

    in different ﬁelds of research, including farming and agriculture. Agriculturalists
    and

    researchers often use different software systems without assessing the mechanisms
    and

    ideas of the techniques, such as GANs, RNNs, and CNNs, that are usually applied
    in DL

    algorithms. There are various sub-categories of DL algorithms, including deep
    convo-

    lutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), very deep convolutional networks

    (VGGNets), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks; therefore, understanding
    these

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    2 of 22

    sub-categories of DL algorithms is important for understanding common DL algorithms
    [9].

    According to Kamilaris and Prenafeta [10], DL is a modern and recent technique
    and

    system for data analysis and image processing with signiﬁcant potential and promising

    results [10]. DL has been successfully used in different domains and has recently
    entered

    the agriculture ﬁeld. Additionally, it has the potential to address complex problems
    more

    efﬁciently and quickly due to the use of complex models that enable massive parallelization.

    These multifaceted models used in DL are likely to increase classiﬁcation accuracy
    and

    limit faults in regression problems, but only if there are sufﬁciently large databases
    that can

    be used to explain such problems.

    The authors of [11] argued that DL using drone technology is signiﬁcant for agriculture

    and farming as it provides a convenient way to monitor, assess, and scan crops
    through the

    use of high-quality and high-resolution images [11]. Such technology aids in recognizing

    advancements in ﬁelds and assessing quality. For example, with the help of images

    provided by drone technology, agriculturalists and farmers can determine whether
    crops

    are fully ready for harvesting. DL, along with machine-learning (ML) techniques,
    can help

    farmers understand the nature of the soil, thus aiding them in making timely decisions

    regarding farming. DL is also applied to assess how nutrients and water are to
    be managed

    and to make decisions about the suitable time for cropping and harvesting. Yields
    are

    higher and more efﬁcient and the return on investment (ROI) for crops can be projected,

    considering the margin and cost in the market [12]. In addition, the efﬁciency
    of DL is

    recognized because it has been observed to outclass conventional methods, such
    as support

    vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF) algorithms, and ANNs. Several technologies

    are being used together with DL to enhance performance in prediction and classiﬁcation

    related to agricultural problems. The RNN and LSTM models have memory and time

    dimensions. As a result, they can be used to project animal and plant growth based
    on

    recorded data, evaluate water needs, and determine crop yield using the mining
    time

    dimensions and memory function [13,14]. They can also be utilized to estimate
    plant

    and animal growth based on previously recorded data to evaluate fruit yields or
    water

    requirements. Ren et al. [15], for example, used both models to forecast various
    phenomena

    and climate changes. Using hyperspectral images and infrared thermal imaging to
    provide

    data and information is the right direction for the prompt detection of diseases
    in crops.

    With the subsequent exponential growth in this ﬁeld, it is necessary to provide
    an up-to-date

    review of the recent literature focusing on innovative research techniques implementing

    DL for agriculture. Hence, this study focused on providing an overview of the
    recent

    advancements linked to DL in the agricultural sector. The study aimed to describe
    the

    use of DL in agriculture; in particular, with respect to counting fruits, managing
    water,

    crop management, soil management, weed detection, seed classiﬁcation, yield prediction,

    disease detection, and harvesting. The adoption of technology in the agriculture
    sector

    during the recent period has signiﬁcantly transformed and assisted farming and
    crop

    cultivation. However, DL has been noted to have added efﬁciency to agriculture,
    which

    has motivated researchers to investigate how it can be helpful in farming and
    harvesting

    and in yield predictions.

    This paper is categorized in the following way: Section 2 presents the research
    method-

    ology. Section 3 provides a literature review by highlighting a brief history
    of the topic.

    Section 4 highlights the importance of DL in the agriculture sector. Section 5
    discusses DL

    tools that can be used for model development. In addition, the same section describes
    the

    usage, purpose, signiﬁcance, and implementation of DL in the agriculture sector.
    Section 6

    provides the results and a discussion, drawing on previous studies that have discussed

    deep learning. Section 7 presents the overall conclusion of the study, together
    with some

    ideas for future research directions.

    3. Literature Review

    3.1. Deep Learning

    Agriculture faces many challenges due to the increase in demand and the presence

    of fewer workers in the ﬁelds. In this context, smart farming can be used to address

    issues such as food security, sustainability, productivity, and environmental
    impact [16].

    As is known, agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy [17]. This is
    because

    it ensures food security for countries, and most companies rely on it for their
    external

    trade. In the world today, most home appliances, travel means, and other commonly

    used services are becoming automated through the adoption of artiﬁcial intelligence
    (AI);

    thus, farming practices should too, since they are the backbone of a country.
    Achieving

    understanding and making quick responses with the help of data provided by continuous

    monitoring, measuring, and analysis of different physical aspects and phenomena
    would be

    helpful to overcome the complex, multivariate, and unpredictable challenges of
    agricultural

    ecosystems [18]. This would require the analysis of huge amounts of agricultural
    data

    and the use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) and would
    be

    necessary for both small-scale farms and large-scale ecosystem monitoring [19].
    It could

    be achieved using DL with a large network. DL is basically an aspect of machine
    learning

    that aims to build neural networks that can analytically learn by simulating the
    human

    brain. It acts like the human brain in that it works by reading data, such as
    pictures, videos,

    text, and sounds. With its continued development, DL has already been implemented
    in

    various complex tasks, such as image segmentation, image recognition, natural
    language

    processing, object detection, and image classiﬁcation [18]. However, DL requires
    a huge

    dataset since the quality of the DL results entirely depends on the size of the
    dataset, and

    the model tends to learn from that data and then respond accordingly. Some computer
    and

    industrial advancements, such as image processing, IoT technologies, robotics,
    machine

    learning, deep learning, and computer vision, are very useful in the agricultural
    industry

    and even for local farmers. High-quality image processing makes AI based on drone

    technology a very helpful asset for farmers, since they can identify the progress
    of the crops

    and determine whether they are ready to harvest or not while sitting in one place
    rather

    than having to move long distances. This has been achieved just AI and a drone
    system;

    one can only imagine how beneﬁcial it would be to implement DL in agriculture
    [18].

    Figure 2 lists numerous advantages of using DL in agriculture. With the current

    increase in the population, there has also been an increase in the demand for
    agricultural

    goods [18]. The implementation of DL and other automation components could greatly

    beneﬁt production outcomes, reduce the chances of ripening, reduce production
    costs,

    and increase income due to the increased production. Moreover, it would also make

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    4 of 22

    it possible to forecast climatic changes—for instance, if there is an incoming
    rainstorm,

    cyclone, etc.—so that the farmers could be ready and prepare before a disaster.

    Figure 2. Deep learning applications in agriculture [18].

    3.2. Agriculture before Deep Learning

    Traditional agriculture was the main method of farming before the adoption of
    sci-

    entiﬁc advancements in agricultural industries. Traditional agriculture mainly
    involves

    the extensive use of traditional tools and organic fertilizers, indigenous knowledge
    of land

    use and natural resources, cultural beliefs, etc. [19]. Another way to describe
    it could be

    as the “primitive style” or “early style” of farming and food production. The
    traditional

    method of farming affects the environment in many ways, such as through the depletion
    of

    soil nutrients. For instance, slash and burn practices in traditional agriculture
    were one

    reason for decreased soil organic matter. Another problem caused by traditional
    farming

    was deforestation, as most deforestation has taken place in tropical rainforests
    to make

    space for other agricultural activities. Another signiﬁcant issue relating to
    soil erosion is

    the removal of topsoil by water or wind. This topsoil is the most fertile, and
    it may take

    decades to replenish it once it is removed [19].

    Agroforestry, crop rotation, intercropping, polycultures, and water harvesting
    are

    some of the most common types of traditional farming practices. The traditional
    farming

    method of constructing grain storage structures provided an incredible moisture-proof

    environment for grain storage. Compared to today’s colossal warehouses, these
    small

    structures were cheap to fabricate and maintain. However, many different pesticides
    were

    used to keep the grains safe during storage periods, which later resulted in very
    bad effects

    on the environment [20]. The implementation of technology and the investment of
    huge

    sums of money in agricultural industries have helped to control other diseases,
    thereby

    making the amount of money spent worthwhile.

    3.3. Deep Learning Architecture

    Several nonlinear transformations are used to model higher-level abstractions
    in

    data, and these are the foundations of DL [21]. One of the main beneﬁts of DL
    is the

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    5 of 22

    automatic extraction of features from raw data or feature learning. Producing
    features

    from lower-level components yields features in higher-level components [22]. Recurrent

    neural networks (RNNs) and CNNs are two types of DL networks that are often used

    in agriculture.

    3.3.1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

    The CNN is a type of DL algorithm [23] composed of multiple convolutional layers,

    pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Two of the most common applications
    for CNNs

    are the recognition of handwritten characters and image processing. In the domain
    of

    computer vision, CNNs have been used for a variety of tasks, including object
    detection,

    image classiﬁcation, voice recognition, image fragmentation, medical image analysis,
    and

    text and video processing. Convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
    are the

    typical architectural components of a CNN [24]. Figure 3 depicts the architecture
    of a CNN,

    and brief descriptions of each layer are provided below.

    Figure 3. Convolutional neural network architecture.

    In a CNN, the convolutional layer is the most fundamental and signiﬁcant. It stores
    all

    of the images’ distinguishing characteristics while making it possible to limit
    the amount of

    data that must be simultaneously processed. Then, pooling enables a CNN to aggregate
    all

    the different dimensions of an image and recognize the object, even if its form
    is distorted or

    it is positioned at an angle. Thus, the number of learnable features in the model
    is reduced,

    helping to address the overﬁtting issue. Pooling can be accomplished in a variety
    of ways,

    including average pooling, maximum pooling, and stochastic pooling. The fully
    connected

    layer is the ﬁnal layer, which is used to feed the neural network [24].

    3.3.2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

    An RNN is a type of neural network model capable of performing exceptionally

    well in fundamental tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and
    speech

    recognition [25]. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs use the network’s sequential

    information. This feature is essential in many applications because the data sequence’s

    inherent structure contains valuable information that can be extracted from it.
    Figure 4

    depicts the fundamental structure of a recurrent neural network [25].

    4. Signiﬁcance of Deep Learning in Agriculture

    4.1. Counting of Fruit

    Counting fruit is an essential task for growers because it makes it possible to
    estimate

    the yield, which can be helpful in the management of yards. According to [26],
    counting

    fruit using automated fruit detection and algorithms can optimize agriculture
    production

    and help in managing the harvest process effectively. For automated fruit counting
    and

    detection, the authors provided a method that uses a pipeline for the DL algorithms

    consisting of part 0, part 1, part 2, and part 3. In part 0, the algorithms learn
    ground

    truths. They use the Bob detection neural network in part 1 and count the fruit
    through the

    neural network in part 2. In part 3, the linear regression is run for the ﬁnal
    count [26]. The

    authors of [27] proposed automatic yield estimation using robotic agricultural
    techniques

    to improve the manual counting of fruit. The authors used Inception-ResNet to
    achieve a

    high accuracy ratio with a lower computational cost as a deep simulated learning
    technique.

    The signiﬁcance of the technique proposed in [27] is that it does not require
    thousands of

    images to train the neural networks. Instead, the network can be trained with
    synthetic

    images to test the authenticity of images, achieving an accuracy rate of 91%.
    This novel

    DL method can facilitate farmers’ abilities to efﬁciently count fruit and make
    decisions

    with great precision [27]. Similarly, the authors of [28] trained a Fast R-CNN
    DL model

    to detect, count, and predict the right size for citrus fruit. The authors also
    used the long

    short-term memory detection method to calculate the number of fruit on each tree,
    as

    shown in Figure 5. Hence, DL methods, such as automated yield detection, DL simulation,

    and Fast R-CNN, can be helpful in the counting of fruit. Table 1 presents the
    most recent

    methods for counting fruits.

    4.2. Management of Water

    Water is an essential natural resource for agriculture that needs recycling for
    the

    continued and sustainable development of agriculture. The authors of [39] stated
    that

    water is essential for agriculture production but the chemicals from industries
    and the

    wastewater from daily usage increase water pollution. Therefore, the agriculture
    ﬁeld

    needs a DL technique to protect agriculture from water pollution. The authors
    of [39]

    proposed a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy method that can be used to assess
    water

    demand, protection, and recycling. The NIR system is used as one layer along with
    an

    improved convolutional neural network (CNN) layer that employs decision tree analysis

    to depict informative data helpful for making decisions relevant to water management.

    The authors of [40] posited that agriculture is the backbone of the economy in
    India and

    requires water as a signiﬁcant resource. Traditional irrigation methods waste
    water due to

    excessive water use and unplanned water management. Therefore, the authors provided

    an integrative approach that uses DL methods to improve the irrigation system
    in India’s

    agriculture (see Figure 6). The system consists of sensors that detect the soil’s
    humidity

    and predict the irrigation needs of the soil. The authors of [41] stated that
    water is a critical

    resource for which evapotranspiration assessment is very beneﬁcial. Evapotranspiration

    assessment uses DL techniques to predict upcoming water needs and to provide clues
    that

    can be helpful for real-time irrigation management. Thus, DL techniques can help
    farmers

    precisely manage their irrigation systems.

    Figure 6. Deep learning approach for water management [40].

    4.3. Crop Management

    The signiﬁcance of DL frameworks is increasing in crop management, a subﬁeld of

    agriculture. The authors of [42] asserted that DL technology is beneﬁcial for
    crop planting.

    Crop planting is the ﬁrst step in crop production and needs to be managed efﬁciently
    to

    increase crop production. The authors discussed the various DL crop planting techniques,

    including ViSeed, which has been used for soybean production; Fast R-CNN, which
    has

    been used to count and measure the stalks of sorghum plants; CNN, which has been
    used

    for the identiﬁcation of localized features of roots and shoots; and VGG-16, which
    has

    been used for categorization of crops and weeds. According to the authors of [43],
    there

    are different types of deep learning networks that can be used for crop prediction.
    These

    different types include ANNs, for which the regression method and crop species
    and images

    and climatic and soil properties can be used to predict wheat, barley, sugarcane,
    sunﬂower,

    and potato crop production. Other DL techniques discussed in [43] include two-layered

    DNN LSTM, which has been used to predict tomato, soybean, and corn crop production

    using the regression method, a vegetative index, environmental characteristics,
    and soil.

    In addition, the authors of [44] stated that intelligence plays a crucial role
    in precisely

    managing crops. The authors introduced the CropDeep approach, which classiﬁes
    and

    detects different classes of crops. CropDeep provides crop management services
    through

    cameras and models; it classiﬁes crops and provides analysis that is helpful for
    decision

    making and includes real-world challenges; e.g., weather uncertainty (see Figure
    7). Table 2

    presents the most recent methods for crop management.

    4.4. Soil Management

    Soil management refers to the practices, operations, and treatments that protect
    soil

    and increase an agricultural ﬁeld’s production. The authors of [50] stated that
    DL techniques

    can help manage soil moisture. According to the authors, developing a mathematical
    model

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    9 of 22

    is difﬁcult for soil moisture, so the accuracy, predictions, and generalization
    of existing

    models could be improved. The authors improved the DL regression model by ﬁtting
    it

    with large datasets, making it possible to precisely determine soil moisture.

    The authors of [51] proposed that agriculture has been an essential aspect of
    the lives of

    human beings since even before civilization. Soil yield plays a key role in crop
    production

    and efﬁcient agriculture. Therefore, the authors discussed how implementing the
    Keras

    API in Python can help protect soil from herbicide toxicity while also retaining
    moisture.

    Moreover, using a ﬁrst-order agriculture simulator that employs discrete time,
    the Richard

    equation can help determine the precise moisture level in soil [52]. The authors
    explained

    that using an agriculture simulator can help in obtaining aerial images with a
    particular soil

    moisture information dataset. The dataset was analyzed using seven methods, including

    constant prediction baseline, SVM, and NN, which showed that using a CNN could
    reduce

    water consumption by 52% [52]. Thus, the authors showed that DL techniques can
    help

    maintain soil moisture.

    4.5. Weed Detection

    Weeds are undesirable plants that can reduce crop production. DL techniques can

    help detect weeds. According to [51], a “weed” is a plant that grows in an unfavorable

    environment. They have negative effects on crop production because they compete
    with

    plants for water, sunlight, and soil minerals. Weed detection can be undertaken
    by using

    DL techniques, such as ﬁrst-order agriculture simulation with Richard’s equation.
    This

    approach reduces the use of weedicides, thus protecting the soil from toxicity
    and ensuring

    the plants achieve suitable production yields. In addition, the authors of [53]
    raised the

    concern that the production and utilization of herbicides have made weeds resistant
    to

    these herbicides. Therefore, developing precision techniques to detect weeds is
    important

    to increase crop production. Researchers have discussed the revolution in computing

    technology and how it can help in better understanding weed biology and ecology.
    DL is

    the most helpful technique, as it aids in categorizing weeds in crop categories
    and getting

    rid of them. In a similar context, the authors of [54] found that DL techniques,
    such as

    classiﬁcation SVMs and CNNs, can reduce the burden on farmers. The techniques
    can help

    farmers detect weeds. The authors described various weed detection and categorization

    techniques. In such techniques, the camera ﬁrst takes images of weeds and then
    uses a gray-

    level occurrence matrix to identify homogeneity among the images. The color identiﬁed

    through the hue saturation value (HSV) describes the mellowness of the weeds,
    as shown

    in Figure 8. Hence, DL techniques are helpful for weed detection, reducing the
    burden on

    farmers and increasing crop yield.

    4.6. Seed Classiﬁcation

    In the agriculture sector, crop production strongly relies on seeds. According
    to [55],

    seeds are a signiﬁcant part of crop production, without which production and harvesting

    of crops are impossible. The increased level of population growth has put pressure
    on

    agriculture growth due to the precision needed when identifying and classifying
    seeds.

    The authors proposed a CNN to increase the efﬁciency of the classiﬁcation of seeds.
    In this

    technique, the methods used included decayed learning points.

    4.7. Classiﬁcation of Plant Diseases

    Plants can produce decreased crop yields due to the presence of fungi, microbes,
    and

    bacteria. If the disease is not diagnosed in time, it can cause signiﬁcant economic
    losses

    for farmers. The pathogen-killing pesticides that are used to restore crop functionality

    and remove pests come at a high cost. Excessive use of pesticides is detrimental
    to the

    environment and can disrupt the water and soil cycles [56]. As plant diseases
    stunt growth,

    identifying them in their early stages is essential. DL models have been applied
    in the

    process of recognizing and categorizing various plant diseases. Several DL architectures

    have been proposed to improve detection accuracy [57]. In [58], the authors proposed
    a

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    10 of 22

    method for identifying and categorizing banana diseases based on a CNN. The proposed

    model processes pictures of leaves to help farmers detect two banana diseases
    (sigatoka

    and speckle) quickly. In addition, the authors of [59] used AlexNet to accurately
    classify

    plant diseases based on leaf images. The DL hybrid model described in [60] identiﬁed

    and categorized diseases that affect sunﬂowers, such as Verticillium wilt, Phoma
    rot,

    downy mildew, and Alternaria leaf rot. The authors of [61] developed a mobile
    app that

    utilizes machine learning to diagnose diseases that affect plant leaves. The app
    can classify

    38 different diseases. The authors amassed 96,206 images, including both healthy
    and

    diseased plant leaf specimens, for training, testing, and validation of the model.
    In [62], the

    authors proposed a pre-trained, transfer-learning deep neural network model that
    could

    predict crop disease by learning leaf characteristics from input data. They extensively

    investigated different DL and CNN topologies, such as ResNet, MobileNet, Wide
    ResNet,

    and DenseNet. The result showed that the proposed method was superior in terms
    of

    accuracy and memory to previous methods in the literature. Another CNN-based method

    for detecting, classifying, and identifying plant diseases was proposed in [63].
    The accuracy

    for the identiﬁcation of 13 different plant diseases ranged from 91 to 98%. Furthermore,
    the

    proposed model was able to distinguish between unhealthy and healthy leaves, as
    well as

    their backgrounds. Using 500 different leaf images, the authors of [64] proposed
    a model

    based on an SVM classiﬁer. The proposed model could accurately identify plant
    diseases,

    achieving an accuracy of 94%. Table 3 presents the most recent methods for classifying

    plant diseases.

    4.8. Yield Prediction

    It is essential to focus on and carefully manage yield predictions for each crop.
    Agri-

    cultural machine-learning and DL algorithms are primarily concerned with crop
    yield

    prediction. They inform the farmer about whether the crop is ready for cultivation
    and

    predict when it will be [73]. Manjula et al. [74] proposed a model based on an
    RF classiﬁer

    that could predict millet crop yield with an accuracy of 99.74%. The prediction
    of crop

    yield is notoriously difﬁcult due to the presence of numerous complex factors.
    For example,

    high-dimensional marker data are required to represent genotype information, consisting

    of the data for millions of markers for each individual plant. The ﬁnal effect
    of the genetic

    markers must be estimated because it is affected by numerous environmental conditions

    and ﬁeld management techniques. Recently, a variety of machine-learning models,
    includ-

    ing association rule mining, ANNs, decision trees, and multivariate regression,
    have been

    applied in the ﬁeld of crop yield prediction. The most notable characteristic
    of ML and DL

    may be that the output is treated as an implicit function of the input variables
    and may be

    a highly nonlinear and complex function [75].

    Extensive research has been conducted on crop yield prediction. Liu et al. [76]
    em-

    ployed a neural network with one hidden layer for the prediction of corn yield
    using input

    data on weather, soil, and management. In the same context, Drummond et al. [76]
    worked

    on predicting crop yield by using neural networks, projection pursuit regression,
    and

    stepwise multiple linear regression. As a result, they found that both regression
    methods

    were outperformed by the neural network method. In addition, Marko et al. [76]
    predicted

    the crop yields of different soybean varieties by using weighted histogram regression.
    They

    obtained better performance than the conventional regression algorithms.

    4.9. Disease Detection

    In the agricultural ﬁeld, one major threat to farmers is crop disease. With the
    devel-

    opments in the ﬁelds of AI and DL and their implementation in agricultural industries,

    crop disease detection has become one of the easiest processes. Before the adoption
    of

    advanced technology in agriculture, the detection of diseases in crops at an early
    stage was

    a time-consuming and tedious task that had to be performed manually [77]. Plant
    disease

    not only affects plant growth and the population but also seriously affects the
    economy

    of countries. Hence, it is essential to adopt automatic and accurate techniques
    for the

    prediction and detection of plant disease severity for disease management and
    food safety

    and to predict losses in returns. In most developing countries, farmers are usually
    required

    to travel huge distances to contact experts, which can consume huge amounts of
    money

    and time [76]. This could be handled by developing a robust and easy-to-use plant
    or crop

    disease detection system, which would require many sample images of crops that
    have

    diseases that could be uploaded to the cloud, and the system could run on IoT
    devices, such

    as smartphones and tablet PCs with appropriate computational capabilities. Some
    work

    has been done in order to tackle this issue of crop diseases. Nikhil Patil et
    al. [78] proposed

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    12 of 22

    a crop disease detection system using a CNN. The system achieved an accuracy rate
    of 89%

    compared to the traditional crop disease detection system. Hence, when it comes
    to image

    processing, CNN systems can be relied upon due to the fact that they are widely
    used in

    agricultural research. Most DL applications in agriculture can be categorized
    as plant or

    crop classiﬁcation, which is important for disaster monitoring, robotic harvesting,
    pest

    control, and yield prediction. Plant and crop disease recognition models are mostly
    based

    on pattern recognition and leaf images [78]. Hence, DL and AI models could automatically

    determine which plants are diseased and send alerts to the farmer for early action.
    Figure 9

    shows an example of how DL and AI can detect plant diseases.

    Figure 9. Plant disease detection [79].

    5. Application of Deep-Learning Models in Agriculture

    According to [80], there are different points of view about the creation of DL
    tools

    for model development. Python tools are used to emphasize the concept of saliency
    in

    images. Saliency is typically deﬁned by unique features, including pixels, or
    the resolution

    of the image in visual processing. Another DL tool is the gradient explanation
    technique,

    which employs the gradient-based attribution method. In this method, each gradient

    quantiﬁes each of the input dimensions that can change the predictions around
    the input.

    The integrated gradient is a gradient-based attribution that allows predictions
    to be formed

    by a deep neural network. It is created via attributions related to the network’s
    input

    features [81]. Deep label-speciﬁc feature (DeepLIFT) is another tool designed
    to ensure

    the accuracy of deep neural network predictions. It is also known as the gradient
    + input

    method, and it is used to enhance the gradient with the input signal. It has quite
    a few

    advantages over gradient-based methods, especially when it is implemented into
    models

    that are usually trained with natural images and genomics data [82]. Typically,
    activation

    of each neuron takes place with reference to the contribution scores calculated
    by the

    system. These calculations are based on comparisons between various outputs and
    a

    certain benchmarked output and the differences in the inputs from their reference
    inputs.

    Another model is guided backpropagation, also known as guided saliency, which
    is a

    type of deconvolution approach. This tool and approach is often employed in a
    range of

    network structures, such as in max pooling in CNNs [83]. The purpose is to substitute
    the

    max-pooling layers with a convolutional layer. Similarly, the authors of [84]
    claim that

    deconvolution is a technique for visualizing CNNs that uses quite similar aspects,
    such as

    deconvolutional networks. Furthermore, the authors of [85] proposed class activation
    maps

    (CAMs) for the identiﬁcation of images. With this tool, analysts may inspect a
    particular

    image and then its speciﬁc parts or pixels are used to form the ﬁnal output. In
    other

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    13 of 22

    words, CAMs are used to study the discriminative regions of an image, as with
    a CNN. A

    ﬁnal softmax-loss layer is formed after obtaining the weighted sum of the vector.
    Finally,

    layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is a tool for decomposing nonlinear classiﬁers
    that

    aims to improve DL interpretability [86]. It is based on deep neural networks
    formed by

    propagating predictions backward, fulﬁlling the requirement for the conservation
    property.

    All the abovementioned DL tools are currently available for model development.

    According to [87], the deep neural network (DNN) can be employed using a CNN for

    the assessment of the quality of seeds in agriculture. The model can be used to
    study the

    quality of seeds in soybean pods, along with the sorting of haploid seeds. Assessments

    of the shape, phenotypic expression, and embryonic pose are undertaken [88]. CNNs

    have also been used in the classiﬁcation plant seedlings into 12 species. Furthermore,
    the

    authors of [89] used an image analysis technique to create a principal component
    analysis

    (PCA) that can be used to place seeds in different clusters in a cost- and time-effective

    manner. The authors of [90] claimed that DL algorithms, such as Inspection-v3,
    VGG-16,

    and VGG-19, are more efﬁcient in citrus plant disease detection than other innovations.

    In [91], the authors claimed that DL methods aid in the identiﬁcation of plant
    diseases

    from individual lesions and spots. This makes it possible to focus on other aspects
    rather

    than only considering the entire leaf in disease detection. This DL application
    is good

    at detecting multiple diseases on the same leaf and provides 12% greater accuracy.
    DL

    methods can also be used to identify various plant diseases [92]. The authors
    of [93]

    claimed that apple leaf and fruit diseases can be detected using a CNN model,
    implying

    that the use of DL models for disease detection is quite effective. There are
    also harvesting

    techniques that use DL. The authors of [94] formed a shot-detector (YOLO) algorithm
    for

    on-tree fruit detection and used the BBox-Label-Tool to label images. Likewise,
    two deep

    learning models were utilized for images of pears and apples fruits, and it was
    found that

    the deep learning models were quite effective for harvesting purposes. The authors
    of [95]

    revealed that having a robust DL model can be helpful in the harvesting process,
    as it

    showed promising results due to its employment of bio-inspired features. As shown
    by

    these studies, DL is becoming one of the most useful techniques and models in
    harvesting

    since it employs mature features in comparison to other agricultural techniques.
    This recent

    survey also shows that CNNs have promising results in agriculture and increase
    efﬁciency.

    In other words, CNNs have increased accuracy and improved learning capacities
    when DL

    mechanisms are employed in agriculture.

    6. Results and Discussions

    The ﬁndings from the studies show that DL mechanisms have helped farmers in

    different areas of agricultural production. These include counting fruit, management

    of water, crop management, soil management, weed detection, seed classiﬁcation,
    yield

    prediction, disease detection, and even harvesting. A summary of the key ﬁndings
    is

    presented in Table 4.

    The key ﬁndings from the literature review show that there are various ways in
    which

    DL has beneﬁted the agriculture industry. Agriculture faces numerous barriers
    as a result of

    increased demand and fewer workers in the sector. However, the implementation
    of smart

    farming can help address issues such as productivity, environmental impact, food
    security,

    and sustainability and increase the efﬁciency of agricultural production [16].
    Agriculture,

    as is well-known, plays an important part in the global economy [17] as it ensures
    food

    security for regions and is used by the majority of businesses for external commerce.
    The

    implementation of deep-learning methods has helped the agricultural sector grow
    and

    develop, employing the latest prediction analyses and tools. There are various
    tools that

    have been used by scholars to prove the efﬁciency of deep-learning methods in
    agriculture.

    According to [18], the size of the dataset used for deep-learning methods may
    determine

    the quality of the results. The accuracy of the results obtained using deep learning
    in

    agricultural production and processes may lead to improved decisions. Traditional
    farming

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    15 of 22

    practices result in a wide range of environmental consequences, including soil
    nutrient

    depletion. Deforestation is another issue produced by traditional farming, as
    most defor-

    estation has occurred in tropical rainforests to make room for other agricultural
    activities.

    Soil erosion, which occurs as a result of the erosion of topsoil by water or wind,
    is another

    issue associated with traditional farming. This topsoil is the most productive
    portion of the

    soil and, once removed, it can take decades to restore it [19]. This implies that
    traditional

    agricultural production methods are insufﬁcient to promote the efﬁciency of the
    sector.

    Agriculture must become more brilliant and progressive in order to meet future
    demands

    and utilize emerging technologies, such as deep learning, remote sensors, and
    distributed

    computing [98]. The current study’s key ﬁndings highlight that the use of various
    DL tools

    in agriculture has improved farming outcomes and production. According to [95],
    the

    real parameters for agriculture are now obtained through cutting-edge technology
    and DL

    mechanisms. DL methods have proven their ability to increase efﬁciency in agriculture,

    showing improved results and accuracy in all domains. Despite the employment of
    DL

    mechanisms in agriculture, it was identiﬁed that there are also certain challenges
    that

    accompany the use of this technology, such as dataset creation, the time required
    to train

    staff, and having skilled labor to increase production. Furthermore, system development

    and hardware maintenance, as well as the deployment of large models and software
    on

    small devices, such as mobile phones, may have an impact on system efﬁciency [99].
    More-

    over, developing awareness among staff members when DL methods are employed is

    also challenging in agriculture. According to [100], transfer learning is a technique
    that

    can be employed to minimize the emerging challenges that may arise when employing

    deep learning in agriculture. It is typically used to address problems when there
    is a

    small dataset and minimal time is required to test the accuracy of the model.
    As shown

    in [101,102], AI is useful to minimize the challenges affecting agricultural production
    when

    DL and robotics are used. In the same context, automated machine learning (AutoML)
    is

    another technique that helps increase agriculture production through innovation.
    When

    DL methods are employed in agricultural production mechanisms, AutoML can be use-

    ful to minimize the challenges. Thus, the literature shows that DL methods have
    been

    extremely useful in increasing production in the agricultural sector. However,
    in order

    to minimize the challenges that come with employing DL techniques, it is important
    to

    consider employing other emerging technologies, such as robotics, the Internet
    of Things,

    and distributed computing.

    It was found that most DL-based farming techniques use very simple algorithms
    and

    network structures. The primary cause of this is that the combination of deep
    learning and

    precision agriculture is still in its infancy. The lack of collaboration between
    the computer-

    science and agriculture communities is also a contributing factor. Table 1 shows
    that many

    of the deep-learning algorithms tested had an accuracy of 90% or more with some
    datasets,

    but it should be noted that these results are not generalizable. The accuracy
    and speed

    of these networks typically fall short of the benchmarks when they are employed
    with

    other datasets or a real farmland environment. This is mainly due to the fact
    that the

    complexity, quality, and quantities of agricultural datasets are still very different
    from

    actual farmland environments. Many novel approaches have been proposed to lessen

    the reliance of DL models on agricultural datasets, including transfer learning
    [103,104],

    few-shot learning [105,106], graph convolutional networks [107], and semi-supervised

    learning [108]. However, their entire performances are still unavailable. Only
    a few

    recent studies have focused on tailoring deep-learning algorithms and neural network

    architectures to the needs of agricultural applications. Some studies, for instance,
    have

    aimed to ﬁnd the most effective ways to optimize the parameters used in DL models.

    Enhancing DL algorithms and frameworks has been the focus of other research. With
    the

    aim of large-scale dense semantic segmentation of weeds using aerial images, the
    authors

    of [109,110] presented WeedMap and WeedNet. They made changes to the decoder that

    allowed them to use a modiﬁed version of the VGG16 architecture in place of the
    original

    encoder. Jiao et al. [111] created an anchor-free convolutional neural network
    (AF-RCNN)

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    16 of 22

    to achieve a balance between speed and accuracy in deep-learning algorithms applied

    to the detection of multiclass agricultural pests. To improve recognition accuracy
    in leaf

    disease detection, the authors of [112] utilized convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) and

    pre-trained models to identify plant diseases. The study focused on ﬁne-tuning
    popular

    pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4,
    using

    the PlantVillage dataset, which contains 54,305 images of plant diseases in 38
    classes. The

    performance of the models was evaluated through various metrics. The results showed
    that

    DenseNet-121 achieved the highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.81%, outperforming
    other

    state-of-the-art models. In the same context, the authors of [113] proposed a
    new method for

    data augmentation utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) for tomato
    leaf disease

    recognition. By utilizing deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs)
    to

    augment the original images and GoogLeNet as the input, the proposed model was
    able to

    achieve the top average identiﬁcation accuracy of 94.33%. The model was further
    improved

    by adjusting the hyper-parameters, modifying the architecture of the convolutional
    neural

    networks, and experimenting with different GANs. The use of DCGAN to augment

    the dataset not only increased its size but also improved its diversity, leading
    to better

    generalization of the recognition model. In addition, the authors of [114] proposed
    the use

    of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to augment an original

    dataset and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the task of regression
    by

    utilizing the DCGAN to generate synthetic images that were realistic enough to
    be included

    in the training set. They employed a two-stage scheme where the baseline CNN,
    trained

    with the original dataset, was utilized to predict the regression vectors for
    each image

    generated by the DCGAN. These regression vectors served as the ground truth for
    the

    augmented dataset, enabling the CNN to make more accurate predictions.

    7. Future Challenges and Opportunities in the Agricultural Domain

    Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize the agricultural industry by
    enabling

    more efﬁcient crop production, precision agriculture, and improved crop monitoring
    and

    forecasting. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to
    fully

    realize the potential of deep learning in agriculture. One major challenge is
    the lack of

    high-quality labeled data in the ﬁeld of agriculture. This can be addressed by
    developing

    new data collection methods and creating large labeled datasets that can be used
    to train

    deep-learning models [114]. Another challenge is the high computational cost associated

    with deep learning, which can make it difﬁcult to implement these models in resource-

    constrained environments, such as rural areas [115].

    Additionally, there is a need for deep-learning models in agriculture to attain
    robust-

    ness and adaptability to different environments, crop types, imaging conditions,
    and sensor

    modalities. This requires the development of models that can be generalized well
    across

    different scenarios and are robust to variations in the data [116,117]. Furthermore,
    as the

    data in the agricultural domain is often incomplete, noisy, or corrupted, there
    is a need for

    methods that can handle missing or incomplete data [118]. In recent years, research
    on

    robust deep-learning techniques, such as robust optimization, adversarial training
    [118],

    and meta-learning [119,120], has been undertaken to address this challenge, but
    more

    research is still needed in this area.

    Another important challenge is the need for deep-learning models in agriculture

    to be interpretable and explainable, as this is essential for decision making
    and to gain

    trust from stakeholders. There is a growing interest in developing methods that
    can

    provide insight into the inner workings of deep-learning models, such as explainable
    AI

    techniques—for instance, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)
    [121]

    and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) [122]—and interpretable deep learning—for

    instance, decision trees and rule-based systems [123]. Moreover, the integration
    of multiple

    modalities of data, such as image, sensor, and weather data, is crucial to improving
    the

    performance of deep-learning models in agriculture. There is a need for multistream
    neural

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    17 of 22

    networks, such as those based on attention [124], that can handle multiple modalities
    of

    data and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the agricultural system.

    Few-shot learning is a form of machine learning that allows models to be generalized
    to

    previously unseen classes with a small number of examples. This is beneﬁcial in
    agriculture,

    as it allows such models to learn more quickly and accurately from a limited amount
    of

    data. Furthermore, it is more data-efﬁcient, meaning that fewer data points are
    required to

    train the model [125].

    In conclusion, deep learning has the potential to revolutionize the agricultural
    industry,

    but there are several areas that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.
    These

    include the need for robustness, interpretability, integration of multiple modalities
    of data,

    and few-shot learning. Further research in these areas is crucial to overcoming
    these

    challenges and fully harnessing the power of deep learning in agriculture.

    8. Conclusions and Future Work

    The primary aim of the present study was to provide an overview of the recent
    ad-

    vancements linked to DL in the agricultural sector. This study employed a comprehensive

    review of approaches linked to agricultural DL, including disease detection, yield
    predic-

    tion, and weed prediction, in studies published between 2016 and early 2022. The
    key

    ﬁndings of this paper indicated that a range of DL tools, employed for counting
    fruit,

    managing water, crop management, soil management, weed detection, seed classiﬁcation,

    yield prediction, disease detection, and even harvesting, have been identiﬁed.
    It was also

    revealed that, despite the employment of DL processes in agriculture, there are
    certain

    obstacles that come with the use of this technology. It involves difﬁculties such
    as the

    compilation of datasets, the time necessary for staff training, and the presence
    of DL experts

    to ensure high production. Furthermore, system development and hardware requirements,

    as well as the deployment of large models and software on small devices, such
    as smart-

    phones, may have impacts on system efﬁciency. Thus, it can be concluded that,
    with the

    support of the most recent prediction analyses and tools, the application of DL
    methods

    has assisted the agriculture industry in growing and developing. It can be noted
    that DL

    has great potential in the ﬁeld of agriculture. However, the high cost of hardware
    and

    software makes its application very limited. Therefore, there is a need to work
    on research

    and development around cost-effective DL methods in the future to enhance large-scale

    applications. Furthermore, DL methods are limited in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

    Thus, more research is needed in this direction to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness
    of

    DL methods.

    The availability of computational capacity is yet another barrier that inhibits
    the

    implementation of DL in agriculture. The training of models necessitates ever-increasing

    amounts of computing resources due to the growing number of datasets, as well
    as the

    increasing complexity of deep-learning neural networks. It is very important that
    the

    performance of graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs)

    continues to improve, as this is a very important accelerator for the widespread
    popularity

    of deep learning. In addition, the development of DL has been sped up by the availability
    of

    cloud computing services, such as the Google Cloud Platform, offered by private
    businesses.

    However, because of stringent requirements regarding computation capacity, current
    uses

    of DL in agriculture are typically ofﬂine. This means that the collection and
    analysis of

    images of farmland is undertaken in an asynchronous manner. Consequently, companies

    have paid some attention to this issue.

    \ of IoT technologies for crop monitoring\namong farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia.\
    \ The research investigates the relationship between farmers’\nawareness of IoT\
    \ technologies, their perception of beneﬁts, and willingness to adopt them. It\
    \ also\nexplores the inﬂuence of factors like access to information, training,\
    \ and the perception of government\nsupport on adoption behavior. A structured\
    \ questionnaire was distributed to 550 farmers, with a\nresponse rate of 90.91%.\
    \ The analysis reveals a signiﬁcant association between farmers’ awareness of\n\
    IoT technologies and their perception of beneﬁts. The perceived beneﬁts show a\
    \ moderate positive\nrelationship with farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\
    \ Access to information, training,\nand the perception of government support also\
    \ have a positive inﬂuence on adoption. The ﬁndings\nhighlight the importance\
    \ of increasing farmers’ awareness and providing access to information\nand training\
    \ on IoT technologies. The study emphasizes the need for government support in\n\
    facilitating adoption. Recommendations include exploring additional factors, conducting\
    \ longitudinal\nstudies, and developing tailored training programs. Collaboration\
    \ among stakeholders and ﬁnancial\nsupport mechanisms is also crucial. This study\
    \ contributes to the understanding of IoT technology\nadoption in agriculture,\
    \ providing insights for policymakers, agricultural extension agencies, and\n\
    technology providers. By embracing IoT technologies and implementing the recommended\
    \ actions,\nfarmers in Jizan can enhance their crop monitoring practices, improve\
    \ productivity, and promote\nsustainable farming.\nKeywords: IoT technologies;\

    \ has witnessed signiﬁcant advancements in\ntechnology, paving the way for improved\
    \ monitoring and management practices. One\nsuch technological innovation that\
    \ holds great promise is the use of Internet of Things (IoT)\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction. The integration\nof IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data analytics offers new possibilities for farmers to\
    \ gain\nreal-time insights into their crops and make informed decisions for optimizing\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity [1,2].\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541. https://doi.org/10.3390/su151914541\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    2 of 19\nAgricultural productivity cannot be overstated when it comes to the importance\
    \ of\ncrop monitoring. In order for farmers to make informed decisions concerning\
    \ irrigation,\nfertilization, pest control, and other agronomic practices, accurate\
    \ and timely information\nabout crop health, growth, and yield potential is necessary\
    \ [3]. There has been a long\nhistory of crop monitoring that relies on manual\
    \ observation and a limited range of sam-\npling methods, which often results\
    \ in inadequate resource allocation and a reduction in\nproductivity. This is\
    \ in spite of the fact that farmers have been able to access continuous\nand detailed\
    \ information about their crops as a result of IoT technologies, enabling them\
    \ to\npractice precision agriculture [4].\nIn agriculture, IoT technologies have\
    \ the potential to offer a number of beneﬁts. As a\nﬁrst step, IoT enables farmers\
    \ to collect real-time data on the health and growth of their\ncrops, allowing\
    \ them to gain valuable insights about them. This allows for proactive inter-\n\
    vention and timely adjustments in irrigation, nutrient application, and pest management\n\
    strategies. Secondly, IoT technologies enhance the accuracy of yield prediction\
    \ models\nby capturing detailed data on environmental conditions, crop physiology,\
    \ and growth\npatterns [5]. Accurate yield prediction enables better planning\
    \ and resource allocation,\noptimizing overall agricultural productivity.\nMoreover,\
    \ IoT technologies facilitate resource management in agriculture by optimiz-\n\
    ing the use of water, energy, and fertilizers. By monitoring soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and nutrient levels, IoT systems can provide precise recommendations for irrigation\
    \ and\nfertilization, reducing waste and the environmental impact [6]. Additionally,\
    \ IoT-based\nmonitoring can help to identify pest infestations and diseases at\
    \ early stages, enabling\ntargeted interventions and minimizing crop losses [4].\n\
    The Vision 2030 of Saudi Arabia aims to diversify the country’s economy and reduce\n\
    its oil dependence. Agri-food sustainability is the focus of the plan. The achievement\
    \ of\nthese goals will be dependent on technological advancements and innovations.\
    \ The Centre\nfor the Development of Agricultural Techniques (CDAT) is a research,\
    \ development, and\ntechnology adoption center established to promote agricultural\
    \ research, development, and\ntechnology adoption. In order to achieve this aim,\
    \ advanced farming techniques must be\nimplemented, water resources should be\
    \ conserved, and agricultural productivity must\nbe improved. AgTech Investments:\
    \ There has been a lot of investment in agricultural\ntechnology startups and\
    \ innovations in Saudi Arabia. A large portion of these investments\nare targeted\
    \ towards fostering technological advancements in various aspects of agricultural\n\
    production, such as crop monitoring and the optimization of yield.\nThe objective\
    \ of this research is to explore the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\nnologies\
    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Jizan, located in\
    \ the\nsouthwestern region of Saudi Arabia, is known for its diverse agricultural\
    \ activities and\nis a prime area for investigating the potential of IoT technologies\
    \ in improving farming\npractices. By understanding the perceptions, challenges,\
    \ and adoption intentions of farmers\nin Jizan regarding IoT-based crop monitoring,\
    \ valuable insights can be gained to enhance\nthe implementation and effectiveness\
    \ of these technologies in the local agricultural context.\nA major objective\
    \ of this study is to determine how much awareness farmers in Jizan\nhave regarding\
    \ the use of IoT technologies for crop monitoring and what the level of\nawareness\
    \ is. What are the perceived beneﬁts associated with adopting these technologies?\n\
    What is the intention of farmers to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring\
    \ in the future?\nAdditionally, this study will explore farmers’ preferred IoT\
    \ technologies, their perception\nof government support, access to information,\
    \ and training resources.\nBy investigating these aspects, this research aims\
    \ to contribute to the existing knowl-\nedge on the use of IoT technologies for\
    \ crop monitoring and provide valuable insights\nfor policymakers, agricultural\
    \ practitioners, and technology providers in Jizan, Saudi Ara-\nbia. The ﬁndings\
    \ of this study will help to identify the factors inﬂuencing the successful\n\
    implementation and adoption of IoT-based crop monitoring solutions, ultimately\
    \ leading\nto improved agricultural practices, enhanced productivity, and sustainable\
    \ farming in\nthe region. In this research paper, we aim to explore the perception\
    \ and adoption of IoT\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n3 of 19\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction among farmers in\nJizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, by understanding the awareness, beneﬁts, and adoption intentions\
    \ of\nfarmers regarding IoT technologies in the region.\n2. Literature Review\n\
    In recent years, IoT technologies have gained substantial attention for crop monitoring\n\
    due to the fact that they have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by enabling\
    \ the\nprovision of real-time data on crop health, growth, and yield prediction\
    \ [7,8]. This emerging\nﬁeld offers promising opportunities for farmers to optimize\
    \ resource management, enhance\nproductivity, and make data-driven decisions for\
    \ sustainable farming practices. However,\nthe adoption and successful implementation\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture depend on\nmultiple factors that can vary\
    \ across different regions and contexts.\nIoT technologies have been shown to\
    \ have a number of beneﬁts in agriculture in\nprevious research. In the study\
    \ conducted by [7] in a different geographical context, it was\nfound that farmers\
    \ were able to collect precise and timely information about environmental\nfactors\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, and other elements through the use of IoT-based\n\
    monitoring systems. This enhanced data availability allowed farmers to optimize\
    \ irrigation\nschedules, resulting in improved water efﬁciency and increased crop\
    \ yields. Similarly,\nref. [8] emphasized the potential of IoT technologies in\
    \ crop yield prediction, demonstrating\ntheir ability to integrate data from multiple\
    \ sensors and provide accurate predictions for\ninformed decision-making.\nIn\
    \ Pathmudi et al. [9], IoT is considered a modern technology comprising physical\n\
    entities that communicate over the Internet with one another. The Internet of\
    \ Things is\neverywhere. Globally, connected systems/organizations are driving\
    \ the growth of IoT\ndevices [10]. Ref. [11] developed an irrigation management\
    \ system that uses the Internet of\nThings. There was a discussion of various\
    \ IoT architectures, deployment models, sensors,\nand controllers that are used\
    \ in agriculture today, cloud platforms for IoT, irrigation\nscheduling software,\
    \ and machine-learning algorithms that allow us to predict real-time\nirrigation\
    \ water demand in the future [12]. A system of automated monitoring of the\nsoil–plant–atmospheric\
    \ continuum at a high spatiotemporal resolution is being developed\nto replace\
    \ the current labor-intensive, experience-based methods of agricultural decision-\n\
    making with a data-driven approach based on data collected by automated monitoring\
    \ [13].\nIt is proposed to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) framework that\
    \ consists of wireless\nsensor networks with intelligent algorithms based on an\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) approach\nthat increases food production while combating\
    \ climatic change [14]. An IoT system\ncould be used for agricultural automation\
    \ and could be governed by a variety of protocol\ncommunications that are used\
    \ to describe its rules. Several factors must be considered\nwhen analyzing parameters\
    \ such as the speed at which data are transferred, the mechanism\nby which data\
    \ are transferred, the encryption level, range, latency, and number of items\n\
    controlled when analyzing parameters.\nIt has been proven that agriculturalists\
    \ and farmers can take advantage of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) not only in\
    \ order to enhance the efﬁciency with which they are able to\ngrow crops and to\
    \ make them more proﬁtable but also to improve their post-harvest\nprocesses and\
    \ the end users’ experience with agricultural products [15]. Furthermore, one\n\

    \ climate conditions, crop varieties, and farming practices. Such contextual factors\n\
    can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence farmers’ attitudes, awareness, and willingness to adopt\
    \ IoT\ntechnologies for crop monitoring and management.\nUnderstanding the speciﬁc\
    \ factors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers in\nJizan is crucial\
    \ for the successful implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in the\n\
    region’s agricultural sector. Factors such as farmers’ level of awareness, perceived\
    \ beneﬁts\nand challenges, preferred IoT technologies, and perception of government\
    \ support play a\nsigniﬁcant role in shaping their attitudes towards adopting\
    \ these technologies. However,\nthe literature lacks empirical evidence and insights\
    \ into these factors in the context of Jizan.\nTo address this research gap, this\
    \ study aims to investigate the perception and adop-\ntion of IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. By\nconducting surveys\
    \ and analyzing the collected data, this research will provide valuable\ninsights\
    \ into the speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption intentions and inform\
    \ the\ndevelopment of strategies to promote the successful integration of IoT\
    \ technologies in\nJizan’s agricultural practices.\n2.2. Level of Awareness of\
    \ IoT Technologies in Agriculture\nIt has become increasingly apparent in recent\
    \ years that IoT technologies can be used\nfor improving agricultural productivity\
    \ and efﬁciency. IoT technologies offer numerous\nopportunities for enhancing\
    \ crop monitoring, improving productivity, and optimizing\nresource management\
    \ in the agricultural sector. This section discusses the evolving level\nof awareness\
    \ among farmers and stakeholders regarding the potential beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies\
    \ in agriculture.\nUsing IoT technologies, the authors of [8] argue that farmers\
    \ will be able to make\nmore informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources\
    \ in order to maximize crop\nhealth and growth during the growing season. The\
    \ study highlights the importance of\ncreating awareness among farmers about the\
    \ capabilities and beneﬁts of IoT technologies.\nSimilarly, [30] emphasize the\
    \ role of IoT-based crop growth monitoring systems in enabling\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ key parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels,\nleading\
    \ to improved crop management practices.\nIn a survey conducted by [31], it was\
    \ found that a majority of farmers had some level\nof awareness regarding IoT-based\
    \ smart agriculture. However, the study also revealed\nvariations in awareness\
    \ levels across different regions and farm sizes. This suggests the\nimportance\
    \ of tailoring awareness campaigns and educational initiatives to speciﬁc contexts\n\
    and target groups.\nThe authors discuss the importance of bridging the digital\
    \ divide and ensuring equal\naccess to information and resources related to IoT\
    \ technologies in agriculture. They empha-\nsize the need to address technological\
    \ literacy and provide adequate training and support\nto farmers to enhance their\
    \ awareness and adoption of IoT solutions.\n2.3. The Adoption of IoT Technologies\
    \ in Agriculture\nThe adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in the\
    \ agricultural sector has\ngained signiﬁcant attention in recent years. Farmers\
    \ are increasingly recognizing the\npotential beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for monitoring crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction. This section explores\
    \ the adoption of IoT technologies among farmers and\nhighlights key factors inﬂuencing\
    \ their adoption decisions.\nA study conducted by [32] among farmers in the United\
    \ States found that 70% of the\nrespondents were aware of IoT technologies and\
    \ expressed a positive attitude toward their\nadoption. This indicates a growing\
    \ interest and acceptance of IoT technologies among\nfarmers.\nThe adoption of\
    \ IoT technologies is inﬂuenced by various factors. One crucial factor\nis the\
    \ perceived beneﬁts of using these technologies. Research by [30] demonstrated\
    \ that\nfarmers perceive IoT technologies as beneﬁcial for the real-time monitoring\
    \ of crop health,\nenabling proactive decision-making and optimizing resource\
    \ allocation. The ability to\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n6 of 19\nobtain\
    \ accurate and timely information about crop conditions and environmental factors\
    \ is\nseen as a signiﬁcant advantage of IoT technologies [33].\nHowever, there\
    \ are also challenges associated with the adoption of IoT technologies\nin agriculture.\
    \ Limited technical knowledge and skills to operate IoT devices have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ as a barrier to adoption [34]. Farmers may require training and support to\n\
    effectively utilize IoT technologies in their farming practices. Additionally,\
    \ concerns about\ndata privacy and security pose challenges to adoption. Farmers\
    \ want assurance that their\ndata will be protected and not misused [2,35].\n\
    Government support plays a crucial role in facilitating the adoption of IoT technologies\n\
    in agriculture. Policies and initiatives that promote the use of IoT technologies\
    \ and provide\nﬁnancial incentives can positively inﬂuence farmers’ adoption decisions.\
    \ Research by [36]\nshowed that farmers who perceived strong government support\
    \ were more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies.\nMoreover, the availability of\
    \ information and training resources is vital for successful\nadoption. Farmers\
    \ need access to reliable and relevant information about IoT technologies,\ntheir\
    \ beneﬁts, and how to effectively implement them. Training programs and workshops\n\
    can enhance farmers’ understanding and competence in utilizing IoT technologies\
    \ for crop\nmonitoring [37–39].\n2.4. Perceived Beneﬁts of IoT Technologies\n\
    The perception of beneﬁts of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in agriculture\
    \ plays\na signiﬁcant role in determining their adoption. Farmers are increasingly\
    \ recognizing the\npotential advantages that IoT technologies offer for monitoring\
    \ crop health, optimizing\nresource allocation, and improving overall agricultural\
    \ productivity.\nReal-time monitoring and data collection: One of the key perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies is the ability to monitor crop conditions and collect\
    \ data in real time. IoT de-\nvices equipped with sensors can provide farmers\
    \ with accurate and up-to-date information\nabout soil moisture levels, temperature,\
    \ humidity, and other environmental factors. There\nis a growing need for farmers\
    \ to be given access to data in real-time so that they can make\ngood decisions\
    \ regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control and thus improve crop\n\
    health and maximize resource utilization [30,33].\nProactive decision-making:\
    \ IoT technologies enable farmers to take a proactive ap-\nproach to agricultural\
    \ management. By continuously monitoring crop health and environ-\nmental conditions,\
    \ farmers can identify potential issues or anomalies early on and take\nnecessary\
    \ actions to mitigate risks. For example, if a sensor detects a sudden drop in\
    \ soil\nmoisture levels, the system can automatically trigger an irrigation schedule\
    \ adjustment or\nsend an alert to the farmer, allowing for prompt intervention\
    \ and preventing potential crop\ndamage [34].\nYield prediction and crop planning:\
    \ IoT technologies also contribute to yield pre-\ndiction and crop planning. Through\
    \ data analysis and machine-learning algorithms, IoT\nsystems can generate insights\
    \ and forecasts regarding crop yield potential. This information\nenables farmers\
    \ to plan their harvesting, storage, and marketing activities more effectively.\n\
    Additionally, yield prediction helps farmers estimate their future produce, allowing\
    \ for\nbetter ﬁnancial planning and decision-making [36].\n2.5. Willingness to\
    \ Adopt IoT Technologies\nThe willingness to adopt IoT (Internet of Things) technologies\
    \ is a critical factor in the\nsuccessful implementation and integration of these\
    \ technologies in the agricultural sector.\nThis section explores the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies\nand the potential\
    \ beneﬁts associated with their adoption.\nPerceived usefulness: Farmers’ perception\
    \ of the usefulness of IoT technologies sig-\nniﬁcantly inﬂuences their willingness\
    \ to adopt them. Studies have shown that farmers\nare more likely to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies when they perceive them as valuable tools that\ncan enhance their\
    \ farming practices and decision-making processes. The perceived useful-\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n7 of 19\nness of IoT technologies stems from their ability\
    \ to provide real-time data on crop health,\noptimize resource management, and\
    \ improve overall agricultural productivity [30,33].\nPerceived ease of use: The\
    \ perceived ease of use refers to farmers’ perception of\nhow easy it is to learn\
    \ and operate IoT technologies. Farmers are more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies\
    \ when they perceive them as user-friendly and accessible. Factors such\nas the\
    \ simplicity of the interface, ease of installation and maintenance, and availability\n\
    of training and technical support inﬂuence farmers’ perception of the ease of\
    \ use. User-\nfriendly IoT technologies increase farmers’ conﬁdence in their ability\
    \ to adopt and utilize\nthese technologies effectively [2,34].\n2.6. Access to\
    \ Information and Training, Perception of Government Support\nAccess to information\
    \ and training, as well as the perception of government support,\nare important\
    \ factors that inﬂuence farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies in our\n\
    targeted area. Here, we explore the impact of these factors on farmers’ adoption\
    \ decisions\nbased on recent studies conducted from 2020 onward.\nAccess to information\
    \ and training: Farmers’ access to relevant information and train-\ning on IoT\
    \ technologies is crucial for their successful adoption. Studies have shown that\n\
    farmers who have access to comprehensive information and training programs are\
    \ more\nlikely to adopt and effectively use IoT technologies in their farming\
    \ practices. Accessi-\nble information channels, such as agricultural extension\
    \ services, workshops, seminars,\nand online resources, contribute to farmers’\
    \ understanding of the potential beneﬁts and\nfunctionalities of IoT technologies.\
    \ Training programs that provide hands-on experience\nand technical knowledge\
    \ further enhance farmers’ conﬁdence and competency in utilizing\nthese technologies\
    \ [8,40].\nPerception of government support: Farmers’ perception of government\
    \ support plays\na signiﬁcant role in their decision to adopt IoT technologies.\
    \ When farmers perceive that\nthe government actively supports the adoption and\
    \ implementation of IoT technologies\nin agriculture, they are more likely to\
    \ embrace these technologies. Government support\ncan take various forms, including\
    \ ﬁnancial incentives, subsidies, policy frameworks, and\nthe establishment of\
    \ dedicated support programs. The perception of government support\ncreates a\
    \ favorable environment for farmers, instilling conﬁdence and reducing potential\n\
    barriers to adoption. It also signals the government’s commitment to the modernization\
    \ of\nthe agricultural sector and the promotion of sustainable farming practices\
    \ [6,41].\nIn our targeted area, the availability of relevant and up-to-date information\
    \ on IoT\ntechnologies through government initiatives and agricultural extension\
    \ services is vital.\nFarmers should have access to training programs that provide\
    \ them with the necessary\nskills and knowledge to effectively use IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring. Additionally,\nthe government should demonstrate a supportive\
    \ stance by offering ﬁnancial assistance,\nsubsidies, and policy measures that\
    \ incentivize the adoption of IoT technologies in agri-\nculture. These efforts\
    \ foster a positive perception of government support, encouraging\nfarmers to\
    \ embrace IoT technologies and integrate them into their farming operations [42].\n\
    2.7. Research Gap\nDespite the growing body of research on the use of IoT technologies\
    \ in agriculture,\nthere is still a notable gap when it comes to understanding\
    \ the perception and adoption of\nthese technologies among farmers in speciﬁc\
    \ regions, such as Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Most of\nthe existing studies have focused\
    \ on general discussions of IoT applications in agriculture\nor have examined\
    \ adoption patterns in different geographical contexts [8,43]. However, the\n\
    speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing the perception and adoption of IoT technologies in\
    \ the context\nof Jizan’s agricultural sector remain largely unexplored.\nJizan,\
    \ located in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia, has its own unique agricul-\n\
    tural landscape, characterized by speciﬁc climatic conditions, crop varieties,\
    \ and farming\npractices. These contextual factors can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence farmers’\
    \ attitudes, awareness,\nand willingness to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring\
    \ and management. Therefore,\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n8 of 19\nit is crucial\
    \ to conduct region-speciﬁc studies to bridge the gap in knowledge and provide\n\
    insights that are tailored to the needs and challenges faced by farmers in Jizan.\n\
    By conducting a focused investigation on the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, this study aims to ﬁll this\
    \ gap in\nthe literature. It is hoped that the ﬁndings will allow us to better\
    \ understand the speciﬁc\nfactors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers\
    \ in Jizan. These factors include the\nfarmers’ level of awareness, their perception\
    \ of the beneﬁts, and their perception of the\nchallenges associated with IoT,\
    \ as well as their perception of the government’s support.\nThis knowledge can\
    \ inform the development of targeted strategies and policies to promote\nthe successful\
    \ implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in Jizan’s agricultural\n\
    sector.\nObjective and Hypothesis\nObjective 1: To examine the association between\
    \ farmers’ level of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the\
    \ beneﬁts.\nHypothesis 1. There is a signiﬁcant association between farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the beneﬁts.\nObjective\
    \ 2: To assess the inﬂuence of perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for\n\
    crop monitoring on farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies.\nHypothesis\
    \ 2. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop monitoring have\
    \ a signiﬁ-\ncant and positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\
    \ technologies.\nObjective 3: To explore the inﬂuence of access to information\
    \ and training, as well as\nthe perception of government support, on farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\nHypothesis 3. The access to information\
    \ and training and perception of government support have\na positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Research\
    \ Design\nIt is the aim of this research study to identify the factors that inﬂuence\
    \ farmers in Jizan,\nSaudi Arabia, to adopt Internet of Things (IoT) technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring using the\nquantitative method as part of the research design.\
    \ In quantitative research, numerical data\nare collected and analyzed in a systematic\
    \ way, with the objective of testing hypotheses\nand drawing objective conclusions\
    \ based on the statistical analysis of the data.\n3.2. Sampling Technique\nAn\
    \ examination of a representative sample of farmers in Jizan was conducted by\
    \ using\na sampling technique based on stratiﬁcation. Based on relevant criteria\
    \ such as farm size,\nfarming experience, and geographic location, the population\
    \ of the study was divided\ninto distinct strata, which were categorized according\
    \ to relevant factors. To ensure that a\nproportionally representative sample\
    \ of each subgroup was selected, a random sampling\nalgorithm was used within\
    \ each stratum in order to select participants.\n3.3. Data Collection\nData were\
    \ collected through a structured questionnaire administered to the selected\n\
    sample of farmers. The questionnaire consists of multiple-choice and Likert scale\
    \ items\nto gather both demographic information and respondents’ perceptions,\
    \ attitudes, and\nbehaviors related to the adoption of IoT technologies for crop\
    \ monitoring. The questionnaire\nwas pre-tested with a pilot group of farmers\
    \ to ensure clarity and validity.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n9 of 19\n3.4.\
    \ Data Analysis\nTo address the research objectives and test the hypotheses that\
    \ have been proposed,\nthe collected data have been analyzed using appropriate\
    \ statistical methods. In order to\nsummarize the demographic information and\
    \ the responses from the participants, descrip-\ntive statistics such as frequencies\
    \ and percentages were used. Correlations, associations,\nand yield predictions\
    \ were all examined by using inferential statistical techniques, such as\nreliability\
    \ analysis, correlation tests, and regression analysis.\nAccording to methodology,\
    \ we aim to gather reliable and representative data that can\ncontribute to a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of the factors inﬂuencing the adoption of IoT\n\
    technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia.\n4. Results\n\
    Descriptive statistics were calculated to provide an overview of a variety of\
    \ charac-\nteristics related to the demographics of the participants, as well\
    \ as their perceptions and\nbehaviors in relation to the use of the IoT for crop\
    \ monitoring technologies. Frequencies\nand percentages were computed to present\
    \ the distribution and central tendencies of the\nvariables under investigation.\
    \ In addition to hypothesis testing, other relevant ﬁndings\nemerged from the\
    \ data analysis. These ﬁndings provide further insights into the factors\ninﬂuencing\
    \ the adoption of IoT technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan,\n\
    Saudi Arabia. The results highlight patterns, trends, and relationships that are\
    \ important\nin understanding the research topic. This study has some limitations\
    \ that need to be ac-\nknowledged in order for the results to be reliable. Among\
    \ the limitations of the study\nare the constraints on sample size, the possibility\
    \ of bias during data collection, and the\ngeneralizability of the ﬁndings beyond\
    \ the sampled population. These limitations should\nbe considered when interpreting\
    \ the results and implications of the study. The results\nsection presents the\
    \ ﬁndings of the statistical analyses conducted, providing evidence to\nsupport\
    \ or reject the formulated hypotheses and offering insights into the research\
    \ objec-\ntives. The results contribute to our understanding of the factors inﬂuencing\
    \ the adoption\nof IoT technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan,\

    \ Arabia. This information serves as a foundation for under-\nstanding the farmers’\
    \ perceptions and adoption patterns regarding IoT technologies for\ncrop monitoring,\
    \ health assessment, growth tracking, and yield prediction.\nAccording to the\
    \ results in Table 3, the topic of using IoT technologies to monitor\ncrop health,\
    \ growth, and yield prediction exhibits a relatively moderate mean, a relatively\n\
    high variance and standard deviation, and a good level of internal consistency.\
    \ The high\nvariance and standard deviation indicate a signiﬁcant degree of variability\
    \ in the data, and\nthe good internal consistency suggests that the measured items\
    \ or variables in the analysis\nare reliable. The Cronbach’s alpha value for the\
    \ Likert scale was 0.872, which indicates that\nall factors in the Likert scale\
    \ have an internal consistency of 0.872. As a result, all factors\nare internally\
    \ consistent with each other. In order to verify the reliability of a test, a\
    \ good\nmeasure is a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.7 or higher, which, when using\
    \ Cronbach’s alpha\nas a guideline, is generally considered a good measure of\

    \ (r = 0.835\n**) for Hypothesis 1, which examines the relationship between farmers’\
    \ level of awareness\nof IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\
    \ of using these technologies for crop\nmonitoring. The correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ of 0.835 ** indicates a strong positive correlation\nbetween farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\nassociated\
    \ with using these technologies for crop monitoring. This suggests that as farmers’\n\
    awareness of IoT technologies increases, their perception of the beneﬁts also\
    \ tends to\nincrease. The strength of the correlation coefﬁcient suggests that\
    \ there is a substantial\nrelationship between these two variables. The positive\
    \ correlation implies that farmers who\nhave a higher awareness of IoT technologies\
    \ are more likely to perceive greater beneﬁts\nfrom using these technologies for\
    \ crop monitoring. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis\nthat there is a signiﬁcant\
    \ association between farmers’ level of awareness of IoT technologies\nand their\
    \ perception of the beneﬁts. It indicates that farmers who are more aware of IoT\n\
    technologies are more likely to recognize the advantages and positive outcomes\
    \ associated\nwith implementing these technologies in their crop monitoring practices.\n\

    \ no signiﬁcant evidence to suggest that the variances\nbetween the groups are\
    \ different from one another. Furthermore, there is no strong reason\nwhy the\
    \ null hypothesis should be rejected, as the assumption of homogeneity of variance\
    \ is\nmet. These results are considered good because they imply that the variability\
    \ within each\ngroup is relatively consistent, which makes it more appropriate\
    \ to use statistical methods\nthat assume equal variances, such as the analysis\
    \ of variance (ANOVA) or t-tests.\nAccording to the results in Table 6, the correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient (R) represents the strength\nand direction of the relationship between\
    \ the independent variable (perceived beneﬁts) and\nthe dependent variable (willingness\
    \ to adopt IoT technologies). In this case, the correlation\ncoefﬁcient is 0.458,\
    \ indicating a moderate positive correlation between the perceived bene-\nﬁts\
    \ and willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The coefﬁcient of determination (R\
    \ Square)\nexplains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that\
    \ can be accounted for\nby the independent variable(s). In this model, the R Square\
    \ value is 0.210, which means\nthat approximately 21% of the variance in farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies is\nexplained by the perceived beneﬁts.\
    \ The adjusted R Square is a calculation that takes into\naccount the number of\
    \ predictors that are included in a model and calculates the adjusted\nR Square\
    \ value accordingly. A more accurate R Square in this case is 0.209, which is\
    \ slightly\nlower than the standard R Square in this case. As a result, it is\
    \ suggested that when taking\ninto consideration the other variables in the model,\
    \ the perception of the beneﬁts alone\nexplains about 20.9% of the variance in\
    \ farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The\nSustainability 2023, 15,\

    \ values have around\nthe predicted values, or how much scatter they have around\
    \ the observed values. The\nstandard error of the estimate of farmers’ willingness\

    \ 10, the ANOVA table provides information about the overall\nsigniﬁcance of the\

    \ the amount of variance in the dependent variable (farmers’ willingness to adopt\n\
    IoT technologies) that is explained by the predictors (access to information and\
    \ training,\nperception of government support). In this particular case, the regression\
    \ sum of squares is\n3180.032, which is a signiﬁcant value. The amount of unexplained\
    \ variance in a dependent\nvariable is represented by the residual sum of the\
    \ factor of the square. By using this method,\nwe can measure the difference between\
    \ the observed values and the values predicted by\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    14 of 19\nthe regression model based on the observed data. According to this equation,\
    \ the residual\nsum of squares is 13,495.416, which is a signiﬁcant value. In\
    \ order to calculate the variance\nin the dependent variable, the total sum of\
    \ squares must be calculated. The sum of squares\nis calculated based on the regression\
    \ sum of squares and the residual sum of squares. This\nmeans that the total sum\
    \ of the squares is 16,675.448 in this case. There are degrees of\nfreedom that\
    \ serve as a measure of the amount of independent information that can be\ngathered\
    \ for estimation. In the regression model, the degrees of freedom for the predictors\n\
    are two, which is the number of predictors (access to information and training,\
    \ perception\nof government support). The degrees of freedom for the residual\
    \ are 497, which is the total\nnumber of observations minus the number of predictors.\
    \ The mean square is calculated by\ndividing the sum of squares by the degrees\
    \ of freedom. It represents the average amount\nof variance. The F statistic is\
    \ the ratio of the mean square for regression to the mean\nsquare for the residual.\
    \ It indicates whether the regression model as a whole is statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\
    \ In this case, the F statistic is 58.556. As a result of the F statistic, you\
    \ will be able\nto determine the signiﬁcance level (p-value). In other words,\
    \ it represents the probability of\nobtaining an observable F value by chance\
    \ alone, rather than using an algorithm. Using\nthis method of analysis, the p-value\

    \ of increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technolo-\ngies in order to enhance\
    \ their perception of the beneﬁts and promote the adoption of these\ntechnologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\n\
    for crop monitoring (PBIT) have a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness\nto adopt these technologies. However, it is important to note that\
    \ the perceived beneﬁts\nalone explain only a portion of the variance in the willingness\
    \ to adopt, and there may\nbe other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption behavior\
    \ that are not accounted for in the\ncurrent model. The ANOVA table indicates\
    \ that the regression model with the perceived\nbeneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ (PBIT) as the predictor variable explains a signiﬁcant\namount of variability\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies. The p-value\n(<0.001) suggests\
    \ that the relationship between the perceived beneﬁts and willingness\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n16 of 19\nto adopt IoT technologies is statistically signiﬁcant.\
    \ Overall, these ﬁndings support the\nsecond hypothesis, indicating that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop\nmonitoring have a signiﬁcant and\
    \ positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\ntechnologies. The\
    \ results suggest that highlighting the advantages and positive outcomes\nof using\
    \ IoT technologies can enhance farmers’ motivation to adopt them in their crop\n\
    monitoring practices.\nThe predictors (access to information and training, perception\
    \ of government support)\nhave a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies,\nand they collectively explain a signiﬁcant\
    \ proportion of the variance in the dependent\nvariable. The regression model,\
    \ which includes the predictors (access to information and\ntraining, perception\
    \ of government support), is statistically signiﬁcant in explaining the\nvariance\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The predictors collectively\n\
    contribute signiﬁcantly to the model, as indicated by the F statistic and the\
    \ associated\np-value. Overall, the coefﬁcient table provides information about\
    \ the estimated effects of\nthe predictors on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies. The signiﬁcant coefﬁcients\nindicate that both access to information\
    \ and training and the perception of government sup-\nport have a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies, although\nthe effect of access\
    \ to information and training (AIT) is relatively stronger compared to the\nperception\
    \ of government support (PGS).\n6. Conclusions\nThe purpose of this study is to\
    \ make contributions to the understanding of how farmers\nperceive IoT technologies\
    \ and their adoption for crop monitoring among themselves. The\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on the roles of these technologies in enhancing agricultural practices\nand\
    \ emphasize the need for further research and support in promoting their effective\n\
    implementation in the agricultural sector. The discoveries of the study show the\
    \ importance\nof increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technologies to enhance\
    \ their perception of the\nbeneﬁts and promote the adoption of these technologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The\nperceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring have a moderate positive\nrelationship with farmers’ willingness\
    \ to adopt these technologies. However, it is important\nto note that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts alone explain only a portion of the variance in the\nwillingness to\
    \ adopt, suggesting the presence of other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption\n\
    behavior that were not accounted for in the current model. The predictors, namely\
    \ access to\ninformation and training and the perception of government support,\
    \ also have a moderate\npositive relationship with farmers’ willingness to adopt\
    \ IoT technologies. Collectively,\nthese predictors explain a signiﬁcant proportion\
    \ of the variance in farmers’ willingness to\nadopt. The regression model including\
    \ these predictors is statistically signiﬁcant, indicating\ntheir inﬂuence on\
    \ farmers’ adoption behavior.\n6.1. Decision\nAccording to the results, it is\
    \ recommended that IoT technologies be promoted to\nfarmers and highlighted for\
    \ the beneﬁts associated with their use. Agricultural IoT tech-\nnology beneﬁts\
    \ and practical applications can be explained to farmers through targeted\ninformation\
    \ dissemination and training programs. IoT technologies should also be im-\nproved\
    \ to ensure farmers have access to information and training to adopt and use these\n\
    technologies effectively. Additionally, government initiatives and policies can\
    \ foster a\nsupportive environment for IoT adoption among farmers. Farmers’ adoption\
    \ behavior\nmay not be captured by the current model. IoT technologies in agriculture\
    \ should be\nexplored further in future research. These variables include economic\
    \ considerations, social\ndynamics, and technological infrastructure.\nAs a result\
    \ of the study, we conclude that the key drivers of the adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia include raising awareness,\
    \ promoting\nperceived beneﬁts, and providing access to information and training.\
    \ To improve crop\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n17 of 19\nhealth, growth, and\
    \ yield prediction, policymakers, agricultural extension agencies, and\ntech providers\
    \ can use these ﬁndings to develop strategies and interventions.\n6.2. Future\

    \ behavior towards IoT\ntechnologies in crop monitoring. Consider variables such\
    \ as economic viability, social\ndynamics, technological infrastructure, and regulatory\
    \ contexts. This will offer a more\ncomprehensive considerate of the barriers\
    \ and drivers of adoption.\n2.\nLongitudinal studies: Conduct longitudinal studies\
    \ to track the adoption of IoT\ntechnologies over time among farmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia. This will help to\nidentify trends, challenges, and opportunities\
    \ associated with long-term adoption,\nas well as to assess the impact of IoT\
    \ technologies on crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction.\n3.\nTailored training\
    \ programs: Develop and implement tailored training programs for\nfarmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, focusing on building their skills and knowledge related\nto IoT\
    \ technologies. These programs should be designed to address speciﬁc challenges\n\
    and opportunities in the local context, making them more effective in promoting\n\
    adoption and maximizing the beneﬁts of IoT technologies in crop monitoring.\n\
    4.\nCollaboration and partnerships: Foster collaboration and partnerships among\
    \ key\nstakeholders, including farmers, agricultural extension agencies, technology\
    \ providers,\nand government entities. Such collaborations can help in knowledge\
    \ sharing, capacity\nbuilding, and the co-development of IoT solutions that are\
    \ relevant and practical for\nthe local agricultural sector.\n5.\nFinancial support:\
    \ Explore ﬁnancial support mechanisms, such as subsidies, grants,\nor loans, to\
    \ assist farmers in the adoption of IoT technologies. Financial incentives\ncan\
    \ help to alleviate the initial investment costs associated with acquiring IoT\
    \ devices\nand implementing the necessary infrastructure, thus encouraging more\
    \ farmers to\nadopt these technologies.\n6.\nDemonstration farms: Establish demonstration\
    \ farms or pilot projects in Jizan, Saudi\nArabia, where farmers can observe and\
    \ learn ﬁrsthand about the beneﬁts and prac-\ntical applications of IoT technologies\
    \ in crop monitoring. These farms can serve as\nliving examples to showcase the\
    \ effectiveness and economic viability of IoT solutions,\nencouraging other farmers\
    \ to adopt similar practices.\n7.\nPolicy and regulatory frameworks: Develop supportive\
    \ policies and regulatory frame-\nworks that facilitate the adoption and integration\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture.\nThis can include standards for data privacy\
    \ and security, streamlined approval pro-\ncesses for IoT devices, and policies\
    \ promoting open data sharing for research and\ninnovation.\nBy implementing these\
    \ recommendations, stakeholders can contribute to the broader\nadoption of IoT\
    \ technologies in crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, ultimately leading to\n\
    improved agricultural practices, enhanced productivity, and sustainable farming\
    \ systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.A.R., A.J., A.H., M.U.,\

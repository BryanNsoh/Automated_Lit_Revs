    The surge in global population is compelling a shift toward smart agriculture
    practices. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources, limited availability
    of arable land, increase in unpredictable weather conditions makes food security
    a major concern for most countries. As a result, the use of Internet of Things
    (IoT) and data analytics (DA) are employed to enhance the operational efficiency
    and productivity in the agriculture sector. There is a paradigm shift from use
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) as a major driver of smart agriculture to the
    use of IoT and DA. The IoT integrates several existing technologies, such as WSN,
    radio frequency identification, cloud computing, middleware systems, and end-user
    applications. In this paper, several benefits and challenges of IoT have been
    identified. We present the IoT ecosystem and how the combination of IoT and DA
    is enabling smart agriculture. Furthermore, we provide future trends and opportunities
    which are categorized into technological innovations, application scenarios, business,
    and marketability. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 5,

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has found its application in several
    areas, such as connected industry, smart-city [1], [2], smart-home [3] smart-energy,
    connected car [4], smart-agriculture [5], connected building and campus [6], health
    care [7], logistics [8], among other domains. IoT aims to integrate the physical
    world with the virtual world by using the Internet as the medium to communicate
    and exchange information [9]. IoT has been defined as a system of interrelated
    computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people
    that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over
    a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. A
    key area of interest in this paper is the application of IoT in agriculture. The
    world population is estimated to be about 9.7 billion in 2050, as such there will
    be great demand for food. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources,
    arable land, unpredictable weather conditions make food security a major concern
    for most countries. The world is turning to the use of IoT combined with data
    analytics (DA) to meet the world’s food demands in the coming years [10]. It is
    predicted that IoT device installations in the agriculture sector will increase
    from 30 million in 2015 to 75 million by 2020. The use of IoT and DA will enable
    smart agriculture which is expected to deliver high operational efficiency and
    high yield [11], [12]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    Outline Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: With the
    deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional agriculture,
    the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture, has come.
    Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation.
    However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development of
    agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three typical
    development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture,
    and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications
    are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications,
    6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving,
    blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management,
    physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and
    discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed
    and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information
    technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment
    as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based
    on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that
    agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies
    (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management
    system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
    security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research
    directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica

    Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry in the world,
    and it plays an important role in social stability and economic development [1].
    Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion and the limited
    grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number of studies on smart
    agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both the improvement in
    productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress of science and
    technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is used to help readers
    understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture development
    (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the traditional
    agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human and animal
    resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of operation.
    • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century), the
    main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era of
    high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the main
    issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart agriculture
    (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is mainly marked
    by the use of modern information technology to both serve agriculture and develop
    it intelligently. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained

    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related

    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks; Internet of Things; precision agriculture; smart farming;\ncommunication\
    \ technologies; Cloud Computing\n1. Introduction\nPresently, the digital transformation\
    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\
    \ literature.\nTable 4. Smart farming routing protocols.\nRouting Protocols\n\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    \ are helping to make water management smarter\nand optimizing consumption in\
    \ the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology\nof sensor\
    \ nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efﬁcient components, such as\
    \ water level,\nsoil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally,\
    \ to guarantee good performance\nof the system, the used transmission module is\
    \ based on LoRa LPWAN technology. The design of the\nmain circuit board of the\
    \ system is optimized by combining two layers and implementing software\noptimization.\
    \ The overall sensor network is developed and tested in the research lab, and\
    \ real farms\ncan be controlled by users manually or automatically using the mobile\
    \ application. Experimental\nresults are produced by testing sensor and communication\
    \ link effectiveness, and are subsequently\nvalidated in the ﬁeld through a one-week\
    \ measurement campaign.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); water management;\
    \ smart agriculture; LoRa; LPWAN; sensor\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) technology, which is known as the center of the Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ has continuously grown in recent years. An advantage of WSNs is their ability\
    \ to easily\ndeﬁne a network of devices that can be communicated with and gathered\
    \ from a monitored ﬁeld\nthrough communication links since the information is\
    \ sent through multiple nodes with a gateway and\nconnected to other networks\
    \ like wireless Ethernet. Many researchers have applied WSNs to different\nresearch\
    \ areas, such as environmental monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, smart cities,\
    \ smart education,\nhealthcare, agricultural control, water quality monitoring,\
    \ military uses, and asset management [1–9].\nAccordingly, WSNs are suitable for\
    \ multiple applications. The long range (LoRa) LPWAN is one\nnovel IoT communication\
    \ technology with an excellent capacity for development that is applied in\nmany\
    \ ﬁelds. The beneﬁts of this technology can be attributed to its capabilities\
    \ of ultra-long-distance\ncommunication, low power consumption, and ease of deployment,\
    \ among others.\nIn agriculture, environmental monitoring is required to control\
    \ speciﬁc plant conditions.\nBy collecting approximate values of available data\
    \ and making more accurate estimates, a WSN\ncan be used to achieve this task.\
    \ In addition, many agriculture researchers apply WSNs to monitor\nenvironmental\
    \ criteria [2–6]. In addition to standard environmental conditions such as temperature,\n\

    \ such as the ability to control the water level or temperature level are\nthe\
    \ subject of research in an agricultural environment [10].\nWater management and\
    \ optimal water supply have become popular topics in the ﬁeld of smart\nagriculture\
    \ and are being studied and developed by many researchers. Over the years, prominent\n\
    researchers in the ﬁeld of smart agriculture have written many survey articles\
    \ which introduce the\nresearch methodology for various communication technologies\
    \ that control resources efﬁciently based\non IoT technology [11–13]. We summarize\
    \ and compare our model with the existing literature in\nTable 1. In Vietnam,\
    \ agricultural production has transformed the country’s socioeconomic status\n\
    by alleviating national food insecurity, reducing poverty, fostering agrarian\
    \ exports, and providing\nlivelihoods to nearly half of the labor force nationwide.\
    \ These are just some examples, since WSN is\nactively applied to various functions\
    \ such as smart cities, waste management, and waste collection\nwith LoRaWan technology\
    \ [14–16].\nTable 1. A comparisons of our model with existing literature.\nModel\n\

    \ work on WSN in smart\nagriculture, clariﬁcations on issues of water management,\
    \ and essential tasks to be completed. Section 3\npresents details of the architecture\
    \ of the IoT proposed system. Section 4 presents the operational tests\ncomposed\
    \ of two different tasks, while Section 5 discusses the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of our\npolicy. Finally, some concluding observations and a way forward are\
    \ offered in Section 6.\n2. Smart Agriculture and Related Works\nAs it possesses\
    \ the advantage of critical natural resources, Vietnam is an agricultural country\
    \ that\nis growing very quickly. Agriculture plays an essential role in the Vietnamese\
    \ economy and contributes\nto the country’s economic development currently and\
    \ in the future. Agriculture is one of the critical\nindustrial sectors of Vietnam,\
    \ and economic growth depends heavily on agriculture. The population of\nVietnam\
    \ will rise to reach 100 million people by 2020, while the demand for agricultural\
    \ products such\nas food crops (e.g., sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, and corn)\
    \ rice, coffee, pepper, cashew nut, rubber,\ntea, fruit, and vegetables continues\
    \ to increase dramatically. Combined with the effects of climate\nchange, these\
    \ demands place even more strain upon land, water, energy, and other resources\
    \ that are\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n3 of 22\nalready inﬂuenced. Several\
    \ smart solutions can be co-optimized and scaled up to improve yields and\nmeet\
    \ growing food production demands while transporting power and water resources\
    \ efﬁciently [17].\nMany articles depict the close relationship between smart\
    \ agriculture and IoT/WSN.\nResearchers focus on how this high-tech improvement\
    \ can be employed to develop effective smart\nsystems and data transmission [8,18].\n\
    The authors of [18] present a SmartFarmNet framework, based on the IoT platform\
    \ that can\nautomate the collection of environmental, fertilizer, soil, and irrigation\
    \ data; automatically correlate\nthat data and evaluate product performance; and\
    \ calculate product estimates and suggest speciﬁc\nproducts for any particular\
    \ farm. Importantly, IoT devices can be integrated into this platform as\nsensors,\
    \ cameras, and weather stations. Produced data can then be saved in the cloud\
    \ to enable\nperformance analysis and and recommendations.\nWith the help of IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4, which is a suite of high-level communication technology, artiﬁcial\n\
    intelligence, and decision support technology, the authors of [19] have developed\
    \ research on the\nagricultural application of IoT technology to monitor real-time\
    \ moisture and nutrients of citrus, along\nwith an analysis of the combination\
    \ of fertilizer support systems and irrigation. However, this research\nhas weaknesses,\
    \ which include system complexity and high costs. The authors of [20] also present\n\
    a narrow-band radio channel model whereby the communication link transfers under\
    \ near-ground\nrequirements for a smart agriculture platform.\nThe solution presented\
    \ in [21] was developed by implementing machine learning applications\non agriculture\
    \ datasets for smart farm improvement. By employing and comparing numerous\nmachine\
    \ learning methods to recommend the best solution, this system enabled the investigation\n\
    and deployment of useful jobs, varying from crop yield forecasting to missing\
    \ or incorrect sensor\ndata reconstruction. However, the only reasonable application\
    \ for this scenario is smart agriculture,\nsince three different resources are\
    \ available: the CRN scientiﬁc dataset, Istat statistical dataset, and the\nIoT\
    \ sensor manufacturing dataset.\nMany researchers and developers have chosen microcontroller\
    \ boards (e.g., Arduino boards) or\nRaspberry Pi for IoT applications. These allow\
    \ real-time monitoring, collection, data management,\nsecurity, and remote control\
    \ functions using the mobile app because of the suitable platforms available\n\
    for Internet-connected sensor buttons. This option is often challenging because\
    \ it entails a trade-off\nbetween cost, performance, and functionality for each\
    \ speciﬁc application project. Water management\ninvolves a valuable resource.\
    \ If an attacker controlled the system, entire crops could be destroyed\ndue to\
    \ altered irrigation levels. A denial of service (DoS) attack on sensors, irrigation\
    \ actuators,\nor distribution systems could affect system-wide operations. Changes\
    \ to sensor settings may also\nissue a warning that could cause networks or decision\
    \ producers to perform illegal actions and yield\nmonths of efforts and production\
    \ aims. If an attacker gains control of the actuators, irrigation and\nwater distribution\
    \ may be compromised and result in the incorrect irrigation of certain products.\n\
    Furthermore, eavesdropping may give criminals access to secret data about the\
    \ farm. They could\nremove productivity information and even manipulate the commodity\
    \ business, which represents an\neven more signiﬁcant threat. Self-governing vehicles,\
    \ drones, and engines utilized to collect images or\ncontrol manufacturing must\
    \ also be kept classiﬁed. An unauthorized node in the network can send\nincorrect\
    \ information about a crop. However, the authors only present the challenges to\
    \ security in\nsmart agriculture, and do not discuss how to overcome challenges\
    \ [22].\nA smart agriculture system was constructed to use low-power Bluetooth\
    \ and LPWAN\ncommunication technologies, including the wire-based communication\
    \ technology used in the existing\nfarm in [23]. This was combined with microcontrollers\
    \ such as an Arduino UNO board or Raspberry Pi\nboard. The administrator receives\
    \ data from sensor connections, and then stores the data, analyzes it,\nand provides\
    \ a user interface to monitor it. A related study [24] explains how an approach\
    \ to using IoT\nand cloud computing that incorporates development is helping to\
    \ quickly modernize agriculture and\nto realize smart solutions for agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, to solve problems regarding more practical issues\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n4 of 22\nrelated to farmers, sensors can be applied for use\
    \ in the IoT system. Furthermore, 2G and 3G wireless\nbroadband networks can be\
    \ used for communication between other components in the IoT system.\nSeveral\
    \ enabling technologies are adapted to present smart platform projects, which\
    \ are able\nto collect and manage data handling problems related to water management\
    \ in smart agriculture.\nFor example, the SWAMP project is a platform architecture\
    \ that includes a scenario-based development\nprocess for the obtained systems\
    \ in [25]. Moreover, the platform develops and assesses smart water\nmanagement\
    \ for precision irrigation in agriculture with a practical method based on four\
    \ pilots in\nBrazil, Italy, and Spain. The structure of SWAMP can be developed\
    \ for different solutions to deal\nwith the requirements of different contexts,\
    \ countries, climates, soils, and crops. Indeed, considerable\nﬂexibility is required\
    \ to adapt to a range of deployment conﬁgurations, including a diverse mix of\n\
    technologies. Unfortunately, for this platform, it is not possible to use without\
    \ the license and to do\nthis. The different IoT smart platforms presented in\
    \ [26] propose the use of cloud-based technology\nto manage the collection, analysis,\
    \ and forecast of agricultural environmental information in one\nuniversal system.\
    \ Besides the introduction of the platform, the author of the paper also presented\
    \ LoRa\ncommunication and applied it to the studied network, and although details\
    \ were not provided on the\nhardware used to do this. In summary, both studies\
    \ presented interesting suggestions and suitable\nplatforms for application to\
    \ smart agriculture.\nOther authors have focused on completing a systematic literature\
    \ review of IoT research and\ndeployments in protected agriculture over the past\
    \ ten years, in which they evaluate the contributions\nmade by various researchers\
    \ and organizations. Moreover, the structure of IoT is also detailed in\nprotected\
    \ agriculture, including the used platforms, modern wireless technologies, cloud\
    \ computing,\nmachine learning, big data, animal farming, hardware, software challenges,\
    \ and so on [27].\nAnother paper [28] proposes an IoT idea-based solution for\
    \ smart farming, where the authors\nproposed stack and discuss the current improvements.\n\
    They mainly focus on the IoT/M2M\ninteraction and explain the design and development\
    \ of a gateway that discusses the provided\nservices. Notably, in [29], the Web\
    \ of Things (WoT) was proposed as an idea to use environmental\nmonitoring and\
    \ enhance agricultural practices by supporting decision-making based on bio-data\n\
    collection. The paper brieﬂy presents the original design, which is a middleware\
    \ platform for IoT\nthat performs separation by understanding opportunistic networking\
    \ and computing operations.\nAccordingly, it is able to detect and control environmental\
    \ targets using web-based technologies.\nMeanwhile, the use of IoT for smart precision\
    \ agriculture for rural areas is proposed in [30]. In this\npaper, the authors\
    \ focus on a scalable network architecture for real-time monitoring of agriculture\
    \ in\nrural areas. A possible strategy is to optimize each element of the system\
    \ to reduce system latency\nup to a particular area. A solution [31] was proposed\
    \ by implementing a framework for managing,\ninvestigating, and sharing groundwater\
    \ data, with the use of sensors to gather data on groundwater\nlevels, pump sensors,\
    \ and weather conditions.\nIn [32], electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis is presented\
    \ as an enhanced monitoring approach for\nsubsurface radio wave propagation and\
    \ underground sensing applications in the ﬁeld of prediction\nagriculture. However,\
    \ this technology is challenging to implement in complex real environments,\n\
    which may delay system deployment. The prediction of the agriculture model presented\
    \ by [33]\noffers solution management capabilities by monitoring soil conditions\
    \ in real time using underground\nwireless sensors. Furthermore, the structure\
    \ used two types of communication links, above-ground\nand underground, for the\
    \ experiments. However, other challenges need to be solved, such as reducing\n\
    energy loss and promoting energy efﬁciency. These nodes should be able to adapt\
    \ to the soil moisture\nand temperature changes of the environment, among others.\n\
    More recently, the authors in [8] proposed an irrigation system that combines\
    \ IoT and data\nanalysis for the collection of environment data and control of\
    \ the farm via web and mobile applications.\nHowever, this article faced challenges\
    \ in controlling water in the farm. After analyzing state-of-the-art\nresearch\
    \ on water management and smart agriculture that applies IoT and related technology,\n\
    the following outcomes are drawn:\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n5 of 22\n\
    •\nMany popular systems and platforms can be used for water management in smart\
    \ agriculture,\nbut may be too expensive for the average farmer [28–31].\n•\n\
    The combination of multiple technologies in one system and the presence of limitations\
    \ leads to\ncomplexity when combining proprietary technologies. Moreover, many\
    \ factors affect the price\n(e.g., farm, hardware design, and guiding documentation),\
    \ although a basic package costs a\nminimum of $500 in [28–31].\n•\nAll IoT smart\
    \ agriculture solutions on the market are Most IoT smart agriculture products\
    \ are\npassive methods (i.e., manual). In some cases, they are connected to farm\
    \ monitoring devices to\nact smartly.\n•\nMany researchers have presented solutions\
    \ for smart agriculture systems. However, these\nmethods are restricted by the\
    \ design-embedded board and the inﬂexibility of devices, as it\nmay be necessary\
    \ to attach additional sensors or to control two or more farms with the same\n\
    mobile application.\nTherefore, we proposal a novel system to address the four\
    \ above points:\n1.\nThe standard IoT water management system is explained and\
    \ designed. It can connect to the\nInternet through LoRa communication both manually\
    \ and automatically with all hardware\ndesigns. The IoT box is designed to manage\
    \ the IoT devices and obtain data from the farms.\n2.\nA system is possible connected\
    \ the agriculture from farming based on rural areas efﬁciency\nto IoT system.\
    \ Additionally, the implemented system is a good alternative for analyzing the\n\
    communication between the gateway and nodes 1 and 2.\n3.\nOur smart watering system\
    \ receives real-time data input from sensors embedded in a farm tunnel\nand other\
    \ locations. The system then offers suggestions for watering schedules and capacity.\n\
    An advantage provided by the sensors, used for two farms, are the transmission\
    \ of an evaluation\nto the user’s mobile application, from where users can prepare\
    \ a watering plan for the farms.\n4.\nFinally, our smart watering system is scheduled\
    \ to a date and time which guarantees that the\nwater level falls below the threshold\
    \ in the tunnel farm. The system notiﬁes the user and switches\non the water pump\
    \ (manual or automatic) in time to water the plants.\n3. System Architecture\n\
    The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the real-time monitoring of\
    \ water management\nthat optimizes power consumption.\nAn additional target is\
    \ a cost-saving in smart agriculture.\nThe critical element that affects energy\
    \ dissipation in the sensor nodes is the transmitting module.\nAs a design operation,\
    \ it focuses on the structure of the sensor node and the meaning of the network\n\
    sensor architecture. Finally, the determination of effective data transfer technology\
    \ is geared towards\nimplementing an energy-efﬁcient sensor node. The details\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.1.\nHowever, most of the smart agriculture ﬁeld if\
    \ the data are the crucial importance in the node,\nwhere the users could be easily\
    \ chosen by operating more comfortable components. Therefore,\nthe micro-controller\
    \ must be selected to guarantee a suitable trade-off between energy efﬁciency\n\
    and complexity. Finally, elements must be selected to consider the optimal agreement\
    \ between\nmeasured data accuracy, expected energy to carry out that task, and\
    \ price, thus prioritizing the use of\nsensors. As a result, the power of the\
    \ sensors becomes an important factor for energy consumption\nand longevity. The\
    \ proposed IoT node in our system is constructed following these requirements.\n\
    First, the choice made regarding essential elements is a single-chip micro-controller\
    \ such as an\nATmega328/P or ATmega2560. A reasonable choice is to provide simple\
    \ open-source software to allow\nthe user to observe and boost their conﬁdence\
    \ in the programming. Second, it uses a lower number\nof clock cycles to execute\
    \ instructions than others—all of the sensors and the developed single-board\n\
    microcontroller, where all of the devices are integrated. Third, after reviewing\
    \ the start-of-the-art of\nthe relevant technology, the best option is the LoRa\
    \ technology, as it provides IoT connectivity over\nlarge areas by enabling data\
    \ transmission across an extended range. It uses very little power, is robust\n\
    in a rural area, and uses an overall network architecture that was developed in\
    \ a smart agriculture\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n6 of 22\nsituation.\
    \ Finally, low-cost and low-power sensors were selected to provide an excellent\
    \ balance\nbetween measurement accuracy and energy efﬁciency.\nOur paper introduces\
    \ a reliable, robust, cost-effective, and scalable smart agriculture solution\n\
    based on IoT technology. The architecture system is presented in Figure 1, which\
    \ presents three\nnode prototypes: the gateway, node 1 and sensor node 1, and\
    \ node 2. The ﬂow diagram shown in\nFigure 2 demonstrates how to manage data transmission\
    \ between the gateway, node 1, and node 2 of\nour system.\n•\nThe gateway performs\
    \ the core functions of data collection from the nodes via LoRa, and then\nsends\
    \ data to the cloud, via the WiFi ESP82666 module, and to the mobile application.\
    \ Moreover,\nusers can also control the node throughout the gateway with the use\
    \ of the mobile app.\n•\nNode 1 and sensor node 1 are designed for this case,\
    \ as we assumed that the water pump machine\nis far from the sensor location.\n\
    •\nNode 2 was designed for orchard conditioners, with a topographic condition\
    \ suitable for installing\npumps directly in the farm without separating the sensor\
    \ block.\nFarm 1\nFarm 2\nGateWay\nNode 1\nSensor node 1\nNode 2\nFigure 1. Block\

    this power has to convert toward the expected form with normal voltage range for\
    \ storing power\nsupply to different kinds of devices in the IoT proposed node.\
    \ Based on the requirement of the\npower IoT system that the microcontroller and\
    \ the communication module need 5 V and 3.3 V for\nthe powering system with receive\
    \ node, respectively. It is necessary to include voltage regulators\ninside the\
    \ node. For that reason, two voltage regulators employ a 5 V regulator that powers\
    \ sensors of\nFigures 3–5 and a 3.3 V one which powers the powering system for\

    \ is combined of a LoRa module and WiFi ESP8266 module, and ATmega2560. Figure\

    \ how all device elements are\nconnected: the LoRa transmission module, WiFi ESP8266\
    \ module, ATmega2560, and power system for\nGateway. Figures 6 and 7a show the\
    \ Electronic schematic and Gateway’s prototype, which includes\nthe sub-section\
    \ mentioned as below:\n3.2.1. Transmitter Module\nAs mentioned previously, the\
    \ transmitter module performs a vital concern in energy consumption\noptimization.\
    \ Hence, it has to be precisely selected and prospered. The IoT proposed node\
    \ is proposed\nto be used outside and spread over a rural area. Since radio communication\
    \ link solutions must be\nexplored, this needs to be taken into account. In fact,\
    \ it is unthinkable for something like this to have\na wirework connection (e.g.,\
    \ LAN) in large quantities at each node. An IoT application has many\ncommunication\
    \ networks where the sensor system is proposed. These systems are working based\
    \ on\nvarious radio technologies. Table 2 shows a measurement of the available\
    \ technologies, along with\ntheir essential features. The vital functions such\
    \ as area, consumption, and availability are accentuated\nin this table because\
    \ they are crucial parts for developing the device. After reviewing the technical\n\
    aspects as presented in this paper, the selection for data transmission technology\

    \ 6. Electronic schematic of the Gateway and Node 1.\nConsidering all of these\
    \ previous technologies, there are mean ﬂexible options for the achievement\n\
    of IoT nodes. The most signiﬁcant selection has to be carefully studied as it\
    \ is easy to change\nthe hardware, implementation, and long-lasting quality over\
    \ time. The one recommended in our\narticle, which is a solution for the real-time\
    \ monitoring of controlling the level of water and resulting\nhypothesis, shows\
    \ as:\n•\nThe IoT node system is expected to be deployed for two nodes with the\
    \ distance between two\nnodes being a few km with complex terrain in rural areas.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of the system needs\nto reduce to the lowest level possible,\
    \ and the support services need to be optimized:\n•\nThe coverage of our system\
    \ to around tens of km2;\n•\nThe lower power consumption is composed possibly\
    \ for an adaptive data rate and changes\nthe output bit rate. Moreover, it depends\
    \ on payload combined with chirp spread spectrum\ntechnology that effectively\
    \ gives processing gain. In addition, LoRa Technology can easily plug\ninto existing\
    \ infrastructure and enables low-cost battery-operated IoT applications.\nAfter\
    \ reviewing these simple highlights, it can deﬁne the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\
    \ the leading\nfour communication networks released for the previously outlined:\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n10 of 22\n(a) Gateway\n(b) Node 1\nFigure\
    \ 7. Prototype of the gateway and Node 1.\n•\nLocal Area Networks (LAN): The ad\
    \ hoc’s area coverage is signiﬁcantly more than other carrier\nnetwork technologies.\
    \ However, it still has some disadvantages. Applying the radio technology\nnetwork\
    \ for our system: for instance, WiFi or BLE technology set up, requires a signiﬁcant\
    \ number\nof nodes for the system. It will noticeably change the overall cost\
    \ of the deployed infrastructure.\nA different choice might be to implement a\
    \ ZigBee network or BLE technology. Because the system\nis not energy efﬁcient,\
    \ and admits a signiﬁcant decrease in the power consumption of the\nend device\
    \ nodes, this means that, although their current absorption levels are relatively\
    \ low\n(40 mA [35]), their life expectancy provided by batteries is in some order.\n\
    •\nLow Power Consumption (LPWAN): The authors in [36] proposed characterizing\
    \ great Area\nNetworks LPWAN solutions as their more extensive transmission range\
    \ allows for the\nestablishment of a star or multi-star network with some APs.\
    \ Allowing the sensor node to\nuse the chief duty-cycling policies allows for\
    \ turning off buttons for long periods. Finally, the\nprice of this technology\
    \ is meager when agreeing to use them in large quantities at no extra charge\n\
    as in the situation of ISP co-operation.\n•\nGlobal Area Networks (GAN): The global\
    \ network is the most simple solution to deploy because\nit does not need access\
    \ points or speciﬁc infrastructure implementations. Unfortunately, it has\nmany\
    \ other essential features, the ﬁrst being the price: 3G technologies; still,\
    \ the lowest of different\ntechniques is always more expensive than other solutions.\
    \ Furthermore, SIM is used, so\nthey need subscription payments when preparing\
    \ to deploy many of nodes and become\ninsigniﬁcant. Additionally, the energy consumption\
    \ needs to take into consideration that the\naverage modern consumption of the\
    \ third-generation mobile cellular system is many times higher\nthan that of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [37]. Alternatively, a low-power wide-area network module [38]\n\
    may be considered; however, obtaining it is unsuitable for applications with low\
    \ energy use.\nFinally, in the rural areas, some ISP cannot support the Internet\
    \ service for the users.\n•\nNarrowband-Internet of Things:\nNB-IoT is the novel\
    \ technology with a short form of\nNarrowband-Internet of Things and speciﬁed\
    \ in LTE Release-13 [39]. It is developed to meet\nthe requirements of LPWA (Low-Power\
    \ Wide-Area) networks. NB-IoT has a wide variety of\napplications for many ﬁelds\
    \ such as personal, technology and industrial. The applications are\nwearables,\
    \ smart bicycles, event detectors, smart garbage bins, smart metering, smart agriculture,\n\
    and logistics tracking. Mainly, low power and long-range are the absolute essentials\
    \ for IoT\n(Internet of Things), which is a signiﬁcant concern with mainstream\
    \ cellular technologies.\nThe other advantages of the NB-IoT are scalability,\
    \ quality of service and safety related to\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n\
    11 of 22\nunlicensed LPWA networks and design, including the secure connections\
    \ between small energy\ndevices and a gateway.\nTable 3. Technical speciﬁcations\

    UART\n3.2.2. ATmega2560 Microcontroller\nIn this research, the nodes communicate\
    \ with each other via the UART interface. At the gateway,\nit is necessary to\
    \ use two UARTs (the ﬁrst one communicates with the ESP8266 module, and the other\n\
    one is used to communicate with two nodes. In Node 1, it is also necessary for\
    \ two UART interfaces to\ncollect data from the nodes and the gateway, since the\
    \ ATmega2560 is a reasonable choice [40].\n3.2.3. WiFi ESP8266 Module\nThe WiFi\
    \ ESP8266 module from [41–43] is the best choice because the ESP8266 is very ﬂexible\
    \ in\ndata transfer between devices and mobile applications, easy to integrate\
    \ into advanced projects, and\nadaptable within the Arduino embedded development\
    \ environment.\n3.3. Node 1 and Sensor Node 1\nThe same as in gateway, in this\
    \ node, an AC supply has to be converted towards the demanded\nform with the required\
    \ voltage range for storing power supply to various types of devices. We are\n\
    suggesting that the micro-controller and the transmission module need 5 V for\
    \ the powering system\nwith a receive node each, and it is necessary to incorporate\
    \ voltage regulators inside the node. Therefore,\ntwo voltage regulators use 5\
    \ V and 3.3 V regulators, which power the sensors in Figure 4 and the\npowering\
    \ system for the receiver node.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of Node 1, which\
    \ designs the case. It assumes that the water\npump is placed far away from the\
    \ sensor location since there is a sensor node to collect the data for\nNode 1.\
    \ Node 1 receives the data from sensor Node 1. Based on the sensor values, we\
    \ can deﬁne the\nvalue from the application and the sensors located at Node 1.\
    \ Moreover, in this node, there are two\nprimary sensors, which are the pump temperature\
    \ sensor and water level sensor. LoRa module on\nNode 1 communicates to the Gateway.\
    \ We also use RF HC12, a short-range wireless data transmission\nmodule whose\
    \ primary function is to receive data from sensor Node 1 transmitted to Node 1.\
    \ RFID\nperforms the central feature of controlling the pump directly at Node\
    \ 1 to increase the security of the\nsystem, and LCD is designed to display the\
    \ data of Node 1. Sensor Node 1 in Figure 5 shows the\nﬂowchart of details as\
    \ the node power is an external AC–DC converter with 7 V that gives sufﬁcient\n\
    current to power all the components.\nSection 3.3.1 illustrates the details of\
    \ the ATmega328 microcontroller and the sensors connected in\nFigure 8 for Node\

    \ Node 2.\n3.3.1. ATmega328 Microcontroller\nAll of those sensors require the\
    \ involvement of a micro-controller system to perform:\nthis component must be\
    \ implemented to trade off the price, power consumption, and performance\nenergy\
    \ results. According to most elements of low power, modern micro-controllers use\
    \ for a several\nmA, the effects of this element for the typical power consumption\
    \ of the node can be negligible,\nthus providing a higher level of independence\
    \ [43].\nBased on the principle diagram of Gateway and Node 1, it seems that both\
    \ have many common\npoints, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The best selection\
    \ in this study for the integrated design\nfor both Gateway and Node 1 is signiﬁcant.\
    \ Because they save on the costs of printed circuitry, achieve\nfaster circuit\
    \ machining, and quickly ﬁx hardware errors. Figure 6 shows the schematic of an\
    \ actuator\nGateway and Node 1, which contains: an AC–DC converter, ATmega2560,\
    \ LoRa transmission, RFID,\nLCD, and all the sensors. Note that, for the sake\
    \ of simplicity, we proposed all of the integrated circuits\ndepicted in the schematic.\
    \ After that, the printed circuit boards Gateway and Node 1 are designed\nwith\
    \ two layers of wires to make wiring more convenient and help optimize the circuit\
    \ as much as\npossible. The components are arranged in blocks with separate functions,\
    \ making it easier and more\nconvenient to check for errors.\nThe printed circuit\
    \ of Gateway and Node 1 is designed with:\n•\n62 components in which there are\
    \ 59 glued components and three pin components.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019,\
    \ 8, 45\n13 of 22\n•\nThe total number of different lines is 49 lines.\n•\nThere\
    \ are three different line sizes of 80 mils, 25, and 10 mils following different\
    \ wiring\nrequirements.\n•\nLine rules: do not cut wires, report faulty components\
    \ and the minimum distance between wires\nis 10 mm.\n•\nSize: 74.193 × 87.503\
    \ mm.\nFigure 7b shows the overall prototype of Node 1. Node 1 powers with a 5V\
    \ AC–DC converter that\nstores full current energy to control all the components\
    \ and the relay module. Furthermore, the LoRa\nmodule is not put close to the\
    \ converter because it generated the electrical noise and the interference of\n\
    communication links.\nWith the various parameters to be observed in our system,\
    \ in most cases, temperature,\ntemperature–humidity, soil moisture, rain, and\
    \ water level are measured.\n•\nTemperature sensor: DS18B20, [44], the popular\
    \ solution for temperature control in smart\nagriculture systems is the application\
    \ of standard digital sensors, for instance, DS18B20 integrated\ncircuits in this\
    \ research.\n•\nTemperature-humidity sensor: DHT22 [45] is a current sensor, which\
    \ combines the temperature\nand humidity sensor; it provides a wider temperature\
    \ range and better accuracy. In particular,\nit has low consumption and is better\
    \ for most smart farming systems.\n•\nSoil moisture sensor: SKU:SEN0193 [46],\
    \ this soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture levels\nby capacitive sensing\
    \ rather than resistive sensing like other sensors on the market. It is made of\n\
    corrosion-resistant material, which provides a good solution for the user. Moreover,\
    \ the sensor is\nsimple to use—an analog sensor that works at a low voltage.\n\
    •\nRain sensor: LM393, this is an analog sensor that operates at a low voltage,\
    \ and the current sensor\nis for easily detecting rain [47].\n•\nWater level and\
    \ temperature pump: LM393 [48]; this is an analog sensor when the water level\n\
    reaches below the threshold in the tunnel farm and checks the sensors. Our system\
    \ communicates\nto the user and establishes a water pump to its switch on the\
    \ state for sufﬁcient watering of plants\nthroughout a mobile application.\nFigure\
    \ 9 shows the sensor Node 1 electronic schematic, and how total hardware elements\
    \ are\nattached: microcontroller, power, and IC circuit. DS 1307 is used to read\
    \ the real-time with the high\naccuracy, LoRa module transfer data via a serial\
    \ connection, and the module connection is used to\nconnect RF HC12, RFID RC522,\
    \ LCD, sensors, pump, and ATmega2560. Figure 10a shows an actual\nmodel of sensor\
    \ Node 1.\nBesides the hardware, before being discussed, sensor Node 1 needs an\
    \ additional device to\noperate. The general important thing is the power subsystem.\
    \ In the case of the nodes, it was selected\nto power the nodes. Note that, in\
    \ this situation, we also can be used by the power supply unit, which\nis based\
    \ on a 12 W solar panel. The solar panel is linked to the solar charge controller,\
    \ where a solar\ncharge controller manages the power going into the battery.\n\

    \ Tests\nThe proposed smart agriculture system is evaluated using two different\
    \ scenarios in Vietnam:\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the sensors for the\
    \ analysis of temperature, solid humidity in\na research lab; and conﬁrming data\
    \ transmission by using the LoRa channel over a large area\nand distance.\n4.1.\
    \ Tests on the Sensors of the IoT\nThe ﬁrst scenario was set up in the Department\
    \ of Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering of Ton Duc Thang University,\
    \ Vietnam, where the sensing infrastructure was evaluated.\nThe performance of\
    \ the system was tested using a subset of nodes with the Arduino. These sensors\n\
    were used because the presence of other components would not affect the accuracy\
    \ of the measurement.\nIn addition, since the circuit board was furnished with\
    \ the equivalent microcontroller used in the node,\nthis circuit board was chosen\
    \ for speciﬁc tests due to its ease of use, as fast prototyping is required\n\
    and because it can exploit the equivalent microprogramming of an IoT button. Experiments\
    \ were\nperformed using the gate, button 1, and sensor button 1 and button 2 with\
    \ LoRa integrated with\nembedded sensors. An easy-to-read LCD screen was added\
    \ to the mainboard, where it displayed\nthe temperature and humidity measured\
    \ by the sensor as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Furthermore,\nthe accuracy of sensor\
    \ measurements was displayed and conﬁrmed on the LCD screen. Finally,\nsensors\
    \ were calibrated before the test to guarantee the accuracy of data, and to help\
    \ users to eliminate\ndifﬁculties during the setup process the system.\nJ. Sens.\

    sensors on the right.\n4.2. Test on Data Transmission through the LoRa Channel\n\
    In the second scenario, the effectiveness of the LoRa technology for the placement\
    \ of a farm\nmonitoring infrastructure was investigated by examining data transmission\
    \ distances in two real\nfarms as shown in Figure 13. For this purpose, a model\
    \ system infrastructure was set up in the Cho\nLach district, Ben Tre province,\
    \ Vietnam, to demonstrate the usability of an individual star topology\nnetwork\
    \ covering an entirely rural area. The model infrastructure was composed using\
    \ a gateway node\nproduced by a LoRa E32-TTL-1W module connected to a mobile application,\
    \ and by two sensor nodes.\nThe transmission modules were set up with three critical\
    \ measures: the symbol rate of information,\nthe bandwidth of the channel, and\
    \ the information rate were set according to the datasheet provided\nby the manufacturer\
    \ in order to obtain the highest sensitivity.\nBased on the sensor network structure\
    \ presented in the previous sections, the transmission\nranges were checked by\
    \ placing the gateway in the farm. The nodes were located in various areas:\n\
    node 1 covered 2000 m2 at a distance of 700 m from the gateway, while node 2 covered\
    \ 1000 m2 at a\ndistance of 500 m from the gateway. These positions were ﬁxed\
    \ and it was veriﬁed that the actual\ndata was correctly received. Subsequently,\
    \ data were collected from nodes 1 and 2 and sent to the\ngateway during the following\
    \ seven days of the same month, during which 24-h measurements were\nmade. In\
    \ this way, the performance of the system was tested. Figures 14 and 15 show the\
    \ results\nof the two nodes, which present the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\
    \ It can be observed\nthat, based on the threshold of these values, the system\
    \ could automatically switch on the water for\nthe farm. The experimental results\
    \ indicate that the application of a quick procedure for effective\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n17 of 22\nresolution building certainly helps to enhance\
    \ the outcomes of a sensor-based system. Not only does a\nsmart strategy improve\
    \ the performance of IoT-based and sensor-based systems, but the efﬁciency of\n\
    these systems can be increased with the smarter and more accurate choices made\
    \ by such intelligent\nsystems. Our experimental results highlight the procedure\
    \ used by the smart irrigation system to\nsave water in tunnel farming, thus achieving\
    \ higher productivity and the ability to ﬂexibly manage\nthe farm.\nFigure 13.\

    \ humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried out\
    \ on Node 1 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\nData transmission\
    \ is also a crucial issue in the IoT smart system in checking the effect of packet\
    \ loss.\nData transmission is tested by exploiting a model created by internal\
    \ sensors. Node 1, Node 2, and the\ngateway are connected through a LoRa module\
    \ in the prototype as described in Section 4.1. Packages\nare lost from all test\
    \ nodes during transmission. Although packet loss was observed whenever the\n\
    model moved between a test place, this is not a problem because the nodes are\
    \ expected to remain\nat the growing farms in the studied area. Therefore, LoRa\
    \ technology is proven to be effective when\ndeployed in rural areas, without\
    \ having to turn on acceleration mode on the transfer module shown\nin Figure\
    \ 13.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n18 of 22\nFigure 15. Collected soil\
    \ moisture, humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried\

    The smart agriculture system based on an IoT application has the following advantages\
    \ compared\nto the previous approaches:\n•\nThe system can be used to manage two\
    \ or more independent farms on the same mobile application,\nwhich may have different\
    \ growth schedules. The aim of this research was to use devices of the\nIoT system\
    \ with lower prices that are easy to obtain.\n•\nRemoving the need for WiFi on\
    \ the farm with the application of LoRa technology helps to save\nenergy, lower\
    \ costs, improve efﬁciency, and facilitate excellent communication between the\
    \ farm\nand gateway.\n•\nControl data are saved to the system memory to prevent\
    \ power outages that result in data loss.\nFurthermore, the multitude of control\
    \ modes makes it easier for users to manipulate the farm.\n•\nReal-time updates\
    \ are available directly from the Internet in order to enable the system to run\n\
    more accurately.\n•\nA lost WiFi connection can be detected and communicated to\
    \ users for timely processing.\n•\nMany different sensors are integrated to collect\
    \ information related to tree care in order to improve\ncrop productivity. Our\
    \ strategy studies ﬁve parameters: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level.\n•\nNone of the previously mentioned approaches discuss\
    \ and investigate the effect of energy\nconsumption in smart irrigation systems.\
    \ Furthermore, other methods frequently rely on soil\nmoisture to determine the\
    \ water needs of plants.\n•\nThe results of the test and the measurement of our\
    \ smart watering system approach the standard\nwatering procedure as a product\
    \ of high-tech application. It has an economic efﬁciency that is at\nleast 30%\
    \ higher than the used technology.\nIn addition to the advantages presented above,\
    \ our research also has disadvantages, which need\nto be overcome before widespread\
    \ application. For instance, the ESP8266 module is a mid-range\nmodule without\
    \ a high stability, while the system can lose an Internet connection and depends\
    \ on the\nBlynk application.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a solution using\
    \ LoRa module transmission for a low-cost and effective smart\nagriculture system\
    \ for use in Vietnam, which is designed and implemented to control environmental\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n19 of 22\nfactors in agriculture. It is less\
    \ expensive than other solutions with a similar accuracy. The system can\ncontinuously\
    \ observe the measured values and communicate them to users via a network and\
    \ mobile\napplication. Furthermore, the system can send alarms to users and activate\
    \ reduction devices. The IoT\nnode was tested in two separate cases in Cho Lach\
    \ district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam, and was used\nto measure distinct values\
    \ such as moisture, humidity, and temperature. Finally, experiments were\nperformed\
    \ to determine if the embedded electronics and the wireless communication module\
    \ might\ninﬂuence the collected values; there were no signs of interference. In\
    \ summary, the results conﬁrm\nthat the system provides the optimal solution to\
    \ users of smart agricultural control for farmers in\nVietnam. The availability\
    \ of real-time data enables quick use and management at all times from all\nplaces.\
    \ However, when IoT nodes are placed in various places, they generate huge quantities\
    \ of data.\nIn this case, our system requires time to store and analyze data before\
    \ ﬁnding the best solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-Y.N.,\

    \x06\a\nAbstract: Data collection is one of the main operations performed in Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks\n(WSNs). Even if several interesting approaches on data collection\
    \ have been proposed during the\nlast decade, it remains a research focus in full\
    \ swing with a number of important challenges. Indeed,\nthe continuous reduction\
    \ in sensor size and cost, the variety of sensors available on the market,\nand\
    \ the tremendous advances in wireless communication technology have potentially\
    \ broadened\nthe impact of WSNs. The range of application of WSNs now extends\
    \ from health to the military\nﬁeld through home automation, environmental monitoring\
    \ and tracking, as well as other areas of\nhuman activity. Moreover, the expansion\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in an important\namount of heterogeneous\
    \ data that are produced at an exponential rate. Furthermore, these data are\n\
    of interest to both industry and in research. This fact makes their collection\
    \ and analysis imperative\nfor many purposes. In view of the characteristics of\
    \ these data, we believe that very large-scale and\nheterogeneous WSNs can be\
    \ very useful for collecting and processing these Big Data. However,\nthe scaling\
    \ up of WSNs presents several challenges that are of interest in both network\
    \ architecture\nto be proposed, and the design of data-routing protocols. This\
    \ paper reviews the background and\nstate of the art of Big Data collection in\
    \ Large-Scale WSNs (LS-WSNs), compares and discusses on\nchallenges of Big Data\
    \ collection in LS-WSNs, and proposes possible directions for the future.\nKeywords:\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks; data collection; Big Data; IoT\n1. Introduction\n\
    1.1. Background\nAccording to the United Nations, the world’s population is estimated\
    \ at 7.6 billion in 2018.\nIn addition, more than 2 billion people are regularly\
    \ connected to the Internet and roughly 5 billion of\nthe world’s population use\
    \ various kinds of connected objects. During the last decade, the amount\nof global\
    \ generated data has exploded with the increasing use of connected objects, and\
    \ especially\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), which continuously produces most heterogeneous\
    \ data. Cisco reported\nthat, by the end of 2019, the IoT will annually generate\
    \ more than 500 zettabytes of structured and\nunstructured data, and that number\
    \ is expected to exponentially grow [1]. Moreover, a number of\nindustries’ forecasts\
    \ are projecting 50 billion connected devices to the Internet by 2020 [2].\nFurthermore,\
    \ in recent years, with the expansion of the IoT and recent technological advancements,\n\
    a growing number of intelligent information-aware devices, such as sensors, actuators,\
    \ smartphones,\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474; doi:10.3390/s18124474\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 4474\n2 of 34\nsmart wristbands, tablets, devices based on readers’\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) and\nMachine-to-Machine (M2M), have led\
    \ to the exponential growth of generated-data volume [3–9].\nIn general, these\
    \ devices, and especially sensors, are used both in industry and research to collect\n\
    data in various application contexts, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring,\
    \ and precision\nagriculture [10]. The signiﬁcant advance in research and engineering\
    \ has introduced novel architectures\nfor data acquisition, transmission, large-scale\
    \ data storage, and processing. Moreover, the emerging\nBig Data paradigm, mainly\
    \ used to describe massive data, is experiencing renewed interest in both the\n\
    industrial and scientiﬁc world [11]. A number of domains, such as the IoT, artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence, and\ndata science, are beneﬁting from digital transformation allowed\
    \ by Big Data.\nMoreover, Internet-based companies, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook,\
    \ and Amazon, motivate\nthe current thrust of Big Data research, where real-time\
    \ data originating from human sources, which\ninclude e-mails, online shopping\
    \ history, as well as tweets, are used in large-scale data mining and\nfor data\
    \ analysis to produce a number of value-added services [12]. Fundamentally, Big\
    \ Data may be\nseen as a very large number of structured, semistructured, and\
    \ unstructured data of a wide variety\nof data types that is generated with high\
    \ velocity and has the potential to help us in understanding\nhidden information\
    \ in datasets, and also in managing and organizing these datasets [13]. Usually,\n\
    the Big Data process relies on four steps: data generation, acquisition, storage,\
    \ and analysis. Contrary\nto traditional data, Big Data need more real-time analysis\
    \ given the fact that they include massive\namounts of unstructured data of various\
    \ types.\nNowadays, IoT devices are commonly used in a large spectrum of critical\
    \ application domains,\nincluding eHealth, smart environments, smart cities, smart\
    \ building, as well as precision agriculture.\nThe massive data collection enabled\
    \ by IoT technology, leads to the emergence of a huge number of\nsensor-based\
    \ applications. Given the virtual abstraction of smart objects enabled by IoT\
    \ technology,\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become the most commonly used\
    \ IoT-based platforms for\ndata collection [14]. Therefore, WSNs are known to\
    \ be a fundamental component that allowed the\ndevelopment of the IoT system.\
    \ In such networks, a large number of sensors are deployed in the order\nof thousands,\
    \ collaborating to collect and transfer information to the base station [15,16].\n\
    Increasingly, there is a growing trend towards large-scale sensor networks for\
    \ data collection.\nAlthough they represent a new generation of sensor networks,\
    \ their use is subjected to many constraints,\nincluding adaptability with existing\
    \ methods for network scaling. Several important challenges need\nto be addressed\
    \ in order to allow a network to effectively play its role. Among these challenges,\
    \ we can\nmention the optimal deployment of sinks, the minimization of sensors’\
    \ energy consumption, as well as\ntheir lifetime [17,18]. In a Big Data context,\
    \ with a massive amount of high-speed, regularly changing,\nand variable data,\
    \ large-scale WSNs (LS-WSNs) may provide valuable solutions for massive data\n\
    collection [19].\nHowever, power-aware Big Data gathering in large-scale sensor\
    \ networks remains, therefore,\na challenging research issue. In a computer vision\
    \ domain, for example, managing a large number of\nlearning instances of images\
    \ is not an easy task [20]. Nevertheless, in LS-WSNs, real-time data\ngeneration\
    \ and acquisition are achieved by various sensors, such as gathering information\
    \ on\nproximity, location, humidity, and movement. Unfortunately, data generated\
    \ and acquired from\nindividual sensors may not seem signiﬁcant. However, the\
    \ global various types of data generated by\na number of sensors in LS-WSNs can\
    \ produce signiﬁcant Big Data [21]. Moreover, data collection in\nLS-WSNs requires\
    \ two important challenges to be addressed, that is, monitoring in large geographic\n\
    environments with unconnected regions, and power-aware data collection.\nA number\
    \ of studies that provide a background to WSNs and Big Data on the one hand, and\n\
    overviews of data-collection schemes in the context of LS-WSNs on the other, have\
    \ been proposed in\nthe recent literature. We reviewed most of the latest existing\
    \ papers related with the topics examined\nin this paper. In this light, Rawat\
    \ et al. (2014) [22] proposed a review of recent developments in WSNs\nby surveying\
    \ the leading research projects, platforms, standards, and technologies related\
    \ with sensor\nnetworks. Bouaziz et al. (2016) [23] as well as Sanchez et al.\
    \ (2018) [24] have reviewed recent trends\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n3 of 34\nof\
    \ mobility management in WSNs while highlighting applications and platforms. Di\
    \ Francesco et al.\n(2011) [25] provided an extensive survey and taxonomy of the\
    \ data-collection process with mobile\nelements in WSNs. In addition to sensors,\
    \ there has been a recent tendency to use unmanned aerial\nvehicles like drones\
    \ for data acquisition. In this context, swarm intelligence schemes based on bacterial\n\
    foraging optimization have been successfully used to collect massive data in LS-WSNs\
    \ [26,27].\nIn 2014, Takaishi et al. [21] proposed a Big Data gathering scheme\
    \ in densely deployed WSNs\nthat exploit sink mobility. In the same year, Wu et\
    \ al. [28] proposed a Big Data collection scheme based\non the structure-ﬁdelity\
    \ approach. The authors provided a framework for collecting structured data\n\
    and to maintain data ﬁdelity in terms of structural similarity in continuous sensing\
    \ applications in\nWSNs. After deﬁning what really represents a big sensor data\
    \ system, Ang et al. (2017) [29] surveyed\nthe progress made in the development\
    \ and applications of big sensor data research, especially in the\ncontext of\
    \ smart cities. In order to enhance Big Data collection in an IoT system, Ang\
    \ et al. (2018) [12]\nproposed a way to collect Big Data in LS-WSNs using mobile\
    \ collectors to optimize energy consumption.\nThe authors adopted a data-collection\
    \ scheme using a date mule and mobile access point, which are\nthe mostly used\
    \ components in data-collection models in sensor networks.\nAccording to the literature,\
    \ we reviewed select research in the context of this study. We established\nthat\
    \ much less research has been done on Big Data collection with sensor-based systems\
    \ compared with\nstandard Big Data systems. Standard Big Data technology using\
    \ stored data is subject to challenges\nrelated to the speed capacities of communication\
    \ networks. Useful technologies, such as Hadoop or\nMapReduce, combined with cloud-computing\
    \ technology are actually used to address communication\nnetworks by integrating\
    \ distributed processing.\nCertainly, future 5G systems, which include a promising\
    \ cloud-based radio access network\nmodel and a more powerful mmWave spectrum,\
    \ will be more ﬂexible, agile, converged, and useful\nfor automating data analytics\
    \ with machine-learning or swarm-intelligence algorithms. However,\nunstructured\
    \ large volumes of data gathered from IoT-based systems, such as LS-WSNs, need\
    \ more\nattention. The focus of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the potential\
    \ of WSNs and Big Data is studied,\nwith particular emphasis on data collection.\
    \ Then, existing data-collection schemes in the literature\nare reviewed and discussed.\
    \ This paper gives a global overview of Big Data collection in LS-WSNs\nwith the\
    \ challenges to be addressed. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide useful\
    \ insights\nto research and industry into this promising research area, and motivate\
    \ the development of new\nschemes, models, and frameworks for Big Data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs.\n1.2. Author’s Contributions\nThis work aims at increasing readers’\
    \ knowledge by providing a sufﬁcient and comprehensive\nbackground in the schemes,\
    \ algorithms, and models used for resolving different data-collection\nchallenges\
    \ in LS-WSNs. The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is enabling novice readers to\
    \ understand\nthe mechanism and operation of large-scale wireless sensor networks\
    \ for massive data collection.\nSecondly, we propose an architecture for a WSN\
    \ dedicated to Big Data collection. Then, we lay the\ngroundwork for our future\
    \ work, which consists on the one hand of proposing a deployment model of\nlarge-scale\
    \ WSNs, which should maximize coverage, and, on the other hand, proposing efﬁcient\
    \ and\nlightweight algorithms for Big Data collection in LS-WSNs.\n1.3. Organization\
    \ of the Paper\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst provide\
    \ an overview of WSNs in Section 2.\nWe then propose a background on Big Data\
    \ in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on Big Data collection in\nLS-WSNs. In Section\
    \ 5, we reviewed data transferring schemes in the context of LS-WSNs. This is\n\
    followed in Section 6 by a discussion on the challenges of Big Data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs. Finally,\nwe conclude the paper in Section 7.\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n4 of 34\n2. Overview of WSNs\nA WSN is an ad hoc network consisting of\
    \ a set of sensor nodes, randomly ﬁxed or dispersed\nin a given geographical area,\
    \ communicating via a wireless link to autonomously collect, process,\nand transmit\
    \ data in their environment to a special node, considered the collection point,\
    \ called\na sink [16,22,30–32]. The geographical area where the sensor nodes operate\
    \ is called the ﬁeld or\narea of interest. In a WSN, sensor nodes are able to\
    \ self-organize to collect information about the\nenvironment where they are deployed.\
    \ The transmission of the collected data can be done periodically\nor event-based,\
    \ depending on the nature of the implemented application. The sink is a node with\n\
    two or more network interfaces that act as a bridge between the WSN and the end-user’s\
    \ network\n(for example, a local area network or the Internet). The user can send\
    \ requests to other nodes in the\nnetwork via the sink, for example, to specify\
    \ the type of data to be collected. For illustration purposes,\nFigure 1 shows\
    \ the basic architecture of a WSN. The sensor nodes randomly deployed in a zone\
    \ of\ninterest and the sink located at the end of the zone are responsible for\
    \ recovering the data collected\nby the sensors. Most often, the sink collects\
    \ and processes network data, thus sending only relevant\ninformation to the user.\
    \ It can also receive commands to run on the internal network from it (the user).\n\
    The collected data are processed and analyzed by the user.\nFigure 1. General\
    \ architecture of a wireless sensor network (WSN).\n2.1. Hardware Architecture\
    \ of a Wireless Sensor\nA wireless sensor is a small electronic device capable\
    \ of measuring a physical quantity\n(e.g., temperature, light, pressure) and communicating\
    \ it to a collection center directly or via other\nsensor nodes that act as routers\
    \ [10]. Given the advances in microelectronics, wireless transmission\ntechnologies\
    \ and software have made it possible to produce microsensors of a few cubic millimeters\
    \ in\nvolume that can operate in a network at a reasonable cost [22]. A sensor\
    \ node consists of four base\nunits and two optional units [10,33] (see Figure\
    \ 2):\n•\nAcquisition unit. This consists of two subunits: a sensor and an analog-to-digital\
    \ converter (ADC).\nThe sensor collects digital measurements on environmental\
    \ parameters and transforms them into\nanalog signals. The ADC converts analog\
    \ signals into digital signals.\n•\nProcessing unit. This is also composed of\
    \ two units: a data-storage unit, and a processor responsible\nfor data-processing\
    \ and control procedures allowing the collaboration of the sensor with the others\n\
    in order to carry out acquisition tasks.\n•\nCommunication unit. Its function\
    \ is information transmission and reception. It is equipped with\na transmitter/receiver\
    \ pair. It allows communication within the network, in our case, by radio\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n5 of 34\nfrequency (radio waves). However, there are other transmission\
    \ possibilities (e.g., optical and\ninfra red)\n•\nPower unit. Power supply is\
    \ a critical element of sensor architecture. It is responsible for supplying\n\
    energy to all other units. It most often corresponds to a battery, feeding the\
    \ sensor, whose limited\nresources make it a problem speciﬁc to this type of network.\
    \ However the recent realization of\nsolar-panel power unit is trying to provide\
    \ a solution for extending sensor life [33].\n•\nMobilizer. Optionally, this is\
    \ used to move the node to complete the task to be processed.\n•\nLocation-Finding\
    \ System. Optionally, this provides information on the location required by the\n\
    application and/or routing.\nFigure 2. Architecture of a wireless sensor.\n2.2.\
    \ Types of WSNs\nDepending on the deployment environment on land, underground,\
    \ or underwater, there are\nseveral types of WSNs [10] (see Figure 3):\n•\nTerrestrial.\
    \ This kind of WSNs is intended to be deployed in a terrestrial space. In these\
    \ networks,\nhundreds of thousands of sensors are deployed randomly or deterministically\
    \ over a given area.\nThis type of WSN is much more useful in the ﬁeld of environmental\
    \ monitoring and natural\nphenomena; however, it represents a challenge for the\
    \ sustainability of the network in terms of\nenergy management [34].\n•\nUnderground.\
    \ These networks consist of very special sensor nodes known for their high cost\n\
    and the logistics necessary for their implementation and maintenance. In this\
    \ type of network,\nthe sensor nodes are installed in the ground. They ﬁnd their\
    \ application in agriculture or in\nmineﬁelds, where they are used to monitor\
    \ conditions in the soil. However, in this type of\nnetwork, there is a ground\
    \ node that has a role in transmitting the information detected by the\nunderground\
    \ nodes to the base station [35].\n•\nUnderwater. This particular type of WSNs\
    \ is networks hidden under the sea. Because of the\nhostility represented by the\
    \ environment of their deployment, this type of network remains an\ninteresting\
    \ research challenge. These nodes are more expensive than terrestrial sensors,\
    \ wireless\ncommunication is acoustic, bandwidth is limited, signal loss is recurrent,\
    \ and propagation delays\nand synchronization problems are frequent [36,37].\n\
    •\nMultimedia. These WSNs are designed to monitor and trace data such as images,\
    \ videos, and\nsound. These sensors are equipped with cameras and microphones.\
    \ This type of network requires\ngood bandwidth and good quality of service, which\
    \ implies high power consumption for data\nprocessing and compression. Preplanning\
    \ is required for the deployment of these sensors [38].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    6 of 34\n•\nMobile. This is the most recent type of WSN, and it uses mobile nodes\
    \ that can autonomously\nreposition and reorganize the network. After initial\
    \ deployment, the nodes disperse to gather\ninformation. There is also a hybrid\
    \ network consisting of a combination of mobile and ﬁxed\nsensors [12,25,26,37,39–42].\n\
    Figure 3. Types of WSNs.\n2.3. Topologies of WSNs\nUsually, an LS-WSN is composed\
    \ of a large number of high-density nodes deployed in a detection\narea, with\
    \ one or more base stations within or near the area. The base station communicates\
    \ with\nthe sensors via requests or commands, and the sensors communicate with\
    \ each other via wireless\ncommunications. They participate in performing data-detecting\
    \ and -sending tasks to the base station.\nIn sensor networks, the energy consumed\
    \ for communication is much higher than that required\nfor detection or computing.\
    \ For example, the transmission of a single bit of data is equivalent to\n800\
    \ instructions [43]. A wireless sensor network can be organized according to different\
    \ topologies,\nincluding star, mesh, and hybrid topologies.\n2.3.1. Star Topology\n\
    In this communication topology, the network consists of a single station that\
    \ can send and/or\nreceive messages from a number of remote sensor nodes. Sensor\
    \ nodes are not allowed to communicate\nwith each other.\nThis topology has the\
    \ advantages of being easy to deploy, and guaranteeing\ncommunication and low\
    \ latency between remote sensor nodes and the base station [44].\n2.3.2. Mesh\
    \ Topology\nThis topology uses a multihop network scheme to cover all connected\
    \ sensor nodes, that is,\nthe signal goes from one sensor node to another until\
    \ it reaches the base station. The communication\nrange of each node is not limited\
    \ by distance; we can, however, add an intermediate sensor node to\nextend it\
    \ [45]. The main advantage of this topology is that it maintains connectivity\
    \ in the network, but\nits major disadvantage lies in the number of jumps that\
    \ increase from one communication to another,\nincreasing energy consumption in\
    \ the network.\n2.3.3. Hybrid Topology\nHybrid topology combines both the star\
    \ and mesh topologies [45]. It provides a robust network\nwith several communication\
    \ functions while keeping sensor energy consumption to a minimum.\nSensors 2018,\
    \ 18, 4474\n7 of 34\nSensor nodes that have higher energy capacities are enabled\
    \ to provide multihop communications,\nwhile low power nodes are disabled.\n2.4.\
    \ WSN Communication\nA sensor node can communicate directly, without detour, thanks\
    \ to single-hop communication\nwith the sink, or using multihop communication,\
    \ passing the information to its neighbors [33].\n2.4.1. One-Hop Communication\n\
    One-hop communications lead to transmissions over long distances resulting in\
    \ a signiﬁcant\nincrease in energy consumption. Figure 4 illustrates this type\
    \ of communication.\nFigure 4. One-hop communication.\n2.4.2. Multihop Communication\n\
    Using multihop communication reduces transmission distance, thus reducing energy\
    \ loss in order\nto increase the service life of the network. In multihop transmissions,\
    \ network architecture plays a\nmajor role. Multihop network architectures are\
    \ typically divided into ﬂat or hierarchical architectures.\nFigure 5 illustrates\
    \ this type of communication.\nFigure 5. Multihop communication.\n2.5. Speciﬁc\
    \ Characteristics of Sensor Networks\nSensor networks have intrinsic characteristics,\
    \ both at the sensor nodes (energy power, processing\ncapacity, storage capacity,\
    \ and reach), and at the level of the network constituted by these sensors\n(bandwidth,\
    \ density, and network topology) [33].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n8 of 34\n2.5.1.\
    \ Sensor-Node Features\nIndividually, sensor nodes have their own characteristics\
    \ that usual sensors do not have. Indeed,\nsensor nodes have energy autonomy,\
    \ and this resource is essential to the survival of a WSN because,\nin most cases,\
    \ the sensor’s battery is irreplaceable.\nIn addition, sensors have limited capacity,\n\
    such as with regard to storage and data processing, as well as narrow sensor transmission\
    \ range.\nHere, we detail the main features. More information is available in\
    \ the literature [22].\n•\nEnergy consumption. Sensors have energy autonomy, and\
    \ they usually use tiny batteries as energy\nresources. In most cases, WSNs are\
    \ deployed in hard-to-reach areas. This makes it difﬁcult or\nalmost impossible\
    \ to recharge or replace the batteries. This difﬁculty leads us to deduce that\
    \ the\nlife of a sensor is essentially dependent on the life of the battery. Therefore,\
    \ energy-consumption\nmanagement is a major constraint in this type of network.\n\
    •\nTransmission scope. This is an important criterion for the deployment of a\
    \ WSN. It is limited\nby the radiation capacity of the antennas used and the signal\
    \ strength involved. For example,\nthe communication between two sensor nodes\
    \ can only take place if the distance between them\nis not too great, i.e., a\
    \ few tens of meters in practice. The longer the distance is, the higher the\n\
    energy cost. This is especially true if there are physical obstacles between the\
    \ two nodes that may\nprevent communication.\n•\nStorage and processing power.\
    \ An intrinsic characteristic of these sensors is their low storage capacity.\n\
    Although they also have a processor, the sensors cannot perform very large operations\
    \ due to\ntheir relatively low processing power. For example, “mote”-type sensor\
    \ nodes are composed of\nan 8-bit 4 MHz microcontroller, 40 KB of memory, and\
    \ a radio with a bit rate of about 10 Kbps.\nThis remains true even for midrange\
    \ nodes, such as “UCLA/ROCKWELL’S WINS”, which have a\nstrong ARM 1100 processor\
    \ with 1 MB ﬂash memory, 128 KB of RAM, and a 100 Kbps radio.\n2.5.2. WSN Features\n\
    In addition to the sensor nodes’ intrinsic characteristics, there are other characteristics\
    \ that are\nrelated to the network: sensor self-conﬁguration, scalability, fault\
    \ tolerance, communication capacity,\nnetwork topology, bandwidth, and density.\n\
    •\nSensor autoconﬁguration. In a WSN, sensors are deployed either in a random\
    \ manner by a missile,\ndrone, or airplane, or manually deployed by a human or\
    \ a robot, inside or around an observed\nphenomenon such as a ﬁeld of war, volcanic\
    \ surface, or sick patient [46]. Thus, each sensor\nnode has the ability, on the\
    \ one hand, to self-conﬁgure in the network, and, on the other hand,\nto collaborate\
    \ with other nodes in order to dynamically reconﬁgure the network in case of\n\
    network-topology changes [41]. As a reminder, each sensor in a WSN has a transmitting/receiving\n\
    unit that allows it to communicate with the sensors that are close to it. By exchanging\
    \ information\nwith them, the sensor can then discover its neighbors and thus\
    \ know the routing method that it\nwill adopt according to the needs of the application.\
    \ Autoconﬁguration appears to be a necessary\nfeature in the case of WSNs since,\
    \ on the one hand, their deployment is done randomly in the\nmajority of applications,\
    \ and, on the other hand, the number of sensors is very high.\n•\nScalability.\
    \ Unlike traditional wireless networks (personal, local, or extended), a WSN consists\
    \ of a\nvery large number of sensors (hundreds or thousands) [33]. The sensor\
    \ network is scalable in that\nit has the ability to accept a large number of\
    \ sensors that work together to achieve a common goal.\n•\nFault tolerance. In\
    \ case of a sensor malfunction (lack of energy, interference with observation\n\
    environment) or if new sensors are added to the network, the existing sensor nodes\
    \ in the WSN\nmust continue to normally operate without interruption [33]. This\
    \ explains the fact that a WSN\ndoes not adopt a ﬁxed but rather dynamic topology.\n\
    •\nCommunication ability. It can take one of two aspects, multihop or one-hop.\
    \ Multihop communication\nis less energy-intensive, and it remains the most sought-after\
    \ type of communication for WSN\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n9 of 34\napplications\
    \ that require low energy consumption. Finally, it should be noted that WSNs use\
    \ a\nnonstandardized protocol stack. However, the majority of scientiﬁc work that\
    \ deals with the WSN\nissue is based on the protocol stack proposed in 2002 by\
    \ Akyildiz et al. [33], which is presented in\nSection 2.6.\n2.6. Protocol Architecture\n\
    The role of the protocol architecture given in Figure 6 is to standardize communication\
    \ between\nnetwork components so that different vendors can develop compatible\
    \ products (software or hardware).\nThis protocol stack combines energy routing\
    \ and management, and integrates the data with the\nnetwork. It communicates efﬁciently\
    \ (in terms of energy) through the wireless medium and promotes\nco-operative\
    \ efforts among sensor nodes [45]. Depending on detection tasks, different types\
    \ of\napplication software can be designed and used in the transport layer. A\
    \ WSN can be seen as a\nseries of connections between sensors that enable them\
    \ to communicate. The content, scope, size,\nspeed, and connectivity of the network\
    \ depend on the set of protocols and their implementation.\nThis includes application,\
    \ transport, network, link, and physical layers, and energy-, mobility-, and\n\
    task-management plans.\n•\nApplication layer. Depending on the functionality of\
    \ the sensors, different applications can be used\nand built on this layer.\n\
    •\nTransport layer. It is used to maintain the ﬂow of data when needed in the\
    \ applications used,\nespecially when connected to the Internet.\n•\nNetwork layer.\
    \ This deals with the routing of data provided by the transport layer.\n•\nData-link\
    \ layer. As the sensor network environment is noisy and nodes can be mobile, the\
    \ MAC\nlayer must ensure low power consumption in the data broadcast of neighboring\
    \ nodes.\n•\nPhysical layer. This deals with data-transmission, -reception, -modulation,\
    \ and -encryption techniques.\n•\nEnergy-, mobility-, and task-management levels\
    \ are responsible for controlling the consumed energy,\nnode movements, and task\
    \ distribution across the entire protocol stacks. These levels allow\nsensors\
    \ to co-ordinate their tasks and minimize energy consumption.\nFigure 6. WSN protocol\
    \ stack [33].\n2.7. Dedicated Applications\nWSNs are in use in many areas, and\
    \ most often with a varied architectural design. Moreover,\nsensor networks correspond\
    \ to speciﬁc types of applications, as can be seen in Figure 7. A 2012\nstudy\
    \ by IDTechEx has reported that the worldwide market for sensor networks is growing,\
    \ and is\nexpected to grow from 0.45 billion to 2 billion between 2012 and 2022.\
    \ We distinguish four types of\nWSN applications [32]: event-driven applications,\
    \ periodic data-collection applications (also called\ntime-driven applications),\
    \ recommended execution applications or query-oriented applications, and\nhybrid\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n10 of 34\nFigure 7. Dedicated WSN applications.\n\
    2.7.1. Event-Driven\nThis type of application is the most representative of WSN\
    \ applications (see Figure 8). As an\nexample, we can mention the detection of\
    \ a forest ﬁre or an earthquake, or the monitoring of the air\nquality in a given\
    \ region. In this class of applications, sensor nodes must be able to detect an\
    \ event\nthat could happen at any time in any location in the area of interest.\
    \ Thus, the sensor nodes must\ncontinuously collect this information and immediately\
    \ react to abrupt changes in the sensed values.\nFor this application category,\
    \ no periodic control is required by the sink, and the data processing by\nthe\
    \ sensor nodes is simple: each node must compare the measured data with a ﬁxed\
    \ critical threshold.\nAs soon as this value exceeds the threshold, the sensor\
    \ node sends the data to the sink. In order to\nprovide better performance, these\
    \ applications must meet certain criteria, such as:\n•\nA high density of sensor\
    \ nodes is required to ensure high probability of event detection. This\nimplies\
    \ that the network must have very good coverage.\n•\nGood coverage of sensor nodes\
    \ that usually depends on the type of event to be detected.\n•\nAn exact location\
    \ of all sensor nodes in the network is required. This is to locate the event\
    \ through\nthe sensor node in which the event occurs. Note that distributed location\
    \ algorithms could be\nused for this purpose.\n•\nGood network connectivity linked\
    \ to transmission coverage so that communication protocols\nallow the alarm sent\
    \ by sensor nodes to arrive at the sink with high probability and in the\nshortest\
    \ time.\nFigure 8. Event-driven applications.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n11 of 34\n\
    2.7.2. Query-Driven\nIn query-oriented applications (see Figure 9), the deployed\
    \ sensor network tracks information\nonly at the explicit request of a base station.\
    \ This category of applications is intended for the speciﬁc\nneeds of the user.\
    \ The latter may seek, for example, to request information speciﬁc to a certain\
    \ region,\nor to interrogate the sensors to acquire measures of interest. Generally\
    \ In this case, the topological\nknowledge of the network and the geographical\
    \ location of the sensors are necessary.\nFigure 9. Query-driven applications.\n\
    2.7.3. Time-Driven\nIn this category, applications aim to periodically evaluate\
    \ the measurements of the given physical\nquantities. Note, for example, the application\
    \ of WSNs in the monitoring of the atmospheric pressure\nof a large area or variations\
    \ in ground temperature at a small volcanic site [47]. These applications react\n\
    in a given period sink. The sensors take a sample of the environment and transmit\
    \ it by means of an\nappropriate communication protocol to the ﬁnal sink. For\
    \ the smooth operation of these applications,\nwith better quality of service,\
    \ it is important: that the sampling frequency is sink-chosen, that the\nconnectivity\
    \ of the network is kept under control, and to have communication protocols adapted\
    \ to\nthat kind of data. The sensor nodes used in this type of application can\
    \ sleep, i.e., turn off their radio\nduring periods of inactivity in order to\
    \ manage the energy consumption of the network.\n2.7.4. Hybrid\nThis category\
    \ of applications group the resulting applications of the two previous categories.\n\
    Examples are home-automation applications, where we can evaluate the temperature\
    \ of a room\n(event-oriented), or/and monitor a newborn (time-driven).\n2.8. WSN\
    \ Application Areas\nThe increasingly smaller size of the sensors, the ever-lower\
    \ cost, the wide range of available sensor\ntypes (thermal, optical, vibration,\
    \ etc.), as well as wireless-communication support, have widely spread\nthe use\
    \ of solutions based on WSNs [33]. Needs in terms of WSNs’ applications are growing\
    \ every day.\nIn 2006, the works of Ekici et al. [48] broke down sensor-network\
    \ applications into four main areas, as\ndescribed in Figure 10: environmental,\
    \ health, security, and other applications. Furthermore, existing\napplications\
    \ are extended in order to facilitate the design of other systems, such as the\
    \ control and\nautomation of industrial production lines.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    12 of 34\nFigure 10. WSN applications.\n2.8.1. Environmental Applications\nNowadays,\
    \ environmental problems, such as ﬂoods, ﬁres, and pollution, are the most recurrent.\n\
    The use of WSNs in environmental applications is becoming increasingly important\
    \ and common, thus\nimproving environmental awareness and the effectiveness of\
    \ control methods [22,47,49]. Therefore,\nWSNs can contribute to the development\
    \ of risk-response systems, natural-disaster detection, energy\nmanagement, and\
    \ other systems. Environmental applications can be broken down into ﬁve classes,\n\
    as shown in Figure 10: weather monitoring, geological monitoring, habitat monitoring,\
    \ pollution\nmonitoring, and energy monitoring.\n2.8.2. Medical Applications\n\
    The health sector is increasingly using WSNs for healthcare needs, such as medical\
    \ treatment,\npre- and posthospital patient surveillance, and rescue operations\
    \ [32]. In addition, sensor networks\ncan help in solving important social problems,\
    \ such as caring for the chronically ill and people with\nintellectual and physical\
    \ disabilities. The ﬁeld of healthcare includes patient follow-ups, invalid\n\
    assistance, life-saving, biosurveillance, and intelligent environments. Furthermore,\
    \ WSNs are used for\nmonitoring physiological measurements [33]. They can also\
    \ be used, for example, to monitor the vital\nfunctions of the elderly or people\
    \ with health problems in order to alert medical devices. Similarly,\nwe can analyze\
    \ different physical measurements collected from athletes, the possibilities offered\
    \ by a\nWSN to lighten data-collection devices.\n2.8.3. Security Applications\n\
    Some institutions can be monitored in real time by WSNs to prevent possible theft\
    \ or ﬁre. Another\nexample is the application of sensor networks in intelligent\
    \ transportation systems for monitoring\nroads or railways to prevent accidents\
    \ [50]. In the military domain, these networks are used for\nsurveillance inside\
    \ and outside the theater of operations and in espionage. In the security ﬁeld,\
    \ sensor\nnetworks can signiﬁcantly contribute to the reduction of ﬁnancial expenses\
    \ dedicated to the security\nof locations and human beings. Thus, the integration\
    \ of sensors in large structures, such as bridges\nor buildings, could help detect\
    \ cracks and alterations in the structure following an earthquake or the\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n13 of 34\naging of the structure. Deploying a motion-sensor\
    \ network can be an alarm system that can detect\nintrusions into a surveillance\
    \ zone [41].\n2.8.4. Other Applications\nOther applications of WSNs include [51,52]\
    \ structural monitoring, construction monitoring and\ncontrol, automobile surveillance,\
    \ trafﬁc monitoring, control of industrial processes, and warehouse\nsurveillance.\
    \ Usually, WSNs are particularly suitable for monitoring critical areas, thanks\
    \ in particular\nto their autonomy and smaller size. In addition, possible applications\
    \ include ﬂood prevention,\nforest-ﬁre detection, and the monitoring of nuclear\
    \ facilities [53]. This type of network opens up new\nopportunities for managing\
    \ the many problems that our present and future cities face, like trafﬁc\ncongestion,\
    \ and energy and waste management.\nMoreover, WSNs provide elements of answers\
    \ to issues that remain relevant. They help ﬁnd\nsolutions for trafﬁc observation\
    \ and the management, especially the management of the trafﬁc lights,\nthe regulation\
    \ of public street lamps, or the monitoring and management of centralized waste\
    \ collection.\nFurthermore, in every-day life, home-automation and smart-building\
    \ applications are particularly\npopular [45]. WSNs in these contexts provide\
    \ innovative solutions for comfort, energy savings, and\nsecurity [54]. For these\
    \ applications, ZigBee alliance technologies offer a complete wireless protocol\n\
    stack for different types of applications.\n2.9. Challenges of WSN Design and\
    \ Deployment\nIn most cases, the deployment of a WSN is closely related to the\
    \ nature of the intended application.\nThere is no generic model for these applications.\
    \ However, several factors inﬂuence WSN design and\ndeployment. The design of\
    \ the WSN must ﬁnd a compromise solution for the following challenges:\n•\nEnergy.\
    \ A sensor node, by its size, is limited in energy resources, storage capacity,\
    \ and processing.\nOne of the most serious concerns is the lifespan of the sensor\
    \ node, which is entirely determined\nby the amount of energy available and the\
    \ rate of energy consumption (that is, the average energy\nconsumption). Since\
    \ improving the energy capacity of small batteries still requires a lot of effort,\n\
    the goal of a long service life is difﬁcult to achieve by increasing the amount\
    \ of available energy.\nAs a result, the design of energy-efﬁcient MAC protocols,\
    \ communication strategies, operating\nsystems, and energy-efﬁcient routing mechanisms\
    \ provides effective ways to extend the life of the\nnode [36]. The use of energy-recovery\
    \ technologies for sensor-node power supplies has also been\nan alternative in\
    \ recent years.\n•\nQuality of Service (QoS). Quality is deﬁned by the ability\
    \ to interpret the information collected\nby the sink. In spite of the fact that\
    \ the QoS requirements vary according to the different\nWSN applications, the\
    \ two main measures of QoS are data reliability and latency [33]. Usually,\na\
    \ successful data-exchange rate between the sensor nodes and the sink must be\
    \ above a certain\nthreshold to ensure network reliability and functionality.\
    \ Reliability can be further maximized, but\nthis could be at the cost of increased\
    \ energy consumption. Therefore, a compromise is necessary.\nIn case of latency,\
    \ for certain types of applications, the reception of the data detected on the\
    \ sink is\nstrictly timed, so that latency data can cause delay problems and lead\
    \ to bad decisions, particularly\nin industrial-surveillance applications.\n•\n\
    Security and privacy. WSNs ﬁnd their applications in various areas of life. Some\
    \ applications\nmanipulate private data. Moreover, WSNs are networks whose topology\
    \ is very frequently subject\nto change. The deployment of sensor nodes is sometimes\
    \ done in accessible areas; they may\nencounter technical interference or human\
    \ intrusion, which can lead to conﬁdentiality issues.\nThus, the network should\
    \ allow the detection of intrusions. It is therefore necessary to design\nrobust\
    \ and lightweight algorithms for data encryption, authentication mechanisms for\
    \ privacy\nprotection, and secure routing for data relays to protect the entire\
    \ network against passive and\nactive attacks, and denials of external service\
    \ providers [55–57].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n14 of 34\n•\nAdaptability. The design\
    \ of a WSN must be sufﬁciently ﬂexible and adaptable to be deployable\nacross\
    \ a wide range of application scenarios. The entire network should be kept functional\n\
    regardless if the number of sensor nodes is hundreds, thousands, or very small.\
    \ Due to the\nmobility of sensor nodes and observed events, as well as the possibility\
    \ that a sensor node can fail\nin the network, the overall topology of the network\
    \ may be subject to frequent change. Therefore,\nthe design of a WSN must be sufﬁciently\
    \ intelligent and robust to deal with these dynamic\ntopology scenarios [10,31].\n\
    •\nLocalization.\nWSNs play an important role in the problem of locating elements\
    \ in a given\ndeployment area. Certainly, GPS is a well-known tracking system\
    \ and the most used location\nsystem. However, it is not satisfactory for this\
    \ use, because it accumulates handicaps. It is only\navailable outdoors and if\
    \ no obstacle obstructs the ﬁeld of view of the receivers. In addition, an\noperation\
    \ under dense foliage or in cities with narrow streets is not possible, which\
    \ are very bad\nconditions. Moreover, it is particularly expensive, both in terms\
    \ of hardware, multiplied to many\ncopies in a network with high sensor density.\
    \ Moreover, signal reception is very energy-greedy,\nwhich is not compatible with\
    \ management problems of battery service life. Location is done in\ntwo steps:\
    \ distance estimation to the other nodes, and triangulation. The development of\
    \ new\nlocalization techniques has become a major concern for WSNs [33,58].\n\
    3. Overview of Big Data\nThis section aims at presenting an overview of the Big\
    \ Data concept by presenting its\ncategorization through the three-V model actually\
    \ extended to ﬁve Vs, with an emphasis on different\ngeneration sources of these\
    \ data. Moreover, a number of technologies on Big Data have been proposed\nin\
    \ both industry and research applications. In view of its characteristics, the\
    \ problem of Big Data\nis different from that of business intelligence, so Big\
    \ Data challenges in the process of extracting\nknowledge from data are studied.\
    \ These challenges are grouped into three phases: storage, processing,\nand exploitation\
    \ of results. Therefore, using LS-WSN to collect, process, and exploit knowledge\n\
    extracted from Big Data is an emerging trend.\nHowever, we must say that the term\
    \ Big Data is still an abstract concept. Sometimes called massive\ndata or metadata,\
    \ Big Data is an increasingly heterogeneous dataset, which is growing in volume\n\
    such that it is difﬁcult to process these data with conventional database-management\
    \ tools [11,13].\nIn this context of data deluge, McKinsey, in its June 2011 publication\
    \ “Big data: the next frontier for\ninnovation, competition, and productivity”\
    \ advocates the new era of Big Data [59]. Unfortunately, Big\nData appeared much\
    \ earlier, more than a decade ago, without being named, with the emergence of\n\
    large data that cannot be processed using traditional techniques [29]. Large IT\
    \ companies, such as\nYahoo and Google, were the ﬁrst to offer their own Big Data\
    \ solutions. They were confronted very\nearly with issues related to the storage\
    \ and processing of large volumes of data. Therefore, Big Data is\na new generation\
    \ of solutions for collection, storage, real-time processing, and data analysis.\n\
    3.1. Characterization of Big Data\nCharacterization of Big Data is generally done\
    \ according to the three Vs: Volume, Variety, and\nVelocity. Other complementary\
    \ Vs are added, such as Value and Veracity.\n3.1.1. Volume\nVolume is certainly\
    \ the one best described by the term Big in “Big Data”. Volume refers to the\n\
    amount of too-large information to be acquired, stored, processed, analyzed, and\
    \ distributed by\nstandard tools. This data volume is constantly growing. With\
    \ the exponential growth in the number\nof electronic smart devices, the world\
    \ is steadily becoming more connected. Moreover, connected\nobjects will continue\
    \ to grow over the coming years. For instance, according to computer company\n\
    IBM, 2.5 exabytes, i.e., 2.5 billion gigabytes, of data were generated every day\
    \ in 2012. This amount of\ndata will reach 500 zettabytes by the end of 2019 [1].\
    \ Furthermore, some analyses report that, in the last\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    15 of 34\ntwo years, about ninety percent of these data has been generated. In\
    \ most cases, most of the generated\ndata come from the digital world. In 2013,\
    \ IBM reported that about 12 terrabytes of tweets were created\neach day, and\
    \ 5.2 billion daily Google searches in 2017. Table 1 highlights the volume of\
    \ data generated\nby the digital sector. Volume is certainly the main criterion\
    \ that comes to mind when we talk about\nBig Data. However, summarizing Big Data\
    \ volume is too simplistic. There are other criteria, such as\nvelocity and variety,\
    \ to characterize Big Data.\nTable 1. Volume of created data (Sources: bloomberg.com,\
    \ IBM, BBC, onereach.com, Internet Live Stats,\nInternet World Stats, Forbes,\

    \ users.\nData created by the Internet of Things (IoT)\n- 2.5 quintillion bytes\
    \ of data are created every day by mobile devices,\nWSNs, Smart TVs, cars, etc.\n\
    3.1.2. Velocity\nVelocity refers to the dynamic and/or temporal aspect of the\
    \ data, and their update and analysis\ntime. Data are no longer processed and\
    \ analyzed ofﬂine, but in real time or near-real time. They are\nproduced in continuous\
    \ streams, during which real-time decisions can be made. These are the\ndata especially\
    \ from sensors, requiring fast processing for a real-time reaction. In the case\
    \ of such\nhigh-velocity data generating very large volumes, it is no longer possible\
    \ to store them as they are, but\nonly to analyze them in streaming, or even to\
    \ summarize them; for instance, in time-sensitive processes\nlike detecting frauds,\
    \ Big Data must be used as they stream into industries in order to maximize their\n\
    value. The challenge of Big Data applications is to recover data almost instantly,\
    \ process them in real\ntime, and extract useful information.\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n16 of 34\n3.1.3. Variety\nVariety refers to the heterogeneity of formats,\
    \ types, and quality of information. It is linked to\nthe fact that these structured\
    \ and unstructured data can present complex shapes because they have\ntheir origins\
    \ in various and varied sensors (e.g., temperature, wind speed, hydrometry, humidity,\n\
    and brightness), in exchanged messages (e-mails, social media, and exchange of\
    \ images, videos,\nand music), in texts, online publications (e.g., digital libraries,\
    \ websites, and blogs), recordings of\npurchase transactions, planning of scanned\
    \ books, directories, log ﬁles, click streams, and information\nfrom mobile phones.\
    \ Most of these data consist of public or private data, local or remote, shared\
    \ or\nconﬁdential, and complete or incomplete. When analyzing these data types\
    \ together, new insights\nare found.\nThe three Vs are the major features of Big\
    \ Data. A more relevant deﬁnition ofBbig Data could\nthen be: data that are too\
    \ large, too fast, or too broad in variety to directly store in traditional databases\n\
    or processed by current algorithms [60]. The recent literature adds other complementary\
    \ Vs, turning\nBig Data into Smart Data.\n3.2. Toward Smart Data\nRecently, a\
    \ new term has emerged that tends to replace Big Data. This term is Smart Data.\n\
    Why smart? Because not all data in Big Data are good to recover. Smart Data add\
    \ a V to Big data,\nthe Veracity of the data, which is directly related to value.\
    \ Without Veracity and without quality data,\nValue is illusory.\n3.2.1. Veracity\n\
    Completeness Veracity or Validity refers to the quality of the data and/or the\
    \ ethical issues related\nto their use. Not all data are intended to be analyzed.\
    \ We must unload unusable data, called bad data,\nof poor quality for several\
    \ reasons. This understands the problems of outliers or missing values (these\n\
    problems can be solved by the volume of data), but also to the conﬁdence that\
    \ one can have in the data.\nIf there are criteria for qualifying the quality\
    \ of data, in the case of Big Data this quality check is made\ndifﬁcult or impossible\
    \ because of the volume, variety, and velocity speciﬁc to Big Data [61].\n3.2.2.\
    \ Value\nThe complementary V character that is Value refers to the potentiality\
    \ of the data, especially\nin economic terms. It is thus associated with the use\
    \ that can be made of these Big Data and their\nanalysis, especially from an economic\
    \ point of view. In this light, a recent study by Deloitte [62]\nstates that Viability\
    \ is named as the ﬁfth V, and the sum of the ﬁve Vs is likened to Value. Value\
    \ is\nthe criterion resulting from the exploitation of Big Data; how to validate\
    \ useful, reliable and accurate\ndata from many large online datasets? Once done,\
    \ how to extract value? In addition, Big Data is an\ninterdisciplinary issue requiring\
    \ cooperation from academia, industry, and business [63,64].\n3.3. Big Data Generation\n\
    In this section, we explore the main sources of massive data generation. As highlighted\
    \ in\nFigure 11, we have four main sources of Big Data.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    17 of 34\nFigure 11. Taxonomy of Big Data sources.\n3.3.1. Medical and Biomedical\
    \ Data\nThe medical ﬁeld with related services, such as bioinformatics, computer\
    \ clinics, and other\ncomputer- and health-related activities, generate multidimensional\
    \ data, and are a source of Big\nData generation [65]. Examples are genome-related\
    \ clinical projects and real-time health-monitoring\nsystems using wireless sensors.\
    \ These different techniques generate a lot of data. In addition to this,\nmedical-imaging\
    \ software produce large amounts of data, even with more complex features. In\
    \ the\neffort to modernize medical trays, the Swiss government carried out different\
    \ types of projects going\ntoward this direction, so a project named ProteomicsDB\
    \ was launched to handle genes with a size of\n5.17 terabytes [66].\n3.3.2. Internet\
    \ of Things\nThe IoT covers the connection of objects to the Internet through\
    \ sensors to retrieve and exploit\ndata from the physical world. The constant\
    \ evolution of Internet technologies, coupled with the\ncontinuous decline in\
    \ the cost of electronics, has today made it possible to deploy such systems on\
    \ a\nlarge scale. The best deﬁnition of the IoT would be: an open and comprehensive\
    \ network of smart\nobjects that have the ability to self-organize, share information,\
    \ data, and resources, and react to and\nact on situations and changes in the\
    \ environment [67]. The IoT is therefore seen as the next online\nrevolution [60].\n\
    3.3.3. Social Media\nSocial media are one of the main sources of massive data\
    \ generation. Nowadays, social media\nplatforms, such as Facebook, Youtube, Twitter,\
    \ and Instagram, produce large amounts of data.\nFor instance, SocialBlade.com\
    \ reported that Instagram, with 7.1 million active users, has more than\n34.7\
    \ billion shares of active photos, and more than 3.25 billion hours of videos\
    \ are watched in one\nmonth. In the same light, Twitter has 355 million active\
    \ users every month, averaging 665 million tweets\nper day. More than 5 billion\
    \ people worldwide call, text, tweet, and browse on mobile devices [60].\nThe\
    \ number of email accounts created around the world increased from 3.3 billion\
    \ in 2012 to more\nthan 4.3 billion by the end of 2016 at an average annual rate\
    \ of 6% over the four years. In 2012, a total\nof 89 billion emails were sent\
    \ and received daily, and this value is expected to increase. An average\nannual\
    \ rate of 13% over the next four years will exceed 143 billion by the end of 2019\
    \ [68].\n3.3.4. Scientiﬁc Data\nScientiﬁc data are a particular source of generation\
    \ of Big Data. In most cases, scientiﬁc projects\ncarried out in areas such as\
    \ astronomy, earth sciences, and projects related to the study of the\nocean and\
    \ its reconstruction via imagery, are projects generating large quantities of\
    \ data. As an\nexample of the data generated by different scientiﬁc projects,\
    \ 2MASS (both Micron All-Sky Surveys)\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n18 of 34\ngenerates\
    \ 10 terabytes, DPOSS (Le Palomar Digital Sky Survey) generates 3 terabytes, GBT\
    \ (Green\nBank Telescope) produces 20 petabytes, GALEX (The Galaxy Evolution Explorer)\
    \ has 30 terabytes,\nLSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) has more than 200\
    \ petabytes expected, SDSS (Sloan Digital\nSky Survey) produces 40 terabytes,\
    \ SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey has 500 terabytes, Pan STARRS\n(Panoramic Survey\
    \ Telescope and Rapid Response System) has more then 40 petabytes planned, and\n\
    SKA (Square Kilometer Array) has more than 4.6 exabytes expected [68].\n3.4. Areas\
    \ of Utility of Big Data\nBig Data present application perspectives in all activity\
    \ sectors, scientiﬁc, technical, and\nsocioeconomic, from data recovered from\
    \ the operation of aircraft engines to better maintain or\ndesign them, up to\
    \ data for specifying our relationships on social networks that can be used by\
    \ banks\nto estimate the quality of our credit [69]. Figure 12 presents a taxonomy\
    \ of Big Data utility domains.\nFigure 12. Taxonomy of Big Data utility domains.\n\
    3.4.1. Scientiﬁc Research\nIn the scientiﬁc and technical ﬁelds, scientists and\
    \ engineers particularly face Big Data generated\nautomatically by sensors or\
    \ measuring instruments. In medical research, technologies associated with\nBig\
    \ Data have led to spectacular advances in the analysis of the human genome. This\
    \ knowledge of\nthe genome, coupled with others, makes it possible to better understand\
    \ the evolution of pathologies,\nand to improve preventive measures and even care\
    \ protocols.\n3.4.2. Health\nIn the area of health, McKinsey estimates that Big\
    \ Data could save the U.S. healthcare system\nUSD300–450 billion in the Big Data\
    \ revolution in healthcare reports. These savings include prevention,\nwith a\
    \ follow-up of patients to change their habits, diagnosis, helping doctors to\
    \ choose the most\nappropriate treatment, medical staff, determining if a patient\
    \ needs a nurse, a general practitioner, or\na specialist, cost control both by\
    \ automating the reimbursement procedures and by detecting fraud,\nand ﬁnally\
    \ innovation through multiple contributions of intensive computing to the understanding\
    \ of\nliving and the improvement of treatments. Similarly, thanks to Big Data,\
    \ it is possible to better prevent\ncertain diseases or epidemics, or improve\
    \ the treatment of patients.\n3.4.3. Socioeconomic and Political Domain\nIn the\
    \ socioeconomic ﬁeld, Big Data in general can be used to simplify or adapt offered\
    \ services\nby better listening to users and understanding how they use these\
    \ services [70]. For instance, Google\nAnalytics offers companies, as well as\
    \ public administrations, the opportunity to improve their website\ndesign by\
    \ analyzing Internet user visits. Moreover, in education, with distance education\
    \ such as the\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n19 of 34\nMassive Open Online Course (MOOC),\
    \ the Big Data treatment is used to analyze student activities,\nincluding spent\
    \ time, how to follow the programs, stop and return in pedagogical videos, and\
    \ parallel\nInternet searches, to improve teaching methods.\n3.4.4. Transport\
    \ and Energy Domain\nIn the ﬁeld of transport, population movements can be modeled\
    \ to adapt infrastructure and\nservices such as train schedules. For this purpose,\
    \ data from transit passengers, bicycles, and shared\ncars, as well as from the\
    \ geolocation of people or cars, are used, such as cellular data and satellite\n\
    tracking systems. In the ﬁeld of energy and sustainable development, smart metering\
    \ systems\n(electricity, gas, water) generate Big Data that can rationalize energy\
    \ consumption [71]. In addition\nto offering citizens the opportunity to better\
    \ control their consumption, these meters allow remotely\ncutting, with the agreement\
    \ of customers, the supply of equipment to avoid overloading the network.\nIn\
    \ air transport, by combining sensor data on airplanes with weather data, air\
    \ corridors can be modiﬁed\nto save fuel, improve aircraft design, maintenance,\
    \ or safety [72].\n3.5. Big Data Challenges\nThis section presents the challenges\
    \ to overcome in order to take advantage of the exciting\nopportunities offered\
    \ by the advent of Big Data in various business sectors. The different challenges\n\
    of exploiting Big Data (see Figure 13) are categorized according to the three\
    \ phases of the process of\nextracting knowledge from data: data acquisition,\
    \ processing, and exploitation of results.\nFigure 13. Big Data challenges.\n\
    3.5.1. Data Acquisition and Storage\nData acquisition refers to data acquisition,\
    \ storage, and preprocessing. Big Data are produced\ncontinuously, and volume\
    \ is growing at an exponential rate. At this speed, the acquisition of these data\n\
    is a real challenge for researchers and industrialists. Indeed, the nature of\
    \ Big Data already presents\nseveral challenges [73]:\n•\nHeterogeneity. In general,\
    \ data-mining algorithms and machine learning expect homogeneous\ndata, and cannot\
    \ understand the ﬁne distinction between them. IT systems work the fastest if\
    \ they\ncan store multiple items that are the same size and structure. Thus, Big\
    \ Data must be carefully\nstructured as a ﬁrst step in their acquisition process\
    \ [74].\n•\nScale. The ﬁrst thing everyone thinks about Big Data is size. The\
    \ management of large volumes\nof data and high growth has been a major problem\
    \ for many decades. The volume of data is\nincreasing faster than IT resources.\
    \ Unfortunately, parallel data-processing techniques that were\nuseful in the\
    \ past for processing data between nodes do not apply directly to intranode parallelism,\n\
    since the architecture is very different.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n20 of 34\n\
    •\nDelay. The larger the dataset to be processed is, the longer it takes to analyze\
    \ it. Designing a\nsystem that effectively treats size is also likely to result\
    \ in a system capable to more quickly process\na given dataset size. However,\
    \ it is not only this speed that is generally heard when we talk\nabout Velocity\
    \ in the context of Big Data [75]. There are many situations in which the result\
    \ of the\nanalysis is immediately required. Given a broad dataset, it is often\
    \ essential to ﬁnd elements that\nmeet a speciﬁc criterion. The analysis of all\
    \ the data to ﬁnd the appropriate elements is obviously\nimpracticable [76].\n\
    •\nPrivacy and Security. One of the key value propositions of Big Data is access\
    \ to data from multiple\nand diverse domains. Security and privacy play a very\
    \ important role in Big Data research and\ntechnology. In areas such as social\
    \ media and health information, more data are collected on\nindividuals. It is\
    \ therefore feared that some organizations will know too much about individuals,\n\
    developing algorithms that randomize personal data into a large dataset problem\
    \ [77].\nIn terms of data storage, relational databases remain the reference,\
    \ but these systems ﬁnd their\nlimit against Big Data. These widely used tools\
    \ guarantee the maintenance of ACID (Atomicity,\nCoherence, Isolation, and Durability)\
    \ properties. The management of large volumes of data, especially\nin the context\
    \ of data warehouses, always faithful to the relational model, solutions like\
    \ Teradata rely\non the distribution of data on different disks, allowing a parallelization\
    \ of query execution. However,\nthese solutions do not allow massive data management\
    \ beyond a certain volume. Thus, different\nnew solutions have emerged. All of\
    \ these solutions rely on the distributed (partitioned) storage of\ncluster data.\
    \ Given that Brewer’s theorem is quite easily proven, no distributed system can\
    \ ensure\nconsistency, availability, and the possibility of being partitioned.\
    \ The consequence is that, in these new\nstorage solutions, it is not possible\
    \ to provide the ACID properties, and a loosening of these properties\nis necessary.\n\
    3.5.2. Data Processing\nThis treatment refers to all techniques and methods dedicated\
    \ to the exploitation of Big Data.\nThe data must be presented in a suitable format\
    \ in order to be used as input to generic data-processing\nalgorithms. The challenge\
    \ of Big Data processing is to be able to propose methods and techniques\nto manage\
    \ the complex nature of these data (Velocity, Volume, and Variety) [68], and,\
    \ in most\ncases, the treatment process. Massive data are performed in a distributed\
    \ environment. Traditional\ndata-processing methods are not suited to the context\
    \ of Big Data. The design of new methods or\nthe adaptation of existing methods\
    \ for the processing of these data in the context of a distributed\nenvironment\
    \ remains a topical research issue.\nHowever, the use of distributed data-analysis\
    \ algorithms, including search, learning, decision\nsupport, and visualization,\
    \ requires the rewriting of existing algorithms or the adaptation of Big\nData\
    \ to the data-input format of existing algorithms in a distributed context, but\
    \ also to use speciﬁc\nhardware environments to run them in distributed mode,\
    \ for example, multicore and many-core\nmachines, or computing grids. The current\
    \ limits to the distribution of Big Data analysis algorithms,\nanalysis is taken\
    \ here in a broad sense, including search, learning, decision support, and visualization,\n\
    resides as much in algorithmic difﬁculty as in the hardware architecture of execution.\
    \ Thus, most\nsearch algorithms are not easily distributed, and not necessarily\
    \ with a MapReduce approach, and it is\nsometimes necessary to ﬁnd new techniques\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient parallelization [78].\nAlthough sensors are limited in terms\
    \ of resources due to the fact that they are equipped with an\nintelligence allowing\
    \ them to collaborate to carry out a task, sensor networks can be an interesting\n\
    means for capturing and managing Big Data.\n4. Big Data Collection in LS-WSNs\n\
    The collection of data by a WSN is based on a well-deﬁned architecture. The real\
    \ problem lies\nin choosing an optimal architecture. In this section, we present\
    \ the different architectures proposed\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n21 of 34\nin the\
    \ literature in order to detect those that are compatible with large-scale WSNs.\
    \ The work of\nReferences [25,32,33,41,45,79] proposed several network architectures\
    \ dedicated to data collection.\nThese architectures are built around two main\
    \ approaches: one based on a static network, and the\nother on network mobility.\
    \ Figure 14 presents the different data-collection architectures proposed in\n\
    the literature.\nFigure 14. Different architectures of WSNs.\n4.1. Static Architectures\n\
    This is the classical approach encountered in the literature. It consists of deploying\
    \ a set of sensors\nin an area of interest in order to gather information. In\
    \ this architecture, all network components are\nstatic. On the other hand, the\
    \ deployment of the network can be achieved in two ways: deterministic\nor random.\n\
    4.1.1. Static-Sink and Static-Sensor Architecture\nThis architecture consists\
    \ of a large number of sensors capable of collecting and transmitting\nenvironmental\
    \ data in an autonomous way. The position of these sensor nodes is not necessarily\n\
    predetermined. They can be randomly dispersed across the area of interest. This\
    \ type of architecture\nis characterized by a high density in order to ﬁnd at\
    \ least one path between any two network nodes.\nMoreover, one of the major drawbacks\
    \ of this architecture is that it shortens the lifetime of the\nnetwork. The authors\
    \ in References [25,80–82] reported a problem of rapid depletion of batteries\
    \ from\nneighboring sensor nodes to the sink. The relay of data from the source\
    \ sensor to the sink is the source\nof the network’s nonuniform energy consumption.\
    \ Thus, neighboring sensor nodes at the sink, being\nthe most requested in the\
    \ data transfer to the sink, quickly exhaust their energies, and the sink, in\
    \ turn,\nis out of order. This fact reduces the lifetime of the network. For instance,\
    \ applications that use this\ntype of architecture include the VOLCANO [47], GLACSWEB\
    \ [83], and the Habitat Monitoring on\nGDI (Great Duck Island) projects [84].\n\
    4.1.2. Architecture with Sensor Nodes and Several Static Sinks\nUnlike the previous\
    \ architecture, the architecture with sensor nodes and several static sinks\n\
    (see Figure 15) consists of multiplying the number of sinks in the network in\
    \ order to increase the\nlifetime of the network. However, the problem of battery\
    \ depletion of the sensor nodes lying at a jump\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n22 of\
    \ 34\nfrom the sinks remains. Sensor nodes of this architecture, the choice of\
    \ one sink compared to another,\nremain a challenge in this kind of architecture\
    \ [85].\nFigure 15. Architecture with sensor nodes and several static sinks.\n\
    4.2. Architecture Based on Mobility\nIn order to maximize network lifetime and\
    \ reduce latency in WSNs, several works [48,86–88]\nhave introduced mobility into\
    \ WSNs. Mobility in WSNs is useful since it has a number of advantages\nthat include\
    \ good connectivity, reduced deployment cost, reliability, and energy efﬁciency\
    \ [84,89–91].\nAlthough mobility brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of increased\
    \ network lifetime, it presents\nseveral challenges for sensor networks. These\
    \ challenges (see Figure 16) are, among others, contact\ndetection, mobility-oriented\
    \ power management, reliable data transfer, QoS, location, and energy\nconsumption\
    \ [92–94].\nFigure 16. Challenges of mobility in a WSN.\nDifferent kinds of mobility\
    \ in WSNs have been proposed: static-sink architecture and moving\nsensor nodes,\
    \ architectures with mobile and static-sink sensor nodes, architectures with mobile\
    \ sinks\nand mobile sensor nodes, architectures with sensors, and multiple static-sink\
    \ architectures with sensors\nand multiple mobile sink and hybrid architectures.\n\
    4.2.1. Static Sink Architecture and Moving Sensor Nodes\nThis architecture has\
    \ the particularity that the sensors are mobile. This approach has been the\n\
    subject of much work in recent years [48,86–88]. By the fact that the sensors\
    \ are mobile, this architecture\nconsiderably reduces the number of sensors to\
    \ deploy. Communication in this architecture is direct.\nThis architecture helps\
    \ maintain good network coverage. Moreover, this architecture allows a balanced\n\
    consumption of energy at the sensor level, and the amount of data collected by\
    \ the sink is signiﬁcant.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n23 of 34\nFor instance, these\
    \ projects use this architecture in which sensor nodes move while the sink is\
    \ ﬁxed:\nthe COW project [95] and the CENWITS project [96].\n4.2.2. Architecture\
    \ with a Mobile Sink and Static Sensor Nodes\nUnlike the previous architecture,\
    \ all nodes are static and the sink is mobile here. Data collection\nis done once\
    \ the sink reaches a given sensor node and that sensor detects the presence of\
    \ the sink.\nThis architecture poses the problem of detection of the sink by the\
    \ sensor nodes. However, it represents\nan interesting solution, consisting of\
    \ using mobile agents to collect data gathered by the sensors.\nAkyildiz et al.\
    \ (2002) [33] as well as Jain et al. (2006) [42] reported that mobile agents called\
    \ MULEs\n(Mobile Ubiquitous LAN Extensions), mobile sinks, or mobile data collectors\
    \ move in a random or\ncontrolled way to collect data accumulated at the sensors\
    \ [26,97]. Data collection is done with the\napproach of the mobile agents of\
    \ the ﬁxed sensor nodes. These mobile agents can be humans, robots,\nanimals,\
    \ or vehicles. This architecture has the advantage of relaxing the constraint\
    \ of high densities in\nfavor of better connectivity to the WSN deployed in an\
    \ area of interest. Thus, such a WSN architecture\nhas the advantage of avoiding\
    \ collusion and loss of data induced by networks of wireless sensors with\nhigh\
    \ density of nodes as in References [41,79].\n4.2.3. Architecture with a Mobile\
    \ Sink and Mobile Sensor Nodes\nIn this architecture, mobility is considered at\
    \ the level of the sensor nodes as well as at the level of\nthe sinks. This architecture\
    \ has the same advantages as those of the mobile sink and the static sensor\n\
    node architectures. This architecture has been implemented in several scientiﬁc\
    \ and industrial research\nprojects. For instance, this architecture was implemented\
    \ as part of a zebra tracking project in Kenya;\nthe sensors were deployed on\
    \ zebras from Sweetwaters Reserve to Mpala in central Kenya, and the\nsink was\
    \ positioned on a vehicle. This project was one of the ﬁrst studies carried out\
    \ in the ﬁeld of\nenvironmental monitoring that simultaneously took into account\
    \ the mobility of nodes and sink. As a\ntype of application using this type of\
    \ architecture, we obviously mention this zebra tracking project\n(ZebraNet) [84].\n\
    4.2.4. Architecture with Sensors and Multiple Static Sinks\nThis architecture\
    \ differs from all architectures presented so far. It consists of using several\
    \ sinks\nwith a high density of sensor nodes. The data collected by the sensor\
    \ nodes are transmitted to the\nend users via one of the network sinks. The big\
    \ problem with this architecture lies in the difﬁculty of\nchoosing the sink.\
    \ One can also perceive the complexity of such a solution in Reference [81], which\n\
    proposes a routing optimization solution in a multi-to-many architecture. This\
    \ proposal also suffers\nfrom the clear problem of a lack of evolution. Indeed\
    \ if the sensor network grows, so as not to fall back\ninto the same problems\
    \ as a single-sink architecture, we would have to add sinks, which cannot be\n\
    done automatically. In addition, this solution still does not allow a direct connection\
    \ between the end\nuser and the sensor nodes.\n4.2.5. Architecture with Sensors\
    \ and Multiple Mobile Sinks\nThis strategy is almost identical to the previous\
    \ one, with the difference here being that the\nsinks are mobile. This solution\
    \ consists of placing a plurality of mobile sinks in a single WSN [98,99].\nAn\
    \ important problem with this solution is the difﬁculty of routing the data collected\
    \ by the sensors.\nJuang et al. (2002) [84] tried to solve this by proposing a\
    \ solution to optimize routing.\n4.2.6. Hybrid Architectures\nThere are also solutions\
    \ with a multisink architecture. The lifetime of the WSN could be signiﬁcant\n\
    when using multiple mobile receivers instead of static receivers in data collection.\
    \ Other works, with\nseveral mobile sinks, focused on reducing the energy consumed\
    \ by sensors, or to maximize the lifetime\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n24 of 34\n\
    of the global network. These proposals often come from a lack of scalability.\
    \ Indeed, if the size of the\nsensor network increases, it is to avoid the problems\
    \ of an architecture with a single sink, which can\nnot be done automatically.\
    \ Moreover, this solution does not allow a direct connection between the user\n\
    and the sensor.\n4.3. Comparison of Data-Collection Architectures in the Context\
    \ of LS-WSNs\nThe different architectures analyzed in this section each have advantages\
    \ and disadvantages,\nthe main reason being that the design of these architectures\
    \ is determined by the goals that we set.\nOtherwise, in the context of LS-WSNs,\
    \ the density of sensors deployed in a vast ﬁeld of interest is\nhigh. This makes\
    \ us say that even if mobility brings more advantages than inconveniences to the\n\
    sensor networks, if this mobility is on the side of the sensor nodes, it would\
    \ reduce the number of\nnodes to deploy. We can therefore say that these kinds\
    \ of architecture are not suitable for LS-WSNs.\nRegardless of what the sensor\
    \ and static-sink networks consume in terms of energy, they are adapted\nas the\
    \ network scales up. The real challenge remains the optimization of energy consumption\
    \ in this\nnetwork. For this, the different techniques used in the context of\
    \ so-called conventional WSNs must\nbe adapted to better respond to an environment\
    \ with a high concentration of sensors. A comparative\nstudy of the different\
    \ architectures is presented in Table 2.\nTable 2. Comparison of different data-collection\

    \ by the nodes must be transferred to a collection point in the network called\
    \ a\nsink. Routing is the process of ﬁnding a cost-effective route in terms of\
    \ power consumption in order\nto transfer the data from the sensor nodes to the\
    \ sink. The sink can be connected to a remote user\nvia Wimax, LTE, a satellite,\
    \ or another wide transmission system. The user can address requests to\nother\
    \ nodes in the network, specifying the type of required data and harvesting them\
    \ through the sink\nnode. Routing in LS-WSNs remain a very active area of research,\
    \ and several routing protocols have\nbeen proposed [12,36,100,103,105–108]. Recently,\
    \ routing protocols for WSNs have been the subject of\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    25 of 34\nseveral studies, and various studies have been published. These protocols\
    \ can be classiﬁed according\nto two main axes [45,79]: the structure of the network\
    \ and the type of operation to be performed\n(see Figure 17).\nFigure 17. Taxonomy\
    \ of routing protocols in WSNs.\n5.1. Network Structure-Based Routing Protocols\n\
    Routing protocols are distributed according to network structure, which plays\
    \ a very important\nrole in the data-routing process. There are three main categories\
    \ of protocols based on network\nstructure. These protocols are:\n•\nFlat routing.\
    \ Called ‘data centric’ as well, all sensor nodes here have the same tasks to\
    \ perform.\nThis is the ﬁrst approach used in the routing of data in the WSN.\
    \ It is based on the collaboration\nof all the nodes of the network. Data properties\
    \ are speciﬁed by a naming system by attribute\n(attribute, value) because of\
    \ the difﬁculty of assigning a global identiﬁer to each node given their\nlarge\
    \ number. Among their advantages is their simplicity, hence the possibility of\
    \ establishing\ncommunications at no additional cost where each node would only\
    \ need information from its\ndirect neighbors. The disadvantage is the depletion\
    \ of the energy resources of the nodes close to\nthe base station because all\
    \ trafﬁc toward the latter obligatorily passes by them.\n•\nHierarchical routing.\
    \ This approach is based on the formation of clusters (common areas) [36,85,100].\n\
    The principle is to route the data collected by each node of the cluster to its\
    \ head of area, the Cluster\nHead (CH), which, after processing their common parts,\
    \ forwards them to the next destination\n(If the CH cannot directly reach the\
    \ station, basic information is routed to the next zone leader).\nThe advantage\
    \ is the reduction of communication and energy costs by minimizing the number\n\
    of messages circulating on the network, since CHs apply aggregate functions on\
    \ the data of the\ncluster, which makes it possible to combine them. The disadvantage\
    \ concerns the size of the\nnetwork. In addition, as network size increases, the\
    \ CH election process becomes critical and\ngreedy in resources.\n•\nLocation-Based\
    \ Routing. The identiﬁcation of the geographic locations of the sensor nodes on\n\
    the gathering area is of paramount importance for the data-routing mechanisms\
    \ in the WSN.\nThis location information allows the calculation of sensor positions\
    \ and the distances between\nthem to build the shortest paths between a source\
    \ node and its destination. This routing approach\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n26\
    \ of 34\nis more energy-efﬁcient because it dispenses sensor nodes from using\
    \ random or probabilistic\nmethods to search for routes [109,110]. In addition,\
    \ the location of the nodes (and consequently\nof their regions) makes it possible\
    \ to only broadcast requests to these regions and to avoid their\ndiffusion in\
    \ broadcast mode (global diffusion to all the nodes), thus signiﬁcantly reducing\
    \ the\nnumber of transmissions. The disadvantage is the need to equip sensor nodes\
    \ with a satellite\ntracking system, such as GPS, which consumes a lot of energy.\n\
    5.2. Feature-Based Routing Protocols\nIn this section, routing protocols are categorized\
    \ according to the features they implement.\nThese features are based on data\
    \ routing, route selection, route discovery, and alternating routes.\n•\nRouting\
    \ protocols based on data routing. In this kind of protocol, each sensor node\
    \ must choose a\nnode of its neighborhood to deliver it the task of conveying\
    \ these data. This decision is made\nusing different techniques, including table-based\
    \ routing, broadcasting, and ﬁltering by neighbors,\nor ﬂooding.\n•\nRouting protocols\
    \ based on route selection. Route selection is the process of choosing the best\
    \ route to\na sink from the potential routes depending on the constraints of the\
    \ network and the sensor nodes.\nAlthough most protocols only choose a better\
    \ route (single-path routing), multipath protocols\nselect and save more than\
    \ one path for different purposes, such as energy, trafﬁc balance, reliability,\n\
    and robustness. The entities involved in the selection process may include the\
    \ source sensor node,\nthe intermediate nodes, or the sink node.\n•\nRouting protocols\
    \ based on route discovery. Each sensor node of a WSN acts as a router and\nparticipates\
    \ in the routing of data to the sink. Many debates and works have discussed when\
    \ and\nhow many routes each node must maintain in its routing table. Indeed, a\
    \ node must memorize\nthe roads to reach a sink, or only search and keep track\
    \ of roads when it has an interest in reaching\nthe sink. As a result, three types\
    \ of routing protocols are distinguished depending on how routes\nare maintained\
    \ in the routing tables. Route discovery is categorized into proactive, reactive,\
    \ and\nhybrid routing protocols.\n•\nRouting protocols based on alternating routes.\
    \ In a WSN, from a sensor node, a routing protocol can\nmaintain a single path\
    \ that allows it to reach a sink. It can also maintain multiple paths to reach\
    \ a\nsingle destination. We distinguish two classes of protocols: single path\
    \ and multiple paths.\n5.3. Data-Collection Steps in LS-WSNs\nThe ﬂowchart given\
    \ in Figure 18 summarizes the major steps of data collection in LS-WSNs.\nAccording\
    \ to application areas of sensor networks, the issue of deploying large-scale\
    \ sensor networks\nfor coverage purposes can be categorized into area-based coverage\
    \ deployment that requires sensors\nto be deployed in the whole ﬁeld, and location-based\
    \ coverage deployment that requires sensors to be\ndeployed in speciﬁc locations\
    \ [111]. The diffusion of control messages is commonly done by ﬂooding\n(and controlled-ﬂooding)\
    \ methods and gossiping methods [36]. Finally, the data-transferring step\nrelies\
    \ on knowledge recorded by the control message dissemination step to achieve data\
    \ collection by\nadopting either ﬂat-routing, hierarchical-routing, or location-based-routing\
    \ schemes.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n27 of 34\nFigure 18. Flowchart of data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs.\n6. Challenges of Big Data Collection in LS-WSNs\nWith increasingly\
    \ miniaturized and integrated sensors, a new paradigm of sensor networks is\n\
    emerging in LS-WSNs. These networks are based on the cooperation of a set of nodes\
    \ to perform\nvarious operations, such as monitoring and data collection, on the\
    \ environment in which they are\ndeployed. The term ‘large-scale’ refers to the\
    \ fact that these are networks deployed over a large area\nwith high sensor density.\
    \ Consequently, all techniques and methods that can be used in so-called small\n\
    WSNs cannot be directly used on these networks. They must undergo a modiﬁcation\
    \ to adapt to the\nextension of the network range. In general, a sensor is a resource-limited\
    \ device whose energy resources\nand sensors are deployed in most cases in hard-to-reach\
    \ areas, making it difﬁcult or impossible to\nchange the batteries. The management\
    \ of energy resources is a strategic issue to increase the duration\nof a sensor\
    \ network [24,46,108].\nEven though WSNs have been used in a number of applications,\
    \ data collection is the main\nactivity of WSNs, whether LS-WSNs or not. For researchers,\
    \ this operation consists of ﬁnding solutions\nto maximize data collection, and\
    \ for others to minimize the energy consumption at the level of the\nsensors.\
    \ In the literature [33,45], it appears that of all the basic functions of a sensor,\
    \ communication is\nthe most energy-consuming activity. This energy consumption\
    \ largely depends on communication\ndistance. Indeed, to reduce this consumption\
    \ and extend the life of the sensors, and therefore that\nof the network, several\
    \ techniques and methods have been developed in recent years. In most cases,\n\
    these methods relax several constraints, such as latency, coverage, and QoS, as\
    \ well as the Quality of\nExperience (QoE) of the network in favor of extending\
    \ network lifetime.\nIn addition, the requirements speciﬁed by data-collection\
    \ applications in LS-WSNs also lead to a\nnumber of issues that need to be considered.\
    \ Among them, WSN coverage is an essential issue in sensor\nnetwork deployment,\
    \ which must make sure that sensors deployment in a given area of interest may\n\
    need to allow an acceptable coverage, especially for certain WSNs’ applications.\
    \ Moreover, in certain\ncases, sensors should be located in particular locations\
    \ in order to more accurately gather data. This fact\nis important for industrial\
    \ 3D sensor networks or sensors deployed in aircrafts [112,113]. Furthermore,\n\
    the way and rate of acquiring data cannot be the same for different kinds of data,\
    \ such as vibration,\ntemperature, movement, and humidity [10,114,115]. These\
    \ issues, if not handled well, lead to an\nunbalanced energy consumption resulting\
    \ to power wastage and a short network lifetime. Otherwise,\ndelivering data to\
    \ the base station while minimizing the rate of data loss is also a challenge.\
    \ Some\nworks focus on network structuring and data aggregation [36,80,100,109,116,117],\
    \ while others rely on\nrouting techniques to reduce the energy consumption of\
    \ sensor nodes [12,46,103,118,119]. However,\noperations like data aggregation,\
    \ compression, and fusion remain difﬁcult to apply in the case of large\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n28 of 34\namounts of structured or unstructured data. It is,\
    \ therefore, necessary to develop novel schemes for\ndata collection in LS-WSNs.\n\
    Moreover, in terms of network structuring, hierarchical networks coupled with\
    \ clustering\ntechniques based on multihop communication seem to be the appropriate\
    \ solution for LS-WSNs.\nThese techniques reduce intranode transmission distance\
    \ in the routing of the collected data. This is\neconomical in terms of energy\
    \ consumption compared to direct communication, that is to say, that\neach sensor\
    \ node directly routes these data to the sink without a relay. In contrast, clustering\
    \ results\nin higher latency than in ﬂat structuring [120,121]. In addition, in\
    \ this type of architecture, the most\ncommon problem is called the access point\
    \ problem [122], that is to say, that sensor nodes that are\nin proximity to the\
    \ sink are rapidly depleting their energy compared to other sensor nodes. This\
    \ is\njustiﬁed by the high concentration of data trafﬁc to the sink. Thus, network\
    \ coverage rate is affected,\nwith an increased risk of sink disconnection.\n\
    Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of multihop communication, other works\
    \ propose\nto multiply the number of sinks within a network. Thus, a WSN can have\
    \ several static sinks [120].\nIn this architecture, in general, these sinks have\
    \ more hardware resources compared to other sensor\nnodes [94]. They are used\
    \ to collect data from other sensor nodes, and to reduce the energy consumed\n\
    in transmissions [120]. The data are then sent from the sinks to the end user\
    \ via an Internet or satellite\nconnection [94]. In this approach, the problem\
    \ is the choice of a sink compared to others. Thus, in most\njobs, metrics such\
    \ as distance are used to determine which sink is closest to the sensor node to\
    \ which\nthe data will be sent. However, the issue of the optimal deployment of\
    \ sinks remains a big problem,\nbecause it is difﬁcult to choose the right place\
    \ to deploy the sinks in order to balance the exchanges\nbetween nodes and sinks\
    \ [102,122]. Even though static sinks are deployed in optimal locations, we still\n\
    have the access point problem, which is that the nodes near the sinks consume\
    \ more power. Sinks can\nbe disconnected from the rest of the network if the surrounding\
    \ nodes exhaust their battery. Thus,\nthe optimal position of the sinks ensures\
    \ good coverage of the area of interest, but not permanent\ncoverage [93].\nAnother\
    \ study [81] proposed an approach based on sink mobility.\nIn addition to saving\n\
    energy consumption at the sensor level of sink mobility, it also satisfactorily\
    \ reduces increased data\nlatency [15,24,40]. By choosing to organize the cluster\
    \ network, this reduces the time spent in the\nsensor nodes and therefore increases\
    \ the frequency of its visits to the cluster heads. In addition, using\na method\
    \ called service cycle can further reduce power consumption [102,122].\nFurthermore,\
    \ the problem of storing and computing very large amounts of collected data from\n\
    LS-WSNs needs more attention. In this light, some companies, such as Nokia and\
    \ Apple, integrate\na number of sensors in their mobile phones and other smart\
    \ devices on the Internet. This leads to\nthe collection of petabytes of data\
    \ each year. Certainly, some distributed database solutions, such as\nGoogle’s\
    \ Bigtable, Amazon’s Dynamo, Windows’ Azure Storage, and Apache Hadoop, can achieve\n\
    the storage of such large amounts of data. However, unless these Big Data are\
    \ associated with\nprogramming models, such as Mapreduce, the existing distributed\
    \ database solutions cannot process\nthe large amount of data generated by sensors\
    \ from LS-WSNs. Unfortunately, a number of works are\nfocused on sensors’ interconnection\
    \ and power-efﬁcient WSNs [21,36,121]. In spite of the number of\ninteresting\
    \ challenges that should be addressed in sensor networks, large amounts of data\
    \ collection,\nstorage, and processing schemes in LS-WSNs should be developed.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nThe application prospects of WSNs are rich and varied. The use\
    \ of these networks in the context\nof Big Data shows the ability of these networks\
    \ to overcome inherent constraints to meet certain\nrequirements. In Big Data,\
    \ we expect a heterogeneous dataset that is continuously produced by the\nIoT\
    \ to such an extent that it cannot be captured, managed, and processed by traditional\
    \ systems. Such\ndata, given their characteristics, are an interesting challenge\
    \ for their acquisition and processing by\nLS-WSNs. In this paper, we conducted\
    \ a comprehensive review that proposes a better approach to\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n29 of 34\nthe collection of Big Data. Thus, in this context, to better\
    \ address the issue of collecting Big Data, we\nﬁrst presented horizontal overviews\
    \ of WSNs and Big Data. Then, we reviewed Big Data collection\narchitectures,\
    \ as well as data-transferring schemes. Moreover, the challenges of Big Data collection\n\
    in LS-WSNs have been discussed. From the systematic analysis of standpoints of\
    \ various authors\nregarding Big Data collection in LS-WSNs, we provided a detailed\
    \ review of the open issues with their\nassociated challenges in order to motivate\
    \ and guide future researchers.\nFunding: This research was funded by PHC-Tassili,\

    • Technology is an integral component of many of the proposed mitigation measures.
    • There exists an urgent need for education on e-waste impact on the environment.
    • Greater focus is needed on responsible digitalization to engender sustained
    change. • Alignment of smart initiatives to SDGs is an underdeveloped research
    area. • Greater awareness is needed on lived in realities of environmental tradeoffs.
    Abstract The UN COP26 2021 conference on climate change offers the chance for
    world leaders to take action and make urgent and meaningful commitments to reducing
    emissions and limit global temperatures to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels
    by 2050. Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental
    and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective
    where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential
    solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore
    these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based
    insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges
    through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its
    forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and
    wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly,
    researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate
    the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral
    component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires
    pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate
    friendly society. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Climate

    Development Goals (SDGs) 1. Introduction The 2021 United Nations (UN) Climate
    Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow UK, brings together many of the worlds’
    leaders to address the critical aspects of global warming. The conference aims
    to gain commitment for sustained progress towards the Paris Agreement and UN framework
    convention on climate change, by limiting increased global temperatures to 1.5
    °C above pre-industrial levels (COP26, 2021). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change (IPCC) identified in its 2018 report that global emissions would need to
    be at net zero by at least 2050 to retain a “high confidence” level of limiting
    temperature increases to sustainable levels (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). In
    her speech at the conference, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that -
    “rising to this challenge will require the wholesale transformation of our carbon-intensive
    economies," and that "addressing climate change is the greatest economic opportunity
    of our time." (COP26, 2021). The transition toward net zero requires significant
    changes at a societal and industrial level and governments, as well as corporations,
    are increasingly turning to technological innovations to meet net zero emission
    targets (Miller, 2020). Digital technologies offer the potential to deliver sustained
    solutions to many of the seemingly intractable societal challenges relating to
    climate change (George, Merrill, & Schillebeeckx, 2021). The World Economic Forum
    (WEF) in its - Harnessing Technology for the Global Goals report, jointly authored
    with PwC, identifies the significant role that digital technology can play in
    improving resilience to global warming related, natural hazards, reducing emissions
    and enhancing the ability for humans to take the necessary steps to realize net
    zero. The WEF report identifies how digital technologies can help to automate
    and significantly improve the efficiency of industrial, manufacturing and agricultural
    processes and that Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems could contribute
    to a reduction of 4% in global emissions by 2030 (World Economic Forum & PwC,
    2021). Although advancements in technologies are closely associated with offering
    solutions to global warming, the digital discourse also highlights the negative
    impacts of the widespread use of technology in the context of waste products,
    resource usage and CO2 emissions. The widely reported impact of vast bitcoin mining
    farms in various parts of the world and their appetite for significant energy
    consumption - 121.36 terawatts hours per year (CBECI, 2021) – illustrates the
    dichotomy of rapid technological advancement and potential barriers to net zero
    by 2050 (Mora et al., 2018). The debates surrounding the convergence of the digital
    and net zero imperatives are beginning to gain traction within the academic literature,
    where studies have started to focus on the role of digital technologies through
    a positive contribution lens, but also a reflective perspective, recognizing some
    of the negative aspects of the rapid adoption of technology (George et al., 2021,
    Merrill et al., 2019). What is clear is that, whilst the emerging diverse and
    disparate discourse has offered insight to many of the significant challenges
    and barriers to net zero from the digital perspective (George et al., 2016, Luo
    et al., 2016), there exists a limited contribution from a wider and more informed
    multiple perspective context. This study contributes to the digital technology
    and climate change discourse, via the individual discussions on a multitude of
    interrelated sub-topics. Each invited expert has offered their own unique insight
    to the myriad of complexities and dependencies to attaining net zero by 2050.
    The remaining sections of this article are organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    a brief review of existing literature in this space. Section 3 presents the experts’
    perspectives related to core themes surrounding information management (IM)/information
    technology (IT)/information systems (IS) and climate change. Section 4 - presents
    an overview of the key perspectives from the submitted full opinion articles.
    The main discussion section is presented in Section 5, where we assess the significant
    challenges and key contributions from the invited expert submissions. Section
    6 concludes the paper by discussing implications for both research and practice.
    2. Background literature review The primary database used for the literature search
    was Scopus. Keywords such as “information systems” or “information technology”
    or “IT sector” were combined (AND operator) with keywords “environment”, “sustainability”,
    “sustainable” and “climate”. The search taxonomy retrieved articles that had the
    combination of keywords in the article title, author keywords, or abstract. Via
    a process of filtering to eliminate non-relevant studies, a total of 372 articles
    remained. These articles were evaluated via their abstract to assess their suitability
    against the following two research questions. • RQ1: Does the digital technology
    and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment and how can it be reduced?
    • RQ2: How can digital technology and IS/IT be utilized to mitigate the causes
    and impact of climate change? After a further process of scanning of the title
    and abstract for the relevance of the article to the research questions, 88 articles
    remained. Additionally, ScienceDirect and Web of Science were also used, following
    similar approaches which resulted in 16 additional articles. 2.1. (RQ1) Does the
    digital technology and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment
    and how can it be reduced? Despite the contribution of the IS/IT industry toward
    the economic and social welfare of society, IS/IT has often been criticized for
    having a negative environmental impact. Concerns surrounding the adverse effects
    both hardware and software have on the environment date back to the Y2K era which
    led to the massive adoption of enterprise systems (Miyamoto, Harada, & Fujimoto,
    2001). These negative impacts include high levels of energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions and toxic disposal of IS/IT systems (Muregesan, 2008). The disposal
    of electronic waste (e-waste) while following recycling processes has been widely
    viewed as not being environmentally friendly, especially the impact of fossil
    fuels or respiratory inorganics (Barba-Gutiérrez, Adenso-Diaz, & Hopp, 2008).
    Refurbished ICTs are often used in developing countries where devices tend to
    have a short life-span and subsequently create environmental damage during disposal
    (Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). Studies have argued that electricity is a major cause
    of climate change, as many power stations throughout the world still rely on fossil
    fuels to generate electricity (Asongu et al., 2020, Tamburini et al., 2015). Energy
    hungry technologies such as applications of blockchain in the form of bitcoin,
    has been widely criticized for producing over 22–29 million metric tonnes of carbon
    dioxide emission each year. These figures are comparable to the carbon dioxide
    production of entire countries such as Jordan and Sri Lanka (Marr, 2018, Stoll
    et al., 2019). Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and
    actuators have a shorter lifespan which leads to increased waste in the environment
    (Chakraborty and Gupta, 2016, Chakraborty et al., 2014, Nižetić et al., 2020).
    Digital transformation initiatives such as smart cities have concerns surrounding
    ICT waste management, energy management and emission management which needs to
    be addressed for achieving long term sustainability and viability (Ismagilova,
    Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019). From an IS/IT perspective, IoT and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) could potentially offer solutions for reducing the impact of
    technology projects (Salam, 2020). High ICT-driven initiatives need to plan for
    sustainability by thinking from the perspective of social welfare and e-waste
    impact (Kar, Ilavarasan, Gupta, Janssen, & Kothari, 2019). Wireless communication
    technologies need adaptations so that emissions can be further reduced. AI can
    operate with such technologies to enhance the usage of bandwidth and energy consumption
    to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the telecom sector Ullah et al.
    (2020). Similarly, AI integrated with blockchain has been found to positively
    impact water management and climate control (Lin, Petway, Lien, & Settele, 2018).
    AI can manage and reduce energy consumption within smart cities (Şerban & Lytras,
    2020). Studies have identified that blockchain applications can improve sustainable
    practices in supply chain management and agricultural practices (Kshetri, 2021).
    Similarly, within nano-technology applications, AI has provided benefits through
    better precision in agricultural water distribution delivering positive impacts
    on efficient use of natural resources. The communication of sustainability related
    messages within social media has greatly increased during the pandemic (Grover
    et al., 2019, Grover et al., 2021, Yadav et al., 2021). The literature has highlighted
    that during crisis periods IS research can provide “signposting” for sustainability
    actions through improved digital monitoring, tackling information flow and paranoia,
    and orchestrating data ecosystems for improved decision making (Pan & Zhang, 2020).
    The focus towards renewable energy has increased dramatically. The IRENA (2021)
    report indicates that jobs in sustainability and cleaner energy are increasing
    exponentially year on year, especially in solar and wind energy. This shift towards
    greener energy consumption is common across industries producing and consuming
    technology products and services. There is evidence that if stakeholders are convinced
    about energy management, their engagement in Green IS/IT programs will increase
    (Nyberg, 2018). The literature highlights the use of theories such as: Institutional
    Theory, Resource Based View, Technology Organization Environment framework, Theory
    of Planned Behavior and Motivational Theory as the dominant models used in the
    IS literature (Asadi & Dahlan, 2017). Lesser used theoretical lenses such as:
    Upper Echelon Theory, Self Determination Theory, Green Theory, Norm Activation
    Model, Elaboration Likelihood Model, Dynamic Capability Theory, Actor-Network
    Theory and Expectancy Theory. could be used to explore future research relating
    to environmental impacts of technology. (Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. Snapshot

    2.2. (RQ2) How can digital technology and IS/IT be utilized to mitigate the causes
    and impact of climate change? As early as 2008, Murugesan (2008) provided directions
    towards a greener IS/IT strategy. A holistic focus towards Greener IT entails
    reducing the energy consumption of computational devices. It also gives directions
    on reuse, refurbish and recycling of IS/IT products. Such a focus requires an
    organizational imperative as indicated by Butler (2011), whereby the study draws
    on institutional theory to explain the multitude of forces acting on organizations
    from the institutional, environment and organizational fields for environmental
    sustainability. Reduction of carbon based energy consumption directly leads to
    reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The study by Simmonds and Bhattacherjee
    (2012) indicates that existing IT infrastructure, alignment of business strategy
    and relative advantages of green IT initiatives, have an overall positive impact
    on the adoption of IT initiatives within firms. Recent IT/IS literature indicates
    that technology can be a solution for better environmental management and sustainability.
    For example, Wang X. (2015), Wang Y. (2015) highlights that IS/IT competence enables
    the integration of technology within the environmental management processes to
    improve performance. The same study demonstrated the positive impact of IT competence
    on IT-environmental management integration. The research by Jnr (2020) indicates
    that there is a significant relationship between integrated technologies and Green
    IS/IT innovation. The study by Ojo and Fauzi (2020) indicates that environmental
    awareness and leadership commitment positively impacts engagement in Green IS/IT
    practices. Further Marques et al. (2019) highlight that universities now consider
    emissions and Green IT principles to reduce the adverse impacts on the climate,
    while designing their curriculum. Audits in Green IT in enterprises help to enhance
    focus towards maintaining environmental orientation and better impacts on climate
    (Patón-Romero et al., 2021). These audits offer a view on the organization''s
    position along the green IT capability maturity model from ISO/IEC 15504 to ISO/IEC
    33000. Within workplace infrastructure management, sensors and actuators are often
    being used for water management and energy consumption in smart buildings (toilet
    management, ventilation and air quality management) and smart devices (like air
    conditioners and lighting systems). These technologies have been observed to have
    brought in wide positive impacts on the climate within the existing literature
    (Zarindast, Sharma, & Wood, 2021). For example, blockchain applications are not
    always energy hungry, and often applications in different use cases such as SolarCoin
    and VerdePay may actually help in reducing carbon footprints (Howson, 2019). Applications
    of analytical models for information management enables more efficient energy
    management in smart cities (Gellert, Florea, Fiore, Palmieri, & Zanetti, 2019).
    Blockchain applications may enable a more efficient IoT ecosystem and thereby
    reduce energy consumption (Sharma et al., 2020). AI technologies such as deep
    learning together with big data analytics have been used for image mining for
    underwater environment management and air quality management (Kushwaha et al.,
    2021, Nair et al., 2021). Driven by the pandemic, working from home has significantly
    increased, which has drastically reduced travel to workplaces, thereby reducing
    the carbon footprint from travel and maintaining office infrastructure. This change
    toward a work from home culture has been facilitated using video conferencing
    and collaboration systems enabled through ICTs (Chakraborty and Kar, 2021, Galanti
    et al., 2021, Richter, 2020). A recent review on AI and its possible impacts towards
    sustainability argue that AI will play a critical role beyond enabling better
    consumption of energy, water, and land usage, and it will facilitate environmental
    governance with greater effectiveness (Nishant et al., 2020). Whilst the literature
    has exhibited an emerging focus on Green IS and sustainability within the information
    management literature, there is still tremendous scope for impactful research
    on many aspects of the use of technology to combat climate change. 3. Multiple
    perspectives from invited contributors This section, in alignment with the approach
    set out in previous studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021a, Dwivedi et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), develops a set of
    unique expert contribution narratives that explore many of the key topics related
    to digital and IS technologies and climate change. This topic has numerous threads
    and interdependencies as many of the invited experts offer their own perspectives
    and viewpoints on the topic. The expert contributions are largely presented in
    an unedited form, as expressed by each of the contributors. The perceived unevenness
    of the logical flow inherent with this approach is countered by the capturing
    of the distinctive orientations of the expert perspectives related to the chosen
    topic (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015). The list of contributions is provided in

    and information technology – Professor Robert M. Davison 3.1.1.1. Some issues
    I think that IM/IT/IS has a profoundly negative impact on the environment in ways
    that are largely invisible. For instance, the devices that we use, particularly
    batteries, require the inclusion of rare earth elements, notably tantalum. This
    is mined from Coltan. Major deposits of coltan are found in DR Congo (Wikipedia,
    2021) where open cast mines blight the landscape. In addition, hundreds of small
    scale independent miners look for their own spoils. The impact on the environment
    is considerable, and this includes the local wildlife that used to live in the
    area, notably the Eastern Mountain Gorilla. Militias are often employed to protect
    the mines and their all-too valuable minerals, but these militias may abuse the
    local people, wildlife and more (YouTube, 2017). At a more visible level, the
    devices that we use require huge amounts of electricity, whether for the extraction
    and refinement process, the manufacturing process or the simple use of the end
    products. Where does the electricity come from? Well, that depends on where you
    live. You might be fortunate enough to live in a country that depends to a large
    extent on renewable energy resources (or at least gives you the option to source
    your electricity from such sources) – solar, hydro, wind, geothermal or wave for
    instance. But you might also live, as billions of people do, in a country that
    relies on coal or oil for energy production. Thus, to operate your devices, you
    are directly contributing to the coal economy and to further global warming via
    the CO2 that is emitted when coal is burned. How can the negative effect be reduced?
    The answer is simple but painful: we need to keep our existing devices in use
    for much longer than we currently do. We need to avoid the temptation to update
    our devices as soon as the next version is available. Here devices include: phones,
    tablets, notebooks, cameras, electric cars and any other device with significant
    battery use. We can’t eliminate the negative effects but we can reduce them. 3.1.1.2.
    Research agenda I think that a valid research agenda has to include the concept
    of sustainability. Tan B. (2021) are currently editing a special issue of the
    ISJ on IS and Sustainable Development. They note that the 2015 UN Agenda for Sustainable
    Development includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 associated
    targets to be achieved by 2030 (United Nations Department of Economic & Social
    Affairs, 2015). These goals and targets constitute a research agenda in their
    own right, though not all are immediately applicable to IM/IS/IT. Meanwhile, Walsham
    (2012) argues that there is a need to undertake IS research that demonstrates
    how we can make the world a better place. To provide some other context, however,
    Clarke and Davison (2020) noted that almost no IS research, at least as published
    in the Association for Information Systems’ basket of eight journals (EJIS, ISJ,
    ISR, JAIS, JIT, JMIS, JSIS, MISQ), included the environment as a key stakeholder
    or treated the environmental perspective as a matter of importance. Thus, the
    track record in IS is not particularly rosy. We have a long way to go. 3.1.1.3.
    Education I teach Green IS issues to my MBA students: we identify and discuss
    issues concerning how green IS really is, including many of the issues raised
    in this editorial. We look at the topic from a policy perspective and consider
    what actions organizations can take to ensure that they genuinely adopt a green
    culture and implement green measures. This is particularly relevant to corporate
    social responsibility and the triple bottom line (Elkington, 1997). 3.1.2. Contribution
    2 – digital platforms in combating climate change: user engagement tools and digital
    traces of climate footprints – Professor Ioanna Constantiou and Professor Morten
    Thanning Vendelø In spite of the increasing awareness about the consequences of
    climate change, many individuals continue to fail in adjusting their behaviors
    and lifestyles in order to lessen their impact on the climate. While mottos like
    “think globally, act locally” urges people to consider the health of the entire
    planet and to take action in their own communities and cities, they do not seem
    to significantly contribute to combating climate change. Many individuals appear
    to experience difficulties in understanding how their behavioral patterns and
    choices affect the climate of the planet, although the most recent UN Climate
    Report shows that with no changes in greenhouse gas emissions the increase in
    the global temperatures will rise to 2.7 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100
    (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). Hence, alternative means of influencing
    consumer behavior are required. Digital technologies can support individuals in
    developing connections between their behavioral patterns, and the ongoing changes
    in the global climate as well as identify and choose alternatives to these behavioral
    patterns (Schroder, Prockl, & Constantiou, 2021). Digital platforms can support
    combating climate change by providing marketplaces where transactions can be made
    in more cost efficient and climate friendly ways, promote sustainable product
    innovation or inform consumers about their climate footprints. The abundance of
    data available to digital platforms can be used for activities that promote sustainable
    options and motivating climate friendly behaviors. For example, applications tracking
    user physical activity can quantify climate impacts and thereby nudge users to
    consider more sustainable options of public transportation (e.g., based on CO2
    emissions of different means of transportation). Another area of interest is reduction
    of food waste. A number of digital platforms have recently emerged with related
    visions. Building on the logic of collaborative consumption and social entrepreneurship
    (Schroder et al., 2021), digital platforms such as Eat Grim provide a marketplace
    for selling vegetables and fruits that do not match industry standards based on
    appearance to consumers. Their aim is to change the consumers’ perceptions of
    appearance related quality standards of what is edible and nudge their users to
    eat vegetables and fruits by focusing on other criteria such as freshness, or
    nutrition value of the vegetables and fruits. By redistributing these products
    to their consumers from restaurants or other retail shops, they reduce food waste.
    Another example is the digital platform Too Good To Go that connects customers
    to restaurants and stores, mainly bakeries, that have unsold food surplus. The
    surplus food is sold to consumers at discounted prices instead of being wasted.
    Finally, Plant Jammer is another platform that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    and fight climate change through sustainable cooking and plant-based food. Consumers
    reduce waste in their home by using ingredients that would normally be wasted
    due to lack of knowledge on how to combine through recipes in their daily meals.
    These platforms provide multi sided marketplaces (Parker, Van Alstyne, & Choudary,
    2016) governed by loose control mechanisms and apply pricing structures for cost
    compensation, hence display low intensity of competition (Constantiou, Marton,
    & Tuunainen, 2017). Based on the data they collect they can develop new mechanisms
    to engage users. Customer engagement, is a multidimensional tool, rooted in marketing
    and social psychology, and described as “the level of an individual customer’s
    motivational, brand-related and context-dependent state of mind characterized
    by specific levels of cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity in direct brand
    interactions’’ (Hollebeek, 2011, p. 790). These dimensions cover three key activities
    that can support consumer transition to more climate friendly behaviors. Techniques
    displaying a quantified climate footprint based on the individual behaviors that
    are tracked by platforms, could stimulate cognitive activities towards combating
    climate changes, for example considering the impact of specific food choices,
    e.g., daily consumption of meat. This can lead to behavioral changes when multisided
    platforms make more environmentally friendly options easily accessible and economically
    attractive as observed with platforms combating food waste. Finally, gamification
    or other nudging techniques that stimulate emotions, either positive or negative,
    can reinforce consumer engagement with different platforms combating climate changes.
    The success of such mechanisms is reliant on increasing levels of user engagement
    with the platform where user behaviors can eventually be replaced with more climate
    friendly ones. 3.1.3. Contribution 3 – faith and climate change – Dr. Iyad Abumoghli
    While the world''s religious and spiritual traditions did not traditionally face
    climate change in the way society has come to know it since the mid-20th century,
    peoples throughout history have always lived through and had to deal with extreme
    and erratic weather events. Comparable notions of climate change have been expressed
    in the world’s different religions through their texts and teachings. There is
    no singular perspective or monolithic view of climate change within highly diverse
    faith and religious traditions. Within the same religion, adherents may hold different
    views and perspectives on climate change and humanity''s relationship with nature.
    However, there are general perspectives developed in consultation with adherents
    of represented faith groups. Naturally, they are taken from those who accept the
    scientific consensus on climate change. The Buddhist perspective on climate change,
    for example, is presented as the ecological consequences of our own collective
    karma. Therefore, it is not just an ecological crisis, but a spiritual one too.
    Within the broad sphere of Christianity, Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si,
    provides a high-level perspective on Catholicism’s views on climate change. He
    argues that climate change is a global problem and that humanity has a moral obligation
    to address it at all levels of society (UN News, 2015). Climate change can be
    explained through the Daoist concepts of Ying and Yang. The carbon balance between
    the earth and sky is off balance causing instability and disasters. Thus, climate
    change can be viewed as a manifestation of humanity’s failure to maintain harmony
    with nature. The Hindu Declaration on Climate Change states that “today we call
    on all Hindus to expand our conception of dharma (duty). We must consider the
    effects of our actions not just on ourselves and those humans around us, but also
    on all beings. Addressing climate change from an Islamic perspective, is about
    assuming the role as trustee or steward (khalifa) of creation that God bestowed
    upon humanity. This trusteeship applies to all life forms and ecosystems, in their
    full diversity and richness, reflecting the glory of their creator. Today, the
    balance (mizan) of nature has been disturbed by human activity and choices which
    have resulted in overconsumption, overexploitation and overuse of resources, ultimately
    leading to environmental degradation and climate change. Climate change is already
    manifesting itself in highly localized contexts, directly impacting Indigenous
    ways of life. Therefore, climate change does not just represent an abstract scientific
    issue, but rather a very real and dangerous threat to livelihoods and culture.
    Adherents from all the world’s religions and faith traditions agree that climate
    change represents an immense threat that must be overcome, for the sake of humanity,
    the environment and all living beings we share Earth with. This common understanding
    has led to an increase in faith, intrafaith and interfaith efforts to address
    it. These serve as an acknowledgment of the overwhelming scientific evidence that
    climate change is indeed human-induced. Faith actors can play a crucial role here
    given that faith permeates into all areas of life and can inspire the behavioral
    changes necessary to address climate change. As a testament to growing faith engagement,
    in the lead-up to COP21, held in Paris at the end of 2015, many Faith leaders
    and organizations called on governments to take climate change seriously and commit
    to addressing it. This formed part of a much broader global advocacy movement
    that helped lead to the creation of the Paris Agreement and the climate measures
    contained within it. In October 2021, in the lead up to COP26, more than 40 faith
    leaders met at the Vatican and submitted a Faith Appeal to the president of COP26
    linking Faith to Science and calling upon nations to increase their ambitions
    and committing their organizations to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.
    This process has been only effective in engaging faith leaders over a period of
    seven months through information technology systems and online capabilities of
    applications. UNEP’s Faith for Earth Initiative was founded to accelerate and
    solidify precisely this spirit of interfaith collaboration, ensuring that faith
    actors had a voice at the highest level of environmental governance and greater
    access to the UN system. The interfaith initiative introduces the cultural, spiritual
    and ethical dimensions of sustainable development that faith actors bring into
    the implementation of the SDGs, particularly those related to the environment.
    Since its founding Faith for Earth has hosted and participated in multiple interreligious
    conferences, workshops, webinars and events, encouraging faith actors to come
    together and tackle common issues of climate change and environmental degradation.
    Faith actors can play an important role by providing a moral voice to the climate
    change crisis. Combining spiritual ethics with climate knowledge and science can
    serve to drive behavioral change amongst adherents, more than either one can alone.
    Substantial and widespread changes in public attitudes are essential to tackle
    climate change. Given that faith permeates into all areas of life, authoritative
    faith voices can be strong drivers in motivating people for action. Indeed, given
    that many religions already advocate environmentally friendly behaviors as part
    of their core values such as living with fewer material luxuries, caring for creation
    or dietary restrictions, there are strong traditions to draw upon. Faith groups
    across the globe are bringing religious teachings into thousands of projects on
    the ground to protect people and nature from the effects of climate change and
    pollution. By leading by example, FBOs can inspire positive action in communities
    to begin the transformation to a carbon-neutral sustainable society from the bottom
    up. Faith-based organizations have been using information technology to communicate
    with the world and pass their messages online, either directed to their congregations
    or to others through mainly social media and networks. Sharing publications, articles
    and courses has become easier for the faith communities. Climate change campaigns
    are among the most active ones among the faith communities. 3.1.4. Contribution
    4 – the pros and cons of IM/IT/IS on climate change and future directions – Professor
    Bhimaraya Metri 3.1.4.1. How the IM/IT/IS sector is having a negative impact on
    the environment and how it can be reduced The IS/ICT sector is a net source of
    global greenhouse gas emissions. The data centers used to power digital services
    now contribute approximately 2% of global GHG emissions – on par with the aviation
    sector (UNFCCC, 2016). The digital technology industry is one of the least sustainable
    and most environmentally damaging industrial sectors in the modern world (Junior,
    Majid, & Romli, 2018). If we are aiming to utilize technology as a mitigating
    factor for climate change we need to reform the way technology is used at different
    sectors, causing substantial damages: 3.1.4.2. Replacement rather than repair
    A consistent shift in the consumption pattern which pushes replace over repair
    is causing huge overheads on the environment. Companies like Apple are systematically
    discouraging self-repairs or repair at affordable prices thus pushing for replacement.
    3.1.4.3. Software upgrades pushing hardware replacements Innovation and upgradation
    in the technologies sector are simultaneously pushing the hardware upgrades. These
    upgrades often leave the legacy hardware unusable leading to e-waste. 3.1.4.4.
    E-waste Increasing digitalization is giving rise to the problem of e-waste. Much
    e-waste contains concentrated amounts of potentially harmful products, and this
    shows little sign of abating. In the absence of clear policy on e-waste flow management
    (Frazzoli, Orisakwe, Dragone, & Mantovani, 2010), the world produces about 50
    million tonnes of e-waste, with only 20% of it being dealt with sustainably (UN
    report, 2019, WEF report, 2019). 3.1.4.5. Technology driving electricity demand
    The overall demand for electricity from the digital technology sector is growing
    rapidly (Jones, 2018). It is further predicted that ICT networks could use about
    20% of the world’s electricity by 2025. The World Economic Forum (WEF, 2021) report
    stated, “by 2020, Bitcoin mining could be consuming the same amount of electricity
    every year as is currently used by the entire world”. Currently at the start of
    2020, Bitcoin alone has a carbon footprint of 34.73 Mt CO2 (equivalent to the
    carbon footprint of Denmark), it consumes 73.12 TWh of electrical energy (comparable
    to the power consumption of Austria), and it produces 10.95 kt of e-waste (equivalent
    to that of Luxembourg). Future projections relating to Smart Cities, 5 G and the
    Internet of Things give rise to additional concerns over energy demand Carroll
    and Heiser (2010). The negative outcomes of IT on the environment are further
    going to be increased with the advent of these new technologies. Even proliferation
    of Satellite Constellations could be a challenge (David, 2017). 3.1.4.6. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change Recent reports have
    highlighted that IT/IS can lead to a more efficient and sustainable energy consumption
    using smart grids, smart housing and smart logistics. Statistics suggest a possible
    fifteen percent reduction in the emission of green-house gases- close to the annual
    emissions of China. There are many initiatives to reduce energy consumption and
    carbon emissions. Japan’s $32 million Green IT Project promotes highly energy
    efficient ICTs in three areas. It aims to reduce energy consumption of network
    components and data centers by more than 30%. And Japan is experimenting with
    organic light-emitting diodes to cut the power consumption of displays by 50%
    (GZR, 2020). Technology can also offer cost-effective market-driven solutions,
    using sensors, software and networks. Technologies can also help monitor and evaluate
    climatic conditions and change and may help mitigate natural disasters. We also
    need to have supported policies and regulations for green energy. Supporting demand
    for green technologies is only one step. Certain pacts undertaken by regulatory
    bodies such as the European commission and united nations, also pave the way to
    regularize sustainable technology development. One such pact is the European Green
    Digital Coalition between the European Commission and United Nations Environment
    Programme. We have to ensure that new technology development is cognisant of impending
    climate changes. One of the ways to enable technology development that conforms
    to environment and sustainability goals is for governments to penalize technology
    developers that fail to adhere to global warming constraints. Leaders in the IT
    sector need to ensure that new technology developments and innovations are guided
    by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prescribed by the UN. Further, government
    and regulatory authorities may promote climate friendly IT innovations by prescribing
    the necessary guidelines and incentives for better e-waste management and lower
    energy demands. 3.1.4.7. A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS
    and climate change Climate-change mitigating technology is a wide research area
    where researchers are attempting to gain more insights into the technology portfolio
    which can be utilized to mitigate the climate changes such as carbon emission,
    energy consumption and e-waste (McLaren and Markusson, 2020, Wang et al., 2018).
    Some of the other relevant research areas are. • Reuse/ recycle and sustainable
    manufacturing • Closed supply chain and e-waste removal • Reducing waste and efficient
    consumption using technology • Monitoring of natural disasters using technology.
    • Zero power ICT solutions • e-waste management • Circular economy • Green IT
    • Energy Management for data centers and telecommunication networks • Leveraging
    data science and Artificial Intelligence for predicting climatic changes and natural
    disasters 3.1.4.8. How IS/IT education should reflect this There is a need for
    including the impact of IT/IS on climate change in the curriculum across all disciplines
    (Perkins et al., 2018). There is a severe lack of awareness around the topics
    of climate change and how it connects to digitalization and technology transformations.
    There is a very swift adoption of new courses such as industry 4.0, blockchain
    technologies and IoT across premier educational institutions. However, courses
    discussing the flip side of these technologies in the context of climate change
    and sustainability are scarce. In addition to this, courses that introduce climate
    change mitigation technologies can be a good addition to start a conversation
    around climate change issues. 3.1.5. Contribution 5 – the role of online communities
    in supporting digital activism on climate change – Professor Niki Panteli COP26
    gives us the opportunity to reflect on our role as IS researchers on how IS/IT
    can support climate change. I draw on my personal interest and knowledge of online
    communities and digital platforms, to posit that IS has an enabling and empowering
    role in the promotion of climate change. My position in this editorial was triggered
    by an article in which the Swedish teenager and activist Greta Thunberg wrote
    in the Guardian (Thunberg, 2021), where she criticized world leaders for being
    in denial over the climate crisis. Indeed, there seems to be a catastrophic myopia
    among world leaders on current and emerging environmental threats and the challenges
    that climate change is causing to our planet. Instead of government and officials
    leading these debates, transparency of the challenges that humanity faces has
    been achieved by school children, teenagers and young adults around the world.
    The role of IS has been invaluable in providing a platform for these young activists
    to be heard, to form a community, to grow a collective voice and ultimately to
    lead on debates and protests and increase awareness on the climate crisis. A notable
    example of an IS-enabled climate change movement is the “School Strike 4 Climate”
    which was initiated and led by Greta Thunberg. Boulianne, Lalancette, and Ilkiw
    (2020) studied one of the school strikes in 2019 which was linked to this specific
    social movement and found that the online media in particular Twitter were used
    to share diverse sets of information such as local events, tactics for protesting,
    and opinions of climate change and blame of governments and other institutions
    for inaction and compliance on issues related to climate change. According to
    the same study, online platforms are transforming political engagement whilst
    offering the younger generation the means to express their ideas and voice their
    concerns to a global audience. Activism has been portrayed as a collective action
    (Landzelius, 2006), which can be orientated towards challenging the status-quo,
    and putting pressures on world leaders, corporations, communities, groups and
    individuals to make much needed changes. Digital activism can maintain activism
    traditional characteristics namely its collective nature and transformational
    purpose (George & Leidner, 2019), whilst its dynastic feature is that it relies
    on the use of online media and digital platforms with the purpose of reaching
    global audiences and mobilizing large-scale protests worldwide (Askanius & Uldam,
    2011). Online communities (OCs) offer the ground for breeding activism as they
    provide opportunities for individuals who regardless of their location voluntarily
    form a social aggregation through an online platform for sharing interests, knowledge
    and experiences (Rheingold, 1993). OCs can be used for providing a shelter for
    their members (Vaast & Levina, 2015) and a sense of place where members feel empowered
    to freely express themselves and get involved in stimulating discussions (Panteli,
    2016). The growth and sustainability of these communities depends on members’
    involvement. Mutual understanding among members (Ma & Agarwal, 2007) as well as
    group attachment and identification (Panteli and Sivunen, 2019, Ren et al., 2007)
    have been found to be crucial for OC success. In our research on digital activism,
    we studied the case of MedicineAfrica, an online health community (see Chamakiotis,
    Petrakaki, & Panteli, 2021), which had the aim to provide medical education and
    improve clinical practices in fragile, post-war countries. Findings showed that
    it is not so much the technological affordances of digital platforms—namely to
    inform, to network and to organize (Tim, Pan, Bahri, & Fauzi, 2018)—but it is
    primarily their potential to set up an online collective of like-minded individuals
    that allows this form of digital activism to succeed. Similarly, Cardoso, Boudreau,
    and Carvalho (2019) posited that though digital platforms can be used to organize
    collective action, the extent to which these are successful depends on the capacities
    and intents of their members, which the authors referred to in their study as
    resourcefulness and agency. It is not surprising therefore that IS researchers
    have shown an interest in OC members’ behaviors and practices, and how OC users
    interact with and influence each other within this online setting. Founded by
    passionate and enthusiastic individuals, OCs can be used to develop networks of
    support as a way for responding to emergencies (e.g. Nan & Lu, 2014); indeed climate
    change is not just a phenomenon that deserves to be understood, but an emergency
    that requires immediate action. With an understanding that OC knowledge flows
    travel beyond the community itself (Mozaffar & Panteli, 2021), there is a need
    to explore the direction and distance of the knowledge flows generated within
    OCs on climate change, and the impact that these are making on individuals, groups,
    organizations and governments worldwide. Further, digital climate activism offers
    the opportunity to study cross-generational differences on the use of online platforms
    and within OCs. Cross-generational differences have been evident in the use of
    social media platforms (Panteli & Marder, 2017) and a study on these differences
    is particularly relevant and topical with the increasing number of young digital
    activists globally. Research therefore on the interactions within OCs founded
    and led by teenagers and young adults should fall part of the agenda for future
    IS research. This should shed further light on who is indeed leading the climate
    crisis!. 3.2. Education, awareness and changed working practices 3.2.1. Contribution
    6 – Climate change and the emergent role of IS: an agenda for IS against the background
    of COP261 – Dr Rohit Nishant and Dr Thompson S.H. Teo Climate change is an existential
    threat facing humanity today.2 The recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought
    an important realization that humanity needs to be prepared for impending challenges
    such as climate change. Leaders from different countries assembled at the 2021
    United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, between October
    31, 2021- November 12, 2021. Political leaders as well as business leaders are
    expected to commit to ambitious goals and targets relating to emissions reduction.
    This COP26 comes after the recent working group report titled “Climate Change
    2021: The Physical Science Basis” as a part of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)
    of the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The
    report has been described as the starkest warning of irreversible and inevitable
    climate change (Harvey, 2021). The report is a call to humanity to come together
    and face this challenge, and academia also needs to focus on climate change. The
    role of IS has become more pronounced due to the increasing digitalization of
    our society, accelerated by COVID-19 pandemic. Exponential technologies such as
    AI and ML have the potential to combat climate change (George et al., 2021). However,
    the success of any technology is dependent on the people and processes surrounding
    the technology. IS, being at the intersection of people, process, and technology,
    is therefore well poised to play a key role in combating climate change. IS research
    has been focusing on socially relevant issues as well as examining green IS (Nishant
    et al., 2017, Watson et al., 2010). These researches have highlighted both the
    positive and negative aspects associated with IS. Nevertheless, recent conversations
    surrounding climate change offer new opportunities and avenues to IS research
    to contribute to this fight against climate change. These conversations and development
    surrounding COP26 are on specific goals and targets, economic models and recognition
    of specific areas as critical in our fight against climate change. Companies and
    different nations are increasingly talking about “Net Zero” where the addition
    of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the environment is nullified by equivalent reduction
    of GHGs from the environment. Companies such as Microsoft are showing their commitment
    to net zero by paying for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However,
    net zero also faces several challenges including measurement (Joppa et al., 2021)
    as net zero requires precise, consistent, and automated measurement. IS research
    can contribute to this endeavor by focusing on how IT used for automated measurement
    can help companies achieve the goal of net zero. It can focus on processes that
    increase the effectiveness of IT as well as the design of IS that facilitates
    automated measurement. Another related development is the Science Based Targets
    initiative (SBTi), which helps companies to set emissions reduction targets in
    line with scientific assessment in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement
    (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level and focus
    on efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degree Celsius).2 Over 1000 companies are working
    with SBTi.3 IS research can focus on understanding the role that the intersection
    of people, processes and IT is playing in SBTi. It can also focus on developing
    an understanding of conditions under which IT is effective in helping companies
    implement SBTi as well as challenges in leveraging IT. Another development is
    the increasing focus on the circular economy as a new economic model. The inherent
    objective is to minimize waste as much as possible relative to a linear economy,
    where products ultimately end up as waste. IS research has started to focus on
    the circular economy, but the focus has been primarily on the potential of IS
    to facilitate circular material flows (Zeiss, Ixmeier, Recker, & Kranz, 2021).
    As data increasingly flows through the digital economy, data flow has its own
    carbon footprint and the proliferation of data can lead to redundant data. IS
    research can focus on how the idea of circular economy affects data generation
    and data flow, and how IS research can help minimize the carbon footprint of IS
    artifacts. Data also forms an essential component of AI/ML. As our society increasingly
    uses AI/ML and other exponential technologies, their own carbon footprint cannot
    be ignored. IS research can help companies and societies to redesign processes
    such that these technologies can be used effectively without damaging the environment.
    In terms of recognition of specific areas as important in the fight against climate
    change, there is also an increasing emphasis on biodiversity. In fact, the COVID-19
    pandemic has brought out an important realization that deforestation and loss
    of biodiversity can trigger new pandemics (Tollefson, 2020). Climate change can
    also facilitate zoonotic spillover (Rodó, San-José, Kirchgatter, & López, 2021).
    IS research has generally not focused on issues relating to biodiversity. Nevertheless,
    projects such as Half-Earth Project Map, that maps biodiversity exemplifies how
    IT can play a key role in conserving biodiversity. IS research can focus on the
    design of IS artifacts that support biodiversity. It can also focus on IS use
    for biodiversity conservation by companies, government, and different agencies
    and explore the factors that contribute to the success of such initiatives. Besides
    research, the IS community can contribute by making students aware of issues relating
    to climate change. Other disciplines such as management are increasingly focusing
    on climate change related issues.4 The IS community has contributed to increasing
    awareness of issues related to climate change through courses on green IS and
    IS for sustainability. The current debates surrounding climate change provide
    an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment. Students are increasingly interested
    in courses on data analytics, AI, and ML. We can make students aware that data,
    AI, and ML also have a carbon footprint, and thus they should be used in an optimal
    manner such that their carbon footprint does not diminish the benefits realized
    from them. In summary, we see that IS research and teaching can make a strong
    contribution to our fight against climate change through a focus on issues that
    have become topical due to COP26 and increasing digitalization of society. 3.2.2.
    Contribution 7 – dematerialization is so material! The contrasting impacts of
    IT on the environment and climate change – Professor Yves Barlette 3.2.2.1. How
    the IM/IT/IS sector contributes to a negative impact on the environment and how
    it can be reduced IT and IS correspond to dematerialization, but only to some
    extent. If we create digital copies of documents and save paper (and trees), we
    still have to store the data we create. Moreover, data which was stored on our
    devices (smartphones and computers) or on DVD/Blu-Rays, USB sticks (e.g., movies
    and music) or just broadcasted (radios and TV), are now increasingly decentralized
    ‘in the cloud’, i.e., data centers. Data exchanges also involve emails, texts,
    and all that we exchange using social media. Even if emails seem “old-fashioned”
    today, some companies can send the same message including 10 MB of attached files
    to 1500 employees, generating 15,000 MB, which will never be deleted for most
    of us. If these are ‘dematerialized’ and almost ‘virtual’ documents, they require
    storage, and instead of removing old data, the size of our mailboxes keeps on
    increasing and is measured today in GB. Hence, streaming and data exchanges have
    become the norm. Instead of waiting for broadcasting by TV channels and watching
    a movie, or by radio listening to a song, each of us can separately obtain the
    content on-demand and stream the same song over and over. The Korean series “Squid
    Game” from Netflix generated such a huge demand, that SK broadband sued Netflix
    over the resulting surge in network traffic (Campbell, 2021). The rollout of 5
    G will multiply by 100 the traffic capacity offered by 4 G and will in turn increase
    the volumes of exchanged data. Although the climate impact of streaming and data
    exchanges may have been overrated, they nevertheless remain significant (Kamiya,
    2020). To solve these problems, education seems to be the main solution, however,
    a tax related to bandwidth consumption could be created for streaming and cloud-based
    companies. This would in turn increase cost for users. Options such as a tax for
    other kinds of companies or even a tax on the users themselves could be created,
    specific to bandwidth consumption and/or storage volume. Storage rationalization,
    also known as “Green storage”, is also a possibility. Google is able to show its
    users their carbon footprint within the cloud (Lardinois, 2021). However, these
    data exchanges and distant storage of data require data centers and data transmission
    networks: First, company IT infrastructures, data centers and data transmission
    networks, including computers and storage, that must be manufactured. The manufacturing
    of computers requires a large amount of fossil fuels, chemicals, and raw materials.
    The mining of raw materials for electronic products includes copper, lead, and
    gold and contributes to increased environmental problems. For example, gold mines
    are the leading source of mercury air pollution in the U.S. (Gerson, Wadle, &
    Parham, 2020). Mining also pollutes the water of surrounding communities. When
    the various devices are discarded, they are sent to landfills overseas in Africa,
    China, India, Vietnam and the Philippines. Computers contain heavy metals like
    lead and toxic chemicals that pollute the soil and contaminate groundwater when
    they are dumped into landfill. Some solutions to mitigate these issues include
    (1) increasing recycling, (2) stopping greenwashing that includes cessation of
    waste recycling to countries that cannot actually recycle and (3) mitigate planned
    obsolescence and increase the reparability of devices. Second, IT devices, data
    centers and data transmission networks need power to operate thereby generating
    significant levels of heat. Several possibilities have been tested, for example
    underwater data centers and data centers located in northern countries. This does
    not reduce the heat generated but at least reduces the required energy for cooling.
    Even if the problem related to heat is not addressed, the use of carbon-free but
    polluting energies such as nuclear, must also be solved. 3.2.2.2. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change I see several aspects:
    • IT/IS permits the use of more efficient products and designs that save raw materials
    and energy. For example, digital twins can help to better design improved products,
    e.g., car batteries (Merkle, Pöthig, & Schmid, 2021). • Processes can be more
    efficient and supply chains can be improved, reducing energy used during manufacturing,
    reducing fuel requirements and food waste during transportation. • Big data analytics
    offer possibilities for precision agriculture, reducing water waste, use of fertilizers,
    pesticides and other pollutants. • Work-from-Home possibilities, reducing business
    trips, encouraging ‘virtual’ companies. • Super calculators allow us to improve
    weather models and offer insights on what factors are the most important to regulate
    climate change. • The solution to controlled thermonuclear fusion power, could
    solve the energetic component of IT/IS impact on climate change. Fusion is only
    possible when scientists are able to compute the shape of magnetic confinement
    devices of Tokamaks and Stellarators (Klinger, 2021) or to perform simulations.
    3.2.2.3. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change • Improving methodological
    innovations in greenhouse gas emissions calculations. • Improving weather models
    to mitigate climate change and risks related to this change. • Development of
    awareness campaigns dedicated to mitigating our personal and professional environmental
    impacts related to IT and IS. • Increasing the conception and use of new big data
    analytics tools to mitigate the impacts of our society on climate change. • Developing
    charters in companies including best practices (see below). • Developing tools
    for smart buildings (lighting, heating, ventilation) and energy management (statistics,
    diagnostics). 3.2.2.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this IS/IT education
    could act in several ways: • Disseminate knowledge and create awareness-raising
    campaigns about the negative impacts of IT/IS on environment and how they can
    be reduced by adopting best practices including for example: • Automatic sleep
    mode and turning of the devices during nights and weekends. • Workers and home
    users should know that ‘dematerialization’ and ‘virtualization’ does not exist
    and that data is always ‘materialized’ somewhere. • Future CIOs and members of
    IT staff should be offered during their education awareness-raising campaigns,
    including the same as above plus IT/IS-specific elements: for example, the fact
    of checking that all audiovisual devices are turned off every evening. The same
    for all the laser printers in a company, even if some monitoring is deactivated.
    Turning off the monitors of their computers, even if some systems must always
    run. 3.2.3. Contribution 8 – emerging technologies to mitigate supply chain disruption
    due to climate change – Professor Manoj Kumar Tiwari Climate change has become
    one of the most important concerns in recent years at nearly all tiers of decision-making.
    Climate change is a set of worldwide phenomena caused mostly by the burning of
    fossil fuels that release greenhouse or heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere
    such as methane, carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, and nitrous
    oxide. These factors have resulted in changing global weather patterns, with frequent
    occurrence of hurricanes, droughts and rising temperatures causing habitats to
    vanish, and altering ecosystems. Climate change has a worldwide impact. As a result
    of such calamities, homelessness is on the rise, putting vulnerable communities
    at risk of food insecurity, disease, and civil upheaval. Climate change, as a
    result of global warming, is a universally acknowledged reality that affects human,
    industry, business, and the environment in a variety of ways. Supply chain and
    Logistics providers among all the industries being aware of the consequences of
    climate change are most conscious about the deterioration happening due to variation
    in weather patterns, storms, altered sea routes, and environmental changes will
    all have a significant impact on their operations, forcing them to alter conventional
    business models and trading routes. If logistics companies are on the front lines
    of climate change, they are also huge contributors to the crisis. Transportation
    industry accounts for nearly 25% of all CO2 emissions from fuel combustion around
    the world (IEA, 2019). While value addition to the product as it passes through
    the supply chain, each SC link causes environmental deterioration, especially
    climatic pollution, via GHG emission. In return, each channel in the supply chain
    faces opportunities and risks in the form of severe occurrences such as waterlogging
    or windstorms, higher temperature, soil erosion, rising sea levels, storms, impact
    on local weather conditions, increased storm frequency and intensity, drought,
    and so on. As a consequence, both climate change and supply chain activities are
    simultaneously impacted. Mitigation (cutting emissions) and adaptation (preparedness
    for inescapable circumstances) are two aspects of dealing with climate change.
    Both of these challenges are multidimensional. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    changes are required in power grids, buildings, transportation, land use and industry.
    Given a better knowledge of climate and catastrophic occurrences, adaptation necessitates
    disaster management and resiliency. Presently, Machine learning (ML) has gained
    popularity as a versatile tool for technological advancement. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and ML techniques can contribute to reduce emissions in several ways such
    as by speeding up the development of low-carbon technologies, better demand predictions,
    reducing system waste, remote sensing, improving energy efficiency, vehicle emission
    estimation from smartphone GPS traces, single building optimization, identifying
    behavioral patterns, and planning and operating low-carbon infrastructure. The
    impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is becoming more essential
    as people become more aware of climate change and its obvious implications. It
    provides simple and faster problem resolution using simulations and a large variety
    of different options. Climate change concerns can be monitored, mitigated, and
    adapted with the use of ICTs. Some inventions of ICTs are Wireless Sensor Networks,
    Satellite Technology, GIS, Remote Sensing, Mobile Technology, and Web-based applications.
    Climate change mitigation and adaptation can be more efficient and successful
    with the use of ICTs, if integrated strategically; it contains knowledge centers,
    mobile phones, and interactive media. By educating and raising awareness at the
    community level, sharing theoretical and practical knowledge, and empowering people
    to have access to knowledge and relevant data, it can assist vulnerable populations
    in reducing the risk of climate change. Micro-sensor Wireless Network is among
    the most prominent technologies in the twenty-first century, with a wide range
    of applications. Commercial or human-centric applications, robotics, military
    applications, and environmental monitoring are all using the applications of wireless
    sensor networks. Sustainable Environmental Management Information System (IS)
    can maintain the decision-making process for supportable climate control and develops
    Earth-friendly design. Emergence of big data and AI/ML techniques allows climate
    solution research to design policy and its implementation at the building and
    household scale, street, urban areas, modified to specific circumstances but scalable
    to worldwide mitigation possibilities. Furthermore, the wide application of ICTs
    also adds to the depletion of limited energy supplies and the increase in greenhouse
    gas emissions. It is one of the causes contributing to rising CO2 levels for producing
    ICT machinery and devices, energy usage, and electronic waste recycling. We are
    living in a phase of rapid transformation, where technological advancements are
    transforming the way of our living, at the same time directing us to face several
    challenges in the form of climate change and resource scarcity. Although these
    technologies contribute to greenhouse gas emissions to some extent, they aid in
    the reduction of considerably larger amounts released by all other industries.
    By establishing smarter cities, industrial processes, electrical grids, transportation
    systems, and energy savings benefits, ICT can cut CO2 emissions on a worldwide
    scale. ICT may be used to investigate and manage natural resources in a variety
    of ways, both locally and worldwide. As a result, information and communication
    technologies constitute a critical component in combating climate change and mitigating
    its effects. Some ICT tools used to mitigate climate change are: • Computer-controlled
    devices are used in a variety of ways to reduce energy consumption in the home,
    at work, and in manufacturing; • Telecommunications are critical in response to
    natural calamities caused by climate change; • Sensor networks can be used to
    monitor vulnerable or dangerous environments. • Satellite observations give critical
    information on climate and vegetation trends. Oceans and land can be monitored
    by sensors either on the ground or remotely through satellite. The state of the
    atmosphere can be examined for wind currents and greenhouse gas emissions that
    may indicate the impending arrival of a storm. Data on tsunamis and sea-level
    changes can be communicated via satellite via ocean buoys. • Geographic information
    systems can understand and visualize data. • Better study and modeling of complex
    environmental and climate systems are possible due to increased computing capability
    and innovative techniques. • Distributed (grid) computing helps scholars to dig
    deeper into themes. Natural catastrophes affect around 200 million people each
    year, according to United Nations figures. ICT plays a critical role in providing
    early warnings for natural disasters. It provides essential data on the effects
    of climate change that might lead to disasters, in addition to the usage of sensor
    networks to monitor hazards such as active volcanoes. Among these include increasing
    sea levels, depleting freshwater resources, deforestation, and ecosystem concerns.
    The Famine Early Warning System Network is one example of how ICT may help. Its
    goal is to reduce the possibility of food shortages by alerting people to early
    warning signals of famine. The system monitors and analyses data about climate
    and weather, as well as their impact on crops, utilizing information technology.
    The data is subsequently delivered to decision-makers in the form of monthly food
    security updates, predictions, and alarms, as well as assistance with emergency
    preparedness and long-term policy decisions. A variety of sensor systems created
    for weather monitoring (ocean buoys) and earthquake detection are used in tsunami
    warning systems (seismic sensors). Data is collected and delivered into real-time
    analysis and detection systems via satellite. Grid computing makes it possible
    to share data in order to do in-depth analysis. The Global Earth Observation System
    is available for all policymakers to get access to the data. There are free programs
    that allow us to zoom in on satellite photos that map the world. Geographic information
    systems (GIS) are one of the most powerful — and extensively used — tools for
    visualizing environmental data. Overall, using technology into climate change
    assessment, prevention, and adaptation can help save the ecosystem from damage
    and degradation. 3.2.4. Contribution 9 – facing the negative environmental digital
    impact: time to change values? Professor Frantz Rowe To examine whether and how
    the IT sector can have a negative impact on the environment, following the evolution
    of our awareness of the issues, I will address first the aspect of the question
    which concerns how the use of IT products is affecting the environment, before
    turning to the issue of IT production itself. The world has drastically changed
    since the end of the last century. In the 1980s, the first oil crisis was just
    behind. Society, including researchers with my transportation engineering and
    my economics background, saw enormous benefits in telecommunications to reduce
    transportation negative impacts on the environment such as pollution and CO2 emissions.
    Our first studies on the use of the telephone in households, that had been adopted
    lately in France in the 1970s, demonstrated some substitution effects on urban
    trips. However, the main lesson was that, at the scale of a large city, a) the
    net substitution effect was low since the telephone also induced some trips, and
    b) the main effect of telephone-transportation interactions was an accompanying
    or “management” effect (Claisse & Rowe, 1993). Unless we take and accept restrictive
    measures on our liberties to move, like the recent lockdowns, the effects of new
    communication tools such as video conferencing meetings, will not reduce transportation
    demand. This is notably due to an induction effect linked to the opportunities
    and more largely to a “digital rebound” effect (Coroama & Mattern, 2019), whether
    for business or social life, generated by interactions with communication technology.
    Hence my spontaneous answer to the question - how can (the) IT (sector) have a
    negative impact on the environment? - is that, unless we voluntarily reduce our
    activity and do less, the only significant gains from IT use will occur if we
    can reduce the negative impacts related to the efficiency of transportation systems.
    This means that we should design transportation systems so that their use is more
    environmentally efficient, i.e. they pollute less than others when used and have
    the best possible environmental footprint (for instance in terms of CO2 emissions)
    when produced (Teubler, Kiefer, & Liedtke, 2018). Typically IS researchers can
    contribute to such “green” designs for “greener” use by examining how IT/IS can
    help support the use of such transportation systems and more generally support
    more environmentally efficient supply chains. We looked at this, studying how
    Carrefour had redesigned its supply chain, but gains were not spectacular (Antheaume
    et al., 2018, de Corbière et al., 2016). This revision of the supply chain is
    what we would call a " second order " revision. It involved using IT based solutions
    to improve the use of trucks and supply chain restructuring with an additional
    layer of consolidation centers. It did not involve “first order” transportation
    modes improvements such as the use of trains, or river-boats which generate fewer
    GHG emissions per t.km but may be more expensive, at least to start with. This
    is because what corporations seek is to be more efficient economically, while
    ideally showing that they are environmentally conscious. However, in the large
    retailing industry for instance, becoming environmentally efficient is not their
    main concern. Unless they are forced to do so, they will not really optimize CO2
    emissions or other environmental indicators. A set of interviews on the impact
    of e-commerce on retailers supply chains shows that senior managers just want
    to be politically correct (de Corbière, Durand, & Rowe, 2010). However, we believe
    that the potential of information systems to reduce pollution is very large. Here
    again, we can distinguish between first order and second order changes. First
    order changes might be, for example: “combined truck-train transport, where for
    long distances trucks will travel on train carriages (as is done in Switzerland),
    or assisting with local manufacturing solutions, based on 3D printing, rather
    than subcontracting to a third party in another country. These first order changes
    also involve challenges which IT can help resolve. Second order changes might
    be, for example, to control cargo or to optimize vehicle routes regardless of
    the type of transportation mode considered. Regularly, containers are lost at
    sea and cargo and ships can be better controlled before their cargo falls overboard.
    Satellites, RFID technologies and web portals can be important to support these
    aims. There are many other avenues for improvements in that direction. But again,
    the issue is not just about what type of digital technology we should invest in
    to help traditional businesses reduce their environmental impact; what counts
    is to find appropriate production solutions and institutional mechanisms so that
    firms really aim at reducing harmful emissions in a significant manner and not
    always put profitability first. Like the retail or transportation industry, the
    problem is that the IT sector itself is engaged in a worldwide competition where
    profitability and convenience innovations for the consumer are key. Typical of
    these innovations the smartphone is only 14 years old, but its appearance also
    has very negative implications simply because it needs to be produced and incorporates
    rare materials that are extracted in terrible conditions in some African and Asian
    countries. In short, the ecological imprint of IT may be negative because IT products
    also have drastically changed: by becoming “smart”, and more precisely due to
    the introduction of manipulable screens, our telephones have also become very
    destructive of scant resource (Ritthof, Rohn, & Liedtke, 2002). In parallel the
    speed at which we renew corresponding infrastructures such as 5 G and soon 6 G
    won’t help. Our dream of the world being cleaned from pollution by an immaterial
    economy was just a very naïve dream. Many other examples abound such as servers
    farms for the cloud and other data centers that demonstrate huge environmental
    costs. Worse than that with the internet of things, machine to machine communication,
    automated vehicles and bots in finance may make environmental pollution uncontrollable
    or at least many times superior to that created with human-controlled processes.
    For instance, researchers recently demonstrated that training an artificial intelligence
    could explode CO2 emission costs (Strubell, Ganesh, & McCallum, 2019). Not only
    are we exhausting resources, but there are huge geopolitical implications related
    to the sometimes unique locations of these resources on the planet and related
    to where chips or materials for certain of our digital equipment are produced
    (to the extent that children’s lives are destroyed as in Congo, see Lebrun, 2020).
    These geopolitical risks may in turn generate other ecological risks because we
    unfortunately know that wars are never clean. Unless we take and accept measures
    to get sober in what we consume and what we produce, digitization alone may not
    be such a good solution for saving our environment. This goal implies making value
    choices (Rowe, 2018) and requires rethinking the design of our activities at multiple
    levels in an interdisciplinary and systemic manner (Nishant et al., 2020). 3.2.5.
    Contribution 10 – from cradle to grave – impact of IT on climate change and the
    relevant research agenda – Professor Ramakrishnan Raman 3.2.5.1. How the IM/IT/IS
    sector is having a negative impact on the environment and how it can be reduced
    IT and its applications have made business processes efficient, but the rapid
    growth of technology and its applications has also negatively impacted the environment.
    Whilst green IT practices have advocated to minimize the negative impact of IT
    on the environment, there is still a huge scope for changes to be brought into
    manufacturing, logistics and operations, usage and disposal of information technology
    equipment, which can make every process sustainable and environmentally-friendly.
    Manufacturing of Information technology products can be environmentally-friendly
    if the production adopts environmentally friendly processes. Process innovation
    is needed which can help in creating products which use fewer natural resources
    and also reduce pollution. Recycling and reuse of material and zero emission should
    be the goal of every IT manufacturing process. IT manufacturing can become environmentally
    friendly by using energy from renewable sources and also by focusing on energy
    efficiency. Innovation in business processes that can help in achieving zero pollution,
    remove greenhouse gas emissions and also eliminate waste. Focus on conserving
    natural resources can help in making manufacturing of Information technology products
    environmentally-friendly. Logistics and supply chain processes used by the IT
    sector cause hazardous air emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Logistics and
    operations can be environmentally-friendly if manufacturers shift to green suppliers
    and partners who provide green logistics and supply chain processes and also handle
    reverse logistics. If organizations focus on consolidated shipments and reduce
    packaging by redesigning products, it can immensely help in reducing the negative
    impact on the environment. IT products have an impact on the environment even
    during the ‘use’ stage of their life cycle. The energy consumed by the product,
    the lifetime of the product, the heat dissipated and the digital frequency noise
    have a negative impact on the environment. Creating products that are more durable
    and reusable can help the environment. Less resource intensive gadgets which work
    with low power and solar power and IT gadgets will not only help protect the planet
    but also will help in the well-being of all. Responsible and environmentally friendly
    disposal of IT products can help the environment. In several developing nations
    the practise of disposing IT waste in landfills is the most popular disposal method,
    which has a colossal negative impact on the environment. Stringent regulations
    applicable for every end consumer, which mandates safe disposal of e-waste to
    certified e-waste recyclers can help in reducing the negative impact of IT disposal
    on the environment. 3.2.5.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized to improve situation
    regarding climate change Application of IT can immensely help in managing climate
    change. Use of IT while developing smart cities can help reduce annual global
    greenhouse gas emissions. For example, smart energy meters and smart electric
    systems help in managing climate change by optimal use of energy consumption.
    This in turn can also help in smart electric grid management which helps in reducing
    the losses. This is a simple example to showcase the use of smart IT systems which
    can help utility companies, end-users and society at large and also help also
    in managing climate change. Internet and Internet technologies are a force to
    reckon with for managing climate change. IT can infuse intelligence in transportation
    and logistics and make them smart. The Internet of Things (IoT) can make the supply
    chain smart and agile and hence can help in reducing the emission of greenhouse
    gases. Internet and Internet technologies can also help in monitoring the environment
    to reduce energy use in real time. IT can be used to harness and create green
    homes, green industries and hence can help in managing climate change. 3.2.5.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change Information
    Technology and Internet of Things (IoT) are vital in confronting climate change
    problems and help in managing the threats posed by climate change. IT and IoT
    are part of the solution as their applications are being used to cut greenhouse
    gas emissions and they help countries manage climate change. IT and IoT are needed
    for precipitous transfer of information concerning risks of climate change. In
    this context a few questions which need deeper research include - How can information
    needed for decision making be collected and disseminated in an efficient manner
    which can help to advance the integration of climate risks into plans and policies,
    which can be useful for those who need it most? How can a low-cost IoT infrastructure
    be created in the urban and rural areas of developing countries which can enable
    authentic and speedy dissemination of real time data related to greenhouse gas
    emissions? How can IT and IoT be used to enable countries to adapt to climate
    change? 3.2.5.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Education is vital in
    enabling people to understand the impact of climate change on life on this planet.
    Educating and creating awareness can help to change the attitude and behavior
    of people. Education alone can help in ensuring that people start adopting a sustainable
    lifestyle and also develop skills that can help in managing climate change. Education
    can not only inspire people to change their attitudes and behavior, but also helps
    them to make informed decisions which can have an impact on climate change. A
    deep-seated shift in pedagogy is needed for IT and IoT to enhance teaching and
    learning for sustainability. Teaching about climate change needs an interdisciplinary
    and cross disciplinary approach to synthesize diverse ideas. The information about
    climate change and its impact must be introduced within the school curriculum.
    IT must be used to create interactive activities on climate change which can help
    students to understand and learn in a better fashion. Projects related to sustainable
    development and climate change must be introduced at the high school level. IT
    tools which can help measure carbon emission must be taught along with practical
    application of the same. Teaching and learning which has hands-on experiences
    with technology must be emphasized. At the undergraduate and graduate level, educating
    and giving opportunities to students to work on environmentally sustainable projects
    to attain sustainability objectives using IT and IoT technologies can immensely
    help in bringing out of the box solutions to climate change problems. 3.2.6. Contribution
    11 – How has the IT sector negatively influenced the environment? Remedies, role
    of IT education and future research agenda – Professor Nripendra P. Rana 3.2.6.1.
    How information management (IM)/information technology (IT)/information systems
    (IS) sector have any negative impact on environment and how it can be reduced?
    The IT sector is constituted of companies that produce software, hardware or semiconductor
    equipment or the companies that provide Internet or related services (Miller,
    2021). Technological advancement has transformed the way we live our lives. Many
    would argue that the growth of the number of electronic devices such as laptops,
    desktops, high performance computing servers, and other most powerful data-intensive
    computing solutions (e.g., supercomputers) have brought us numerous benefits,
    there is no denying that the proper and continuous functioning of these technologies
    have come at a cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The heavy use of these
    devices present concerns when it comes to resource use, energy use, carbon footprint
    and waste. The negative impact of the IT sector on the environment could well
    be traced right from the manufacturing of these devices as a large proportion
    of materials come from finite natural resources and precious metals. Procuring
    raw materials and precious metals for manufacturing technological devices and
    electronic equipment comes with a high carbon cost usually powered by fossil fuels,
    deforestation, landscape degradation, water pollution and the release of vast
    quantities of carbon dioxide into the air (Mensah et al., 2015). For example,
    silicon, plastic, iron, aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, barium are
    some of the most important materials used for manufacturing the technological
    equipment for which the mining of these poses serious threats to our environment
    (Williams, 2010). Similarly, manufacturing of these equipment requires massive
    energy to convert them into complex and sophisticated technological products.
    Subsequently, the transportation of these finished products also comes with a
    high carbon cost. Finally, massive servers and data warehouses that enable these
    technologies to work also consume a vast amount of energy and this threat does
    not stop there. These products also pose setback at the end of their lifespan
    and globally we throw away electronic waste (e-waste) of approximately $62.5 billion
    every year and only one-fifth of the electronic waste generated globally is currently
    formerly recycled, which undoubtedly an enormous threat to the environment (Amos,
    2020, Okafor, 2020). It is therefore very evident that the entire lifecycle of
    technological evolution to disposition adversely affects the environment and technological
    companies are largely responsible for this threat. This negative impact of the
    IT sector on the environment could be reduced to a certain extent by adopting
    the responsible practices of the circular economy, which signifies reusing some
    of the raw materials of the disposed equipment for a more sustainable approach
    to consumption. The governments and local authorities also have the larger responsibilities
    by legislating the circular economy model, promoting eco-friendly manufacturing
    and by adopting a responsible way of sustainable consumption. This could be achieved
    by implementing effective laws and regulations on e-waste (Geissdoerfer, Savaget,
    Bocken, & Hultink, 2017). 3.2.6.2. How can IM/IT/IS be utilized to improve climate
    change? Technological developments – particularly the discovery of use of fossil
    fuels, have contributed to climate change. Rising temperatures are essentially
    blamed by scientists for human-generated gases (primarily CO2), concentrations
    of which have been enhanced by almost 50% since the industrial revolution started.
    Innovations such as carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies are being
    used to reduce CO2. During the time of the Coronavirus pandemic, many office jobs
    were being done from home resulting in reduced emissions of CO2 from transport
    and office buildings (Sky News, 2021). The technological innovations to support
    remote working has been swiftly embraced as businesses endeavored to manage the
    effect of Covid-19. Greater use of data centers and cloud computing services by
    some of the leading technology giants including Amazon, Google and Microsoft are
    also an example of energy efficient services. With many of the latest technology
    efficient products such as smart LED light bulbs, smart outlet and power adapters,
    smart thermostat, etc. responsible for reducing energy consumption available in
    the market not only help households to save decent amounts of money in their annual
    bills but also reduce the CO2 emissions (Oberhaus, 2019). 3.2.6.3. A brief discussion
    on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change? Although the technology
    improvement with an environmental attribute reduces overall CO2 has been discussed
    in the prior research, how the role of technology change in lowering carbon emission
    intensity needs to be further researched for the overall reduction of CO2 (Li
    & Wang, 2017). While the low-carbon energy technologies contribute toward mitigating
    climate change (Schmidt & Sewerin, 2017), there is a need for further research
    on how social-psychological factors, lifestyles, behavioral patterns, etc. will
    help organizations and individuals to adopt such technologies that can reduce
    the CO2 emission and serve toward the climate change. The future researchers could
    also look to explore the adoption of such technologies in different contexts for
    both well-aware and less aware consumers about using such technologies for the
    purpose of supporting climate change action. Future research can also explore
    individuals'' pro-environmental behavior toward using such technologies. 3.2.6.4.
    How IS/IT education should reflect this? Information technology education could
    be a key component of raising awareness of climate change mitigation and adaptation.
    One suggested solution could be the collaboration between the scientists and the
    students at the pre- and post-college levels to make them aware of how modern
    emerging technologies could help reduce hazardous emissions and reduce the threat
    of global warming. The pre-college school system is the right place to disseminate
    such scientific information on the key global climate change issues. School teachers
    should be provided with the necessary advanced level of educational and hands-on
    training from scientists from local research bodies on climate change and governments
    should take the necessary steps to make it a part of the curriculum. Climate change
    is not only the knowledge that should be taught to children right from an early
    age, but they should also be made aware of how to responsibly use technologies
    in a way that helps reduce carbon emissions becoming ambassadors for sustainable
    living. 3.2.7. Contribution 12 – technology, information systems and sustainability:
    a public interest research agenda – Professor Katina Michael and Dr Roba Abbas
    3.2.7.1. The negative impact of technology and information systems on the environment
    The coupling of natural and human systems is defined by highly integrated and
    complex system dynamics resulting from human-nature interactions (Liu et al.,
    2007). This has presented significant global challenges and wicked problems (Buchanan,
    1992, Brown et al., 2010) that require immediate attention in view of sustainability,
    particularly given the centrality of technology and information systems (IS) to
    these interactions. A multifaceted feature of the natural system that is integral
    to all forms of life is biodiversity, which can be considered at three levels:
    genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity (Chapin III et al.,
    2000). Biodiversity is both implicitly and explicitly linked to health and wellbeing,
    in addition to sustainable development programs (Naeem et al., 2016, World Health
    Organization and Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2015).
    Human actions, notably decisions concerning technology and information systems,
    increasingly impact biodiversity. In line with the 26th UN Climate Change Conference
    of the Parties (COP26) Sustainability Governing Principles, there is a pressing
    need to engage in deliberate management of potential environmental impacts to
    encourage inclusivity, health and sustainability (UN Climate Change Conference
    UK 2021). Adverse impacts on the natural world resulting from existing and emerging
    technologies and IS can be described as negative externalities (Dasgupta and Ehrlich,
    2013, Perrow, 1991). The field of environmental economics, among other things,
    involves the study of externalities that generate tangible and intangible costs
    to the physical environment and its inhabitants (Cropper & Oates, 1992). It is
    often difficult to quantify these costs given the reach of an incident, and the
    extent of its irreversible impact. For example, significant oil spills cause major
    externalities that cannot readily be measured, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil
    spill, which was estimated to have spilled 4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into
    the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Beyer, Trannum, Bakke, Hodson, & Collier, 2016). There
    are two main types of negative externalities; the first refers to negative production
    externalities that can cause, for example, air or water pollution through manufacturing
    plants powered by technology and other forms of engineering; and the second denotes
    negative consumption externalities that can cause for instance, traffic congestion
    and noise pollution that are generated by systems (Biglan, 2009). Externalities
    caused by technologies and IS may be unanticipated, unintended, and even paradoxical
    (Pringle, Michael, & Michael, 2016). Unanticipated externalities refer to those
    incidents and system failures that were not factored into scenario planning and
    risk management processes during systems design and development, such as the Fukushima
    Daiichi nuclear disaster whereby a substantial wave surged over defences and flooded
    reactors causing major radiation leakage (von Hippel, 2011). Unintended consequences
    of technologies and IS are those that were discounted as potential outcomes of
    a respective system, but nonetheless transpired (Ash, Berg, & Coiera, 2004). An
    example is the use of irrigation systems for crops, which subsequently contributes
    to soil erosion and increased soil salinity (Khan, Tariq, Yuanlai, & Blackwell,
    2006). Conversely, paradoxical externalities emerge from attempts to use technologies
    and IS for advantage and benefit, but where the result is a negative outcome on
    another aspect of the environment. An example is the introduction of Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices to monitor energy systems to lower consumption that requires
    the devices to be powered and over time to be replaced, causing often toxic and
    non-biodegradable e-waste that is disposed of in landfills (Mukhopadhyay & Suryadevara,
    2014). A common element underpinning these types of negative externalities is
    the impact on public resources that are shared by communities (Pigou, 1920). These
    include the ocean and its fisheries and clean drinking water, amongst others,
    leaving individuals and communities vulnerable, potentially compromising their
    health and wellbeing. Furthermore, these undesirable impacts extend to the natural
    system and environment. These impacts can be linked to technologies and IS that
    do not suitably consider socio-ecological and socio-technical considerations,
    and that fail to recognize the value of design, testing and validation, with sustainability
    and people in mind (Chen et al., 2008, Trist, 1981). The mitigation of the undesirable
    consequences of existing and emerging technologies and IS necessitates intervention
    in the form of sustainability transitions (Loorbach et al., 2017, Smith et al.,
    2005), moving beyond the existing multi-level perspective (Geels, 2004, Geels,
    2011) toward transdisciplinarity. At the heart of these transitions is the establishment
    and socio-technical (re)design of higher education frameworks resulting in new
    forms of knowledge production, allowing for the design and redesign of human-centered
    socio-technical systems for sustainability, and consequently for human benefit
    (Geels, 2010, Verbong and Geels, 2010). The proposed socio-technical intervention
    would require commitment to a series of stages or flows, as depicted in Fig. 1,
    which we define as the Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle. These include:
    (i) establishing a detailed understanding and conceptualization of the tightly
    coupled natural and human systems in context and in view of interactions and feedback
    loops; (ii) implementing the appropriate sustainability transition through a process
    of socio-technical (re)design; (iii) measuring the effect of the design over time
    in view of the degree to which negative externalities are reduced or mitigated;
    (iv) assessing the impact on human health and wellbeing, in addition to environmental
    sustainability; and (v) iterating to ensure continual evaluation of the tightly
    coupled system given its evolving nature. It should be noted that despite this
    proposed cycle, there will be cases in which paradoxical externalities occur,
    which is an inherent and unavoidable characteristic of tightly coupled systems.
    This occurs for two reasons: (i) events in nature are not always predictable no
    matter how “controlled” the socio-technical transitions are through, for example,
    regulation and policy mandates (Smith et al., 2005), and (ii) interventions themselves
    are a form of “technology” that are subject to independent and autonomous forces
    that are “uncontrollable” (Winner, 1978). Download : Download high-res image (251KB)

    cycle. 3.2.7.2. Sustainability transitions through transdisciplinarity The proposed
    model suggests that our global challenges and significant problems require a transdisciplinary
    lens, beyond a multi-level perspective, in which design interventions are required
    in the form of sustainability transitions. Within this model, the information
    systems discipline has a significant and mediating role given its socio-technical
    orientation and appreciation of the open systems paradigm (Scott and Davis, 2015,
    von Bertalanffy, 1950, Watson et al., 2010). For instance, step (ii) in Fig. 1
    would markedly involve a redefinition of technological and information system
    design and development processes (Schoormann, Stadtländer, & Knackstedt, 2021),
    characterized by the emergence of a supportive human-centered, transdisciplinary
    educational framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015) oriented toward a public interest
    technology (PIT) research agenda (Abbas et al., 2021a, McGuinness and Schank,
    2021, Michael and Abbas, 2020). Transdisciplinarity, in the context of the proposed
    sustainability transitions, typifies trans-institutional, trans-sectoral and trans-national
    frameworks bringing together at a minimum industry, government and academia toward
    the production of knowledge (Crow & Dabars, 2017, p. 474; Hadorn, 2008). This
    involves recognition that while all problems are local and community focused,
    their impacts are increasingly global, given the age of entanglement we now live
    in (Hillis, 2016 as cited in Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 381), and the tight coupling
    of natural and human systems, as described above. In considering sustainability
    transitions more specifically, the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design
    Cycle would promote Public Interest Technology (PIT) research, empowering citizens
    and communities (Pitt, Michael, & Abbas, 2021). It would additionally emphasize
    the importance of directing attention to highly integrative basic and responsive
    (HIBAR) research (Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 376), which is still lacking internationally,
    despite the creation of globally oriented goals such as the United Nations Millennium
    Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (World Health
    Organization, 2015). In transitioning to HIBAR research and practice that requires
    PIT processes and innovations, we are seeking to recognize negative externalities
    and to continually strive to reduce them by introducing alternative socio-technical
    design options in each selection environment (Nelson & Winter, 1977, pp. 61–70).
    3.2.7.3. A public interest technology research agenda for sustainability A preliminary
    phase in operationalising the proposed design cycle and implementing sustainability
    transitions is the strategic realignment of IS, and/or the higher education system
    to proceed toward the production of knowledge and socio-technical innovations
    that are purpose driven and in the public interest (Abbas & Michael, 2021), facilitating
    an integrated and responsive approach to addressing our global challenges and
    key problems (Melville, 2010). Capturing first principles from foundational theories
    and frameworks across disciplines, including IS, and merging them to form a transdisciplinary
    lens will allow for the creation of models and simulations that afford a high-level
    view or conceptualization of existing major forces and counterforces (Frodeman,
    2014, Scholz, 2020). Achieving such a capability commands stakeholder engagement
    in the provision of data to an emergent knowledge system, encapsulating multi-level
    perspectives (local-national-global) within socio-cultural, business, techno-economic
    and institutionally-relevant policy contexts (Köhler et al., 2019). We suggest
    that the role of emerging technologies and IS, as they relate to this knowledge
    system, be embedded within a PIT framework (see Abbas, Pitt, & Michael, 2021,
    Fig. 1), represented as a complex, open socio-technical ecosystem that is informed
    by the landscape of technological and IS developments. The framework also acknowledges
    the corresponding application areas and the link to financing models, stakeholder
    engagement (balancing lived experience and professional expertise), transdisciplinary
    theorizations/conceptualizations and operationalisation to achieve the goal of
    sustainability toward human health and wellbeing (Abbas et al., 2021). 3.2.7.4.
    The role of IS/IT education The subsequent and corresponding phase in operationalising
    the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle relates to the elimination
    of disciplinary silos in higher education institutions, that have existed since
    scientific endeavor was acknowledged as the foundation of the Age of Enlightenment.
    Through the deliberate reconfiguration or redesign of university structures, new
    transdisciplinary agendas can be positioned to respond to global challenges (Crow
    & Dabars, 2015, ch. 5; Gholami, Watson, Hasan, Molla, & Bjorn-Andersen, 2016).
    In order to ensure our long-term sustainability as a species and a planet, university
    design must undergo a rapid rethink, becoming more adaptive and agile but also
    closely aligning to public and planetary challenges (Crow & Dabars, 2020). The
    transition to transdisciplinarity, even interdisciplinarity, remains fraught with
    risk principally with respect to forming meaningful ties between Computing, Informatics,
    Business (including Information Systems) and Engineering schools in addition to
    other non-STEM domains of knowledge. A harmonization is required not only within
    the STEM disciplines, but going beyond traditional collaborative fields to incorporate
    action-oriented endeavors through the creation of Schools dedicated to Sustainability
    or Life Sciences (Tejedor, Segalàs, & Rosas-Casals, 2018). Here the traditional
    research university is challenged to apply itself to real-world problems. However,
    irrespective of the inevitable difficulties, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated
    the importance of solidarity toward collective action, harnessing the knowledge
    produced from both professional expertise/practice and the lived experience. The
    IS discipline is in a prime position to offer information and knowledge management
    expertise to support transdisciplinarity, and it is our obligation to actively
    implement sustainability transitions and responsible systems design (Monson, 2021),IS
    research (Pan & Zhang, 2020) and innovation (Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten, 2013)
    in the interest of sustainable futures (Hadorn et al., 2006, Hess and Ostrom,
    2007). 3.3. Impact on people and communities 3.3.1. Contribution 13 – promoting
    IT innovation to improve the global environment: towards establishment of global
    co-creation & co-evolution models – Professor Mitsuru Kodama 3.3.1.1. IT innovation
    through convergence The leading core technologies in the cutting-edge technology
    fields of IT, energy, automobiles, electronics, semiconductors, biotechnology,
    pharmaceuticals and materials science, etc. have become dispersed among individuals,
    companies and organizations across the globe. The integration of these superior
    core technologies is a source of innovation of new products and services. (e.g.,
    Kodama, 2007). Across various fields in society, IT innovation is changing working
    practices, lifestyles, the way products are made and resources are used in production
    activities. IT technology is being incorporated into a variety of advanced devices
    and contributing directly and indirectly to the reduction of CO2 emissions. IT
    innovation is driving energy-efficient manufacturing by promoting energy-saving
    investments and measures. Such IT innovation will bring about “convergence” -
    the fusion and integration of different technologies and services and the building
    of business models across different industries. Meanwhile, with the adoption of
    the Paris Agreement, a new international framework for the reduction of greenhouse
    gas emissions and other measures from 2020, all participating countries, including
    those that are developed, emerging and developing, are strongly urged to take
    measures to combat global warming. Specifically, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
    and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been trending globally in recent years while
    collaboration and fusion of the IT industry with various other industrial fields
    is transforming various businesses, social activities and the lives of people.
    Backing the evolution of these innovative technologies is the convergence of IT
    and electronics technologies, including sensing and location information technologies,
    energy management systems (HEMS, BEMS, FEMS, etc.), energy-saving devices and
    data utilization. Furthermore, smart communities such as smart towns and smart
    cities, into which many countries are currently pouring efforts, are attracting
    attention as next-generation social systems that connect homes, buildings, and
    transportation systems with IT networks to make effective local use of energy.
    IT solutions including energy management systems such as HEMS, BEMS and FEMS to
    optimize operation smart meters, renewable energy and EVs, etc., and CEMS to integrate
    the management of those as well as transportation systems such as ITS are becoming
    indispensable in smart communities. The development of these innovative technologies
    will greatly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and enable a dramatic
    increase in energy reduction benefits. Furthermore, XR technology, which has a
    promising future, will contribute directly and indirectly to global environmental
    issues by minimizing the physical resources generated, utilized, and consumed
    in various processes in social, economic, and management activities. Therefore,
    IT industries in every country need to contribute to global society by further
    strengthening technological and business partnerships with various industries,
    supply chains and venture businesses to promote new technologies and businesses
    through convergence strategies that will open up the future while understanding
    environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures. To date, the
    advances of IT have shortened the time and space in business processes and supply
    chains across a whole range of industries, accelerated decision-making and raised
    business efficiency, and have given birth to new business models that transcend
    and converge dissimilar industries (Kodama, 2020, Kodama, 2021). IT innovation
    promotes industry-wide co-creation & co-evolution to improve the global environment
    and increases the possibility of forming dynamic “global ecosystems” as new value
    chains (see Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (897KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global IT innovation through IT- leadership. Through such
    convergence, what actions should companies, public bodies, government organizations,
    and a country as a whole take in terms of strategy building and organizational
    reform to create new business models that integrate different technologies and
    create IT innovations across industries? What kind of national leadership and
    management is required to achieve this? These are just a few of the many practical
    issues facing many stakeholders around the world, including those in academic
    research. 3.3.1.2. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS While individual industries,
    companies, and governmental organizations in each country have their own strategies,
    the key concept of organizational behavior to adapt to (or create) the convergence
    worldview is new “strategic knowledge integration” at the global level. Organizational
    platforms that support such global strategic knowledge integration are global
    IT community formations. Global IT communities are important organizational platforms
    for evolving the core knowledge in one’s own country while at the same time actively
    exploring and integrating the best knowledge from around the world with the core
    knowledge of one’s own country (see Fig. 2). To drive global strategic knowledge
    integration, the most crucial issue is not only to integrate the diverse knowledge
    of different organizations within a company, but also to form global IT communities
    with superior stakeholders including customers around the world and integrate
    the best knowledge in the external environment, an ecosystem consisting of globally
    dispersed knowledge, with the knowledge in the organizations within a company.
    The key word to accelerate such global knowledge integration inside and outside
    an organization is “IT collaboration”. In forming global IT communities across
    the world, “collaborative dynamic capabilities” (Kodama, 2018) to appropriately
    generate, evaluate, and use common knowledge (i.e., lexicon, meaning, and interests)
    (Carlile, 2004) regarding environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures
    among diverse stakeholders, are a trigger to realize IT collaboration. In addition,
    the “IT-leadership” of national leaders is crucial to accelerate new strategic
    knowledge integration through IT collaboration through the formation of global
    IT communities across a wide range of countries. For this purpose, “holistic leadership”
    (Kodama, 2017) through the holistic thinking and actions of world leaders will
    be a particularly important factor of management. However, existing studies in
    the IM/IT/IS fields have shed little light on the details of the theoretical concepts
    and practical processes of global IT community formation. Furthermore, there is
    very little accumulated research on IT collaboration. The holistic IT-leadership
    of leaders will play a role in forming and developing the organizational platforms
    of global IT communities. Hence, the cultivation of such leaders will become a
    pressing issue going forward. 3.3.2. Contribution 14 – smart city initiatives
    to maximize information value for sustainability – Professor Brenda Scholtz The
    growing population, particularly in urban areas, has put pressure on researchers
    and society to address challenges surrounding the global lack of scarce resources
    and the negative impact on the environment (Khatoun and Zeadally, 2016, Kumar
    et al., 2020). The technological footprint of companies and individuals has exacerbated
    this problem since technologies are mainly reliant on fossil fuel, thus the more
    technology used, the more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, creating
    global warming. Technology manufacturers and implementers therefore need to consider
    adopting practices of environmentally sustainable computing. This phenomenon can
    be viewed as sustainability in technology or Green IT, where the priority must
    be to reduce the negative impact of an organization’s technological footprint.
    On the other hand some argue that providing individuals and organizations with
    access to information and technology can assist people with living more conveniently
    and easily; for example reducing travel and our carbon footprint. This phenomenon
    can be referred to as sustainability by technology, whereby we need to reduce
    the negative impact of companies and their value chains by enabling sustainability
    use cases or initiatives. The interplay of sustainability in technology and by
    technology must therefore be addressed by all stakeholders in industry and academia.
    One solution to achieving this interplay is to utilize the capabilities of information
    management (IM) and the related field of information systems (IS), which are reliant
    on the acquisition of information, the custodianship and distribution of that
    information to those who need it, and its ultimate disposal through archiving
    or deletion thereof. However, valuable information can only be provided to users
    if access to data is available. The Economist has described data as “the oil of
    the digital era”. However, others, such as the Centre on Regulation in Europe,
    argue that this “often-used analogy between data and oil is misleading.” Their
    argument is that data, unlike oil, is not scarce and therefore it cannot be likened
    to oil (MacCarthy, 2018). One thing that everyone agrees on, is that the digital
    economy cannot live without data and that it remains an immeasurably valuable
    and unexplored asset. More than 90% of the world’s data has been created in the
    last two years – more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. We are experiencing
    an information explosion. Herbert Simon, the Nobel prize-winning psychologist
    and economist, stated way back in 1971 that “In an information-rich world, the
    wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever
    it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious:
    it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates
    a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among
    the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” (Bélanger, Van
    Slyke, & Crossler, 2018). The potential value of data, information flow and technology
    to address the effective management of scarce resources has been the driver of
    the Smart City concept (Ismagilova et al., 2019). According to Albino, Berardi,
    and Dangelico (2015): “A Smart City is based on intelligent exchanges of information
    that flow between its many different subsystems. This flow of information is analyzed
    and translated into citizen and commercial services. The city will act on this
    information flow to make its wider ecosystem more resource-efficient and sustainable.
    The information exchange is based on a Smart Governance operating framework designed
    to make cities sustainable”. The promotion of a Smart Environment is one of the
    core dimensions of a Smart City (Van der Hoogen, Scholtz, & Calitz, 2020). The
    success factors that are linked to this dimension are the attractiveness of natural
    conditions, environmental protection policies, having a sustainability strategy
    for resource management, and making sure that a city is ‘future proof’. A sustainability
    strategy should enable an integrated view of socio-economic, political and environmental
    visions; thus focusing on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
    Nations. Future-proof refers to the ability of something that allows it to continue
    to be of value into the distant future such that the item does not become obsolete.
    Another core dimension for a Smart City is that of Smart Policy, meaning that
    any Smart City initiative should align with the strategy of the city, the country
    (government laws), intergovernmental agreements and of course global policies
    (Garg et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). Policies here include environmental policies
    and those related to information governance and therefore IM. The privacy of personal
    data and information is causing much concern and therefore acts and regulations
    are important in the context of a Smart City. In South Africa the Protection of
    Personal Information Act (POPIA) was implemented in 2013 to protect the information
    and privacy of people, but was only enforced on 1 July 2020 (POPIA, 2020). The
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European equivalent to the POPIA
    for South Africa (GDPR, 2018). In addition to these acts, companies are also pushed
    to have their own information governance and management policies and guidelines.
    Another dimension that is closely linked to climate change issues is that of Smart
    Mobility. This dimension focuses on factors that involve sustainable, innovative
    and safe transport systems that are accessible locally, nationally and internationally
    (Calderón et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). IoT is an integral part of Smart
    Mobility and is regarded as an enabling technology of big data (Bibri, 2019).
    However, big data is only valuable once quality data is produced, which is required
    for intelligent decision making to contribute to sustainable smart cities. The
    Smart City definition illustrates the importance of information exchange within
    a Smart City and therefore the importance of the provision of open data and the
    creation of open data hubs. Smart Technology and ICT-infrastructure is considered
    a support dimension of a Smart City since it is integral to all the other dimensions.
    It refers to the different types of smart technologies that are used in a Smart
    City and since these technologies produce and utilize data, it also involves relating
    all the data in smarter ways. Some of the opportunities for smart cities are that
    the data is in a digital format through IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    machine learning technologies, making real-time collection, processing and sharing
    easier and therefore, decision making and solution development is becoming faster
    and more advanced (Allam & Dhunny, 2019). Providing access to quality data through
    the related strategy of information governance is becoming more and more critical.
    Information governance is the overall strategy for information and provides a
    balance between the risks of the information with the value that this information
    can provide. Data quality forms part of governance, since it is focused on the
    integrity and value of the information itself. When the factors of a Smart City
    concept are integrated, such as ICT, urban infrastructure, open data with data
    governance, and stakeholder participation, equitable and sustainable solutions
    can be developed to face city challenges (Yadav et al., 2017). Stakeholder participation
    is emphasized in the Smart People dimension of a Smart City and it is here that
    the importance of skills, qualifications and education is addressed. The lack
    of skills lies in the areas of IT/IS and Computer Science graduates in general,
    but in particular with regard to Data Science, AI and machine learning competencies.
    Higher education has started addressing the need for these competencies in the
    recent IS2020 curricula guidelines (IS2020, 2020). Competencies related to sustainability
    and environmental issues are also included in the IS2020 guidelines as social
    and ethical considerations. In Germany and South Africa modules related to Green
    IT, and environmental information systems have been introduced in recent years.
    So whilst some progress has been made, much more effort and investigations need
    to take place to introduce more competencies regarding sustainable technologies,
    data management, data analytics and data science into IS/IT and CS degree programs.
    Much research has been done on the topics of smart cities, Green IT and ICT for
    sustainability. However, reported empirical studies on IS for meeting the SDGs
    are still considerably low, particularly with regard to sustainable management
    of water and sanitation (SDG 6); access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and
    modern energy for all (SDG 7); and conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas
    and sustainable behavior (SDG 14). In Africa and other developing countries these
    three SDGs are far from being met, where access to clean water and energy are
    major problems for the vast majority of the population. There is also a lack of
    valuable information and empirical research regarding emerging smart cities, especially
    in developing countries (Backhouse, 2015, Estevez et al., 2016). This lack of
    information prevents stakeholders from making informed decisions, such as how
    to manage the city resources more efficiently or how to attract potential investors.
    3.3.3. Contribution 15 – wider issues in IS research on climate change – Professor
    Rahul De’ In The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, noted
    writer Amitav Ghosh (2018) points to the absence of writing on the destruction
    of nature and habitats through the devastation wrought by Imperialism and the
    rise of industrial capitalism. He calls this absence in the canon of English literature
    the ‘great derangement’ where thinkers and intellectuals are oblivious to the
    plainly visible damage done to the planet. This neglect of climate change continued
    in writings in history and politics. Ghosh calls for an awakening to recognize
    and give voice to the scale of the ‘unthinkable’ impact of this phenomenon. Ghosh’s
    call resonates in IS research, where this phenomenon is recognized as a ‘critical
    challenge’ for researchers and practitioners (Gholami et al., 2016; Eliot and
    Webster, 2017). The call is for more extensive research on climate change and
    its impact on the world, where ‘grand challenges’ require a wider understanding
    of the phenomena and a scoping that includes ideas and concepts outside of current
    disciplinary concerns (Winter & Butler, 2011). Following this reasoning, three
    possible issues are presented in this brief essay that can address the scale of
    climate change concerns, and, which also resonate with prior IS research. These
    ideas have to do with engaging with issues of the postcolonial condition; a focus
    on the impact of climate change on ordinary people; and its impact on women. 3.3.3.1.
    Focus on postcolonial condition Prior research in IS has examined the postcolonial
    condition prevailing in former colonies of large imperial nations of the West,
    which includes most of the developing and less-developed world (Lin et al., 2015,
    Ravishankar et al., 2013). This condition essentially refers to the power asymmetry
    between former rulers and the ruled, and defines the cultural and political practices
    of both, even though there is no present-day colonial presence. The postcolonial
    condition is perpetuated largely through multinational corporations and global
    agencies. Global actors, such as large multinational corporations and multilateral
    agencies (like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), have a massive
    and disproportionate effect on world affairs. Their beliefs, policies, and practices
    affect millions of people directly and indirectly, as they influence governments
    and the actions that governments take. These institutions have a strong influence
    on the uptake of information technology in many nations, through efforts such
    as electronic governance, ICT for development, and spread of technologies to reduce
    the digital divide (De, Pal, Sethi, Reddy, & Chitre, 2018). They also have a strong
    influence on industrialization, deforestation, energy consumption patterns, and
    the overall adoption of modern technologies. Prior research has shown that many
    “development” projects ultimately harm subaltern people, who are the poor and
    marginal groups, rather than benefit them (Ferguson, 1994), and scholars often
    doubt the very benefits of development in such situations and contexts (Escobar,
    2011). Green IS research that is concerned with recording and analyzing the impact
    of climate change (Melville, 2010) must also document the postcolonial conditions
    and the impact of multilateral agencies. When agencies fund, say, construction
    of roads or dams or massive irrigation projects, the impact on the environment
    must be documented and the particulars of local politics, struggles, and contestation
    must be recorded. Crowd-sourcing technologies may be used to both record the different
    perspectives of people, and also to arrive at a possible consensus (Malone & Klein,
    2007). 3.3.3.2. Focus on people Though there is considerable work on Green IT
    and Green IS from the perspective of organizations and how they can manage their
    consumption and production patterns (Dedrick, 2010, Khuntia et al., 2018, Melville,
    2010), the emphasis must also include the manner in which ordinary people in urban
    and rural areas, in remote mountainous regions, on isolated islands, and in forests
    are affected, and how they are using IT to both learn about and counter the effects
    of climate change (Watson et al., 2021). The focus can be on local and indigenous
    approaches to adapting to climate change, and how digital technologies can support
    those, with information and feedback. One problem that can be addressed through
    both design science and action research is that of measuring the changes that
    are slowly and inevitably happening, and how people are adapting to them. These
    changes are in local climate conditions, in soil composition, in levels of water
    tables and aquifers, and in the extent and survival of local flora and fauna.
    These changes may be viewed from multiple perspectives of resource depletion for
    businesses or from that of people’s livelihood, and the impact on local sustainability
    (Clarke & Davison, 2020). 3.3.3.3. Focus on gender Theorizing about climate change
    around issues of mitigation and impact cannot be “gender blind” (Pearse, 2017).
    In rural areas, the brunt of droughts, flooding, soil degradation, river erosion,
    salinization, and loss of food crops, is felt largely by women (Alston, 2015).
    With these drastic and adverse changes in agricultural conditions, there follows
    shortages in food, nutrition deficiency for both women and children, loss of livelihood,
    and increase in debt (Chandra, McNamara, Dargusch, Caspe, & Dalabajan, 2017).
    Though both men and women suffer the consequences of extreme climate events, it
    is women who are worse off as national policies do not fully account for them,
    and relief measures are not easily accessible to them. When climate change events
    force populations to migrate, women are worse off as they lose their local social
    networks, are subject to abuse, and are unable to secure livelihoods on foreign
    soil. The gender imbalances are exacerbated and become entrenched (Alston, 2015).
    Prior research in IS has established the imbalanced access that women have to
    both ICT devices and facilities in developing regions (Rashid, 2016). As they
    are most prone to adverse effects of climate change, research has to both reveal
    these deprivation issues, and find ways to address them. 3.3.3.4. Conclusion IS
    research has an opportunity to sidestep the great derangement in literary culture
    by both exposing the causes and consequences of climate change, and finding ways
    and means to address them. Some work has already started on understanding concerns
    of postcolonial dominance, identifying issues of ordinary people, and understanding
    the particular challenges faced by women. Future research will likely build on
    this. 3.4. Responsible digitalization 3.4.1. Contribution 16 – corporate digital
    responsibility: the powerful offspring of sustainability and digitization – Professor
    Michael Wade 3.4.1.1. Two dominant trends Two of the most significant global business
    trends over the past several years have been sustainability and digitization.
    Sustainability revolves around the natural world, most notably humanity’s impact
    on our planet. Digitization, by contrast, focuses on the virtual world. Without
    obvious common roots, these two megatrends have largely developed independently
    of one another (Naujok, Fleming, & Srivatsav, 2018). I recently had a conversation
    with the Chief Sustainability Officer of a consumer goods company and when I asked
    him about digital and sustainability, he looked back at me blankly. However, this
    is likely to change. If we expand the definition of sustainability to include
    responsible and ethical practices of all kinds, not just those that impact the
    planet, we see plenty of intersection points. Examples include cyber-security,
    data privacy protection of employees and customers, digital diversity and inclusion,
    ethical algorithms including AI, technology component recycling, right to repair,
    ethical gig economy practices, and there are many others. Unfortunately, our research
    suggests that most organizations today are unprepared to effectively respond to
    these challenges. If they do so at all, it is in a fragmented manner. This opens
    up new and interesting avenues for research. 3.4.1.2. A new field of corporate
    digital responsibility It is time to bring these disparate and fragmented elements
    together under a single umbrella so that they can be addressed in a consistent
    and complementary manner. We refer to this new consolidated focus as Corporate
    Digital Responsibility (CDR) (Lobschat et al., 2021). CDR can be regarded as a
    subset of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), an already established entity
    in many organizations. Corporate digital responsibility is defined as a set of
    practices and behaviors that help an organization use data and digital technologies
    in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally responsible (Wade,
    2020). 3.4.1.3. Each CDR sub-categories contains a number of areas Social Corporate
    Digital Responsibility revolves around an organization’s relationship to people
    and society. The important topic of data privacy protection of customers, employees,
    and other stakeholders is included here. It also incorporates aspects of digital
    diversity and inclusion, such as bridging an increasing divide between digital
    haves and have nots across geographies, industries, social classes, and age. There
    are also societal impacts of inaccurate A.I. decision-making algorithms that can
    lead to unfair or discriminatory practices, as has been noted among many recommendation
    engines (Noriega, 2020). Other technologies can also have harmful effects on society.
    Facebook, among others, banned so-called deep fake videos that realistically apply
    false or misleading statements to real people. Economic Corporate Digital Responsibility
    relates to the responsible management of the economic impacts of digital technologies.
    Much has been said about the replacement of human jobs by robots and other digital
    technologies, and this is certainly a relevant part of economic CDR. Yet, it also
    relates to the creation of new jobs in a digital world that are enriching, purposeful,
    and interesting. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the so-called gig
    economy creates jobs that are often uninteresting, repetitive, and underpaid (Tan
    Z.M., 2021). There are also questions regarding the sharing of the economic benefits
    of digitization with society through taxation of digital work, and fair compensation
    of data monetization to the original owners. Finally, Environmental Corporate
    Digital Responsibility concerns the link between digital technologies and the
    physical environment. There are many issues here, including the responsible recycling
    or disposal of old computer equipment. The extension of obsolescence cycles by
    one year, for example, can have an enormous impact on the environment.5 There
    are also issues regarding the limiting of power consumption, including reducing
    the use of electricity to support bitcoin mining. 3.4.1.4. A call for a multi-disciplinary
    focus on CDR Many organizational processes, practices, and projects exist to address
    digital aspects of social, economic, and environmental responsibility. Yet, they
    are rarely coordinated or optimized. Some, like cybersecurity, tend to be the
    responsibility of IT departments, others, like workforce automation, may fall
    under the purview of operations, and yet other elements may sit with HR, legal,
    engineering, R&D, or particular lines of business. Without effective coordination,
    organizations leave themselves open to risks, and may miss out on rewards. Research
    too, is required to better understand the dynamics of CDR from both theoretical
    and empirical perspectives. This research will need to be multi-disciplinary since
    CDR covers aspects of many different fields, including IS (the coordination of
    technology and people), IT (the ethical design of technologies themselves), operations
    (the development of systems and practices to embed CDR in organizational processes),
    organizational design (how to set up structures to effectively govern CDR activities),
    strategy (how to align CDR with other organizational objectives), and OB (how
    to train people to act in responsible ways). In summary, as the sustainability
    and digitization trends continue to grow, Corporate Digital Responsibility will
    become increasingly relevant for organizational performance, both to mitigate
    risks as well as find new sources of advantage. As researchers, we need to get
    ahead of this trend not only to better understand it, but to influence its development
    through the creation and dissemination of tools, frameworks and best practices
    to practicing managers. 3.4.2. Contribution 17 – digitalization and the myth of
    sustainability: some critical reflections – Professor Suprateek Sarker Digitalization
    is all around us, and we are all well aware of the value digitalization brings
    to help improve many facets of human existence. Indeed, when we think about digitalization,
    most of us see the positive impacts digitalization has had, and can potentially
    have, on the environment. After all, in digitizing business processes, we drastically
    reduce, even eliminate the consumption of paper, which saves trees, and in turn
    contributes to better environmental outcomes. We also think of how, through metering,
    we are able to encourage consumers to consume less electricity, which again contributes
    to better environmental outcomes (e.g., Wunderlich, Veit, & Sarker, 2019). Perhaps
    a more high-profile example that we can all relate to pertains to the new generation
    of automobiles, that have been described as “computers on wheels” (Wade, 2016).
    Digitalization vehicles can help to optimize fuel and/or battery usage, and hence
    result in less pollution of the environment. Furthermore, metaphors like ‘cloud’
    imply something floating and delicate” and green, and add to our sense that digitalization
    is at the heart of our battle to save the environment (Crawford, 2021, p. 41)
    and can have a significant role in addressing climate change. Yet, many argue
    that the above represents a grossly biased picture, and is a consequence of the
    largely pro-digitalization, “digital utopia” narrative which includes the myth6
    of digitalization’s contribution to sustainability, that is promoted by tech companies,
    sections of the business press, and those fascinated by the wonders of digitalization.
    Crawford (2021), among others, provides a critical commentary on the “mineralogical
    layer” (p. 32) underlying digital technologies and AI that made me acutely aware
    of the environmental effects associated with digitalization. She notes that “seventeen
    rare earth elements,” that are part of virtually every digital device/technology
    surrounding us, have to be extracted from mines. Mining of such minerals is not
    only associated with slavery, conflicts, and human exploitation very often, but
    also results in dangerous waste. Specifically, she quotes David Abraham who writes
    “. 99.8% of earth removed in rare earth mining is discarded as waste… that are
    dumped back into the hills and streams” and this leads to “pollutants like ammonium…”
    (pp. 36–37). Particularly alarming is the estimate by the Chinese Society of Rare
    Earths that refining one ton of these elements “produces 75,000 liters of acidic
    water and one ton of radioactive residue” (p. 37). The amount of consumption of
    water and electricity by data centers and other components of the digital infrastructure
    is also shocking, but is largely hidden from view or consciousness of the average
    consumer or decision-maker, who is led to believe that digitalization is “clean”
    and a key part of the solution for the environmental crisis (pp. 42–45). Along
    similar lines, Wade (2016) suggests that in addition to batteries and their deleterious
    environmental impacts, “rare metals are sprinkled throughout vehicles, mostly
    in the magnets that are in everything from the headlights to the on-board electronics.
    But those rare metals come from somewhere—often, from environmentally destructive
    mines… and processed in less-than-green ways.” The point of highlighting the above
    issues is not that digitalization needs to stop. The point is to make people aware
    that there are environmental trade-offs that we are implicitly making when we
    use digital technologies. Indeed, by many accounts, the clean paperless image
    has been carefully cultivated, and it distorts the assessment of environmental
    impacts in one direction, in favor of further digitalization. As IS researchers
    who embrace the sociotechnical view (e.g., Sarker, Chatterjee, Xiao, & Elbanna,
    2019), we are aware that the need for efficiency, effectiveness, and economic
    value needs to be balanced with a consideration of humanistic outcomes. Given
    the critical role that the environment, especially in the form of climate change,
    is seen to play in shaping human wellbeing (even threaten survival), we need to
    consider environmental outcomes as an undeniable aspect of humanistic outcomes
    of digitalization. While outlining a research program is not feasible in a short
    editorial segment, there are a few points I would like to make, that may have
    implications for research and teaching: As researchers and teachers, we need to
    develop and communicate a balanced picture of digitalization, and not unreflectively
    perpetuate the “digital utopia” narrative. We must reflect on the culture that
    our societies have developed, of technology infusion in human processes as a natural
    course of development of organizations, economies, and societies. We need to develop
    frameworks and metrics that will help managers and technology consumers assess
    the economic value and convenience with respect to the true costs. Just as we
    have metrics to capture the economic value of digital technology implementation,
    we need to develop and incorporate the use of environment-related criteria and
    metrics as part of the proposal and justification process for any significant
    digitization initiative. At a very basic level, we need to ask why we need digital
    technology infusion in a certain aspect of life, and whether it is warranted when
    a holistic assessment is done. And, we need to develop conceptual and analytic
    tools to be able to carry out such assessments, even if such analysis is initially
    far from perfect. Obviously, the environmental damage resulting from the harnessing
    of digital technologies is a systemic issue involving many different stakeholders,
    and IS scholars cannot solve the problems themselves, but we need to actively
    consider how we may be part of the solution. We need to become aware of the issues,
    make the environmental costs transparent in our communication with stakeholders,
    conduct revelatory studies of the hidden environmental costs of certain technologies
    that are extolled, create models that incorporate benefits and costs including
    environmental costs, and, most importantly, make our students aware of the one-sidedness
    of the pro-digitalization narrative. We need to incorporate environmental impact
    analysis of digitalization initiatives as part of the IS curriculum, and foster
    an environmental consciousness among the students with respect to digitalization.
    Undoubtedly, a lot of research will be needed to enable decision makers to link
    environmental costs to a particular decision pertaining to digitalization. Many
    of us talk about responsible AI – here, my objective is to encourage responsible
    digitalization, and the responsibility is regarding environmental impacts of digitalization.
    As we set out on this path, I reiterate that our goal will not be to single-mindedly
    promote or oppose digitalization, but to “right-size” the extent of digital infusion
    in any initiative, after careful consideration of benefits and costs, where costs
    will not only consider the immediate tangible financial implications but also
    environmental costs over time that humanity will be left to bear. 3.4.3. Contribution
    18 – systems for sustainable growth – Professor Maung Sein and Dr Leona Chandra
    Kruse “Stark realities, critical choices […] Years, or even decades, of progress
    have been halted or reversed.” These alarming statements began this year’s Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) report, underlining the gloomy consequences of COVID
    19 related crises. The prospect, however, is not all doom and gloom. Digital transformation
    has been accelerated in various governmental and business sectors, and we need
    to continue harnessing the potentials of information systems to address key societal,
    economic, and ecological issues. Supported by well-designed information systems,
    researchers, economic actors, policymakers, and civil society can join forces
    to rebuild a more resilient and sustainable future. Perhaps no issue is more crucial
    now than the threat of climate change. This is not just an isolated threat: it
    directly challenges our conceptualization of sustainable growth and sustainability
    itself. We view sustainability as a synergy across people, planet, and profit,
    following the SDGs. We place a particular emphasis on a holistic view of information
    systems (IS) for sustainability which entails the study of designing, engineering,
    using, and disposing of information systems in order to minimize their environmental
    impact as well as to promote sustainability-related practices. This holistic view
    embraces different initiatives across various computing and informatics disciplines
    in the spirit of transdisciplinarity and multilateralism. In the following, we
    will delve into the role of IS in this crucial discourse on the threat of climate
    change. We will first set the scene by providing our perspective on IS and sustainability.
    We will then propose specific approaches that the IS research community can take
    to address the issues we raise. We will conclude our editorial segment by discussing
    issues related to evaluating the initiatives and frameworks aimed at meeting sustainability
    challenges. 3.4.3.1. Setting the scene The thirteenth SDG persuades us to “take
    urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,” and this year’s report
    continues to urge us on how “rising greenhouse gas emissions require shifting
    economies towards carbon neutrality” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 20). For us,
    this urging means exploring new and alternative approaches to minimize the environmental
    impact of information systems, in addition to our ongoing measures. We observe
    several ongoing transdisciplinary movements to this end. One of them, computing
    within limits, aims to reshape computing research by acknowledging a need for
    limits (LIMITS, 2021). This movement is guided by three core ideas: aiming for
    a steady-state economy and acknowledging the limit of growth, considering models
    of scarcity in order to promote resilience, and reducing energy and material consumption
    while avoiding the rebound effect (Nardi et al., 2018). Rethinking the status
    quo in our design and computing assumptions can help us shape the way forward.
    Minimizing the environmental impact of information systems, however, concerns
    not only the design and use period. We need to anticipate what happens in the
    post-use period, that is, minimizing and managing e-waste. This is echoed by the
    twelfth SDG: “ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” However,
    this year’s report shows that “electronic waste continues to proliferate and is
    not disposed of responsibly [.] Each person generates about 7.3 kg or e-waste,
    but only 1.7 kg was recycled” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 19). 3.4.3.2. Design
    science research for sustainability What can the IS community do to meet the enormous
    challenges posed by the threat of climate change in particular and to sustainability
    in general? The simple answer is that research needs to make this a key area to
    address. Understanding the phenomenon, explaining the mechanisms of climate change
    and predicting its consequences are agendas that continuously engage researchers
    from across the disciplines. We propose that the IS community can significantly
    contribute to these ongoing initiatives through designing artifacts (systems,
    prototypes, methods or frameworks). While designing systems in a way to best accomplish
    a particular purpose (combating climate change in our case here), lies at the
    very core of what we do in our discipline, our call here is to take a design science
    research (DSR) approach in our research. DSR aims at creating new prescriptive
    knowledge through building methods and artifacts to improve the world in some
    way, however incremental. The DSR paradigm is fundamentally a problem solving
    paradigm. It is not atheoretical tinkering – artifacts are developed based on
    theoretical and conceptual foundations, drawing upon the knowledge base for explanation
    research – and in the process creates theoretical and conceptual knowledge that
    are of prescriptive nature such as design principles that are transferable to
    other contexts. While care is taken to ensure rigor, the very fact that the artifacts
    developed through DSR are to solve problems faced by the society makes it relevant
    by definition. 3.4.3.3. Sustainability as value for design DSR is perfectly placed
    to meet the threats to sustainability. Among the papers and prototypes presented
    in the 2021 edition of the premier conference of the DSR community (Design Science
    Research in IS Technology – DESRIST), one is an excellent illustration of what
    the IS community can do. Hillebrand and Johannsen (2021) developed a chatbot called
    KlimaKarl “to Promote Employees’ Climate-Friendly Behavior in an Office Setting”.
    The App can be classified under “persuasive technology” that has been used successfully
    in the health sector to promote healthy living (e.g. weight management) through
    behavior change. Obviously such systems cannot force behavior change but can definitely
    informate users. A system of this genre can prove to be useful in the particular
    case of wind powered energy in Norway. While there is a broad support for developing
    green energy, many localities vehemently oppose constructing windmills in their
    areas. Systems can be effective in helping citizens see a balanced view and hopefully
    reduce opposition to windmills. DSR, like any research approach, is not value
    free (Iivari, 2010) and consequently, “the values of DSR should be made as explicit
    as possible” (p. 44). The burden of explicating the value of the designer and
    his/her goal in designing the artifact is essential to help the user understand
    the possible deleterious outcome or the unintended dark side of the technology.
    This is a particular sensitive issue with the use of persuasive technology in
    a debated issue such as sustainability. 3.4.3.4. Green practices within DSR Finally,
    environment-friendly practices such as green computing and green coding can be
    incorporated in the design of artifacts, whether as a DSR project or routine design.
    These practices help to minimize the environmental impact of the resulting information
    systems. The IS research community is also a user of IT. We need to be mindful
    of the potential e-waste of our research endeavor and ingrain e-waste management
    in our daily behavior. Some of the points in this editorial indeed represent critical
    choices which must be made in the face of the stark climate realities. 3.5. Role
    of data, technology and IS governance 3.5.1. Contribution 19 – climate change
    and role of information technologies – Professor Babita Gupta 3.5.1.1. Information
    technologies and climate change Information technologies require energy at every
    stage of its life-cycle and contribute to the carbon footprint. However, IT is
    also helping reduce net carbon emissions in various industry sectors. Technology-enhanced
    working using the video conferencing and cloud-based collaboration that has accelerated
    during the COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be a double-edged sword (Frontier technologies,
    2020). While these technologies helped the environment by significantly reducing
    the impacts of travel and commuting, they also increased carbon emissions since
    the backend infrastructure, such as massive data centers, is enormously energy-intensive.
    Current estimates of information and communication technology (ICT) impact range
    from 1.4% to 3.9% of global CO2 emissions, highlighting the need for accurate
    data on ICT’s impact on the environment (Cunliff, 2020, Murugesan, 2021, Robertson,
    2021). Several information technologies are poised to play a critical role in
    monitoring, managing, and mitigating climate change-related phenomena and increasing
    environmental resiliency. For example, artificial intelligence and robotics are
    being utilized for automated detection and monitoring of environmental hazards,
    remote sensing to track deforestation activities and marine life, monitoring biodiversity,
    traffic flow optimization, estimating real-time precipitations, and managing flood
    risks and emergency planning. Increasing occurrences of extreme weather events
    are affecting food production and distribution globally. Advancements in information
    technology utilizing multi-source spatial and temporal data, robotics, drones,
    Internet-of-Things (IoT), etc., are being explored in the agriculture and transport
    industry. For example, precision agriculture technology is an environmentally
    sustainable strategy for optimizing water input, weed control, disease eradication,
    pest reduction, and yield enhancement to avert water and food insecurity and optimize
    the food production chain. Data centers are the backbone for managing big data,
    cloud computing, AI, blockchain, and IoT. They also have massive power consumption
    needs contributing to climate change. Researchers and innovators are exploring
    novel technologies such as liquid cooling that improve heat-dissipation efficiency
    and reduce their impact on the environment to reduce the carbon footprint of data
    centers and other IT infrastructure. 3.5.1.2. Role of higher education in building
    environmental resiliency Higher education institutions can provide knowledge and
    resources to the learners and create awareness, inspiring the next generation
    to navigate the complexities of climate change. Education and training can encourage
    learners to think about technological and behavioral changes to reduce and mitigate
    environmental impact within their local sphere of influence and macro level. Institutions
    offering information systems and related programs are beginning to incorporate
    pedagogical practices in their curriculum that engage students to reflect on organizations’
    sustainable and responsible technology adoption and use practices. Educational
    institutions can create partnerships with community stakeholders to accelerate
    carbon-neutral business practices and build environmental resiliency. Several
    universities are forming coalitions committed to climate action, such as the University
    Climate Change Coalition, to leverage scientific knowledge and expertise for climate
    change solutions. In addition, universities are offering programs that emphasize
    environmental justice and equity, such as responsible business MBA and hospitality
    and sustainable management. 3.5.1.3. Research agenda and climate change The estimates
    for carbon dioxide levels in the year 2021 are at 417 parts per million. Bringing
    it down to the safer threshold of 350 parts per million would require the removal
    of about 2000 gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere over the next century (Fork
    and Koningstein, 2021, Frontier Technologies to Protect the Environment and Tackle
    Climate Change, 2020). This reversal of climate change would require everyone’s
    effort, including researchers in the IT, information systems, and related areas,
    to develop a robust and practical research agenda: Methodologies to assess the
    sustainability of ICT Infrastructure. • Develop an actionable set of metrics that
    can measure the reliable and precise impact of an information technology infrastructure,
    an IT project, or a portion of the cloud in terms of its carbon budget and footprint
    • Develop reporting mechanisms, models, and infrastructure that would make it
    easy for companies to evaluate their as well as their supply chain partners’ emissions
    and environmental impact. Sustainable, greener technologies. • Strategies grounded
    in organization behavior and culture that persuade companies to shift from fossil-fuel-based
    electricity to using cleaner, renewable energy solutions in their IT projects,
    technology infrastructure, and data centers • Creating mechanisms for designing
    sustainable technologies compliant to be carbon-neutral in the ICT industry by
    2050 • Models for integrating disparate data and prediction models and forecast
    systems for weather, traffic, demand, patterns of consumption, and real-time inventory
    that companies can use to optimize their supply chain and reduce waste and carbon
    footprint • Best practices to make the entire life cycle of IT greener, including
    energy-efficient hardware and software that has reusable code and is optimized
    for the green hardware. Resource recovery and reducing e-waste. • Research on
    e-waste management and strategies for e-waste prevention, smart recycling, and
    resource recovery, without shifting the e-waste burden to still-developing economies.
    Use of behavioral theories to engage stakeholders in climate change solutions.
    • Research on the role of social media and models grounded in behavioral theories
    that can prevent or at least reduce the impact of misinformation on public perception
    of climate change • Strategies to empower consumers so that the collective consumer
    sentiment about climate change imperative can incentivize companies to pursue
    carbon net-zero more actively as a goal • Research on digital and social media
    best practices to increase consumer awareness of the impact of their purchasing
    choices and decisions on environmental sustainability and design strategies that
    nudge consumers to adopt behavior that reduces their carbon footprint. Role of
    governance in climate change innovations. • Research on the role of governments
    in enabling effective guidelines, policies, legislation, incentives, R&D collaborations,
    and regulations about emission standards versus companies setting voluntary targets
    for achieving carbon neutrality within the critical time frame. • Research on
    the role of policy governance within the organizations when implementing IT projects
    and the evaluating impact on the environment. • Research on the role of social
    media and other digital tools to influence leaders in government and businesses
    to embrace sustainable consumption and production. 3.5.2. Contribution 20 – climate
    crisis response: climate crisis response: complex information governance for social
    sustainability – Professor Deborah Bunker "Climate change is destroying our path
    to sustainability. Ours is a world of looming challenges and increasingly limited
    resources. Sustainable development offers the best chance to adjust our course."
    – Ban Ki-moon (2012). We are amid an existential climate crisis which has been
    building since the onset of the industrial revolution (Jonsson, 2012). Information
    systems (IS) scholars continue to debate our contributions to tackle climate change
    and sustainability. In response to the global climate crisis, we are being called
    upon to “develop suitable theoretical frameworks to underpin the investigation
    of complex phenomena and complex problems” on a societal level (Hasan, Smith,
    & Finnegan, 2017, p. 298). In response to any crisis, however, we know that to
    develop and deploy resources effectively, an IS must produce an accurate, reliable,
    and trustworthy assessment of the situation at scale (Bunker, 2020). The key to
    achieving this ''situational awareness'' is the development and implementation
    of an accepted approach to complex information governance for response to societal
    problems and crises (Bunker, 2020, Smith and Stirling, 2008, Nüttgens et al.,
    2011). How the value, authenticity; accuracy; reliability; and legality of information
    is determined, controlled, and assured through acceptable governance mechanisms,
    is at the heart of how information is represented and used to develop situational
    awareness and support sustainability goals for climate action ". the ways in which
    these representations are articulated into knowledge that structure our overall
    understandings" (Smith & Stirling, 2008 - p. 2). Complex information governance
    has, however, been shown to be difficult to assure as seen in the financial market
    failures of 2001 and 2008 and more generally in the response to the current COVID-19
    pandemic. Information governance is defined as "a collection of competences or
    practices for the creation, capture, valuation, storage, usage, control, access,
    archival, and the deletion of information and related resources over its life
    cycle" (Mikalef, Bourab, Lekakos, & Krogstie, 2020). IS research on information
    governance, however, has mainly focussed on big data analytics and organizational
    innovation for formal IS. Far less is known about information governance in complex
    scenarios where formal IS and informal social IS might combine to jointly produce
    situational awareness on which to frame a response. Yet we know of many cases
    where trusted situational awareness, dynamic organizational collaboration and
    multi-stakeholder decision support have been produced by combining formal and
    informal IS. These include adoption and use of: – a cloud-based, freely available
    IS used by environmental non-government organizations (ENGO), for eco-collaboration
    activities in a structurally dynamic manner based on the NGO national context
    i.e., Thai, Lebanese, Australian (Aoun, Vatanasakdakul, & Bunker, 2011). – a combined
    open social media platform and proprietary job scheduling system to communicate
    with and organize a student volunteer army during the Christchurch Earthquakes
    (Bunker, Ehnis, Seltsikas, & Levine, 2013); and – an open social media platform
    for dynamic communication, coordination, and collaboration activities during Hurricane
    Harvey (2017) by emergency management agencies, media organizations, journalists,
    private individuals, celebrities, politicians, and influencers who took on the
    roles of information starters, information amplifiers and information transmitters
    (Mirbabaie, Bunker, Stieglitz, Marx, & Ehnis, 2020). These cases highlight an
    emerging need for development of effective complex information governance approaches
    for IS, using dynamic organizing principles. Lee, Zhu, and Jeffery (2019) researched
    information governance and data management for these types of platform ''ecosystems''.
    While they focussed on data governance and practices, they did not directly address
    the complexity of information governance where trusted situational awareness/consensus
    is developed at a societal level from a combination of formal and informal IS.
    In order to conceptualize and understand complex information governance for development
    of trusted situational awareness and response at scale, transitions may hold the
    key i.e. dynamic co-evolutionary processes that evolve from the "interplay of
    many unlike, particular processes" (Kemp, Parto, & Gibson, 2005, p. 23). Transitions
    present us with an opportunity to develop approaches for complex information governance
    as they are "aimed and guided in an iterative, forward-looking, adaptive manner,
    using markets, institutions and hierarchy (the three basic forms of coordination)"
    (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 23). These three forms of coordination are critical ''global
    levers'' for climate action so consensus regarding information governance at a
    transitional level is crucial for achievement of situational awareness, development
    of sustainability response/goals and resulting action. The key components or mechanisms
    of complex governance for social sustainability include: policy integration, common
    objectives, criteria, trade-off rules and indictors, information and incentives
    for practical implementation and programs for system innovation (Kemp et al.,
    2005). “The most significant challenge is to ensure that multi-player governance
    regimes embody capacity for sustainability-oriented co-ordination, direction and
    re-direction” (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 18). This can be achieved through the nature
    and dynamics of autopoiesis or self-producing/constructing physical systems (Bunker
    et al., 2013, Mingers, 2002, Mingers, 2004). These systems are: self-producing;
    contingently maintained (so that they don''t breakdown); structurally open but
    organizationally closed; structurally determined; able to be structurally coupled
    to other systems by mutual specification and/or co-evolution; and able to embrace
    embodied cognition and self-reference/recursion to enable self-construction/production
    (Mingers, 2002, p. 280). Transitional processes combined with the nature and dynamics
    of autopoietic systems, provide IS scholars with a theoretical basis for complex
    information governance development. The use of both formal organizational IS and
    informal personal/social IS in disaster management and crisis response, has been
    rapidly co-evolving at scale over the last decade (Ehnis & Bunker, 2020). While
    IS scholars have mainly focussed on information governance approaches for formal
    organizational IS, the self-producing/constructing attributes of hybrid IS which
    combine elements of the formal and informal have been largely ignored. The negative
    aspects of social systems and platforms and their combination/integration with
    formally managed and governed IS, have presented society with many problems (Elbanna,
    Dwivedi, Bunker, & Wastell, 2020). There is, however, potential for their management
    and use to effect positive outcomes for social sustainability and the response
    to the global climate crisis, if approaches to complex information governance
    are developed and implemented by IS scholars and practitioners. Currently there
    is a global focus on the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
    (STEM) education, but more recently there have been calls for a reframing of STEM
    from techno-science, towards a science of reconnection with nature (Smith & Watson,
    2020). IS courses and training can therefore, make a valuable contribution to
    the development of complex information governance for social sustainability at
    scale by developing and delivering units of study that focus on: 1) complex information
    governance and leadership for social sustainability - frameworks, concepts, descriptions,
    rules and communications approaches based on transitions and autopoietic systems;
    2) how to work in large and diverse teams - understanding, implementing and accommodating
    approaches to complex information governance; 3) and understanding the information
    governance of global supply networks and logistics for sustainable development
    goals. 3.5.3. Contribution 21 – climate change – IT – Data Science perspective
    – Ms Jeel Dharmeshkumar Shah The world’s climatic conditions seem to deteriorate
    every day, and the evidence from the research(Shaftel, 2021) held at NASA further
    bolsters this claim. The researchers at NASA further believe that the unprecedented
    warming trends today are the effect of human actions. Since most of these actions
    involve the development or use of technology, it certainly plays a significant
    role in climate change. The world today seems to be in a state of quandary. Whether
    to restrict the use of technology or invest in further research in the same field
    is a concern. However, in this case, I believe that the cause is the solution-
    just like the snake venom that is fatal for humans but is also proven to be medicinal
    and used to save lives. When the problem is so complicated, the solution must
    also be four-fold; we must take the System-of-Systems (SoS) approach. We must
    be able to analyze the dependencies of various systems - such as human, environmental,
    physical and information systems- which the SoS framework can enable. This could
    be a holistic approach to finding possible solutions to this complicated issue
    as it provides a good understanding from all viewpoints. Data Science is a required
    field for this discussion as it can analyze all forms of data and help automate
    crucial decisions. ‘Green Technology’ is expected to transform our society. The
    Climate Group, in their report, estimates that smart technologies such as smart
    homes/buildings, smart transport and logistics, intelligent agriculture management
    systems and smart electricity grids are a few of the various ways that can help
    reduce greenhouse emissions. It is Data Science that makes these technologies’
    Smart’ or ‘Intelligent’. While Big Data provides a platform for processing large
    chunks of heterogeneous data, Data Analytics and AI help analyze this data and
    identify trends (with the help of machine learning to identify main features and
    make predictions). This intelligence is then used in business to make informed
    and calculated decisions. Cloud computing can further be used to accelerate the
    process, and IoT could help apply these efficiently in a practical scenario. Analyzing
    the foot-fall data of various public transport systems, for example, could help
    identify efficient routes, and this ‘Smart Transport System’ would then optimize
    its fuel consumption and aid in reducing carbon footprints. Another such example
    would be a ‘smart air conditioning system’ that collects, compares and analyses
    weather and usage data to develop plans that optimize economic and environmental
    savings—solutions such as these help tackle issues regarding the sustainability
    of the climate. Various techniques followed by the Data Scientist aid this kind
    of analysis. Classification is one such technique that draws meaningful information
    and differentiates the data based on similarities found in its attributes. Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) can also be utilized in many practical scenarios for cause
    and effect analysis. One such example is the study carried out in the United States
    that used this technique to identify the factors affected due to differences in
    hydro-climatology of two different streams. This study successfully inferred how
    the differences affected the average runoff, flow stability(from baseline) and
    frequency of floods in the two areas (Poff, Tokar, & Johnson, 1996). Further improvements
    in the climate model were also made in 2003 (Knutti, Stocker, Joos, & Plattner,
    2003) to increase its efficiency with larger datasets. Calculations from this
    model revealed that almost half the members surpassed the surface heating range
    that the IPCC estimated earlier. In such challenging scenarios, neural networks
    can help extensively. It is all used to explore the general trend in climate change
    and its mechanisms to identify the hidden correlation/attributes in the data that
    is otherwise not decipherable. The use of Solar energy has become increasingly
    popular today as it is a renewable source of energy. One of the major drawbacks
    of this form of energy is that its availability widely depends on meteorological
    conditions. The efficiency and performance of a solar power plant would depend
    on these changing conditions. Jang, Bae, Park, and Sung (2016) has discussed how
    we can leverage images captured by the satellite to train a SVM (Support Vector
    Machine) model and predict the motion of clouds. This could be a brilliant way
    to determine when the plant would be most productive and when it would require
    backup. In this way, data analytics could help manage climate changes for uninterrupted
    and effective energy production. Climate change also significantly affects coral
    reefs that are important for the ecosystem as they provide food and shelter for
    their inhabitants. Thermal stress due to the warming of the ocean could cause
    infectious diseases, while frequent intense storms could lead to the destruction
    of the reefs. A rise in sea levels could lead to sedimentation, whose runoff can
    destroy the corals, while fluctuations in precipitation lead to an increase in
    runoff that could make the water murky and restrict the light. One such study
    (Franco, Hepburn, Smith, Nimrod, & Tucker, 2016) conducted in 2016 used the Bayesian
    Network approach to evaluate how climate change disturbances affected the coral
    reefs. The study revealed interesting results identifying the factor that contributed
    the most to the carbonate budgetary state of the reef and concluded that the change
    in the state of the reef was mainly due to the decrease in water quality (Franco
    et al., 2016). Data Science offers a plethora of such techniques that can be applied
    in the majority of challenging scenarios. It can help in the acquisition of environmental
    data as well as monitoring and analyzing it. This can help take immediate actions
    in case of an emergency or check if an industry is compliant with the pollution
    control requirements. Remote sensing and continuous data monitoring improve data
    availability that is the foundation for Data analysis. Risk analysis is another
    critical feature that can be used in combination with IoT enabled devices to send
    real-time alerts in case of high-risk prediction. These alerts and controls maintain
    safety by keeping a check on potential hazards. Results drawn from such analysis
    could also aid in finding sustainable alternatives. These advantages are very
    beneficial for governance, and the government has collaborated with the IT industry
    in developing and launching schemes that help alleviate the environmental conditions.
    The ‘National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)’ was established in 2020 by the central
    government that is predicted to reduce 20–30% of particulate matter concentration
    in 4 years by 2024 (NCAP, 2020). Another such flagship scheme introduced by the
    government is the ‘Namami Gange Programme’ that aims to reduce water pollution,
    conserve effectively and revive river Ganga (Namami Gange Programme, 2020). With
    the enormous number of benefits and applications, Data Science, in my opinion,
    has not yet reached its full potential. This is because ‘Data’ forms the foundation
    of Data Science, and without accurate and complete data, ambitious goals can be
    challenging to achieve. A recent paper published on the 10th of October 2021 (Callaghan
    et al., 2021) successfully collected enough evidence to conclude- based on mapping
    of 10000 attributes- that almost 80% of the land area globally is affected by
    climate changes caused by human actions. This is an excellent insight although
    the researchers also identified the ‘attribution gap’. Though the paper could
    draw important information about global climate models, it failed to understand
    the impact of climate on low-income countries. This was because they were unable
    to collect enough data from these regions. Shruti Nath, a researcher at Climate
    Analytics, said, “Developing countries are at the forefront of climate impacts,
    but we can see in our study there are real blind spots when it comes to climate
    impact data. Most of the areas where we are not able to connect the dots attribution-wise
    are in Africa. This has real implications for adaptation planning and access to
    funding in these places” (Mercator, 2021). Although curation of data and its quality
    remains a problem, my belief in the potential of this field stays unaltered. Though
    there are many hurdles on the way, Data Scientists are working hard in fighting
    these challenges and coming up with new and improved solutions every day. 3.5.4.
    Contribution 22 – the IS/IT in addressing the challenges of climate change – Dr
    Matti Mäntymäki 3.5.4.1. Need of increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT Digital services, platforms, and infrastructures consume significant
    amounts of electricity globally. On the other hand, digital infrastructures consume
    electricity. From this vantage point, for example Bitcoin can hardly be considered
    an environmentally sustainable technology. Moreover, the upgrade from HD to 4–8 K
    quality in video has an effect on the energy consumption of the devices such as
    smartphones and tables used to watch the videos. Considering the global smartphone
    penetration, energy consumption of smartphones is a significant sustainability
    issue. All in all, this calls for increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT development and operations. This in turn requires that sustainability
    impact of digital services, platforms, and infrastructures be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion. 3.5.4.2. Reducing digital waste through
    IS/IT design As the volumes of data being created, transmitted, and stored have
    skyrocketed also the volumes of ’digital waste’, i.e. unused digital content,
    have surged. To provide some perspective of this phenomenon, CO2 emissions of
    YouTube in 2019 was evaluated to equal a city size of Glasgow.7 A well-known example
    of how IS/IT design could reduce CO2 emissions is not to show video for users
    who are only listening to audio. This idea of digital waste reduction videos could
    be taken a step further by default by asking the user if he/she wants to see the
    video in addition to the audio content. In addition, energy efficiency can be
    considered in website design. Typically, today’s websites are dynamic. While this
    design approach offers benefits in terms of user experience, it basically requires
    that the server hosting the website creates the website for the user. A static
    website that is stored on the server and updated on a 12-hour or 24-hour interval
    is considerably more power efficient. 3.5.4.3. Research-based decision-making
    to accelerate adoption of ‘green initiatives’ Resulting from the increased innovation
    around Greentech, there will be various new technological solutions to address
    the challenges of climate change. The effectiveness and impact of technological
    tools is dependent on their successful implementation as well as adoption and
    use by the users. The academic IS community has worked on technology adoption
    for decades and the individual-level technology adoption has evolved to be one
    of the most mature areas of academic IS research (Venkatesh, Davis, & Morris,
    2007). Hence, the IS community is well-equipped to contribute to the deployment
    of various technological solutions targeted to fight climate change. 3.5.4.4.
    Sharing economy and circular economy as a means towards more resource-effective
    societies The sharing economy is one way for existing resources to be used more
    efficiently (Sutherland & Jarrahi, 2018). Sharing economy at scale is typically
    executed through digital platforms. Digital platforms such as Uber are famous
    for leveraging data, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence to predict
    and balance supply and demand. Another mechanism toward a more resource-efficient
    society is the circular economy. It is evident that executing a circular economy
    requires implementation of digital infrastructures where the physical and digital
    elements go hand-in-hand (see Lee, 2008; Rajkumar, Lee, Sha, & Stankovic, 2010).
    3.5.5. Contribution 23 – the value of information management in the built environment
    to tackle climate change – Mr Henry Fenby-Taylor The built environment is made
    up of sectors that have an outsize responsibility when it comes to the future
    of our planet. It provides us with our economic infrastructure – power lines,
    roads, railways, utilities, as well as our social infrastructure of homes, schools,
    hospitals and so on. Yet it also contributes around 40% of the UK’s total carbon
    footprint, according to the UK Green Building Council. There is a real sense of
    urgency that this needs to change. Industry leaders are increasingly in consensus
    that they need to prioritize how they mitigate and adapt to climate change, as
    well as reduce emissions. 3.5.5.1. Unlocking the value of data Critical to tackling
    climate change in the built environment will be the use of Information Management.
    It is currently a vast, largely untapped resource that will be pivotal in transforming
    the decision making process. At its core, Information Management is about making
    efficient use of resources – it’s about transforming information about the lifecycle
    of built assets into actionable intelligence. Effective information management
    gathers information across the lifecycle of assets from design to creation to
    operation. At each of these stages, data is collected that informs better decision
    making, enabling reductions in waste, time and cost, more efficient use of resources,
    improved design and safety and increased infrastructure resilience – all essential
    for reducing carbon emissions from our built environment and serving those it
    was intended for. Although we have the technology to collect large amounts of
    data it needs to be structured, managed and shared in an effective way to make
    it valuable. The Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB), through the National
    Digital Twin programme (NDTp) is creating the Information Management Framework
    which is a collection of open, technical and non-technical standards, guidance
    and common resources to enable secure and resilient sharing of data across sector
    and organizational boundaries. There are already some excellent examples of successful
    green Information Management in practice. The Energy and Carbon Reporting Framework
    developed by the CDBB, WMEBoom and the Construction Innovation Hub defines when
    operational energy and emissions need to be analyzed and reported during the lifecycle
    of built assets. This tool is providing organizations like NHS Scotland and their
    supply chain the ability to effectively identify and therefore control the energy
    and carbon impact of their built assets. It also supports the Construction Leadership
    Council''s CO2nstructZero programme which sets out how the construction sector
    can meet the Net Zero challenge. 3.5.5.2. Sharing data to improve climate resilience
    The sharing of data is an important part of the process. At the NDTp, the Climate
    Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) provides a practical example of how connected
    data and greater access to the right information across organizational and sectoral
    boundaries can improve climate adaptation and resilience. Collaborating on CReDo
    are Anglian Water, BT and UK Power Networks who will use their asset and operations
    data as well as weather data on a secure, shared basis to inform an increased
    level of infrastructure resilience. CReDo will integrate data between energy,
    water and telecoms networks to improve climate resilience decision-making across
    infrastructure systems. 3.5.5.3. Fit for the future Although it is clear we should
    be pushing towards a green information economy, there remain hurdles - we need
    a workforce with the appropriate skills who can make it happen. Our work at the
    CDBB has a socio-technical focus and part of this is balancing the technology
    with the people aspect. That is why we commissioned a Skills and Competency Framework
    report, a joint collaboration between Mott MacDonald, Lane4 team and the Construction
    Innovation Hub, that sets out the key roles and skills needed. It is a very practical
    framework that allows organizations and individuals to assess their own needs
    and consider how to address them. 3.5.5.4. A shift in culture Data is no longer
    a commodity to be hoarded, but a resource to be shared. If industry and government
    are serious about tackling climate change there needs to be collaboration and
    there needs to be interoperability between information management systems, so
    that we use all the data we have in a relevant, impactful way. 3.5.6. Contribution
    24 – What can information technology and systems researchers and educators do
    to mitigate climate change? – Dr Wu He To respond to climate change, a significant
    threat to the United States and the world, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences,
    Engineering and Medicine has convened a committee of experts and published a report
    in 2021 to highlight the need for transforming the world''s energy system to one
    with net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2050 (NASEM, 2021). The report
    emphasizes the need to invest in new technology, expand innovation toolkits, and
    reduce the cost of existing technology in a socially just way. My Views on the
    above four questions: 3.5.6.1. Energy Use and Technology The information management,
    information technology, and information systems sectors highly depend on computers,
    sensors, and a wide variety of physical and electronic devices. However, the production
    and use of computers, sensors, storage devices, and other electronic devices require
    a tremendous amount of energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and causing
    harm to the environment. For example, data centers consist of a large number of
    servers and computing resources interconnected by high-speed networks, which need
    to work nonstop 24 × 7. Data centers have to rely on cooling systems to ensure
    all those machines do not overheat. Such cooling systems consume a lot of energy.
    The United States Data Center Energy Usage Report (Shehabi et al., 2016) indicates
    that data centers in the U.S. alone likely consumed approximately 73 billion kWh
    in 2020. Energy efficiency strategies and technologies, including AI and data
    analytics, could help monitor data centers’ energy usage and significantly improve
    energy conservation to reduce cost and carbon emissions. Google has reported using
    AI to reduce energy consumption in its data centers by as much as 40% (Evans &
    Gao, 2016). 3.5.6.2. Potential of information technology on mitigation of climate
    change Information technology has great potential to increase the energy efficiency
    of buildings, transportation systems, manufacturing, supply chains, power grids,
    infrastructure, and agriculture, enabling sustainable solutions for energy consumption
    and usage. Low-cost internet of things (IoT) sensors and devices (e.g., smart
    thermostats, smart humidifiers, smart air purifier, smart air conditioner, smart
    fans, smart blinds, and so on) have been used to reduce energy consumption and
    achieve long term cost savings by tailoring climate-control according to real-time
    needs and lifestyle of people and their schedule (either in the building or away).
    Teleconferencing, telemedicine, e-commerce, and e-learning technologies are playing
    a role in reducing unnecessary travel and thus reducing total emissions into the
    environment. These sensor-based technologies can continuously collect massive
    amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and other relevant parameters
    and adjust based on optimal standards or human preferences and needs. Big data
    analysis and visualization can be leveraged to unlock insights that will help
    individuals, organizations and communities track electricity consumption patterns,
    identify energy leaks, improve energy use efficiency, and find creative ways to
    conserve energy and adapt to climate change faster and better. 3.5.6.3. Suggested
    research agenda on climate change Several potential research ideas on climate
    change for information management, information systems, and technology researchers
    are listed below: • Conducting empirical research to collect first-hand evidence
    and develop evidence-based guidelines and suggestions to help practitioners design
    and implement Green IT(green information technology) and Green IS (green information
    systems) initiatives within their organization. Green IS (green information systems)
    refers to the use of information systems to achieve environmental objectives.
    In contrast, Green IT (green information technology) refers to the practice of
    environmentally sustainable computing and emphasizes reducing the environmental
    impacts of IT production and use (Dedrick, 2010). Green IT/IS can help reduce
    the negative consequences of technology production on the environment and contribute
    to sustainable solutions, including environmentally sustainable business processes,
    practices, and end products in organizations and communities (Boudreau, Chen,
    & Huber, 2008). • Studying the adoption of energy-saving IT in locations like
    home, businesses and communities, and assessing the impacts of information technology
    innovations on human behavior, mitigation of climate change, and relevant policymaking.
    • Conducting design-based research on designing and developing AI-based techniques,
    modeling and simulation, decision support tools, games, visualization, and other
    technologies or approaches that help the general public visualize and understand
    possible impacts of climate change. • Studying the use of games, mobile apps,
    augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality and other technology innovations
    in promoting environmentally sustainable behavior that contributes to climate
    change mitigation. Such studies could help understand the role of human behavior
    in achieving climate change mitigation strategies, reveal insights why people
    choose to engage in specific environmentally sustainable behavior or not, develop
    innovative approaches, policies, best practices, and solutions to climate change
    (Douglas & Brauer, 2021). 3.5.6.4. IT/IS education on climate change This generation
    and future generations need to understand the impacts of climate change on our
    daily lives and society. IT/IS education could play a critical role in helping
    individuals and communities in the understanding of the science behind climate
    change and what steps are needed to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming caused by climate change and human activity. IS/IT educators could use
    project-based or problem-based learning approaches to engage students to explore
    specific climate change issues and community-related climate datasets (e.g., heat,
    cold, rain, drought, snow, wind, river, lake, ocean, water quality, air quality,
    and coastal flooding) and to assess the impact of potential solutions by leverage
    existing software, tools and techniques such as data analysis and visualization,
    modeling and simulation, augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality, and
    AI techniques. When students are asked to use technology tools to explore specific
    climate change issues and datasets of interest or relevance to their local communities,
    they are more likely to become interested and engage in active learning for systems
    thinking, complex problem-solving, creativity, and evidence-informed decision-making.
    In the meantime, they will become familiar with these software, tools, and techniques
    through learning by using them to analyze data and solve problems in a meaningful
    way. Students will have a chance to develop interdisciplinary skills to interpret
    complex data analysis and visualization results into informed decisions and sound
    policies. The ability and skills to interpret data and communicate results to
    support the decision-making process are important for IT/IS students to become
    effective decision makers or problem-solvers in their careers. IS/IT educators
    are recommended to come up with concrete learning activities, to develop technology-related
    case studies, tutorials, projects, and exercises on the topic of climate change,
    and to encourage their students to work on collaborative or hands-on projects
    using open-source resources, including various datasets and open-source software
    and tools available on the Internet, such as CODAP, R, Python, and more. There
    exists significant levels of climate change, open-source projects on GitHub, which
    is an excellent way for IT/IS students to learn, practice, and contribute. 3.6.
    Technology and IS research agenda 3.6.1. Contribution 25 – holistically missing:
    climate change and information systems research – Professor Samuli Pekkola 3.6.1.1.
    Introduction and related activities In Finland, the Ministry of Transport and
    Communications recently published a climate and environmental strategy for the
    information and communication technology sector (Ojala & Oksanen, 2021). The strategy
    defines ICT related objectives and measures for carbon-neutral Finland, paying
    attention to ICT infrastructures and their energy efficiency, making recommendations
    on energy aspects in software and service procurement, considering material flows
    and recycling of the devices, suggesting energy consumption statistics on data
    centers, and increasing awareness of energy specific issues of software and hardware.
    These areas and objectives, and their measures are evidently impactful on climate
    change. They increase awareness and provide general goals. Unfortunately, the
    strategy pays no attention to how the use of ICT impacts on climate and environment.
    The use aspect is touched, for example, in the European Commission’s ICT for Sustainable
    Growth (2021) program, where, similarly to Estonia (2018), UK (Howes, 2020), and
    Norway (2016), the point of foci is on sustainable economics, not on sustainable
    ecology, environment, green ICT, or climate change – whatever term is adopted.
    This means that, in practice, environmental issues and ICT are approached either
    sporadically with a narrow view and disconnected contexts, or indirectly in the
    context of economic growth and prosperity. Similarly, IT/IS literature sees environmental
    issues as something that the ICT managers should consider in their work. For example,
    Esfahani, Rahman, and Zakaria (2015) and Singh and Sahu (2020) summarized the
    green IS studies focusing on the benefits, adoption, design and implementation,
    or initiation of green IS projects. Loeser (2013) takes a more concrete approach
    and lists a variety of different contexts for green IS initiatives. Wang X. (2015),
    Wang Y. (2015)’s meritorious literature review parallels these and poses a set
    of research questions, all aiming to understand the green IS initiatives. In general,
    it seems that IS literature focuses the adoption of ideas of climate change into
    the IS activities and context. Comprehensive understanding about how to apply
    and use IT/IS to improve the situation regarding climate change seem to be scarce.
    3.6.1.2. Towards a holistic understanding of IS and climate change The absence
    of comprehensive approaches is surprising especially after the lessons from COVID-19.
    For example, the amount of traveling decreased up to 90% in California due to
    stay-at-home orders (Schilling 2020). At the same time, air quality improved significantly
    (Eregowda, Chatterjee, & Pawar, 2021). People have learned new ways of working,
    learning, and living, without a need to travel to work, school, or anywhere. Although
    these settings of distant working, online learning, and online shopping, traveling,
    and leisure have been studied (c.f. Dwivedi et al., 2020; Pan & Zhang, 2020),
    the approach is again contextual: how to use IS in online meetings or education,
    how to provide or acquire goods, food, or services online, and how to manage and
    govern the IT (Herath & Herath, 2020). Contextual approach becomes problematic
    with the interconnectivity of systems and the systems of systems. For example
    during the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning tools have turned out to be quite
    efficient in conveying learning contexts to distant learners, although some learning-related
    difficulties have been identified (Chen and Roldan, 2021, Xie et al., 2020). Yet
    the difficulties may go beyond the learning contexts. Online activities have been
    reported to increase loneliness, disconnectivity with fellow students and teachers,
    distraction, mental problems, and increased workload (Maqableh and Alia, 2021,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). These negative issues may have unpredictably long-lasting
    effects on learners: for instance, do they know the topics, have they made friends,
    and have they learned to interact in face-to-face situations? The quality of an
    online learning environment may have an impact on the rest of the learner’ life.
    Similarly, targeting green IS/IT activities locally may, or may not, be beneficial
    from the viewpoint of climate change. They may have unintended consequences similarly
    to online learning: activities seemingly beneficial in the short term may possibly
    be harmful in the long run. This notion leads to following research topics: •
    What are the long-term effects of green ICT investments? To climate and environment?
    To people: employees, learners, travelers, and their ways of doing, working, and
    living? To institutions? To firms and other organizations? To other parts of the
    system? • When do the benefits of green ICT investments exceed its investment
    costs? The example of an electric car illustrates this: building an electric car
    is more environmentally harmful than building a petrol car, but the tide turns
    when the car is used enough. What is this turning point for a green IT/IS investment?
    And most importantly: • How can ICT be used to improve the situation regarding
    climate change? Interestingly, we are studying how the ideas and isms of climate
    change and green ICT are adopted, but not how ICT should be used to reduce climate
    change. This has been touched by sustainable economic endeavors, but aren’t there
    any other values in addition to economic issues? 3.6.2. Contribution 26 – information
    technology and climate change – Professor Rameshwar Dubey Irresponsible human
    activities are well reflected in the form of rising sea levels, forest fires,
    extinction of some rare species, the meteoric rise in floods in many parts of
    the world, and fast-shrinking levels of safe drinking water. These are clear indications
    that human influence on climate systems is clear and growing (Wright & Nyberg,
    2017). Whyte (2020) argues that it is now too late to avoid dangerous climate
    change. The negative effects of climate change have attracted significant attention
    from the world''s top leaders, industry, media, and policymakers (Banerjee, 2001,
    Kolk and Pinkse, 2008, Mees et al., 2019). Some scholars argue that “climate change
    threatens irreversible and dangerous impacts,” that may have serious negative
    effects on people and ecosystems (Whyte, 2020), and to address the pressing global
    threat, there exists a unanimous call for an immediate reduction in carbon emission
    levels (Park, Byun, Deo, & Lee, 2015). Although the COVID-19 crisis has caused
    severe discomfort and impacted human lives in significant ways, studies have identified
    signs of some positive and visible regional effects on the planet (Khan, Shah,
    & Shah, 2021). This could be easily explained by a change in behaviors during
    lockdown that has reduced human activities such as transportation, irresponsible
    consumption, production, and industrial activities. In the last two years, there
    is some evidence of an improvement in the quality of air, water and the environment
    looks greener and cleaner than it used to be (Everard et al., 2021). This change
    has been possible due to the role of emerging technologies, (Dwivedi et al., 2020,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). Many scholars have found positive effects from emerging
    technologies on environmental sustainability: big data and predictive analytics
    capability (Dubey et al., 2019), blockchain technology (Saberi, Kouhizadeh, Sarkis,
    & Shen, 2019), AI (Nishant et al., 2020), and cloud computing enabled supply chain
    design (Shee, Miah, Fairfield, & Pujawan, 2018). However, the COVID-19 crisis
    has further accelerated the debate on “how information technology capabilities
    or information management scholars” can help tackle climate change (He, Zhang,
    & Li, 2021). Despite the general optimism in the role of environmentally friendly
    technologies or emerging technologies in tackling climate challenges, some developed
    and developing economies, industry and global corporations still remain skeptical
    about the role of information technology in tackling the climate change crisis
    (Teräväinen et al., 2014). Wright and Nyberg (2017) argue that the organizations
    in pursuit of their economic gains have in the past lobbied against carbon emissions
    initiatives and further delayed constructive action. Despite the rich body of
    literature on the corporation''s initiative towards mitigating the carbon emissions
    problem (Banerjee, 2001, Wright and Nyberg, 2017), organizational/ management/
    information technology scholars have an important role to play particularly in
    addressing the climate change crisis. There is a need for theory-driven research
    that provides an in-depth understanding of both the causes and possible solutions
    to tackle climate change. We note some clear research gaps in the academic literature
    and posit the following research questions that may help bridge the gaps in our
    understanding and the expected role of the information technology /emerging technologies
    in tackling the climate change crisis: a. How AI-enabled predictive analytics
    techniques may help identify some of the economic activities in some parts of
    the world which are contributing to carbon emissions? b. How the use of distributed
    ledger technology (DLT) and AI can help identify the role of some corporations
    involved in unethical practices that led to contamination of water bodies and
    deforestation? c. How the use of AI enables predictive analytics to detect issues
    during logistics and transportation within developing economies thereby contributing
    to a reduction in carbon emissions? d. How AI-enabled technologies can help build
    swift trust and collaboration among the stakeholders engaged in tackling the climate
    change crises? 3.6.3. Contribution 27 – blockchain and climate change – Dr Daniela
    Andreini Of all technologies in place in the market, the one I know best is the
    blockchain. This technology has environmental, social and economic impacts, and
    in these few words, I would like to focus on the ecological aspects. 3.6.3.1.
    How IM/IT/IS sector has any negative impact on the environment and how it can
    be reduced Like any other technology, blockchain creates a digital ecosystem composed
    of multiple hardware devices, program files, and different actors'' data files.
    Another critical component of the ecosystem is interacting and exchanging cryptocurrencies,
    files, information, etc. The sustainability of the blockchain is controversial;
    for instance, O''Dwyer and Malone (2014) stated that the energy consumption of
    the Bitcoin mining network is comparable with the Ireland electricity consumption.
    In the same way, we can think about the energy and infrastructural consumption
    of all the IM/IT/IS systems that cause enormous energy and infrastructural consumption
    and thus a tremendous environmental impact. 3.6.3.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized
    to improve situation regarding climate change At the same time, other authors
    demonstrated that the artificial intelligence and IT ecosystem could find more
    efficient ways to create and exchange information and virtual services. For instance,
    for what concerns bitcoins, Dimitriou and Karame (2013) demonstrated that in mining
    bitcoins, if a miner can create a block more efficiently and speedily than another
    one, the system will substitute the less efficient miner with the most productive
    and profitable one. This mechanism drives the entire system towards a more effective
    way to use and consume energy and infrastructures. Thus, the IM/IT/IS systems
    can be the sources and the solution of energy consumption and dispersion. 3.6.3.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change The
    cost and climate impact of blockchain are strictly related to its diffusion. For
    instance, in this historical moment, the substitution of traditional currencies
    with bitcoins in our monetary system would be too expensive in energy consumption,
    and thus it could not be sustainable. Therefore, in finance, for instance, more
    research is needed to understand how the two monetary systems can coexist efficiently.
    The same thing can be extended to other IM/IT/IS systems: virtualized and physical
    transactions should coexist to balance environmental, social, and economic systems.
    3.6.3.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Experimentation in education
    is relevant, and more educational systems should turn into laboratories, where
    institutions should offer problem-solving driven teaching methods. 3.6.4. Contribution
    28 – towards a relevant agenda for environmental issues within KM/IM/IS/IT – Professor
    Johan Olaisen The climate crisis is the largest threat to civilization we have
    ever faced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018
    made the science very clear. There are significant climate impacts all around
    the world even if we limit warming to the recommended 1.5 C. The report also showed
    there are significant increases in impacts and damages between 1.5 and 2.0 C.
    These results were fully supported by the IPCC science report (2021). We are building
    our living standards upon coal, gas, and oil, and few of us want to change our
    lives, and new global generations are coming that want our living standards. Every
    corporation wants to be green and practice sustainability even if the reality
    of the image is most often an illusion or just a fashion (Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbd). What is the research situation within knowledge management
    (KM), information management (IM), information technology (IT) and information
    system (IS) research? We investigated all academic papers 2016–2020 (N = 481)
    delivered at the European Conference for Knowledge Management (ECKM). We found
    that less than 5% of the papers investigated climate issues and concluded that
    the KM/IM/IT/IS potentially harms environmental-climate issues owing to neglect
    (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd). All research consists of problem, knowledge,
    and methodology sentences. We get traditional pragmatic business-as-usual research
    when there is an over-focus upon methodology and knowledge sentences and a low
    focus upon problems. We must start to ask the research questions about environmental
    and sustainability issues. Through verification and falsification (Popper, 1974),
    research is expected to come up with theories, paradigms, perspectives (Kuhn,
    1962) that explains and explores practices that we may evaluate, giving us either
    empirical research or critical research (what is acceptable/not acceptable) or
    constructed research (what is adequate and what is not adequate). Most research
    is empirical, and to get more focus upon environmental issues, we must get more
    constructed and critical research setting up the green and sustainable agenda.
    We must ask the essential questions about if the academic papers involve acceptable
    or not acceptable climate solutions or if the papers are adequate or not adequate
    for relevant climate issues. Fig. 3 presents the model of the climate crisis issues

    crisis in information research. Research deals with four paradigms: the empirical,
    the materialistic (political), clarified subjectivity, and action papers. Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb found that nearly all papers
    might be classified as empirical and as a form of clarified subjectivity papers
    in harmony with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. We must invite
    papers in conflict with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. These papers
    will be representing the materialistic political and action paradigms. We must
    ask how research papers, often in conflict, contribute to climate issues. To get
    green and sustainable papers, we must get more problem-focused research on climate
    issues, more critical and constructed papers, more exploring papers built upon
    sensitizing concepts and less upon definitive concepts, and more political and
    action-based papers. Most of all, we need editors and conference chairs dedicated
    to climate issues asking for adequate and critical papers on this topic that might
    be political, action-based, and problems often based in conflict with existing
    issues, knowledge, and methodology. A political economy paradigm for the climate
    crisis in information research is a complement to presently prevailing concepts.
    KM/IM/IS/IT research and papers might be utilized to be a knowledge café, outlet,
    and center for environmental issues and perspectives. We might develop an environmental
    paradigm for relevant KM/IM/IS/IT research. We might define another future for
    societies and organizations. We might be giving the picture of a pluralistic sustainable
    future and even a utopia (More, 1973). We already have the experience through
    AI and robotics forming the fourth industrial revolution and solving the environmental
    issues is the fifth industrial revolution based upon the perspectives from KM/IM/IS/IT
    research. The paradigms within information research focusing upon the climate

    use in the climate crisis. The objective and agenda of IS/I/IT/KM research strategy
    for sustainability are to help to promote knowledge, information, systems, and
    technology that will: • Resolve national and global challenges relating to sustainability
    in corporations and societies • Facilitate industrial development that enhances
    sustainability and increases green competitiveness • Promote the innovativeness
    and creativity for sustainable solutions • Such objectives will include areas
    like: • Reduced climate change and effective adaptation measures • Preservation
    of ecosystems services and lower environmental impacts • Sustainable cities, corporations,
    regions, and transport systems • The circular knowledge economy The IPCC, 2018,
    IPCC, 2021 have mentioned five areas: Food and ecology, Sustainable cities, Energy
    and material, Health and wellbeing, Transportation. IT/IS/IM/KM are mentioned
    as essential for all these areas, and there is a need for developing the areas
    into issues for journals and conferences. The identified focus for research within
    information research is in Scandinavia sustainable private and public cases where
    the green and sustainable practices are documented. These cases should be developed
    into model cases for KM/IM/IS/IT. The cases should be used as action research
    cases promoting a sustainable practise (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd).
    The Scandinavian impact model might look like Fig. 5: Download : Download high-res
    image (118KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The Scandinavian impact
    model of information research. An important issue is how KM/IM/S/IT in higher
    education should reflect the environmental issues. Education that ensures future
    competencies upon sustainability, reuse, and environmental issues is essential.
    Environmental, green, and sustainable practices are an essential part of green
    education. Green KM/IT/IM/IS practice in action will be significant to get the
    students to participate in the transformational changes. The students must understand
    how different practices influence the environment. I have developed an executive
    program at BI (Oslo) “Sustainable leadership-in-action," where sustainable practices
    are discussed and reflected upon through collaboration with Norwegian businesses
    and the participants'' experiences and where the students project paper is an
    empirical paper reflecting and learning from green practices with a synopsis as
    a reflection upon how they have implemented sustainable practices in their organizations.
    Ideally, should environmental issues be a part of all programs. KM/IM/IS/IT are
    innovative and creative tools for the solutions to environmental issues. Let COP26
    also be the starting line for new objectives, areas, and education within KM/IM/IS/IT.
    We have every tool we need within information research to help to reduce and tackle
    the climate crisis. Let us all contribute!. 4. A brief overview of full opinion

    for Future Research Trkman and Černe (2022) Humanizing digital life – Reducing
    emissions while enhancing value- adding human processes. The opinion article by
    Ågerfalk et al. (2022), explores the Scandinavian perspectives on three current
    research projects where digital transformation is posited as offering a positive
    force in the fight against climate change and its impact on the world. The research
    viewed the climate change challenges from a stakeholder-centric perspective, emphasizing
    the criticality of closely involving people to engender the necessary change required
    in the design of digital technologies and the requirement for green IS researchers
    to engage in a collaborative context. It is vital that emerging technology focussed
    solutions, designed to combat climate change, take account of the necessary ethical
    dimensions and values from the onset to negate the potential scenario of technological
    innovations exacerbating the climate change problem. These aspects are analyzed
    by Brooks et al. (2022) where the opinion article highlights the importance of
    technologies delivering the required socio-economic impact through climate engineering
    solutions. Via a review of the relevant literature, the research reveals the disjointed
    nature of ethical dimensions in many cases, lagging behind emerging technological
    innovations. The study advocates a rebalancing of emphasis where ethical dimensions
    are an integral element of the climate engineering process. The opinion article
    by Laukkanen et al. (2022) argues for the usefulness of virtual technologies for
    changing human consumption behavior toward more sustainable consumption behaviors.
    The article argues that such technologies could provide greater opportunities
    to influence consumer decisions than the present digital environment. The article
    details a discussion on technology-assisted sensory marketing, cognitive and emotive
    aspects of virtual reality, and outlines applications of virtual reality technologies
    to encourage sustainable consumption. The opinion article led by Papadopoulos
    and Balta (2022), highlights the low levels of existing studies that focus on
    the role of Big Data Analytics (BDA) and impact of climate change, positing the
    potential opportunities for more sustainable operations and supply chains. The
    study assesses the challenges faced by operations and supply chains, asserting
    the contribution from BDA in providing a valuable role in the development of solutions
    to the myriad of climate related problems. Environmental sustainability from a
    technology acceptance perspective, is discussed in Papagiannidis and Marikyan
    (2022), where the opinion article highlights the dichotomy of technology negatively
    impacting the environment, whilst helping to manage and save precious natural
    resources. The research offers insights to the technology acceptance process from
    the sustainability perspective, arguing for a change in approach from researchers
    to be more cognisant of the impact of systems on the environment, thereby engendering
    environmentally compliant behaviors. Researchers have highlighted the valuable
    role of smart and climate intelligent cities in the transition from current high
    emission urban infrastructure. The opinion article by Pee and Pan (2022) calls
    for resilient urbanization to weather the impending climate shocks that are likely
    to materialize as a direct result of global warming. The research posits the role
    of IS research and its potential contribution to energy and resource optimization
    and the role of IS in the contribution to mitigating many of the current climate
    change related challenges. The opinion article by Pan et al. (2022) offers an
    Australia focussed perspective to approaching the climate change crisis highlighting
    the role of innovative technologies with huge transformative potential such as
    AI, analytics and IoT to tackle global warming whilst adhering to sustainable
    development goals. The researchers posit a research agenda that focuses on: climate
    resilience, climate-conscious citizen science, and substantive ESG strategies
    that can positively impact global warming. The key challenges related to redesigning
    the necessary human processes to eliminate environmentally harmful activities,
    while maintaining humans’ fundamental value proposition are discussed in the opinion
    article by Trkman and Černe (2022). The opinion article discusses a future world
    where humans transition from digitalization to a human digitalization, recognizing
    the critical role of government and research institutions for this change. The
    researchers highlight the role that technology can have in identifying, planning,
    enabling and executing the required changes in human behavior, as well as measuring
    and communicating their impact. 5. Discussion and recommendations This section
    elaborates on the expert contributions presented in Section 3, to reveal the key
    emphasis and emerging themes relating to digital technology, IS and climate change.
    We highlight the implications for government and society, and develop a number
    of key recommendations for policy, practice and education. 5.1. Expert Contribution

    inputs. 5.2. Emerging Issues and recommended actions Whilst the views on the extent
    of the role of digital technology and IS in combating climate change vary amongst
    the contributors, there is general consensus that technology is an integral component
    of the overall solution, whilst at the same time - a fundamental aspect of the
    problem (Muregesan, 2008; Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). There exists a realization
    amongst many of the contributors that a more sustainable implementation of technology
    in all its forms, needs to be at the forefront of solutions to get to net zero,
    the mistakes of old cannot be repeated once more. A number of the submitted articles
    reference the negative impact of human behavior and people''s attitudes in their
    day to day use of technology, positing the necessity for a transformative change
    in the way technology is developed, used and recycled. The expert input by Professor
    Davison illustrates these points specifically, highlighting the study by Clarke
    and Davison (2020), where the study asserts that very few studies within the IS
    research discourse, viewed the major challenges from the environmental perspective
    or included the environment as a key stakeholder. Professors Constantiou and Vendelø
    develop a narrative that highlights the potential use of technological solutions
    to facilitate the necessary change in human behaviors, citing how technology could
    be used to: identifying climate impact of transportation options, reduction in
    food waste via collaborative consumption and education on sustainable cooking.
    Behavioral influences from the community perspective in the context of faith and
    youth activism, are discussed in the expert inputs by Dr Abumoghli and Professor
    Panteli respectively, highlighting the important role of technology in building
    active communities that challenge the status quo. The expert input from Professor
    Metri cites the study by Junior et al. (2018) to highlight the woeful record of
    environmental sustainability from the technology industry, where the article posits
    the necessity of embedding the UN SDGs within technology design considerations
    and the potential of penalties for organizations that fail to change behaviors.
    The educational awareness and requirements for changed working practices, are
    discussed within a number of submitted articles, where these aspects are viewed
    from the technological perspective and impact on progress to net zero. The expert
    inputs from Professor Barlette and Drs Nishant and Teo identify the need for the
    IS community to educate more effectively to instil a greater awareness of the
    impact from technology adoption and the delicate balance between benefits toward
    net zero and contributing to the problem. The impact of climate change can be
    effectively monitored via the use of technology leading to a greater awareness
    amongst people to change their behaviors. These points are discussed in the expert
    input from Professor Tiwari where the article asserts the benefits of education
    at a community level, to empower people to gain access to knowledge and relevant
    data and assist vulnerable populations in the fight against climate change. The
    manufacture of technology based products relies on the use of precious and finite
    natural resources, at significant cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The
    expert inputs by Professors Rowe, Raman and Rana illustrate some of the negative
    impacts on the environment from the use of technology and the necessity for organizations
    to change their working practices to be more cognisant of the impact from the
    choices we make, the effect on the planet and support for the transition to environmentally
    friendly products. Professor Rana further emphasizes the need for education not
    just on climate change but also on how to use technology in a responsible way
    to help reduce carbon emissions and become ambassadors for sustainable living.
    The expert inputs by Professor Michael and Dr Abbas discuss the importance of
    a transition from current IS design practices to a more sustainability focussed
    approach and framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015), presenting a socio-technical sustainable
    design cycle for responsible systems design. A number of the expert contributions
    discussed perspectives relating to the impact of people and communities, where
    key aspects of technology can be used to ensure humans live and work with a “lighter
    touch” to conserve precious resources and attain net zero via the innovative use
    of IS infrastructure (Elbanna at a., 2020). The expert input by Professor Kodama
    references the increasing focus on smart communities in the form of smart cities
    where next generation social systems connect homes, buildings and transport, within
    an environmentally supportive infrastructure, highlighting the criticality of
    an emphasis based on IT collaboration to deliver meaningful change. The smart
    city contribution to reduced emissions is discussed by Professor Scholtz, where
    the contribution highlights the smart environment dimensions of smart cities (Van
    der Hoogen et al., 2020), and the necessity for addressing the necessary skills
    and educational requirements to ensure people can interact with smart infrastructure,
    thereby attaining the intended benefits and sustainable outcomes. The expert input
    from Professor De’ discussed the issues surrounding Green IS initiatives (Dedrick,
    2010; Khuntia et al., 2018; Melville, 2010), and how digital technologies can
    counter the effects of climate change. The article highlights the need for a greater
    emphasis on gender rebalancing to counter the poor access to technology from women
    in developing nations and the disproportionate effect that environmental change
    has on women. Studies have posited the need for a greater focus on responsible
    digitization and corporate digital responsibility (Crawford, 2021; Lobschat et
    al., 2021). These aspects are discussed in the expert inputs from Professor Wade
    and also Professor Sarker where both articulate the need for organizations and
    consumers to take a more holistic view on the use of technology across the full
    lifecycle, highlighting the need for a more balanced, realistic and wider debate
    on environmental tradeoffs. The article by Professor Sein and Dr Chandra Kruse
    advocates a Design Science Research (DSR) approach from the IS community when
    developing sustainability and global warming solutions. This approach aims to
    create new knowledge through building methods and artifacts that are aligned with
    improving societal problems via the greater adoption of green practices. The literature
    has posited the role of technology in the monitoring and governance of climate
    change progression, via the extensive use of IS systems and remote sensing devices
    to provide the necessary data to scientists and decision makers at a global level
    (Bunker, 2020, Nüttgens et al., 2011). The expert input by Dr Mäntymäki highlights
    the need for a greater awareness of the sustainability impact of digital services,
    platforms, and infrastructure and that these systems be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion to mitigate the surge in unused digital
    content - so called digital waste. The expert inputs from Professor Gupta, Professor
    Bunker and from Mr Fenby-Taylor elaborate on these crucial aspects where they
    posit the benefits of improved data innovation practice, transitional approaches
    to complex information governance and effective information management to engender
    a culture shift in the use of data in all its forms, more collaboratively, thereby
    delivering impactful change. The expert input by Ms Shah highlights the critical
    role of data science processes to inform decision makers, monitoring of potential
    environmental hazards and accurate modeling of global warming scenarios. In the
    contribution from Dr He, he discussed the role of data analysis and climate change,
    where the role of sensor-based technologies was highlighted in the collection
    of huge amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and develop insights
    to conserve and improve energy use. A number of the submitted expert inputs discussed
    topics associated with IS and digital technology research, commenting on the current
    position and potential agendas for the future. The expert input from Professor
    Pekkola criticised the narrow approach taken by organizations and public bodies
    where environmental issues and ICT are approached from disparate perspectives
    in the context of economic growth and prosperity. The article from Professor Dubey
    posits the need for theory-driven research utilizing AI based approaches to provide
    a better understanding of the causes of climate change and potential solutions.
    The impact of blockchain technology and the environment was discussed in the submission
    from Dr Andreini, where the article asserts the need for a research agenda better
    aligned to understanding how the traditional and cryptocurrencies can coexist
    more effectively. The article from Professor Olaisen critiqued the current IS
    literature, finding that a very small percentage of studies actually investigated
    climate issues, asserting the need for researchers to start to ask the necessary
    research questions, on key aspects of the environmental and sustainability issues.
    5.3. Recommendations for research The expert contributions detail a number of
    research recommendations on many aspects of technology and digital products. One
    of the key emerging themes from the contributions is the call to explicitly include
    the environment as a key stakeholder. This is referenced in the expert inputs
    by Professors Davison and Sarker and implicitly supported in many other contributions,
    where a more honest and informed perspective is required, advocating a research
    agenda that focuses on impacts as well as benefits from a responsible IS perspective.
    Many of the contributions highlight the need for further research on the role
    of IS in improving systems and processes in the transportation, agriculture and
    manufacturing industries to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and deliver
    accurate data to make better, more informed decisions. A number of contributions
    detail the critical role of IS and digital technologies in the provision of key
    data that can inform decision makers on the progress of global warming initiatives.
    Some of the topics discussed within the expert input by Professor Raman articulate
    many of the perspectives on this topic, highlighting the need for more research
    to improve the collection and dissemination of data on climate risk and use of
    sensor based IoT technologies within developing countries to alert authorities
    on emission levels. The expert input from Professor Rana supports a greater level
    of research focus on the socio-psychological behavioral factors surrounding the
    adoption of digital technologies, that can help inform researchers on how people
    adapt to new interactions and systems that reduce emissions. The theme of multidisciplinary
    perspectives on IS and sustainability for research agenda, is discussed by a number
    of experts including the need for greater focus on global IT collaboration. Viewing
    these perspectives from a transdisciplinary lens is advocated in the contribution
    from Professor Michael and Dr Abbas, where they posit the benefits of creating
    models and simulations within an overall sustainability framework that can encapsulate
    multi-level perspectives on the provision of data and technology interaction.
    A number of articles have referenced the role of smart technologies, smart cities
    and smart mobility, within the overall transition to a more sustainable digital
    infrastructure where people can interact with IS more effectively throughout their
    daily lives. However, as highlighted by Professor Scholtz, the focus on aligning
    smart initiatives to the UN SDGs seems to be an underdeveloped research area that
    could inform further research on key topics of sustainable water management, sanitation
    and access to sustainable energy sources. This sentiment is further explored in
    a number of articles, but particularly the call for greater multidisciplinary
    perspectives on CDR as highlighted by Professor Wade, asserting the need for a
    better understanding of the dynamics of CDR from theoretical and empirical perspectives.
    The problem of e-waste is discussed within a number of articles and further research
    in this area is explicitly called for. The article from Professor Gupta discusses
    a number of these key points that are detailed within many expert inputs, calling
    for greater research on improved strategies for dealing with this problem that
    negates the need for shifting the problem to emerging economies. The pivotal role
    of data and data science has been referenced in many submissions but particularly
    in the from Ms Shah where the article discusses the criticality of accurate data
    and empirical studies to inform key decision makers. Further research and insight
    is needed, through evidence-based initiatives to ensure the effects of global
    warming are effectively communicated to governments and organizations to ensure
    timely decisions are made and relevant resources are made available in the critical
    areas. 5.4. Recommendations for education The need for a greater educational awareness
    amongst IS researchers and users, seems to be a common thread within the submitted
    articles. A number of articles advocate a more holistic emphasis and informed
    debate on the environmental impact of technology, as well as its benefits in helping
    to mitigate further global warming and attainment of net zero by 2050. Many of
    the experts advocate a more balanced perspective within the IS and technology
    curriculum, to ensure students better understand the impact of behaviors. A number
    of articles also posit the need for better education on technologies that directly
    mitigate climate change, highlighting that this core topic seems to lack focus
    within many institutions. Technology has a critical role to play in the changing
    of human attitudes and behaviors toward sustainability. IS can educate and inform
    people about the carbon footprint to explore new innovative ways to perform everyday
    activities but in a more sustainable way. The article by Professors Constantiou
    and Vendelø illustrates how digital platforms can engender collaborative consumption
    and social entrepreneurship, educating people to redistribute unwanted products
    and reduce waste as well as influence consumers via sustainable cooking and plant
    based food. A number of experts have detailed the role of IS in the context of
    educating people through online communities. The contribution from Professor Panteli
    emphasizes this aspect, positing the role of young people and their digital activism
    in influencing a change in behaviors, whilst Dr Nishant and Professor Teo discuss
    the need for IS educators to increase awareness on green IS and the sustainability
    aspects of technology. It is clear from the submitted articles that education
    is a key component of the transition to net zero and ensuring that all stakeholders
    (industry and individuals) have the necessary knowledge to engender changes in
    behavior, is a key component of the transition. 5.5. Recommendations for practice
    and policy The UN COP26 conference gained commitment for a number of key initiatives
    that could have a significant impact on global warming. The key commitments included:
    at least 100 countries (including Brazil) agreeing to end deforestation by 2030;
    Led by the US and EU - 80 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by
    2030; Although commitment could not be gained from China, the US, India and Australia
    - 23 nations made new commitments to phase out coal power, including five of the
    top 20 users: Indonesia, South Korea, Poland, Vietnam, Chile and Ukraine; India
    committed to attaining net zero by 2070 (COP26, 2021). Governments have a critical
    role in combating global warming from the legislative and policy perspective,
    but to ensure the targets set for 2050 have a realistic chance of being achieved,
    we need change at a societal level. The IS and technology industry has a critical
    role to play in the monitoring of progress toward net zero, but also a pivotal
    role in the development of innovative solutions to better manage emissions and
    offer people alternatives to current carbon based practices. Many of the contributions
    have highlighted the crucial role of organizations adopting a green philosophy
    and demonstrating a firm commitment to CSR and CDR policies and working practices.
    A number of the experts have discussed the realities of technology contributing
    to the global warming problem due to the high levels of waste and inability for
    manufacturers to adopt a greater sustainability focus on manufacturing materials,
    processes and poor emphasis toward product repair, not replace - so called e-waste.
    The expert input by Professor Metri cites the 2019 UN and WEF reports that 50
    million tonnes of e-waste was produced in that year, with only 20% being dealt
    with sustainably and the rest ending up as landfill. Many articles discuss these
    aspects, highlighting that the IS industry has much to do in this area. Organizations
    have their part to play to align with the goals and commitments from COP26, but
    successful outcomes rely on support from government and institutions to create
    the necessary environment and policy infrastructure, thereby enabling the technology
    industry to make the right long term decisions for the environment and society.
    6. Conclusions The UN climate change conference – COP26 held in Glasgow UK, is
    seen as one of the last chances for governments and key decision makers to make
    the firm commitments needed to ensure global temperatures do not exceed 1.5 °C
    above pre-industrial levels by 2050. The use of technology and IS is an integral
    component of many of the proposed mitigation measures, as governments and societies
    around the world take the necessary steps in transitioning to net zero. This multi-contribution
    editorial study offers a technology focussed and IS perspective on the climate
    crisis where many of the multi-faceted complexities facing governments, organizations
    and decision makers are discussed. In alignment with the approach set out in previous
    studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), each of the invited experts offers their
    own unique viewpoints to explore many of the key topics related to climate change,
    IS and digital technologies. The major technology and IS focussed themes that
    have emerged from the invited experts include: the impact of technology on behaviors
    and attitudes; Education, awareness and changed working practices; Impact on people
    and communities; Responsible digitalization; Role of data, technology and IS governance;
    Technology and IS research agenda. We present this opinion paper as a timely perspective
    on this critical topic where we have discussed the multifaceted role of digital
    technology and IS in combating climate change. The expert contributions highlight
    the urgent need for education initiatives that offer a more holistic and balanced
    perspective on the opportunities for technology based solutions but also communicate
    the realities of the negative impact from e-waste and the shifting of the problem
    to poorer emerging nations. The developed countries throughout the world have
    a responsibility to develop solutions for problems of their own making and a greater
    focus on responsible digitalization has to be the right direction to engender
    sustained change. We advocate a greater awareness from individual consumers as
    well as manufacturers, on the “lived in” realities of environmental tradeoffs
    and key value choices (Rowe, 2018), as we continue to utilize technology as an
    integral component of our daily lives. Decision makers need to be cognisant of
    these key choices, as greater use is made of technology in all its forms to deliver
    net zero by 2050. References Abbas et al., 2021a R. Abbas, S. Hamdoun, J. Abu-Ghazaleh,

    \ \nAbstract \nThe agri-food sector contributes significantly to economic and\
    \ social advancements globally despite \nnumerous challenges such as food safety\
    \ and security, demand and supply gaps, product quality, trace-\nability, etc.\
    \ Digital technologies offer effective and sustainable ways to these challenges\
    \ through re-\nduced human interference and improved data-accuracy. Innovations\
    \ led by digital transformations in \nthe agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) are\
    \ the main aim of 'Agri-Food 4.0'. This brings significant trans-\nformations\
    \ in the agri-food sector by reducing food wastage, real-time product monitoring,\
    \ reducing \nscalability issues, etc. This paper presents a systematic review\
    \ of the innovations in the agri-food for \ndigital technologies such as internet-of-things,\
    \ artificial intelligence, big data, RFID, robotics, block-\nchain technology,\
    \ etc. The employment of these technologies from the ‘farm to fork’ along AFSC\
    \ \nemphasizes a review of 159 articles solicited from different sources. This\
    \ paper also highlights digiti-\nzation in developing smart, sensible, and sustainable\

    \ is a complex sector that consists of a varied range \nof operations and roles\
    \ worldwide. It is an area of prominence, \nmaking it critical to successfully\
    \ apply advanced internet tech-\nnologies to ensure an efficient agri-food supply\
    \ chain. It is the \nleading provider of sustainable, sufficient, affordable,\
    \ and safe \nfood, feed, fiber, and fuel to the end-user. The pressure is be-\n\
    ing created on different stakeholders associated with agri-food \nsupply chains\
    \ due to free trade strategies and globalization, \nbesides the safe, hygienic,\
    \ and quality foods. Socioeconomic \nand ecological factors play a vital role\
    \ in achieving a thriving \nsupply chain (Bhat and Jõudu, 2019). Innovative solutions\
    \ are \nneeded as supply chains are mostly inefficient, with increasing \nconstraints\
    \ and demand. The stakeholders related to the Agri-\nfood sectors, such as manufacturers,\
    \ producers, retailers, gov-\nernment, and policymakers, are linked intrinsically\
    \ to solve \ncritical challenges. Technology plays a vital role in defining \n\
    and implementing key solutions and in the due process of de-\ncision-making (Panetto\
    \ et al., 2020; Mor et al., 2018b). After \nthe industrial revolution in the nineteenth\
    \ century, there has \nbeen a rapid growth in the Agri-food industry where there\
    \ \nwere system mechanization and steam engine usage, which \nlaid a base for\
    \ the food processing industry. This period is \nspecified as 'Agri-Food 1.0'.\
    \ In the 1950s, commonly called \n'Agri-Food 2.0', there has been increased use\
    \ of electrical ma-\nchines leading to improved production facilities. Robotics\
    \ and \nautomation were the main pillars of 'Agri-Food 3.0', which \nemerged in\
    \ the 20th century. These led to the usage of special-\nized machinery to sow\
    \ and harvest operations that complete \nwork cycles in separated tasks. This\
    \ era also led to remarkable \nprogress in crop techniques (Miranda et al., 2019).\
    \ 'Industry \n4.0' influences the agri-food industry through various tech-\nniques,\
    \ technologies, strategies, and methods. Cyber-physical \nsystems (CPS) are the\
    \ main benefits in this era with applica-\ntions in precision production systems\
    \ and open food produc-\ntion systems. Some CPS involved intelligent greenhouses,\
    \ \nsmart sensors, robots, vertical farms, drones, wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ (WSN), etc. There was a particular emphasis on en-\nvironmental, social, and\
    \ economic issues with advanced sys-\ntem digitalization, sustainable practices\
    \ adoption, and modern \nVASAVI DADI ET AL. / PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES\

    \ era \n(Miranda et al., 2019). New opportunities are provided with \ndigital\
    \ technologies in agri-food right from 'farm to fork' as it \noffers new solutions\
    \ to meet old and new challenges. These \nopportunities are considered essential,\
    \ particularly on climate \nchange challenges and in an integrated global food\
    \ system \n(OECD, 2019). \nTechnological advancement also drives horizontal integra-\n\
    tion and vertical integration in the agri-food chain, favoring \nmajor food suppliers\
    \ (Kirova et al., 2019). Specifically, digital \ntechnologies also enable novel\
    \ business model development \nby offering probabilities for new practices that\
    \ provide entre-\npreneurship (Gregori and Holzmann, 2020). Smart technolo-\n\
    gies are also viewed as adjuncts that can cause a short food \nsupply chain conventionalization,\
    \ thereby altering the opti-\nmally distinct (Lioutas and Charatsari, 2020). Today,\
    \ the \nglobal challenges of managing the efficacy of resources in \nagri-food\
    \ is a key concern. Some issues like energy-related \nconcerns are the same at\
    \ the global level, while others, like \nwater scarcity, vary based on their economic\
    \ condition (Ana-\nstasiadis et al., 2018). The impacts of digital transformations\
    \ \non commercial and ecological performance are mediated by \ndigital platforms\
    \ (Li et al., 2020). The digital transformations \ncan reduce waste, strengthen\
    \ logistical processes & infor-\nmation, and support flexible production and resource-sparing\
    \ \nby encouraging lean production (Hoellthaler et al., 2020). \nHowever, digitalization\
    \ is not new because it is a crucial com-\nponent of modern supply chains. Material\
    \ requirement plan-\nning, i.e., MRP-I and MRP-II, implementation can be consid-\n\
    ered as a starting point for supply chain operations digitization \n(Kittipanya-ngam\
    \ and Tan, 2020). ERP systems and continual \ndigital transformations in food\
    \ production technologies facili-\ntated the food supply chain streamlining towards\
    \ downstream, \nboosting efficiency (Gharehgozli et al., 2017). Also, the de-\n\
    velopments in farming-related processes, including machin-\nery, robots, and drones,\
    \ have replaced the existing traditional \nmeans of transportation and aid in\
    \ last-mile deliveries (Robin-\nson 2017). Agri-Food 4.0, a digitization approach\
    \ for sustain-\nable agriculture acceleration and support, land management, \n\
    and competitiveness, the agri-food sector presents an excellent \npotential for\
    \ improved efficiency, intelligence, performance, \nand sustainability accompanied\
    \ by internet-based networks \nand services (Hernández Jorge et al., 2018). Integrating\
    \ demo-\ngraphic changes, unequal resource distribution, poverty, cli-\nmate change,\
    \ and digital technology would also emerge as a \nchallenge in agri-food 4.0.\
    \ Between concerns and capabilities \nof digital transformation, exploitation,\
    \ and management of ag-\nricultural data act as the central node (Lezoche et al.,\
    \ 2020). \nTechnological interventions, real-time monitoring, and cost \ncontainment\
    \ are the advantages of agriculture digitalization \ntowards sustainability improvement\
    \ and territory management \n(Kamble et al., 2020; Panetto et al., 2020). There\
    \ would be \nmore cost-effective and less labor-intensive supply chains \nwith\
    \ high responsiveness to market demands using highly in-\ntegrated digital platforms.\
    \ Ivanov et al. (2019) studied the im-\npact of supply chain digitization, where\
    \ increased demand re-\nsponsiveness and capacity flexibility encouraged the adoption\
    \ \nof digital technologies. This paper addresses the emerging \ntechnologies\
    \ for transforming the traditional supply chain into \na digitized one via innovations\
    \ such as AI, IoT, robotics, \nblockchain, big data, RFID, etc. This paper presents\
    \ a system-\natic literature review aimed at answering the following re-\nsearch\
    \ questions:  \nRQ.1. What are the issues resolved by the implementation \nof\
    \ digitized agri-food chains?  \nRQ.2. What are the trends or innovations in different\
    \ digital \ntechnologies to address new challenges in the agri-food supply \n\
    chain? \nRQ.3. What should future research emphasize on the suc-\ncessful execution\
    \ of a digitized agri-food supply chain?  \nFurther, this paper highlights the\
    \ findings and research gov-\nerning digital transformations in agri-food. There\
    \ is a focus on \nan urgent need to optimize the existing processing methods \n\
    and management techniques in the agri-food sector for sus-\ntainable development.\

    words and abstract, and the full text was studied.  \n2.3. Analysis of Extracted\
    \ Articles \nThe articles selected were sub-categorized based on the \ntechnology\
    \ emphasized like: Big data, IoT, Robotics, AI, \nBlockchain technology (BCT),\
    \ and RFID, as these are the \nleading technologies highlighted in this paper.\
    \ Based on the \nexisting literature reviews, it was observed that the articles\
    \ \ncovering all technologies are in minimal number, and the sus-\ntainability\
    \ concept was also not emphasized on all papers, \nwhich becomes the base of this\
    \ paper. \n \nFig. 2. Classification for digital technologies \nThe classification\
    \ of articles for different digital technolo-\ngies depicts that maximum studies\
    \ were on blockchain tech-\nnology, which accounted for ~24%, and only 6% of total\
    \ pa-\npers were on robotics (Fig. 2). More research on robotic \ntechnology and\
    \ its usage in agri-food is needed to uncover the \nchallenges and opportunities.\
    \ All other technologies had \nenough approach, and their uses are exploited in\
    \ all sectors, \nincluding agri-food. \nIt is evident that most of the articles\
    \ in the review were pub-\nlished in 2020 and 2019, and the least, i.e., 5% in\
    \ 2016, show-\ning increased research studies on digitalization from 2016 to \n\

    \ Hence, the ex-\nternal validity is assured. Further, this review has been con-\n\
    firmed with the academicians and agri-food industry profes-\nsionals for content\
    \ validity. The reliability is assessed through \nthe percent agreement procedure\
    \ (Mor et al., 2018a), 82%, and \nthus deemed reliable. \n3. Analysis \n3.1. Big\
    \ Data Analytics  \nData-driven supply chain decisions have become trouble-\n\
    free, using tools and techniques developed by big data analyt-\nics (BDA). Better\
    \ and faster decisions can assist enterprises by \nanalyzing and comprehending\
    \ real-time results that deal with \nlarge datasets that portray integrity, volume,\
    \ variety, and ve-\nlocity. Organizations can also improve the supply chain by\
    \ \ncost reduction and risk mitigation (Govindan et al., 2018). \nA combination\
    \ of data technologies and agri-food projects too \ncrucial for creating new knowledge\
    \ by extension of farmers' \ndata, advanced services, processes, and software.\
    \ It also plays \na role in the adaptation of factories-of-future (FoF)  and infor-\n\
    mation & communication technologies (ICT) and related to \nagricultural patterns\
    \ and big data models (Lezoche et al., \n2020). Yu et al. (2018) explored financial\
    \ performance af-\nfected by a Chinese firm's data-driven supply chain. This \n\
    study proposed a data analysis method based on structural \nequation modelling.\
    \ This study depicted a positive association \nwith increased financial performance\
    \ when there was har-\nmony among supply chain partners. A change in supply chain\
    \ \nresponsiveness was also seen in fast response to market de-\nmand shifts in\
    \ an organization. Singh et al. (2018) proposed \na methodology using BDA by identifying\
    \ constraints in pre-\nvailing food supply chains and logistics from social media\
    \ \ndata (Twitter). The text analytics approach analyzed the cap-\ntured Twitter\
    \ data, which uses hierarchical clustering and \na support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ with multiscale bootstrap \nsampling. The cluster of words about improvement\
    \ in various \nsegments of the supply chain was the outcome of this analysis.\
    \  \n \nBelaud et al. (2019) proposed a five-step approach in \nwhich big data\
    \ is integrated to improve sustainability in the \nsupply chain and increase agricultural\
    \ waste value. Oncioiu et \nal. (2019) concentrated on supply chain management\
    \ and \nBDA usage in supply chains of Romanian companies to eval-\nuate the experience,\
    \ professional capabilities, and strategies in \nsuccessfully implementing BDA\
    \ as determining the tools re-\nquired to achieve the goal. Results showed that\
    \ 90% of re-\nspondents endorsed an enterprise-wide approach, encouraging \nbig\
    \ data to add business value. Roßmann et al. (2017) studied \nBDA applications\
    \ by a multi-method approach, which is part \nof the organizational information\
    \ processing theory (OIPT). \nBy conducting a Delphi survey, projections up to\
    \ the year \n2035 were integrated, and fuzzy c- clustering was employed \nto identify\
    \ future scenarios that depict the future of BDA in \nSCM. It was suggested that\
    \ BDA would help improve demand \nforecasts, safety stock reduction, and supplier\
    \ performance \nmanagement. Jha et al. (2020) studied the criteria for capabil-\n\
    ity-building and profit maximization through BDA technolo-\ngies. \n3.2. Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) \nIoT layer produces an anomalous amount of data, using sen-\n\
    sor technology, nanotechnology, higher connectivity through \nsatellite or 5G,\
    \ and devices such as robots or drones, which \ncan remotely generate live data\
    \ (Valentini et al., 2019). A con-\nnected world is visualized by IoT where things\
    \ can communi-\ncate measured data and interact, making the digital represen-\n\
    tation of the real-world for the development (Reyna et al., \n2018). Recently,\
    \ smart farming systems that enhance food \nproduction and are based on embedded\
    \ systems and IoT are \ngetting attention and popularity among people (Mahbub,\
    \ \n2020). Integration of IoT with agriculture offers data related \nto agri-features\
    \ like water, humans, soil, animals, etc. (Lezo-\nche et al., 2020). The Agri-food\
    \ sector is deficient in ICT up-\ntake. The high cost is incurred in data capture\
    \ and analytics, \ndelivering different decision support tools (Brewster et al.,\
    \ \n2017). IoT employs several technologies like wireless sensor \nnetworks (WSN),\
    \ radio frequency identification (RFID), sen-\nsors, and global positioning systems\
    \ (GPS) that are useful for \nenvironmental monitoring, greenhouse management,\
    \ tracea-\nbility, cold chain monitoring, etc. (Ping et al., 2018). Precision\
    \ \nAgriculture (PA) is one such promising example of the IoT \napplication in\
    \ agriculture. The use of guidance systems can \nachieve cost savings in terms\
    \ of seed, fertilizer, and tractor \n5%\n14%\n25%\n28%\n28%\n2016\n2017\n2018\n\

    \ hours during planting \nand fertilizer application (Trendov et al., 2019; Kamble\
    \ et al., \n2019). By IoT usage, self-adaptive food supply chains can be \nformed,\
    \ in which objects decide, operate, and learn continu-\nously and autonomously\
    \ (Verdouw et al., 2016).  \nBrewster et al. (2017) emphasized setting up Large\
    \ scale pi-\nlot plants (LSPs) based on IoT by identifying technological \nand\
    \ Agri-food requirements and describing sectoral and tech-\nnical challenges.\
    \ Design and description of four agri-food do-\nmains LSP (dairy, meat, arable,\
    \ fruit, and vegetable supply \nchain) based on IoT are provided. This provided\
    \ a detailed ac-\ncount of the most appropriate IoT technologies in the agri-\n\
    food sector and their applications and the key performance in-\ndicators to assess\
    \ the proposed LSP's performance in a quan-\ntifiable manner. Kittipanya-ngam\
    \ & Tan (2020) studied IoT \nusage to export Thai Jasmine rice and organic rice\
    \ to global \nmarkets and reach consumers, both B2B and B2C, a major \ndownstream\
    \ challenge. There were safety and quality issues in \nthe upstream case, where\
    \ real-time data availability and trans-\nparency through IoT resolved it. Verdouw\
    \ et al. (2016) pro-\nposed architecture for enabling information systems imple-\n\
    mentation by analyzing virtual supply chains from \na perspective of IoT and usage\
    \ of architecture in the fish sup-\nply chain for 'Proof of concept'. Based on\
    \ online operational \ndata, a basis for optimization, simulation, and decision\
    \ support \nof the virtual supply chain is expected to be established. Ac-\ncorsi\
    \ et al. (2017) discussed goals and strategies for IoT design \nand formation,\
    \ which aid in Food Supply Chain planning, \nmanagement, and control. An IoT paradigm\
    \ embedded simu-\nlation gaming tool was also proposed and elucidated, reflect-\n\
    ing the pros and cons of the 'physical food ecosystems' direct \nintegration into\
    \ a computerized environment virtually. Cui \n(2018) proposed cold chain traceability\
    \ system architecture by \nconducting systematic research in supply chain characteristics\
    \ \nfor IoT and its role in innovation. Competences needed to im-\nprove supply\
    \ chain resilience are reinforced with the decision-\nmaking model. In this system,\
    \ the knowledge database in the \nIoT environment is the key to the firm's contingency\
    \ manage-\nment to make necessary improvements. Related staff and links \nof the\
    \ supply chain also need to be activated to enhance the \nsupply chain resilience\
    \ capabilities.  \nAmandeep et al. (2017) developed a novel design approach \n\
    for smart farming using IoT and automation to increase \nproductivity. A remote-controlled\
    \ GPS-based vehicle helps \nmonitor fields to prevent thefts, sensing soil moisture\
    \ content, \nsensing soil moisture, spraying composts & insecticides, \nweeding,\
    \ etc. Smart warehouse management is also enforced \nwith the sensing of the stored\
    \ products' temperature and hu-\nmidity and the detection of missing products\
    \ in the warehouse. \nA smart device with interfacing sensors and internet connec-\n\
    tivity will monitor operations and control, and Zigbee modules \nwith a micro-controller\
    \ will execute operations. Zhang et al. \n(2017) addressed the challenges in the\
    \ perishable supply chain \nbased on IoT captured real-time data using a conceptual\
    \ model \nusing two-echelon supply hubs. These hubs, which act as sup-\nply chain\
    \ dominators, react to the real-time data acquired from \nan IoT-enabled supply\
    \ chain operational process providing in-\nformation on public warehousing and\
    \ logistic services. Lu et \nal. (2019) studied the multi-tag spot collision evasion\
    \ in IoT \ntechnology for the \"connected objects\" feature to offer data \nfrom\
    \ processing to sales, tracking each link in a process flow, \nfinding the food\
    \ source and product flow effectively. Alonso \net al. (2019) presented a platform\
    \ for IoT application, Artifi-\ncial Intelligence, Edge Computing (EC), and BCT\
    \ in smart \nfarming environments, using the new global edge computing \narchitecture.\
    \ It was also developed for real-time monitoring of \nthe cattle and feed grain\
    \ and to ensure the sustainability and \ntraceability of various production processes\
    \ (Mor et al., 2019).  \nKamble et al. (2019) worked on the food retailing scenario,\
    \ \nincreasing complexity in pressurizing the retailing firms to in-\ncorporate\
    \ the changing consumer behavior and re-design their \nmarketing strategies. IoT\
    \ is predicted to control the food prod-\nuct quality, plan waste management of\
    \ shelf life exceeded \nitems, manage the store, freezer, and other equipment\
    \ temper-\natures contributing to reduced energy consumption. Despite \nIoT's\
    \ potential in food retails, its adoption is still in its emer-\ngent stage. Therefore,\
    \ various barriers were identified that af-\nfect IoT adoption at the retail level\
    \ in the Indian context. \nElavarasi et al. (2019) reduced the fresh fruits spoilage\
    \ and \nwastage using IoT, which continuously monitors the produce. \nTracking\
    \ fruit quality throughout the process was done by us-\ning contact and non-contact\
    \ sensors and smart logistics usage. \nMQ3 sensors were used to detect fruit spoilage\
    \ and send mes-\nsages to operators' mobile, and he removes the spoiled pro-\n\
    duce by using a pick and place robot. Pal and Kant (2018) \naimed to improve the\
    \ distribution efficiency, transportation, \nand removal of sour products from\
    \ the supply chain using cen-\ntralized data collection and analysis techniques\
    \ in IoT-based \nmechanisms. This reduced food wastage by analyzing produce \n\
    characteristics like flavor emissions, color, etc.  \nNirenjena et al. (2018)\
    \ utilized advanced IoT to observe nu-\ntritive qualities and nourishment levels\
    \ in food substances to \nindicate contamination and degradation in foods throughout\
    \ \nthe supply chain. A WASPTOME sensor gathers food degra-\ndation information,\
    \ and an alert is sent to manufacturers and \nconsumers by the raspberry pi unit.\
    \ GPS and temperature sen-\nsors are also used in combination with WASPTOME and\
    \ rasp-\nberry pi unit. Wadhwa et al. (2018) proposed architecture to \nimplement\
    \ enabling information systems from an IoT perspec-\ntive in virtual supply chains.\
    \ Matsumoto et al. (2017) devel-\noped a simulation-based on the information of\
    \ IoT on culti-\nvated fields to perform an advanced evaluation of business by\
    \ \nconsidering insufficient stock and crop loss has given an un-\nreliable amount\
    \ of harvest. Prosanjeet et al. (2016) worked on \nincreasing agricultural production\
    \ by optimally using re-\nsources and continuous monitoring using remote monitoring\
    \ \nsystems based on IoT protocol. For re-programmability and \nreduction of expenses,\
    \ the use of a microcontroller and \nESP8266 was proposed. Khattab et al. (2016)\
    \ presented an \nIoT-based three-layer architecture for precision agriculture,\
    \ \nwhich collects data needed and relays it to a cloud-based \nbackend for processing\
    \ and analysis. Front end nodes receive \nfeedback actions based on the analyzed\
    \ data. \n \nVASAVI DADI ET AL. / PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES 2021, 27(2),\

    \ (AI) \nAI is a technique that aids in tasks and processes' automation \nby recreating\
    \ human-like cognitive abilities (Barnewold and \nLottermoser, 2020). For agri-food\
    \ applications, AI techniques \ncan provide essential contributions to identifying\
    \ service cre-\nation, knowledge models, and decision-making processes. In \n\
    agriculture, AI has three broad categories: agricultural robot-\nics, crop and\
    \ soil monitoring & predictive analytics (Guru-\nmurthy and Bharthur, 2019; Lezoche\
    \ et al., 2020). Moreover, \nAI-augmented farms can robotically alter crop amounts\
    \ for \nsupply & demand data, making earth cycles more resilient \n(Valentini\
    \ et al., 2019). In the case of fresh produce, AI helps \nestimate shelf life,\
    \ reducing guesswork, reducing wastage of \nfood as there are improved planning\
    \ and inventory manage-\nment (Payne, 2019). AI has applications in the food industry,\
    \ \nlike food item segmentation, ensuring stability in FSC, im-\nproving food\
    \ delivery (Abhijit, 2019). Machine learning \n(ML), deep learning, and neural\
    \ networks help solve complex \nproblems, and the human level concerning reasoning,\
    \ speech, \nand vision is the benchmark for AI (Singh et al., 2020). ML is \n\
    an AI-based application around the concept that machines \nshould be given data\
    \ access and allowed to learn by them-\nselves using structured historical information\
    \ (Barnewold and \nLottermoser, 2020; Donatelli and Pisante, 2019; Sharma et al.,\
    \ \n2019). Machine learning models can be used for business de-\ncision-making\
    \ by predicting the backorder of products with \nmore flexibility, process clarity,\
    \ higher accuracy (Islam and \nAmin 2020), and demand forecasting due to their\
    \ learning \nability and finding data patterns (Tavana, 2016). Automated \nreasoning,\
    \ multi-agent systems, semantic web, autonomous \nsystems, natural language understanding,\
    \ and decision-mak-\ning are other AI applications. \nTable 2. Studies on AI \n\

    \ \n3.4. Robotics \nRobotics and autonomous systems (RAS) are presented in \n\
    the economy depicting low productivity like agri-food (Duck-\nett et al., 2018).\
    \ The technology aims to reduce and replace \nintense human efforts and produce\
    \ significant mini and macro-\nscale productions. Productivity has seen massive\
    \ amplifica-\ntion with the usage of robotic technologies. According to Mar-\n\
    kets and Markets, the agricultural robots' market is estimated \nto grow from\
    \ USD 4.6 billion in 2020 to USD 20.3 billion by \n2025. The compound annual growth\
    \ rate (CAGR) rises at \n34.5% from 2020 to 2025 (Markets and Markets, 2017).\
    \ The \nrobots perform various agriculture operations autonomously, \nensuring\
    \ that the adverse climatic and soil conditions have less \nor no effect on production\
    \ and better precision (Talaviya et al., \n2020). Drones are used in agriculture\
    \ to monitor crop health, \nequipment, weed recognition, and disaster control.\
    \ Also, pes-\nticides and herbicides can be sprayed effectively with drones' \n\
    aid, and plants can be monitored (Talaviya et al., 2020). These \nalso benefit\
    \ the supply chain by creating soil maps that aid in \ndamage control (Kirova\
    \ et al., 2019). Trendov et al. (2019) \nreported the usage of small robots for\
    \ replacing high mass \ntractors. Todorova and Tcacenco (2019) stated unmanned\
    \ aer-\nial vehicles (UAV) as the agricultural sector's most progres-\nsive and\
    \ prospective trend and elaborated on drone usage's \npros and cons. Robinson\
    \ (2017) reported using autonomous \ndelivery robots, which move at a speed of\
    \ four miles per hour \nand have nine cameras and ultrasonic sensors embedded\
    \ inside \nthem, enabling faster delivery and reducing human interfer-\nence.\
    \ Rigorous research is needed in the agri-food as there is \nmuch variability,\
    \ need for sensitive handling. \n3.5. Blockchain Technology \nIt is a technological\
    \ concept evolved from Bitcoin (Dujak \nand Sajter, 2019). It also finds food\
    \ security applications, \nsafety, integrity, and waste reduction in the present\
    \ complex \nfood supply chains, including numerous actors like farmers, \nshipping\
    \ companies, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. \nTraditional supply chains\
    \ are highly inefficient and unreliable, \nwhere there is a high risk, trust issues,\
    \ and complexity between \nbuyers and sellers during the value exchange involving\
    \ mas-\nsive paper settlement. There is an increment in overall transfer \ncost,\
    \ and transactions are fraud vulnerable involving interme-\ndiaries, making the\
    \ cost of operating the supply chain increase, \namounting to 2/3rd of the final\
    \ cost of goods (Kamilaris et al., \n2019). Food provenance can be traced with\
    \ blockchain tech-\nnology (BCT), which helps create food supply chains with \n\
    trust (Xiong et al., 2020; Dujak and Sajter, 2019). Blockchain \nfacilitates the\
    \ digital traceability and authentication of food \nproducts throughout the entire\
    \ supply chain, from suppliers to \nstore shelves and finally to end consumers\
    \ (Tijan et al., 2019). \nBlockchain is proving its prominence for hitching transpar-\n\
    ency and solving the problems in scenarios where some re-\nsource distribution\
    \ involves numerous untrusted actors. It also \naids in automatically matching\
    \ real-time data, avoiding man-\nual checks and duplication, reducing documentation\
    \ work to \na fifth of the time. The origin of goods and the environmental \n\
    footprint of production can also be harnessed. Traceability \ntags in BCT can\
    \ efficiently attain tag source verification, in-\nformation, and ownership (Liu\
    \ and Li, 2020). \nKamilaris et al. (2019) represented an example of a digitized\
    \ \nsupply chain using QR codes, RFID, digital signatures, sen-\nsors, etc., supported\
    \ by blockchain. Every action along the \nsupply chain is recorded in blockchain\
    \ blocks where the inter-\nnet/web serves as a connecting bridge. Businesses validate\
    \ the \ninformation in blocks as it passes through the chains forming \nimmutable\
    \ means to store information, becoming a permanent \nrecord (Kamilaris et al.,\
    \ 2019).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVASAVI DADI ET AL. / PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES\

    \ \nresolving food safety and security issues, giving an account of \nfood freshness\
    \ and the origin of food (Athauda and Karmakar, \n2019). Bottani et al. (2017)\
    \ dealt with the RFID logistics pilot \nIII (RLP3) project that focused on RFID\
    \ deployment and IT \ninfrastructure development for real-time data management\
    \ in \nfresh produce supply. Benefits of the supply chain were as-\nsessed with\
    \ a focus on retail store inventory management and \nbackroom and store area shelf\

    \ cuts. The study \nprovided some insights into the backroom feasibility and \n\
    shopfloor management systems in fresh food retailing. RFID \nhas potential applications\
    \ in shrinkage reduction and optimi-\nzation of shelf inventory levels of products.\
    \ Mondal et al. \n(2019) developed an architecture utilizing sensor-based-RFID\
    \ \nat the physical film and BCT at the cyber film. RFID delivers \nunique identification,\
    \ sensor aids in monitoring real-time \nquality, and BCT creates digital databases\
    \ tamper-proof. De-\ntailed security analysis for cyber-attacks investigated the\

    \ the effect of the available \nshrinkage recovery rate and ordering rate on the\
    \ warehouse \ncosts and investigating the RFID adoption. It is mainly de-\npendent\
    \ on the cost of deprivation, error severity, and shrink-\nage recovery rate.\
    \ Arnaud and Costa (2020) developed Ultra-\nlow-cost RFID-based sensors that sense\
    \ nodes and loggers to \ncollect data on food production and logistics using IoT.\
    \ An \napplication-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was used to en-\nhance semi-active\
    \ low-frequency sensor transponder reading \nup to a distance of a few meters.\
    \ It was fabricated in 0.6μm \nhigh voltage- complementary metal oxide semiconductor\
    \ \n(HV-CMOS), which reported a portable reader presence up to \n5m. Karuppuswami\
    \ et al. (2019) presented a 'near-field wire-\nless thin-film coated RFID compatible\
    \ sensor tag' for evaluat-\ning the volatility of packed food at room temperature,\
    \ and the \nsensor tags having polyaniline, coated as thin-film on the in-\nterdigitated\
    \ capacitor. In the direct-wired structure, conductiv-\nity is measured across\
    \ the film by introducing ammonia gas at \ndifferent concentrations in an enclosed\
    \ chamber. An inductor-\ncapacitor resonant tank is formed by soldering an inductor\
    \ \nacross the interdigitated capacitor in the wireless configura-\ntion. The\
    \ proposed sensor is a highly sensitive sensor detect-\ning ammonia as low as\
    \ 3 PPM, and it can be easily adapted \nacross the supply chain to monitor packaged\
    \ food quality. \nParada et al. (2019) designed the RFID food management \n(RFM)\
    \ system in the IoT network paradigm to bring in healthy \neating habits and help\
    \ in the fight against food wastage. RFM \nis composed of a multi-platform application\
    \ to process real-\ntime RFID information.  \nA web-based application is also\
    \ developed to allow users \nabout food expiry and other details. Recipes that\
    \ can be pre-\npared with foods available are also shown along with nutri-\ntional\
    \ information, preventing wastage. This embedded sys-\ntem may economically benefit\
    \ the manufacturer as it permits \nsuperstores to pay for advertising the items.\

    \ Findings show that reading ranges critical food \nproduct identification by\
    \ UHF RFID (Ultra-high frequency \nRFID) systems can be assessed and improvised\
    \ for the food \ncomposition directly from the design phase. Fan et al. (2019)\
    \ \nimproved the traceability in the bidirectional transformation \nof barcode-RFID,\
    \ an effective traceable resource unit (TRUs). \nYiying et al. (2019) developed\
    \ a food traceability system for \na complete life cycle, using RFID, which ensures\
    \ full supervi-\nsion from source to consumer. The RFID fault tolerance mech-\n\
    anism confirmed system practicability. This design ensured \nfood safety, especially\
    \ in perishable foods like meat. A sensor \nwas developed to evaluate the food\
    \ expiry date, which con-\ntains an RFID tag and a conductive polymer. It operates\
    \ on the \nprinciple that the conductivity of polymer changes on expo-\nsure to\
    \ spoiled foods and is detected as an RFID signal by the \nreader (Honari et al.,\
    \ (2018). Saggin et al. (2019) introduced a \nflexible UHF-RFID sensor to detect\
    \ the food quality with an \ninterdigitated capacity in a vegetal biopolymer layer\
    \ deposited \nRFID antenna. Experimental measurements validated this \nstudy by\
    \ exposing it to the environment of real food gas in \ndegradation. Yuan et al.\
    \ (2018) focused on designing and sim-\nulating wearable RFID patches to sense\
    \ food spoilage and read \ntemperature information using near field communication\
    \ tech-\nnology supporting devices.  \nKaruppuswami et al. (2018) developed an\
    \ antibody-free bi-\nosensor to rapidly detect pathogenic bacteria in milk using\
    \ \ndextrin capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNP). These sensors \ncan perceive microbes\
    \ count as low as 5 log CFU/ml in an \nhour and is compatible with RFID tag making\
    \ them useful in \nthe food chain. Chetanraj et al. (2017) described the block\
    \ di-\nagram and the RFID communication protocol and advantages \nover WSN. This\
    \ technology helps detect spoiled food during \nlong-distance transportation leading\
    \ to losses and rejections \nby the consumer. Dabbene et al. (2016) studied the\
    \ challenges \nand opportunities of adopting RFID for food traceability in \n\
    food supply chains and its applications in warehouses, retail \nmanagement, intelligent\
    \ packaging, cold chain monitoring, lo-\ngistics, etc. Alfian et al. (2020) proposed\
    \ machine learning \nmodels to detect passive RFID tags' direction to improve\
    \ the \ntraceability system's efficiency, which is more needed in per-\nishable\
    \ products. Received signal strength (RSS) and tags \ntimestamp depict input features.\
    \ Xiao et al. (2017) explored \nRFID applications in food warehouse management\
    \ and stor-\nage. RFID process simulation model reported increased store \nmanagement\
    \ efficiency with RFID application when com-\npared with previous technology.\

    \ Polyaniline coated capac-\nitive sensor works as a sensing element with a higher\
    \ affinity \nfor ammonia.  \nAmong the two methods, direct probing was found as\
    \ more \nstable as it can detect a minimum of ammonia of 3 ppm with \n30 min response\
    \ time and 60 min recovery time. Zhang et al. \n(2020) focused on the whole dairy\
    \ tracking system, as there \nare increased safety and quality concerns in the\
    \ dairy industry \nlike leather milk and melamine incidents. RFID is the most\
    \ \neffective and viable method, and its application needs to be \nput forth across\
    \ supply chains shortly. Alfian et al. (2017) rec-\nommended an e-pedigree food\
    \ traceability method to use \nRFID technology, WSN, for temperature and humidity\
    \ data \ncollection. This approach was tested on Korea's Kimchi sup-\nply chain,\
    \ and increased customer satisfaction and optimized \nfood distribution were observed.\
    \ Miao et al. (2018) proposed \na rice traceability system for agricultural products\
    \ and real-\ntime using RFID and WSN. Collected rice growth environ-\nment data\
    \ was transmitted through the CC2530 wireless mod-\nule. RFID was used to trace\
    \ rice harvest information, transpor-\ntation, storage, and engineering aspects\
    \ of supporting \na traceability database for agri-food products. The usage of\
    \ \ntechnologies, in combination with each other, might amelio-\nrate them with\
    \ increased advantages.  \nSobral et al. (2018) enhanced the IoT application perfor-\n\
    mance by integrating RFID with WSNs through Fuzzy Q-Al-\ngorithm to improve an\
    \ anti-collision protocol for RFID and \nthe Fuzzy System-Based Route Classifier.\
    \ RFID tag's identi-\nfication performance improvement, lowered packet loss rates,\
    \ \ndecreased energy consumption by nodes, and improved net-\nwork load balancing\
    \ was significantly observed, thus provid-\ning better energy efficacy and service\
    \ quality for IoT applica-\ntions. Desai et al. (2019) developed an architecture\
    \ where \nblockchain technology as value-added services was integrated \ninto\
    \ an IoT-based product tracing & tracking solution by test-\ning and implementing\
    \ it on the NIMBLE-B2B platform. With \nthis approach, small & medium enterprises\
    \ control the data \nand can be benefitted from flexible scalability and cost.\
    \ Alfian \net al. (2019) proposed using machine learning algorithms to \nfilter\
    \ false positives generated by RFID. These models also \nhelped in successfully\
    \ classifying RFID outcomes with high \nprecision and assimilating for detecting\
    \ the outlier. \n4. Sustainable Agri-Food Industry and Digital \nTechnologies\
    \ \nAgricultural sustainability can be supported by the digital \nmarketplace,\
    \ which can act as a platform for financial technol-\nogy (FinTech), which aid\
    \ in innovating crowdfunding and \npayment systems in a broader agriculture ecosystem\
    \ that pro-\nmotes empowerment, transparency, and resourcefulness (An-\nshari\
    \ et al., 2019). Precision agriculture, which uses digital \ntechnologies, has\
    \ environmental benefits of addressing cli-\nmate change, improving resource efficiency,\
    \ and toxin reduc-\ntion (Claap et al., 2020).  Blockchain forms sustainable supply\
    \ \nchain networks that are economical as these reduce transaction \ncosts, business\
    \ waste, and time utilized by decreasing the \nnumber of tiers in the chain and\
    \ reducing human errors (Ward \n2017). Environmental supply chain sustainability\
    \ is ensured \nby reducing resource consumption and greenhouse emissions \nby\
    \ reducing rework and recall practices by identifying sub-\nstandard products\
    \ (Saberi et al., 2019). It makes information \nstable and immutable, ensures\
    \ food safety, and provides ade-\nquate information infrastructure to manage all\
    \ humanitarian \neventualities at the field level, which aids in building a socially\
    \ \nsustainable supply chain (Rejeb et al., 2020). Concerning the \nthree sustainability\
    \ dimensions, blockchain and mobile tech-\nnology seem to have the highest economic\
    \ impact. The sensors \nand actuators, followed by AI, big data analytics, and\
    \ cloud \ntechnology, have the highest impact on the environmental sus-\ntainability\
    \ dimension. In contrast, cloud technology and big \ndata analytics seem to impact\
    \ the social sustainability dimen-\nsion (Bai et al., 2020). \n \n \n5. Conclusions\
    \ \nFood safety, security, traceability concerns in the agri-food \nneed to be\
    \ predicted and prevented rather than reacting and \nresponding as people are\
    \ more concerned about health nowa-\ndays. Digitization remains a perfect way\
    \ out for all these is-\nsues with reducing human interference and provides food\
    \ \nmonitoring along the supply chain, which is highly impossible \nfor humans.\
    \ Thus, there is a need for science-based decision-\nmaking and advanced technology\
    \ usage, which helps supply \nchains, especially food, safer and more secure,\
    \ with better \ntraceability and accountability. Digital technologies help to\
    \ \ndevelop efficient agri-food supply chains in varied ways, i.e., \nRFID can\
    \ sense the food environment; big data can help ana-\nlyze vast info in a fraction\
    \ of seconds; IoT is a combination of \ndifferent technologies; robots can automate\
    \ work. Robots can \nreduce human interference; AI can think independently and\
    \ \nact accordingly. The usage and generalization of such high-\nend technologies\
    \ are needed in the agri-food sector. Thus, \nthere seems to be a vast scope of\
    \ research in the area, such as: \na) The cost associated with data acquisition\
    \ remains signif-\nicantly high in data-driven agriculture, acting as a barrier\
    \ \nfor IoT and AI usage in agriculture. This indicates there \nis a need for\
    \ innovation in inexpensive sensing technol-\nogies. \nb) Cybersecurity is the\
    \ main concerning IoT issue, and data \nsecurity breaches in big data could be\
    \ incurable to busi-\nnesses. \nc) BCT application to the full extent of food\
    \ supply chain \nmanagement needs to be done to remove significant bar-\nriers.\
    \ \nd) A combination of one or more technologies would be \nmore promising, providing\
    \ a featured supply chain that \ncomplies with all food needs. \ne) Integrating\
    \ technologies like blockchain with IoT can \ncomplement the usage by providing\
    \ a reliable and trace-\nable service. \nf) There are also difficulties associated\
    \ with bringing all \nstakeholders on board and a lack of regulations in imple-\n\
    mentation. \nVASAVI DADI ET AL. / PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES 2021, 27(2),\

    \ as the most basic \nsource of material security for human life, has received\
    \ \ngreat attention from various countries. In recent years, \nthe pace of agricultural\
    \ modernization and technological \ndevelopment has accelerated, and people have\
    \ gradually \ncombined agriculture with various types of high-tech and \nintelligent\
    \ algorithms, and the concepts such as “smart \nagriculture”, “precision agriculture”,\
    \ “digital agriculture”, \n“decision agriculture”, and “agriculture 4.0” have\
    \ emerged. \nThese developments are inseparable from the help and \npromotion\
    \ of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Looking \nat the current agricultural\
    \ production process, artificial \nintelligence is everywhere. However, most AI\
    \ applications \nare based on large amounts of data, and the data and time \n\
    cost problems they bring have gradually become new \nchallenges for farmers. In\
    \ response to these challenges, \ndigital twins have come to the forefront of\
    \ agricultural \nresearchers’ minds. Digital twin technology aims to build \n\
    mirror models of information in the hyper-real world, using \ncomputerized virtual\
    \ reality. For example, a model of a plant \ncan be constructed in which its physical\
    \ characteristics \nare transformed into digital information, and this digital\
    \ \ninformation can be used to make it grow naturally in the \nvirtual space beyond\
    \ reality. This makes it easier to develop \nand test new agricultural technologies\
    \ in virtual reality. This \nmeans that issues such as data and time costs are\
    \ no longer \na barrier to progress. Therefore, digital twins have become \nan\
    \ important research direction in the field of agriculture in \nthe future. This\
    \ paper introduces the typical application of \nartificial intelligence in agriculture\
    \ and the development of \ndigital twin technology in agriculture. \nThis paper\
    \ will outline and answer the following \nresearch question:\n· What is the current\
    \ state of development of artificial \nintelligence technologies in agriculture?\
    \ In the whole \nprocess of agricultural production, what are the main \ntechnologies\
    \ and applications of artificial intelligence \ntechnology for different agricultural\
    \ tasks in the \npreproduction, \nmidproduction, \nand \npostproduction \nstages?\n\
    · What is the “digital twins”? What are the basic \ncharacteristics and attributes\
    \ of the architecture based \non digital twins? What are the main technologies\
    \ and \napplication directions of the digital twins?\n· How to integrate digital\
    \ twin technology with \nagriculture? What is the impact of the introduction of\
    \ \nthe digital twins on the agricultural sector? What are the \nscenarios in\
    \ which digital twin technology can be applied \nin the agricultural sector and\
    \ truly benefit from it?\nAbstract: Affected by global economic pressure and epidemics,\
    \ sustainable agriculture has received widespread attention from farmers \nand\
    \ agricultural engineers. Throughout history, agricultural technology has closely\
    \ followed the pace of scientific and technological \ndevelopment and has followed\
    \ the footsteps of mechanization, automation, and intelligence to progress continuously.\
    \ At this stage, \nartificial intelligence (AI) is dominating the field of agriculture\
    \ and advancing the progress of sustainable agriculture. However, the \nlarge\
    \ amount of data required by AI technology and the high cost of data have ensued,\
    \ while the rapid development of virtualization \ntechnology has made people gradually\
    \ begin to consider the application of digital twins (DT) in agriculture. This\
    \ paper examines \nthe application of artificial intelligence technology and digital\
    \ twin technology in smart agriculture in recent years and discusses and \nanalyzes\
    \ the challenges they face and the future directions of development. We find that\
    \ digital twins have great potential for success in \nsustainable agriculture,\
    \ which is of great significance to advancing smart agricultural solutions that\
    \ achieve low cost and high precision \nto meet the growing demand for high-yield\
    \ production from farmers around the world. \nKey words: Smart agriculture, artificial\

    \ opportunities and challenges in the \napplication of artificial intelligence\
    \ technology and digital \ntwin technology in agriculture at this stage? What\
    \ are the \npossible future evolution and development trends?\nThe remainder of\
    \ the paper is organized as follows. \nIn Section 2, starting from the three links\
    \ of the \npreproduction, midproduction, and postproduction stages \nof the agricultural\
    \ production process, the research and \napplication status of artificial intelligence\
    \ in the agricultural \nfield are introduced. An overview of the digital twins\
    \ is \ngiven in Section 3, followed by a description and analysis \nof its current\
    \ state of the art in agriculture. The challenges \nand possible future directions\
    \ of AI and DT in agriculture \nare discussed in Section 4. Finally, a brief conclusion\
    \ is \ngiven in Section 5.\n2. Artificial intelligence in agriculture\nAt present,\
    \ artificial intelligence agriculture dominates \nthe development direction of\
    \ modern agriculture, \nand researchers are committed to applying artificial \n\
    intelligence technology to the whole process of agricultural \nproduction. The\
    \ agricultural production process can be \ndivided into three stages: preproduction,\
    \ midproduction, \nand postproduction. Figure 1 shows the agricultural \nproduction\
    \ process after division. The application of \nartificial intelligence technology\
    \ in the preproduction, \nmidproduction, and postproduction stages of agricultural\
    \ \nproduction is briefly introduced to provide a reference for \nthe rapid and\
    \ effective transformation and improvement \nof intelligent agricultural technology\
    \ and the promotion of \nagricultural industrialization and modernization.\n2.1.\
    \ Preproduction stage of agricultural production\nIn the preproduction stage of\
    \ agriculture, “what are we \ngoing to grow?” is the question that people need\
    \ to consider. \nThe application of artificial intelligence technology to \nthe\
    \ preproduction stage is aimed at helping agricultural \nworkers to grasp the\
    \ prerequisites in the agricultural \nscene. At this stage, we focus on soil fertilizer\
    \ quality \ntesting, irrigation scheme design, seed quality testing, and \ncrop\
    \ yield and quality forecast to briefly introduce the \napplication of AI in agriculture\
    \ in the past five years.\n2.1.1. Soil fertilizer quality testing\nAt the preproduction\
    \ stage of the agricultural process, the \nquality of soil fertilizer plays a\
    \ decisive role in the growth \nof crops. The determination of the content of\
    \ minerals, \nnutrients, and other elements in the soil is an important \nindicator\
    \ to judge whether the soil is polluted (Jia et al., \n2021), and whether it is\
    \ suitable for planting a particular \nplant (Chen et al., 2019; Wilhelm et al.,\
    \ 2022), and whether \nit meets the nutrients required by crops (Kulkarni et al.,\
    \ \n2019). Therefore, it is vital to systematically test and \nevaluate soils\
    \ and fertilizers before planting. There are many \nsubstances in the soil that\
    \ affect crop growth. This paper \nsimply divides them into “human-eye distinguishable”\
    \ \nand “human-eye indistinguishable”, which are introduced \nin the following\
    \ contents respectively. Among them, the \n“human-eye distinguishable” substances\
    \ in the soil are \nmainly the residues from the previous cropping cycle while\
    \ \nthe “human-eye indistinguishable” substances in the soil \nrefer to the physical,\
    \ chemical, and biological indicators \nthat are hardly observable by human beings\
    \ alone and \nrequire the help of some professional detection tools, such \nas\
    \ the content of some trace elements, minerals, and the \nactivity of some microorganisms.\n\
    Firstly, the detection of “human-eye distinguishable” \nsubstances in the soil\
    \ is focused on plant residues that \nhave a major protective effect on the soil.\
    \ Not only do they \nreduce soil erosion and consolidate soil quality, but also\
    \ \nbring nutrients and improve soil structure for recultivation. \nHowever, the\
    \ workload of manually determining the types \nof residues and the coverage rate\
    \ of residues on large \nareas of land is undoubtedly huge and extremely time-\n\
    consuming, and it is subjective and uneven, and the error \nof the results is\
    \ uncertain with the experience of different \nobservers. In this regard, with\
    \ the help of machine vision, \nimage processing and other technologies, people\
    \ have \nproposed a series of reliable, consistent, and automated \nmethods. For\
    \ example, Tao et al. (2021) developed a \ndeep learning method MSCU-net + C,\
    \ which was used to \ndraw the residual coverage area of maize on high spatial\
    \ \nresolution satellite remote sensing images, and classify \ndifferent coverage\
    \ rates and measure the classification \naccuracy index. The results showed that\
    \ the average value \nof IoU increased from 0.8604 to 0.908, and the average \n\
    value of Kappa increased from 0.8864 to 0.9258. Another \nexample is the crop\
    \ residue level estimation using machine \nlearning methods for RGB images of\
    \ three different ground \nimage resolutions (GSD) by Upadhyay’s team (2022).\
    \ The \nRFE-SVM feature selection method was used to obtain \ncross-validation\
    \ scores up to 10 times better than other \nmethods, as well as residual cover\
    \ estimation by location \nfor classified images using a Bayesian-based classification\
    \ \nmodel.\nSecondly, the most familiar part of the “human-eye \nindistinguishable”\
    \ substances in the soil is the detection \nof soil salinity, followed by the\
    \ detection of nitrogen (N), \nphosphorus (P), potassium (K), and carbon (C),\
    \ which are \nthe main nutrients provided by the soil for crop growth. \nSoil\
    \ salinization is closely related to the sustainable \ndevelopment of agriculture\
    \ and is a phenomenon of \nsoil degradation. Therefore, it is of great significance\
    \ to \naccurately monitor soil salinization. Recently, the popular \nway of predicting\
    \ soil salinity is “Internet of things + \nmachine learning”, such as Wang et\
    \ al. (2021) and Wei et \nal. (2020) both used the way combination of “multispectral\
    \ \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n644\nimage acquisition + machine learning prediction\
    \ model” \nto predict soil salinity. Analyzing the nutrient levels of \nelements\
    \ in the soil and adjusting fertilizer planning to \ncrop needs can not only mitigate\
    \ the general environmental \ndegradation, climatic disasters, and economic losses\
    \ \ncaused by over-fertilization, but also increase crop yields \nand productivity.\
    \ Some typical examples of combining \nmachine learning with soil chemical element\
    \ prediction in \nthe last 5 years are presented in Table 1.\nAfter testing the\
    \ elemental content of the soil, scientific \nfertilization planning based on\
    \ soil nutrient status is the \nbasis for high-quality and high-yielding crops\
    \ (Chen et \nal., 2018; Nie et al., 2021). Uneven distribution and low \nutilization\
    \ of fertilizer will be caused by blind, mechanical \napplication of fertilizer,\
    \ which can even cause adverse \nconsequences such as soil pollution and excess\
    \ crop \nnutrients. Researchers have conducted research on this \nproblem. Chaganti\
    \ et al. (2019) used technologies such \nas machine learning, image processing,\
    \ and the Internet \nof things to optimize fertilizer use decisions on farms.\
    \ \nEscalante et al. (2019) used machine learning to determine \nthe optimal fertilizer\
    \ dose for specific barley varieties. In \nan application program developed by\
    \ Goyal et al. (2021), \nthe fertilizer calculator function provides the user\
    \ with the \nnumber of DAPs, MOPs, and kilograms of urea needed \nfor the crop\
    \ after entering the “crop type” and “number \nof hectares”. These efforts have\
    \ promoted the progress of \nfertilization methods in a more reasonable and accurate\
    \ \ndirection, all of which are of great significance to the \nsustainable development\
    \ of agriculture and the successful \nimplementation of precision agriculture.\n\
    2.1.2. Irrigation scheme design\nBesides soil, water is another decisive factor\
    \ restricting \nagricultural production. In the preproduction stage of \nagriculture,\
    \ proper irrigation planning is the basis for \nsustainable agricultural production\
    \ (García-Tejero et al., \n2011). The introduction of several artificial intelligence\
    \ \ntechnologies has made intelligent and automatic irrigation \npossible, while\
    \ irrigation management and decision \nmaking are continuously optimized, thus\
    \ advancing the \ndevelopment of fine agriculture and sustainable agriculture.\
    \ \nA typical AI-based intelligent irrigation system is shown in \nFigure 2.\n\
    The typical intelligent irrigation system shown in \nFigure 2 is mainly composed\
    \ of terminal monitoring part, \ngateway module, cloud service module, expert\
    \ decision \nsystem, and user terminal. The expert decision system is \na key\
    \ part whose main function is to process, calculate, \npredict, and analyze the\
    \ historical or real-time data in \nthe cloud system through a series of artificial\
    \ intelligence \nalgorithms to obtain the best irrigation decision. As can \n\
    be seen from the figure, the data affecting the decision-\nmaking are mainly irrigation\
    \ water quality, soil condition, \nreference evapotranspiration (ETo), precipitation,\
    \ crop \nfactor and other.\nAgriculture is inseparable from water, and the primary\
    \ \nconcern in the irrigation process is the quality of irrigation \nwater. Traditional\
    \ methods of irrigation water quality \nassessment are cumbersome and costly,\
    \ which increases \nthe burden of farmers. Therefore, the use of artificial \n\
    intelligence technology to predict and manage the quality \nof groundwater is\
    \ a valuable research direction at present. \nZhao et al. (2020) compared the\
    \ CAR-RR model and the \nadvanced CAR-SVR model they developed for depth \nmodeling\
    \ of the groundwater table with the support vector \nregression (SVR) model and\
    \ multiple linear regression \n(MLR) model, and they validated them in the Hetao\

    \ artificial neural \nnetwork (Baysia-ANN) models. El Bilali et al. (2021) \n\
    developed and evaluated Adaboost, random forests (RF), \nartificial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs), and support vector \nregression (SVR) models that predict the Berrechid\
    \ \naquifer in Morocco, promising in low-cost and real-time \nprediction of groundwater\
    \ quality.\nSoil conditions are mainly the determination and \nprediction of soil\
    \ temperature, salt content, and water \ncontent. The daily soil temperature (DST)\
    \ model proposed \nby Zeynoddin et al. (2019), the method for determining \nsoil\
    \ salinity levels and environmental conditions based on \nmachine learning proposed\
    \ by Bashir et al. (2020), and the \nResBiLSTM model for detecting soil water\
    \ content (SWC) \nproposed by Yu et al. (2020a), all provide important \ninformation\
    \ for irrigation demand forecasting. Soil salinity \nprediction has been briefly\
    \ outlined in Section 2.1.1 and \nwill not be repeated here. For soil moisture\
    \ content, the \nmode of “Internet of things + machine learning” is also \nthe\
    \ most widely used mode at present. Thus, Tseng et al. \n(2018) used drones to\
    \ collect images and compared seven \ndifferent prediction methods based on deep\
    \ learning; \nSingh et al. (2019) assembled data collected from sensors \ndeployed\
    \ in the field and weather forecast data from the \nInternet, to analyze and compare\
    \ multiple ML techniques \nto predict future soil moisture.\nReference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) reflects the impact \nof weather on crop water requirements. Using machine\
    \ \nlearning model, people can not only estimate the past and \ncurrent ETo more\
    \ accurately, but also predict the future \nETo value. With the continuous development\
    \ and progress \nof technology, people compare a variety of models to find \n\
    the best method to predict ETo. For example, Huang et \nal. (2019) evaluated CatBoost,\
    \ RF, and SVM models, of \nwhich CatBoost is a machine learning method based on\
    \ \ngradient-boosted decision trees; Ferreira and da Cunha \n(2020) evaluated\
    \ long-term short-term memory (LSTM), \none-dimensional convolutional neural networks\
    \ (1D \nCNN), CNN-LSTM in deep learning models, as well \nas artificial neural\
    \ network (ANN) and random forest \n(RF) in traditional machine learning models;\
    \ Ponraj and \nVigneswaran (2020) trained, validated, and tested datasets \nusing\
    \ multiple linear regression, random forest (RF), \nand gradient augmented regression\
    \ (GBR) algorithms; \nMohammadi and Mehdizadeh (2020) compared PL-SVR, \nRF-SVR,\
    \ PCA-SVR, and COR-SVR models and coupled \nthe whale optimization algorithm (WOA)\
    \ with the best-\nperforming RF-SVR to form a new hybrid called RF-SVR-\nWOA model.\
    \ In addition, researchers have also worked \nto find ways to use less information\
    \ while obtaining more \naccurate results. Nagappan et al. (2020) reduced the\
    \ input \nvariable dimensions from six to three when modeling \nbased on deep\
    \ learning neural networks (DLNN).\n2.1.3. Seed quality testing\nSeed quality\
    \ testing mainly includes purity analysis, variety \ndetermination, germination\
    \ test, viability determination, \nand health determination. Inspection and determination\
    \ \nof seeds by scientific and reliable methods, and thus \nevaluation of seeds,\
    \ are important tools for ensuring seed \nquality, calculating appropriate sowing\
    \ amounts, selecting \nsuitable seed batches, and making rational tillage decisions.\

    reserve of testers have restricted the results of seed quality \ntesting, and\
    \ have made the results lack accuracy and less \nscientific. At present, the seed\
    \ quality testing methods are \nalso mostly combined with “IoT + ML” and generally\
    \ use \nthe Internet of things technology to collect image and other \nsource\
    \ information, mainly spectroscopy, hyperspectral \nimaging (Zhang et al., 2021),\
    \ electronic nose, thermal \nimaging technology, and X-ray imaging technology;\
    \ then \nthe algorithms of machine learning, especially of deep \nlearning, are\
    \ introduced to assist model construction. \nFor example, Larios and his colleagues\
    \ (2020) used \ninfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and machine learning \nalgorithms\
    \ to distinguish soybean seed vigor, and in \ntheir cross-validation tests, high\
    \ and low vigor soybean \nseeds were discriminated with 100% accuracy. Another\
    \ \nexample, Tigabu et al. (2020) studied the potential of near-\ninfrared spectroscopy\
    \ in the rapid and nondestructive \ndetermination of Chinese fir seed viability,\
    \ and the average \nclassification accuracy of the test was 99% and above. In\
    \ \naddition, Zeng’s team (2019) worked on identifying and \nclassifying the maturity\
    \ stages of cucumber seeds in a \nnondestructive, accurate, fast, and inexpensive\
    \ manner. \nThe single-core near-infrared spectroscopy (SK-NIRS) \ntechnique they\
    \ proposed, successfully distinguished five \ncategories of cucumber seeds with\
    \ different maturity levels \nin a nondestructive state, and obtained an accuracy\
    \ of \n99.69%. These research results show the high adaptability \nand mutual\
    \ achievement of artificial intelligence and seed \nquality detection.\n2.1.4.\
    \ Crop yield and quality forecast\nCrop yield and quality forecasting is one of\
    \ the challenging \nissues in precision agriculture and an important task \nfor\
    \ agricultural decision makers. Accurate crop yield \nforecasting models can help\
    \ farmers decide what to plant \nand when to plant it, as well as help governments\
    \ develop \ntimely food policies, market prices, import/export policies \nand\
    \ proper storage. Crop yield forecasting is not an easy \ntask as crop yields\
    \ depend on many different factors such \nas climate, weather, soil, fertilizer\
    \ use and seed variety (Xu \net al., 2019). The mainstream method in recent years\
    \ is \nto apply artificial intelligence technologies (Paudel et al., \n2021) such\
    \ as machine learning and machine vision to \nforecast crop yield. \nPrior to\
    \ this, researchers have conducted extensive \nsystematic literature review (SLR)\
    \ work: Vaidya et al. \n(2022) focused on precision agriculture and examined \n\
    related work using hyperspectral remote sensing for \ncrop yield prediction and\
    \ estimation; Klompenburg et al. \n(2020) conducted an extensive study of the\
    \ literature on \nyield forecasting and summarized and analyzed it from \nthree\
    \ perspectives: prediction feature selection, machine \nlearning algorithm selection,\
    \ and evaluation parameter \nselection. The results show that the most commonly\
    \ used \nmethods are CNN, LSTM, and DNN; Koirala et al. (2019) \nreviewed methods\
    \ for fruit detection and yield estimation \nusing deep learning, and also recommended\
    \ methods such \nas CNN, LSTM, and deep regression.\n2.2. Midproduction stage\
    \ of agricultural production\nIn the midproduction stage of agricultural production,\
    \ \n“How are we going to grow?” is the core issue that \npeople need to consider.\
    \ At this stage, farmers expect \nhigh yields and high-quality returns through\
    \ newer and \nbetter farming techniques. Around this core goal, various \nagricultural\
    \ intelligent systems have been developed, and \nvarious disease detection and\
    \ control methods have been \nproposed to better answer the question of “how to\
    \ grow”.\n2.2.1. Various agricultural intelligent systems\nAgricultural expert\
    \ system is an intelligent computer \nprogram system, which integrates the knowledge\
    \ and \nexperience of agricultural experts and can deal with the \nproblems in\
    \ the process of agricultural production from \nthe perspective of experts (McKinion\
    \ and Lemmon, \n1985). It is well known that when solving agricultural \nproblems,\
    \ agricultural experts are usually required to have \nconsiderable experience\
    \ accumulation and research basis, \nand have high requirements for talents. However,\
    \ the \nhelp of agricultural experts is not always available when \nfarmers need\
    \ it. In order to solve the above problems, \nagricultural expert system uses\
    \ big data technology to \nintegrate relevant data into database, and establishes\
    \ \nmathematical model through machine learning, so as to \ncarry out heuristic\
    \ reasoning, which can effectively solve \nthe problems encountered by farmers\
    \ and scientifically \nguide planting. For example, Khalil’s apple tree knowledge\
    \ \nsystem designed by CLIPS with Delphi can help farmers \nget the correct diagnosis\
    \ and treatment of more than a \ndozen apple diseases (Khalil et al., 2019).\n\
    In addition, some systems support users to access \nthem through the Internet\
    \ and enter questions to obtain \nexpert-level answers. For example, Galala developed\
    \ a \nsystem for early date coconut disease diagnosis consulting \n(Galala, 2019);\
    \ Adi and Isnanto (2020) developed a rice \nmanagement expert system based on\
    \ positive chain and \ndeterministic factor method, including seed selection \n\
    consultation and pest detection consultation. Such Expert \nQuestion Answering\
    \ System can answer users’ questions \nin natural language with accurate and concise\
    \ natural \nlanguage, which is a research direction that has attracted \nmuch\
    \ attention and has broad development prospects \nin the field of artificial intelligence\
    \ and natural language \nprocessing (Hu, 2006). The emergence of Expert Question\
    \ \nAnswering System combines knowledge map with \nquestion-and-answer system,\
    \ simulates experts to answer \nfarmers ‘ questions one to one, and provides farmers\
    \ \nwith fast, convenient, and accurate query services and \nknowledge decision-making.\n\
    NIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n648\nRecording, monitoring, and controlling environmental\
    \ \nconditions in agricultural production is particularly \nimportant. Internet\
    \ of things equipment, wireless sensor \nnetworks, suitable sensors, and cloud\
    \ services embedded \nwith the capabilities of artificial intelligence and machine\
    \ \nlearning are the pillars of smart environmental monitoring \n(SEM). Intelligent\
    \ environment detection system plays \nan important role in intelligent or green\
    \ agriculture \n(Nayyar and Puri, 2016; Shahzadi et al., 2016; Sushanth \nand\
    \ Sujatha, 2018; Pathak et al., 2019). It can help people \nobtain soil health,\
    \ water analysis, water pollution level, \nwater level and other factors data,\
    \ and intelligent analysis \nis very important to obtain the sustainable productivity\
    \ of \nthe agricultural sector. In addition, agricultural intelligent \nsystem\
    \ includes weed identification system (Sabzi et \nal., 2018; Espejo-Garcia et\
    \ al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022b), \nagricultural decision support system (Hafezalkotob\
    \ et al., \n2018; Asher and Brosh, 2022), geographic information \nsystem (Manuel\
    \ et al., 2020), portable agricultural \ninformation system (Keerthana et al.,\
    \ 2018; Akhter et al., \n2021), etc.\n2.2.2. Crop disease detection and control\n\
    Plant diseases cause great losses to the production, \neconomy, quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products. \nTherefore, it is necessary to monitor the disease\
    \ of crops \nfrom the first stage of crop life cycle to before harvest. The \n\
    traditional method is a visual observation, which is not \nonly time-consuming\
    \ and labor-intensive, but also requires \nsupervisors to have a lot of professional\
    \ knowledge. To \nsolve these problems, researchers have proposed a series \n\
    of automated and intelligent disease detection methods. \nTable 2 lists some typical\
    \ cases of crop pest detection using \nartificial intelligence technology in recent\
    \ years.\nIt is not difficult to see from Table 2 that the main \nimplementation\
    \ methods of disease recognition are \ngradually moving from traditional deep\
    \ learning to few-\nshot learning. This is primarily because the algorithms \n\
    based on Deep Learning typically rely heavily on large \namounts of data. Deep\
    \ Learning driven by big data \nfaces the challenges of the high cost of data\
    \ acquisition, \nhigh cost of high-end hardware and high consumption \nof power\
    \ resources (Li and Chao, 2021b), which is not \nconducive to the sustainable\
    \ development of agriculture. \nIn order to conform to the sustainable development\
    \ of \nagriculture, researchers should focus on the trade-off \nbetween data quality\
    \ and quantity. For the data quality in \nthe agricultural field, Li et al. (Li\
    \ and Chao, 2021a; Li et \nal., 2021; Li et al., 2022b) believed that limited\
    \ good data \ncan defeat a large number of bad data. For the problem of \ndata\
    \ quantity, Yang et al. (2022a) examines the application \nof few-shot learning\
    \ in smart agriculture, and Nie et al. \n(2022) investigated sustainable computing\
    \ in intelligent \nagriculture. The results show that using small sample \nin\
    \ some agricultural tasks can achieve a better model \nalgorithm with less sample\
    \ data.\n2.3. Postproduction stages of agricultural production\nIn the postproduction\
    \ stage of agricultural production, \nit is necessary to consider the harvesting\
    \ of agricultural \nproducts, that is, to achieve the transformation of \nagricultural\
    \ product output to efficiency. The review \nof the postproduction stage of agriculture\
    \ mainly \nfocuses on the harvesting, inspection, and marketing of \nagricultural\
    \ products. Among them, the general trend of \nagricultural product harvesting\
    \ work lies in automation \nand robotization, while the current state of harvesting\
    \ \ntechnology for different types of crops has a different focus; \nagricultural\
    \ product inspection work mainly includes \nmaturity grading, quality inspection\
    \ and appearance \nclassification, and its mainstream technology lies in \ncomputer\
    \ vision technology; every part of agricultural \nproduct marketing work relies\
    \ heavily on the application \nof information technology.\n2.3.1. Harvest of agricultural\
    \ products\nCrop harvesting activities include harvesting, stacking, \nhandling,\
    \ threshing, cleaning, and hauling. These jobs \nare usually tedious and require\
    \ large labor and high \nrepeatability. Under the influence of increasing demand\
    \ \nfor agricultural products and labor shortage, the harvest \nof agricultural\
    \ products needs to improve the level of \nagricultural automation and roboticization.\
    \ \nFor cereal crops, such as wheat and corn, which mature \nevenly in the field,\
    \ large machines can be used to harvest \nthe crop efficiently and on a large\
    \ scale. For melon and fruit \ncrops, different fruits have different growth environment,\
    \ \nspatial location, geometry shape, size, color, hardness, \nand maturity, so\
    \ it is not suitable for uniform harvesting. \nAt the same time, factors such\
    \ as rugged orchard terrain \nand obstacle interference also increase the difficulty\
    \ of \nharvesting melon and fruit crops. The smaller harvesting \nrobots capable\
    \ of sensing and adapting to different crop \ntypes or environmental changes are\
    \ therefore required \nfor harvesting (Zhao et al., 2016; Silwal et al., 2017).\
    \ At \npresent, fruit harvesting robots can already use visual \nperception to\
    \ perceive and learn crop information, which \ncan complete camera calibration\
    \ (Wang et al., 2019), \ntarget recognition and localization (Yu et al., 2020b),\
    \ \ntarget background recognition (Feng et al., 2019), 3D \nreconstruction (Kusumam\
    \ et al., 2017; Blok et al., 2019; \nOnishi et al., 2019), robot behavior planning\
    \ based on \nvisual positioning (Gongal et al., 2015; Wibowo et al., \n2016),\
    \ and avoid complex factors interference localization \n(Xiong et al., 2018) and\
    \ other tasks. The object recognition \nmethods for these harvesting robots are\
    \ mainly single-\nfeature vision methods, multifeature fusion methods, and \n\
    deep learning algorithms. In addition, the study found \nthat for sweet potato,\
    \ potato, yam, taro, and other root \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n649\nTable\

    \ harvesting \ntechnologies for this kind of crop, and most of them remain \n\
    in the development of mechanical institutions (Bahadirov \net al., 2020; Matmurodov\
    \ et al., 2020) and the optimization \nstage of the automatic control system,\
    \ which need to be \nbroken through and improved.\n2.3.2. Inspection of agricultural\
    \ products\nWith the support of various intelligent algorithms, \nmicroelectronic\
    \ systems, nanotechnology, sensors, on-site \nrapid detection technology, and\
    \ remote data transmission \nand processing technology, the agricultural product\
    \ \ninspection, and detection system tend to be miniaturized \nand intelligent.\
    \ This paper mainly introduces the inspection \nof agricultural products under\
    \ the influence of artificial \nintelligence from three aspects of maturity classification,\
    \ \nquality inspection, and appearance classification. \n2.3.2.a. Maturity classification\n\
    Firstly, judging the maturity of agricultural products \nand choosing appropriate\
    \ preservation methods are the \nprerequisites for consumers to obtain fresh agricultural\
    \ \nproducts. The ripening process of fruit is usually \naccompanied by changes\
    \ in color, aroma, texture, and \npattern. These changes are usually gradual,\
    \ subtle, and \ninappropriate for human judgment. Using artificial \nintelligence\
    \ can quickly and accurately grasp these changes \nthat are not obvious in the\
    \ eyes of people, so as to judge the \nimmaturity, maturity, and decay of agricultural\
    \ products. \nUsing artificial intelligence, researchers have proposed \nvarious\
    \ detection methods of fruit ripeness based on \nsound, light, color, and taste,\
    \ and combined them with \nintelligent algorithms (Balbin et al., 2018; Gutierrez\
    \ et al., \n2019; Zhang et al., 2020). The method of fruit ripeness \ndetection\
    \ using acoustic vibration (Fadchar et al., 2020) \nis a typical example of the\
    \ abovementioned sound-based \nmethods; the light-based detection methods mainly\
    \ \ninclude spectral technology and hyperspectral imaging \ntechnology (Pu et\
    \ al., 2019; Garillos-Manliguez et al., \n2021); the color-based fruit ripening\
    \ detection methods \nuse color feature extraction technology (Alfatni et al.,\
    \ 2020; \nZhong et al., 2021); and there is no doubt that methods \nusing the\
    \ electronic nose (Jia et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021) \nexemplify taste-based\
    \ approach. At this stage, spectral \ntechnology and hyperspectral imaging technology\
    \ are \nstill the mainstream. However, the expensive equipment \nlimits their\
    \ large-scale application and development, and \nlow-cost photodiode-based fruit\
    \ maturity estimation \n(Giovenzana et al., 2015; Bhatnagar et al., 2019) may\
    \ \nbecome a more popular direction in the future.\n2.3.2.b. Quality inspection\n\
    The quality and safety of agricultural products is directly \nrelated to people’s\
    \ health, and its quality testing is mainly \ndivided into two aspects: component\
    \ content testing and \ndamage testing. Firstly, for ingredient content detection,\
    \ \nthe easiest way is of course to cut it open and conduct \nchemical inspection.\
    \ However, due to the consideration \nof food protection and sustainable agriculture,\
    \ in \nrecent years, people have been striving for physical \nnondestructive testing.\
    \ Taking fruit sweetness analysis as \nan example, Tran et al. (2021) used a simple\
    \ spectroscopic \nsystem with a classifier based on machine learning they \ndeveloped\
    \ and trained to detect apple sweetness, with \na maximum accuracy of 91.5%; Nguyen\
    \ et al. realized \nthe precise sweetness classification of mango by using \n\
    low cost visible near infrared ( VIS-NIR ) multispectral \nsensors and random\
    \ forest ( RF ) classifier. Secondly, \nthe nondestructive damage detection of\
    \ fruits is of great \nsignificance for screening bad fruits and fruit grading.\
    \ The \ndamage of agricultural products is divided into internal \ndamage and\
    \ surface damage. Here, the surface damage can \nbe classified as appearance classification\
    \ of agricultural \nproducts, so internal damage is mainly introduced here. \n\
    Traditional physical methods include magnetic resonance \nimaging (Thybo et al.,\
    \ 2004), acoustic localization (Yoshida \net al., 2018), computer tomography (Meberg\
    \ et al., 2001) \nand so on. However, these methods are either complicated \n\
    to operate, expensive, or not compatible with different \nfruits, so they are\
    \ not suitable for large-scale production \npractice. Therefore, researchers have\
    \ proposed to apply the \ndeep learning algorithm. Only by determining the internal\
    \ \ndamage of a small number of samples to train the classifier \nmodel, the machine\
    \ can quickly and reliably predict the \nsituation of a large number of fruits.\
    \ In the nondestructive \ndetection of withered kernels in shelled walnuts, Zhai\
    \ et \nal. (2020) used walnut images and weight information \nto fuse the training\
    \ of the machine learning algorithm, \nand achieved 97% classification accuracy\
    \ with only 0.001 \naverage cost calculation time.\n2.3.2.c. Appearance classification\n\
    The classification of agricultural products according to \ntheir appearance characteristics,\
    \ such as size, shape, color \nand so on, is also an important step before their\
    \ sales work. \nHowever, the efficiency of manual operation is low and \nthe influence\
    \ of subjectivity is large, and the accuracy rate \nof pure mechanical operation\
    \ is low. That is why people \nwant to apply artificial intelligence to the classification\
    \ \nof agricultural products. After the introduction of a very \nreliable inspection\
    \ tool-machine vision technology, the \nfruit can be accurately and efficiently\
    \ identified and \nclassified according to the color, texture, shape, disease\
    \ \ndefects, and other characteristics, which is helpful to \nincrease yield,\
    \ reduce production time and improve quality \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n\
    651\ncontrol (Ayyub and Manjramkar, 2019). Such methods \nhave been relatively\
    \ mature at this stage, so the problems \nto be considered have gradually shifted\
    \ from the method \nitself to how to put them into practical application.\n2.3.3.\
    \ Sales of agricultural products\nThe final work of the postproduction stages\
    \ of agricultural \nis the sale of agricultural products, which needs to \nbe\
    \ processed, packaged, transported, and sold. In the \ntransportation process,\
    \ most agricultural products are \nperishable, which inevitably leads to certain\
    \ losses. People \nwill be based on the Internet of things radio frequency \n\
    identification technology is applied to this, through the \ndynamic way to obtain\
    \ product information, so that \nmanagers can monitor the whole circulation process,\
    \ \nreal-time tracking. In this way, it can effectively plan the \nquantity of\
    \ product storage and transportation, reduce \noperating costs and prevent transportation\
    \ losses. In \nthe sales process, artificial intelligence technology can \nbe\
    \ applied to collect data on production, consumption, \nstorage, and circulation,\
    \ and in-depth analysis of the whole \nmarket. It can effectively understand the\
    \ current level of \nagricultural development, prevent sharp rise or fall, and\
    \ \npromote more stable product transactions. In addition, \nthe online marketing\
    \ of mobile or PC-side e-commerce \nplatforms built by artificial intelligence\
    \ and Internet \ntechnology can maximize the use of online integration \nadvantages\
    \ to effectively integrate information resources, \nreduce production costs, and\
    \ improve the relationship \nbetween suppliers and consumers. At the same time,\
    \ based \non the Internet of things and mobile network technology \n(Zhou and\
    \ Zhou, 2012), the information management \nof agricultural production and circulation\
    \ process, the \ntraceability management of agricultural product quality \n(Yang\
    \ et al., 2018), the management of agricultural product \nproduction archives\
    \ (origin environment, production \nprocess, and quality detection), and the establishment\
    \ \nof agricultural product quality and safety traceability \nsystem based on\
    \ website and mobile phone short message \nplatform (Tian, 2017; Zheng et al.,\
    \ 2021) can realize the \ntraceability of the whole quality and service of agricultural\
    \ \nproduct quality and safety, improve the brand effect of \ntraceability agricultural\
    \ products, and ensure the quality \nand safety of agricultural products.\n3.\
    \ Digital twins in agriculture\n3.1. Overview of digital twins\n3.1.1. General\
    \ definition of digital twins\nReview history, the prototype of digital twins,\
    \ “mirror \nspace model”, was first conceived by Michael Grieves in \n2003 (Githens,\
    \ 2007). In 2010, the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration (NASA) adopted\
    \ two identical \naircrafts, one was the native and the other one was \nthe twin,\
    \ to realize the comprehensive diagnosis and \nprediction function of the flight\
    \ system, which led to the \nconcept of “digital twins” (Piascik et al., 2010).\
    \ In 2014, \nMichael Grieves provided another detailed definition \nof digital\
    \ twins. He proposed that the basic framework \nof the digital twins system should\
    \ include the physical \nspace, the virtual space, and the flow of information\
    \ and \ndata connecting the two spaces (Grieves, 2014). With the \ndevelopment\
    \ of related technologies, the definition of the \nterm “digital twins” has been\
    \ more widely discussed by \ndifferent researchers and institutions. For example,\
    \ Mayani \net al. (2018) saw the digital twins as a bridge between the \nphysical\
    \ and digital worlds; Wanasinghe (2020) regarded it \nas an immersive data analysis\
    \ technique; Poddar (2018) and \nSharma et al. (2018) regarded it as a virtual\
    \ and simulated \nmodel or a realistic replica of a physical asset. Although \n\
    these definitions differ somewhat from each other, none of \nthem has ever departed\
    \ from the basic framework of the \ndigital twins.\nA general definition of digital\
    \ twins is that it refers \nto the establishment and simulation of a physical\
    \ entity, \nprocess, or system in the information platform. By \nintegrating physical\
    \ feedback data, assisted by artificial \nintelligence, machine learning and software\
    \ analysis, \na digital simulation is established in the information \nplatform,\
    \ and this simulation will automatically make \ncorresponding changes with the\
    \ change of physical entities \naccording to feedback. Ideally, digital twins\
    \ can self-learn \naccording to multiple feedback source data, and present \n\
    the real situation of physical entities in the digital world \nalmost in real\
    \ time. In other words, with the help of digital \ntwins, the state of physical\
    \ entities can be understood on \nthe information platform, and the predefined\
    \ interface \ncomponents in physical entities can be controlled (Schleich \net\
    \ al., 2017; Vatn, 2018; Liu et al., 2019).\n3.1.2. Basic architecture of digital\
    \ twins\nThe most typical and widely accepted DT framework \nstill consists of\
    \ three main components: “physical space”, \n“virtual space”, and “connections\
    \ between these spaces” \n(Grieves, 2014). Among them, the physical space contains\
    \ \nphysical assets, sensors, and actuators; the virtual space \nincludes multiphysics,\
    \ multiscale, probabilistic simulation \nmodels; and the connection between the\
    \ physical space \nand the virtual space ensures seamless data and drive \ncommand\
    \ exchange between these two spaces. With \nthe continuous expansion and upgrading\
    \ of application \ndemands, DT faces more service demands from different \nfields,\
    \ different levels of users, and different services (Qi \net al., 2021). At the\
    \ same time, the interconnection of all \nthings provides conditions for realizing\
    \ the information \nphysical interaction and data integration of DT. To facilitate\
    \ \nfurther applications of DT in more domains, researchers \nhave extended the\
    \ three-component DT framework. Tao \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n652\nand\
    \ Zhang added “DT data fusion” and “service system” \nmodules to the original\
    \ framework which have only \n“physical space” and “virtual space”, and the connection\
    \ \nbetween them was also expanded accordingly. The six-\ncomponent framework\
    \ proposed by Parrott and Warshaw \nconsists of five enabling components and a\
    \ six-step \nprocess. Their work embodies “physical space” and “virtual \nspace”:\
    \ “sensors” and “actuators” in enabling components, \nand “act”, “create”, and\
    \ “communicate” in processes belong \nto physical space; while the enabling components\
    \ “data” \nand “analytics”, as well as the “aggregate”, “analyze”, and \n“insight”\
    \ processes belong to the virtual space; in addition, \nthe role of “integration”\
    \ is to connect the physical and \nvirtual worlds.\n3.1.3. Key technologies and\
    \ typical applications of digital \ntwins\nThe digital twins exists in virtual\
    \ form, which can not \nonly reflect the characteristics, behavior process and\
    \ \nperformance of physical objects in a highly realistic way, \nbut also realize\
    \ real-time monitoring, evaluation, and \nmanagement in a surreal form. Its ability\
    \ to present a \nsurreal mirror image of the target physical entity object \n\
    relies on the support of the following technologies: high-\nperformance computing,\
    \ advanced sensing acquisition, \ndigital simulation, high-fidelity modeling,\
    \ intelligent data \nanalysis, VR presentation, etc. By constructing digital \n\
    twins, not only the health state of the target entity can be \ndescribed perfectly\
    \ and meticulously, but also the deep, \nmultiscale, and probabilistic dynamic\
    \ state assessment, \nlife prediction, and task completion rate analysis can be\
    \ \nrealized through the integration of data and physics.\nThrough the integration\
    \ with artificial intelligence, \nmobile Internet, cloud computing, big data analysis,\
    \ \nand other technologies, DT has potential application \nvalue in many fields\
    \ involving physical and virtual space \nmapping, fusion, and collaborative evolution.\
    \ DT can be \napplied in different fields such as smart city, construction, \n\
    medical treatment, agriculture, freight, drilling platform, \nautomobile, aerospace,\
    \ manufacturing, electric power, and \nother fields.\n3.2. The applications of\
    \ digital twins in agriculture\nWith the current global expectations for the agricultural\
    \ \nfield, scientific and technological achievements such as \nagricultural artificial\
    \ intelligence technology, agricultural \nInternet of things technology, agricultural\
    \ data model \nanalysis system, and agricultural intelligent equipment \ncontinue\
    \ to emerge. Agriculture has basically realized \ndigitalization and networking,\
    \ is moving towards the \nstage of intelligence and virtualization. The emergence\
    \ \nof the agricultural digital twins system will realize the \norganic integration\
    \ of the physical entity of agricultural \nproduction and the digital cyberspace,\
    \ so as to realize the \nintegration of “connection-perception-decision-control”.\
    \ \nThis will support the better realization of accurate, efficient, \nand sustainable\
    \ smart agriculture, and provide new \nmomentum for the digital transformation\
    \ and upgrading \nof agriculture.\nAgricultural digital twins are mainly based\
    \ on the \nelements of the agricultural production process (physical \nentities)\
    \ as the object, focus on the digital solidification \nof agricultural knowledge\
    \ based on various types of \nproduction models, system rules, and data collections.\
    \ \nAgricultural digital twins are dedicated to constructing \nmultidimensional,\
    \ multiscale, multidisciplinary, and \nmultiphysical quantity dynamic virtual\
    \ models to portray \nthe attributes, behaviors, and laws of each element in the\
    \ \nagricultural production process to replace some complex \nexperiments in real\
    \ environments. Figure 3 shows a typical \nschematic diagram of an agricultural\
    \ digital twins system. \nIn the figure, the virtual model is constructed based\
    \ on \nagricultural entities and iteratively interacts and optimizes \nwith them\
    \ in the agricultural production process. Through \nthe data and information interaction\
    \ between the twin \ndata fed back to the 3D model and the physical world, the\
    \ \nintegrity of the digital world is continuously improved, \nand then precise\
    \ control over agricultural entities can \nbe achieved. The agricultural digital\
    \ twin system realizes \nthe simulation, monitoring, diagnosis, prediction and\
    \ \ncontrol of agricultural objects by constructing real-\ntime and accurate digital\
    \ mapping of physical objects—\nanimals, plants, and motion trajectories—in virtual\
    \ \nspace. According to the state of agricultural entities in the \nphysical world\
    \ and application requirements, quantitative \nprediction, and decision feedback\
    \ are carried out.\nDigital twins have been used less in agriculture in \nrecent\
    \ years. Our examination of it reveals its main \napplications as follows.\nAgricultural\
    \ product model was established to monitor \ncrop growth or determine crop quality\
    \ parameters. Li et al. \n(2022a) proposed a single-view leaf reconstruction method\
    \ \nof plant growth digital twins system based on deep learning \nResNet, which\
    \ provided important ideas and methods for \nsingle-view leaf reconstruction in\
    \ plant growth digital twins \nsystem. Evers et al. (2020) are committed to developing\
    \ \ndigital twins of greenhouse tomato crops, updating the \n3D simulation model\
    \ through real-time input of sensor \ninformation from real greenhouses, so as\
    \ to simulate the \ninteraction between crop quality, environmental factors, \n\
    and crop management. Pattanaik and Jenamani (2020) \ncreated digital twins of\
    \ three different mango varieties, \nAlphonso, Totapuri, and Kesar, and accurately\
    \ simulated \nthe cooling behavior of real mangoes according to the \nairflow\
    \ rate and temperature, so as to analyze and grasp \nthe cooling heterogeneity\
    \ and quality attenuation in \nthe process of mango export. Kampker et al. (2019)\
    \ \nestablished a plastic “potato digital twin” as a substitute for \nNIE et al.\
    \ / Turk J Agric For\n653\nreal potatoes to detect the impact and rotation of\
    \ potatoes \nduring harvest.\nThe environment model is established to obtain \n\
    decision support. The farm management simulation tool \nAgROS developed by Tsolakis\
    \ et al. (2019) allows the \nintroduction of static object layout characteristics\
    \ such \nas actual fields and trees, so as to carry out field tests of \nagricultural\
    \ robots or autonomous unmanned ground \nvehicles (UGV) in quasireal environment.\
    \ Jo et al. (2018) \nproposed an intelligent pig farm based on digital twins \n\
    to improve animal welfare, and conducted a feasibility \nstudy on it. Alves et\
    \ al. (2019) established a digital twins \nintelligent farm using sensing data\
    \ from soil detectors, \nweather stations, irrigation systems, and equipment to\
    \ \nobtain visual return and decision-making suggestions. \nMoghadam et al. (2020)\
    \ developed an automatic dynamic \ncrown monitoring system, AgScan3D +, which\
    \ is now \nused in mango, macadamia, avocado, and vine orchards \nand generates\
    \ digital twins of 15,000 trees. It uses a \nrotating 3D camera to create a digital\
    \ twin model for each \ntree in the orchard, and monitors the health, structure,\
    \ \npressure, fruit quality, and other indicators of each tree to \npredict pressure,\
    \ disease, and crop loss, and provide real-\ntime farm decision support for farmers.\

    \ cow welfare, greenhouse tomato \nproduction, weed monitoring and pig farm management)\
    \ \nof the European IoF2020 project.\n4. Discussion\nThis chapter focuses on “AI\
    \ in agriculture” and “DT in \nagriculture”, and discusses and analyzes the challenges\
    \ \nand future development trends of these two technologies \nin agriculture at\
    \ this stage. In Subsections 4.1 and 4.2, the \nchallenges and development trends\
    \ of AI in agriculture are \ndiscussed respectively, while the corresponding contents\
    \ \nof digital twin are discussed in Subsections 4.3 and 4.4.\n4.1. Challenges\
    \ of artificial intelligence\nThe survey shows that the abovementioned AI \ntechnologies\
    \ \nare \ncutting-edge \nagricultural \nscience \nresearch hotspots, and their\
    \ applications run through the \npreproduction, midproduction, and postproduction\
    \ stages \nof the agricultural production process. They have helped \nto achieve\
    \ intelligent management and precise control, \nimprove production efficiency\
    \ and product quality, and \nreduce environmental pollution and energy waste.\
    \ They \nhave shown excellent performance and great application \npotential and\
    \ have undoubtedly played a role in promoting \nwork related to agricultural sustainability.\
    \ At the same \ntime, we find that AI in agriculture, especially in the field\
    \ \nof agricultural sustainability, still faces many challenges:\n· Various artificial\
    \ intelligence technologies have \nnot been integrated and implemented with intelligent\
    \ \nequipment widely and on a large scale, and the intelligent \nagricultural\
    \ system still needs to be improved. On the \none hand, different types and growth\
    \ cycles of crops have \ndifferent growth states, which makes the agricultural\
    \ \nanalysis model not have a universal; on the other hand, the \nhigh cost or\
    \ lack of key technologies and equipment makes \nit impossible for various intelligent\
    \ algorithms to be put \ninto agricultural production on a large scale. Therefore,\
    \ \nmost of the research on it is still in the process of algorithm \ndevelopment,\
    \ which fails to enable farmers to truly enjoy \nthe convenience of artificial\
    \ intelligence algorithms.\n· The application of AI in various fields of agriculture\
    \ \nlacks in-depth analysis with relevance. The factors involved \nin agricultural\
    \ production are complex. Regions, seasons, \ntypes of crops, production environments,\
    \ and operating \nmethods all affect the application effect of various \nintelligent\
    \ technologies. At the present stage, most of the \nstudies only stay on the acquisition\
    \ and surface analysis \nof agricultural data. They fail to start from the excavation\
    \ \nof agricultural production laws and lack the deep analysis \nof error laws\
    \ with the correlation between theory and \npractice.\n· The global level of agricultural\
    \ automation and \nintensification is uneven, and there is a technological \n\
    gap between developing and developed countries. The \nmain manifestation is that\
    \ developing countries are prone \nto form shortcomings in basic theory, core\
    \ algorithms, \nkey equipment, high-end chips, and major systems and \nsoftware\
    \ of agricultural artificial intelligence.\n· Artificial intelligence technology\
    \ in agriculture is \ninseparable from the support of a large amount of data,\
    \ \nand how to obtain high-quality data information is one of \nthe challenges\
    \ in the future. Big data mining in agriculture \nis the process of extracting\
    \ potentially useful agricultural \ninformation and crop growth laws from a large\
    \ number of \nincomplete, noisy, fuzzy, and random agricultural data. At \npresent,\
    \ the segmentation and data mining of agricultural \nInternet of Things data resources\
    \ are still in the initial \nstage, and the intelligent algorithm models and practical\
    \ \ndatabases in various agricultural fields are in urgent need \nof expansion.\
    \ With the continuous updating and expansion \nof intelligent algorithms, at this\
    \ stage, the amount of data \nrequired and data costs are both increasing. At\
    \ the same \ntime, agricultural data obtained in the real world is limited \n\
    by the crop growth cycle, and the problems of complex \nacquisition methods and\
    \ long acquisition periods are also \na big challenge for researchers.\n· Restricted\
    \ by factors such as the shrinking global \neconomy, limited scientific and cultural\
    \ exchanges, sluggish \nhigh-tech development, lack of talents, and inadequate\
    \ \ninfrastructure, the infrastructure, policies and regulations, \ninvestment\
    \ in agricultural scientific research, and talent \npools in related fields adapted\
    \ to the development of smart \nagriculture gradually fail to meet the growing\
    \ demand for \nagricultural pressure. It is also a great challenge to balance\
    \ \nthe impact of unfavorable factors on the highly intelligent \ndevelopment\
    \ of sustainable agriculture.\n4.2. Future directions of artificial intelligence\n\
    Artificial intelligence technology, which has a broad \napplication space in agriculture,\
    \ is a pillar to promote \nsmart agriculture. Faced with the above challenges,\
    \ the \nfollowing suggestions for the possible development of \nartificial intelligence\
    \ technology in agriculture are put \nforward as follows:\n· Attention should\
    \ be paid to the improvement of \nthe computing force and technology implementation\
    \ of \nagricultural AI. The computing force is one of the important \nefficiency\
    \ indicators of agricultural AI. Conventional AI \nalgorithms are too computationally\
    \ intensive to be directly \nintegrated and applied to traditional IoT systems.\
    \ The \nlightweight and efficient algorithm models, such as Few-\nshot Learning\
    \ and so on, are easy to embed in IoT devices \nand compute at the edge of the\
    \ devices, thereby realizing \nAI applications on the IoT devices.\nNIE et al.\
    \ / Turk J Agric For\n655\n· Research and development of more universal \nagricultural\
    \ artificial intelligence equipment, strengthening \nstandardization and standardized\
    \ management, and \nimproving the level of agricultural intelligence on \na large\
    \ scale and without threshold are necessary. \nArtificial intelligence equipment\
    \ is an important part \nof artificial intelligence technology, among which the\
    \ \ncore technologies such as artificial intelligence chips and \nintelligent\
    \ sensors need to be developed and optimized. In \norder to meet the different\
    \ performance requirements of \nagricultural application scenarios, it is necessary\
    \ to carry \nout continuous and in-depth research, formulate relevant \nstandards\
    \ around the integration of AI technology and \nagricultural IoT, agricultural\
    \ machinery equipment and \nagricultural big data, and develop agricultural artificial\
    \ \nintelligence terminal equipment with lower cost and \nhigher robustness.\n\
    · People should focus on the fact that technology \ndevelopment and information\
    \ security go hand in hand, \nfocus on agricultural data security, and build a\
    \ green \ndata-sharing model. The development of agricultural \nAI technology\
    \ relies on data. Agricultural data have \nthe characteristics of large volume,\
    \ various types, and \nwide sources. It is necessary to ensure the security of\
    \ \nagricultural data and information systems to ensure the \nsafe production,\
    \ accurate management, and intelligent \ndecision-making of agriculture. At the\
    \ same time, \nestablishing a safe, efficient, and mature agricultural \ndata\
    \ open sharing mode can promote not only the rapid \ndevelopment of intelligent\
    \ agriculture, but also the \ninevitable trend of the environment.\n· The cross-integration\
    \ of different fields should be \npromoted to lead to the transformation of the\
    \ modern \nagricultural development mode. In order to meet the \nincreasingly\
    \ diversified agricultural production tasks, it \nis necessary to promote the\
    \ integrated development of \nagricultural AI in different fields. For example,\
    \ integrating \nthe real-world agricultural process with the virtual-world \n\
    agricultural model can reduce the cost and time cycle of \nagricultural data acquisition\
    \ and accelerate AI technology \niteration in the real world.\n4.3. Challenges\
    \ of digital twins\nAs a cutting-edge technology, the digital twin technology\
    \ \nhas received widespread attention from industries that it \nwill revolutionize.\
    \ Driven by technological updates and \nhistorical experience, the digital twins\
    \ can almost reflect \nall aspects of products, processes, or services. However,\
    \ the \nstudy found that the current potential of the digital twins \nin agriculture\
    \ is far from being realized, and there are still \nmany challenges in the development\
    \ of agricultural digital \ntwin technology: \n· It is easy to see that digital\
    \ twin technology is still in \nits infancy and rising stage in the agricultural\
    \ field, and the \ntechnology and tools need to be developed. Researchers \nhave\
    \ to collect and merge various types of data to model \nall the different parts\
    \ of an agricultural object or system \nfrom scratch, which will be a complex\
    \ and lengthy process.\n· How to form and design cognitive digital twins? At \n\
    this stage, although some low-level operations can be \nimplemented autonomously\
    \ without human intervention, \nmany decision-making activities still need to\
    \ be maintained \nby manual operations based on human interaction. How \nto enable\
    \ spontaneous and intervention-free simulation \nfree from human control and seamless\
    \ interaction among \nmultiple models is also a major challenge in the research\
    \ \nprocess.\n· DT offers real-time simulation possibilities for the \nproduct\
    \ lifecycle and can even help integrate the entire \nsupply chain through all\
    \ stages of its lifecycle. However, \nconnecting data information collected, aggregated,\
    \ and \nexchanged between different suppliers, manufacturers, and \ncustomers\
    \ in a virtual space, or fusing digital twin models \ndeveloped using different\
    \ DT architectures, technologies, \ninterfaces, communication protocols, models,\
    \ and \ndata, can pose interoperability issues. Therefore, the \ndevelopment of\
    \ standard-based interoperability for digital \ntwin applications is undoubtedly\
    \ another major challenge \nfor digital twin technology.\n4.4. Future directions\
    \ of digital twins\nSince its inception, the digital twin has shown great \npromise\
    \ in many aspects. With the further development of \nits technology and the increasing\
    \ maturity of agricultural \nvirtualization technology, everything in the physical\
    \ \nworld may be replicated in digital space by digital twin \ntechnology in the\
    \ future. The following are some outlooks \non future applications of the digital\
    \ twin in agriculture: \n· Digital twin technology will become the best \npractice\
    \ in various agricultural sectors. DT supports \nmanufacturing and controlling\
    \ the entire life cycle of \na product or process and therefore can model complex\
    \ \nlinks in agricultural production processes from physical \nto virtual in order\
    \ to obtain agricultural information. \nFor example, by constructing the plant\
    \ model, the crop \nlife cycle and environmental changes can be accelerated \n\
    in the virtual space, so that the data of each stage can be \neasily obtained.\
    \ By constructing virtual workshops and \npreviewing robot motion planning schemes\
    \ to simulate \nthe real-world agricultural product processing, and then \nmapping\
    \ the virtual data information to the real robot, the \nfully automated processing\
    \ and production can be realized \nto reduce the production cost of agricultural\
    \ products. By \nconstructing the virtual farm breeding environment, the \naccurate\
    \ simulation of animals from organs, tissues, and \nsystems to the whole can be\
    \ realized, so as to obtain the \nknowledge database of animal living environment,\
    \ animal \nnutrition needs, and variety breeding.\nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n\
    656\n· Industry standardization will allow different models, \ndifferent systems,\
    \ and even different domains to interact \nand respond to each other. While different\
    \ physical objects \ncan interact with each other naturally and without barriers,\
    \ \nthe problem of interaction in virtual spaces requires the \ncreation of application-specific\
    \ interfaces and functions. \nIndustry specifications and interface standardization\
    \ of \ndigital twin technology will enable the models to have \nprogrammability,\
    \ interoperability, etc. so that they can \nbe interoperated between different\
    \ production systems \nand application areas in the virtual space. For example,\
    \ \nan apple tree model constructed by one person using DT \ncan be planted accessibly\
    \ in a pear tree population model \nconstructed by another person, and a series\
    \ of feedback \ninformation on growth conditions can be obtained.\n5. Conclusion\n\
    In this paper, we focus on artificial intelligence and \ndigital twin technology\
    \ in sustainable agriculture, review \nand summarize the application of artificial\
    \ intelligence \ntechnology in each stage of the agricultural production \nprocess\
    \ in the past few years, briefly outline what digital twin \nis, and review the\
    \ current status of digital twin technology \nin agriculture. The results of the\
    \ inquiry are as follows:\n(1) Application: A range of AI technologies run \n\
    through the whole process of agricultural production \nand are applied to all\
    \ aspects of the production process. \nIn contrast, compared with the application\
    \ of AI in \nagriculture, the application of DT in agriculture appears \nto be\
    \ stretched.\n(2) Challenges: There is still a lot of work that can \nbe done\
    \ to improve the field of agricultural artificial \nintelligence, especially in\
    \ terms of computing power \nimprovement, large-scale implementation, and multifield\
    \ \nintegration. Due to the specificity and complexity of \nagricultural production,\
    \ the challenges faced by digital \ntwin technology in this application are greater\
    \ than those \nin any other industry, and it will take time to achieve a real\
    \ \nbreakthrough in all aspects.\n(3) Future development: The research on digital\
    \ twin \ntechnology in agriculture is still in its infancy, and there \nare still\
    \ many problems that need to be solved urgently. In \nthe era of big data, the\
    \ origins and development of artificial \nintelligence and digital twin cannot\
    \ be separated from the \ndatabase, so their development should be complementary\
    \ \nto each other.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the National Natural\

    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\

    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\

    Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the\
    \ VF\nsystem, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach\
    \ the trees in the\nmiddle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees\
    \ should be kept in a place\nwhere they get enough sunlight at the beginning of\
    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\
    \ an effective and cost-effective method of minimizing\nwater waste and human\
    \ labor. Additionally, [62] addressed an integrated device built on\nan Android\
    \ application that controls and tests the water pump and water level in smart\n\

    \ The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,\nagriculture, manufacturing,\

    \ are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary\nmaintenance\
    \ [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an\n\
    important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98],\
    \ the\nauthors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s\
    \ health\nconditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore,\
    \ users can easily\ntrack the component health condition using an android application\
    \ in SF.\n3.3.2. Gyroscope Sensor\nA gyroscope is a system that uses the theory\
    \ of conservation of angular momentum\nto determine or retain orientation. Nowadays,\
    \ gyroscope sensors are used in a variety of\nareas, including science ﬁction\
    \ and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a\ngyroscope sensors\
    \ application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an\nandroid\
    \ phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart\
    \ VF\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n14 of 40\ndifﬁcult to implement in terms of\
    \ requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a\nsignal.\n3.3.3. Light\
    \ Sensor\nThe term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using\
    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\
    \ an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped,\
    \ quadrotor\nUAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application\
    \ to detect\nheight, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main\
    \ advantage of such sensors\nin SF is that they are stable, perform well, have\
    \ small defects, are easy to adapt to new\ntechnology, and they have a simple\
    \ operation.\nFigure 11 shows the smartphone applications in agriculture and the\

    4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming\nWith the development of technology and knowledge-science,\
    \ human thought-\nconsciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing.\
    \ The revolutionary\ndevelopment of life and human thought in the world over the\
    \ last few decades is far more\nexemplary than the changes in the previous few\
    \ centuries. The transformation of the\nagricultural sector, like all other sectors,\
    \ is much more pronounced. Information-driven\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n19\
    \ of 40\nadvances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the\
    \ improvement of the IoT\nand may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come\
    \ of farming [146–148]. All modern\nmethods are now being followed to ensure more\
    \ production on less land to meet the needs\nof the age, for example, IoT technology\
    \ in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT\na very modern technology\
    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\
    \ framework consists\nof six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network\
    \ layer, middleware layer,\nservice layer, analytics layer, and user experience\
    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\
    \ system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget\n\
    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\
    \ using a 2FA mechanism. It starts\nwith the device module’s controller demanding\
    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\
    \ access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst\nauthentication\
    \ order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.\n\
    The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation\
    \ to\nthe customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before\
    \ the farming\nmodule can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order\
    \ if approved, at which\npoint TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before\
    \ the controller explicitly stops\nit. If the customer fails to authenticate,\
    \ the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics\nmodule controller is informed\
    \ of the request’s denial.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n28 of 40\nElectronics\

    \ of Urban Farming\nThe study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility\
    \ of USVF contributes more\nin terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air\
    \ and fresh food without using artiﬁcial\nfertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated\
    \ USVF totally brings new technology to produce\nmore food using less water, without\
    \ soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],\nthe authors reviewed\
    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\
    80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient\
    \ light\nfacility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ fresh food, easy to\nmonitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater\
    \ part of the respondents was eager\nto purchase agricultural items. The study\
    \ also reported in [199] presented a lack of food\ninsecurity produced from VF\
    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO) based\nin [107,108].\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original draft preparation,\

    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to connect to the Internet\
    \ more than 75 billion devices\nin 2025 [1]. Such devices are used in a wide variety\
    \ of ﬁelds, like agriculture [2], industry [3–5],\nor environmental monitoring\
    \ [6]. However, IoT still faces some challenges, especially regarding\nsecurity\
    \ [7,8], which result in a slowdown for its widespread adoption.\nUnmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicles (UAVs) have an enormous potential for enabling novel IoT applications\n\
    thanks to their low maintenance cost, high mobility and high maneuverability [9].\
    \ Due to such\ncharacteristics, UAVs have been really useful in a number of ﬁelds\
    \ and applications, like remote\nsensing, real-time monitoring, disaster management,\
    \ border and crowd surveillance, military\napplications, delivery of goods, or\
    \ precision agriculture [10,11]. The use of UAVs has been also\nsuggested for\
    \ providing services in a number of industrial applications, like critical infrastructure\n\
    inspections [12–16], sensor monitoring [17,18], automatic cargo transport [19,20],\
    \ or logistics\noptimization of UAV swarms [21]. In the case of UAVs that operate\
    \ in industrial environments,\nthey require certain characteristics that may differ\
    \ substantially from other applications [22].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144; doi:10.3390/rs11182144\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n2 of 29\nFor\
    \ instance, UAV maneuvering in such environments needs to consider the presence\
    \ of workers,\nmobile vehicles, robots, and heavy-duty tools in order to avoid\
    \ collisions.\nMost of the previously mentioned IoT applications require operating\
    \ without pilot intervention,\nso there is a growing interest in the development\
    \ of techniques that enable UAV autonomous flights.\nAmong the different computational\
    \ techniques that can be used to detect obstacles and to avoid collisions,\nDeep\
    \ Learning (DL) techniques have arisen as a promising alternative that when applied\
    \ to UAVs, derive\ninto the concept of Deep Learning-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (DL-UAVs). The main advantage of the\napplication of DL to UAVs is the ability\
    \ to recognize complex patterns from the raw input data captured\nby the sensors\
    \ incorporated in the UAV, learning proper hierarchical representations of the\
    \ underlying\ninformation at different levels.\nThis article analyzes the latest\
    \ developments on DL-UAV systems and includes the following\nmain contributions.\n\
    •\nThe most relevant DL techniques for autonomous collision avoidance are reviewed,\
    \ as well as\ntheir application to UAV systems.\n•\nThe latest DL datasets that\
    \ can be used for testing collision avoidance techniques on DL-UAV\nsystems are\
    \ described.\n•\nThe hardware and communications architecture of the most recent\
    \ DL-UAVs are thoroughly\ndetailed in order to allow future researchers to design\
    \ their own systems.\n•\nThe main open challenges and current technical limitations\
    \ are enumerated.\nIt must be noted that in this article the term UAV system is\
    \ used, as it has been commonly used\nin the literature for years to name unmanned\
    \ aerial systems. However, most reputable international\norganizations (e.g.,\
    \ EUROCONTROL, EASA, FAA, and DoD) have adopted Unmanned Aerial System\n(UAS)\
    \ as the correct ofﬁcial term for a system that consists of a ground control station,\
    \ communication\ntransceivers and an aircraft.\nThe rest of this article is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work. Section 3\nanalyzes the use\
    \ of DL techniques and datasets for autonomous collision avoidance, emphasizing\
    \ their\napplication to UAVs. Section 4 reviews the hardware of the most relevant\
    \ DL-UAV developments and\ntheir communications architecture, as well as their\
    \ main subsystems. Finally, Section 5 enumerates\ncurrently open challenges, and\
    \ Section 6 is devoted to the conclusions.\n2. Related Work\nAutonomy in a UAV\
    \ can be deﬁned as the capability for being self-guided without human\nintervention\
    \ [23]. According to the UAV autonomy levels indicated in the work by the authors\
    \ of [23],\nthe most basic level requires the UAV to be guided with a remote control,\
    \ whereas the maximum\nlevel involves performing a complex mission with human\
    \ level decision-making without external\nintervention. In the case of this review,\
    \ intermediate autonomy level approaches are analyzed, in\nwhich the UAV should\
    \ be able to perform path-planning and detect existing obstacles in order to avoid\n\
    collisions during navigation.\nDepending on the degree of autonomous navigation\
    \ and on the UAV application, certain problems\nmay arise. For example, in the\
    \ case of following a fixed path, if the UAV deviates from it to avoid a\ncollision,\
    \ it would be desirable to know its position during all the navigation to return\
    \ to such a path.\nIn an outdoor environment, this issue can be solved in a relatively\
    \ easy way just by making use of a Global\nPositioning System (GPS), but in indoor\
    \ scenarios visual odometry techniques should be added [24].\nIn addition, if\
    \ the existing obstacles move throughout the scenario, object detection algorithms\
    \ should be\nincorporated to the system in order to estimate their next position,\
    \ thus anticipating potential collisions.\nCollision avoidance classical approaches\
    \ make use of techniques like Simultaneous Localization and\nMapping (SLAM) [25,26]\
    \ and Structure from Motion (SfM) [27] to generate or update a map that represents\n\
    the visual geometry of the environment, which allows for inferring obstacles and\
    \ traversable spaces.\nThese techniques use data captured by sensors like RGB-D\
    \ cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n\
    3 of 29\nsensors, or Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) sensors, either individually\
    \ [28] or by fusing several\nof them [29]. However, it must be considered that\
    \ the mentioned sensors can be expensive and still present\nsome limitations (e.g.,\
    \ a LIDAR can suffer from mirror reflections, whereas a GPS does not work properly\n\
    indoors). Alternatively, computer vision methods can be used, which involve tasks\
    \ such as optical flow\nor depth estimation from the data captured by monocular\
    \ and stereo cameras [30,31]. Such computer\nvision techniques require using software\
    \ algorithms and a single camera, which is a considerably cheaper\noption than\
    \ the previously mentioned sensors. Nonetheless, further research is needed regarding\
    \ this\nlatter alternative, as it requires more computational resources.\nIn the\
    \ literature, there are some surveys and reviews of methods for obstacle detection\
    \ and\ncollision avoidance in different application domains. For instance, the\
    \ authors of [32] provide a\nsystematic review of sensors and vision-based techniques\
    \ for vehicle detection and tracking for\ncollision avoidance systems on the speciﬁc\
    \ context of on-road driving. Another interesting review\ncan be found in [33],\
    \ where the authors focus on space robotics and identify the major challenges\
    \ in\ncollision-free trajectory planning for manipulators mounted on large orbital\
    \ structures, small satellites,\nand space robots that navigate in proximity to\
    \ large orbital structures. Other authors have reviewed the\nmain techniques for\
    \ improving the autonomy of unnamed surface vehicles with regard to navigation,\n\
    guidance, control and motion planning with respect to the international regulations\
    \ for avoiding\ncollisions at sea [34].\nIn the speciﬁc context of UAV navigation,\
    \ the authors of [31] reviewed vision-based techniques\nfor positioning and mapping,\
    \ obstacle avoidance, and path planning. Regarding the use of DL\ntechniques for\
    \ robotic solutions, in the work by the authors of [35], a survey is presented\
    \ on the use\nof DL techniques for robotic perception, robotic control and exploration,\
    \ and robotic navigation and\nautonomous driving.\nRegarding the application of\
    \ UAVs with attached sensors (i.e., UASs) to remote sensing\napplications, note\
    \ that the latest advances have allowed for monitoring environmental processes\n\
    and changes produced at spatial and temporal scales that would be difﬁcult or\
    \ impossible to detect\nby means of conventional remote sensing platforms [36].\
    \ Moreover, the characteristics of small UAS\nand their impact in the context\
    \ of remote sensing models have been studied in the literature [37],\nidentifying\
    \ novel remote sensing capabilities as well as the challenges that this type of\
    \ platforms entails.\nIn particular, the affordability and potential for ubiquitous\
    \ operation of small UASs enable advances\nin the type and quality of information\
    \ that can be collected, and therefore in the applications that\ncan be addressed\
    \ by this type of remote sensing systems [37]. The main capabilities that small\
    \ UASs\ncan provide to remote sensing are dependent on their operation without\
    \ direct human supervision,\ninvolving autonomous deployment, data collection,\
    \ landing and data transfer [37]. In this regard, it is\nworth mentioning the\
    \ work detailed in the work by the authors of [36], which provides a review on\
    \ the\nrecent progress made in remote sensing for small UASs in different ﬁelds\
    \ that involve photogrammetry,\nmultispectral and hyperspectral imaging, and synthetic\
    \ aperture radars and LIDARs. Additionally,\nin [38], the authors present a review\
    \ on remote sensing tasks that involve data acquired by UAVs.\nSuch a review focuses\
    \ on solutions that speciﬁcally address issues derived from the speciﬁc nature\n\
    of the collected data (e.g., ultra-high resolution, geometric, and spectral data,\
    \ or the fusion of data\nfrom multisensor acquisition). In this regard, it is\
    \ worth mentioning that remote sensing systems that\nuse data acquired by UAVs\
    \ may involve four types of resolutions: spatial, spectral, radiometric, and\n\
    temporal [37]. In the case of DL-UAV systems, in this article, only spatial resolution\
    \ was considered.\nThere are only a few recent articles on the use of DL methods\
    \ for UAVs. For instance, in the\nwork by the authors of [39], the current literature\
    \ is systematically reviewed according to a taxonomy\nthat includes different\
    \ abstraction levels related to perception, guidance, navigation, and control.\n\
    Other authors focused only on solving speciﬁc problems (e.g., counting cars in\
    \ UAV images [40])\nor on improving speciﬁc algorithms [41,42]. Nevertheless,\
    \ most of the current literature cannot be\nconsidered IoT-enabled, and, to the\
    \ best of our knowledge, there are no articles that review the whole\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2019, 11, 2144\n4 of 29\nDL-UAV architecture while focusing on the problem of\
    \ autonomous obstacle detection and collision\navoidance.\n3. Deep Learning in\
    \ the Context of Autonomous Collision Avoidance\nDuring the last decade, DL has\
    \ demonstrated to be an excellent technique in the area of artiﬁcial\nintelligence,\
    \ solving different problems, and even surpassing humans in some cases [43,44].\
    \ In addition,\nDL yields good results in diverse areas like image recognition\
    \ [45], medical imaging [46], or speech\nrecognition [47].\nClassic Machine Learning\
    \ (ML) approaches require designing feature extraction methods in\norder to generate\
    \ a descriptor (i.e., a feature vector that emphasizes the pattern to detect and\
    \ that is\nusually more compact than the raw data). The descriptor feeds a learning\
    \ algorithm that performs a\nspeciﬁc task, such as a classiﬁcation or a regression\
    \ of the input data. In contrast to such an approach,\nDL methods are able to\
    \ perform both tasks (the representation of the data and the classiﬁcation) at\
    \ the\nsame time just by feeding the network with raw data [43]. Moreover, DL\
    \ techniques excel when learning\ndata representations from raw sensor data acquired\
    \ by robotic solutions in real environments [39].\nIn the speciﬁc context of autonomous\
    \ collision avoidance, DL techniques have shown their effectiveness\nwhen solving\
    \ a wide variety of robotic tasks in areas like perception, planning, positioning,\
    \ and\ncontrol [35], which involve learning complex behaviors.\nAmong the DL techniques\
    \ for collision avoidance there are end-to-end approaches that map\ndirectly the\
    \ raw sensor data captured by the robotic system into a set of possible actions\
    \ [48–50].\nSuch approaches are based on learning the behavior of an expert pilot\
    \ at a given scenario in a\nreal-world environment. There are other DL techniques\
    \ whose execution requires several stages that\ninvolve intermediate representations\
    \ (e.g., depth maps) that estimate the distance to potential obstacles,\nthe UAV\
    \ pose or its odometry in order to recalculate the path to reach a goal position.\
    \ These DL\napproaches usually include a module for situational awareness that\
    \ generates a set of feature maps\nrelated to the state of the robotic system\
    \ and its surroundings, and then such computed feature maps\nfeed up a second\
    \ module for the decision-making process. Therefore, the combination of the mentioned\n\
    two modules make up a complex network that takes raw sensor data as input and\
    \ generates the motion\ncontrol commands for the robotic system [48,51–55].\n\
    Regarding the learning paradigm, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms [56] have\
    \ been widely\nused in robotic systems. The essential idea in deep RL methods\
    \ is that an agent extracts feedback from\nthe interaction with real or simulated\
    \ environments. Thus, given a speciﬁc state and based on previous\nexperience,\
    \ the agent can infer which action maximizes a predeﬁned goal. Several approaches\
    \ use RL\nmethods in order to learn effective collision avoidance policies that\
    \ require experience on successful\ntrajectories as well as on undesirable events\
    \ like collisions [51,53,54,57–59]. This use of simulated\nenvironments allows\
    \ for collecting a large amount of data in an easy way. Speciﬁcally, AirSim [60]\n\
    enables navigating freely with a car or a drone through different virtual scenarios,\
    \ providing the raw\ninformation of different sensors (e.g., RGB cameras and depth\
    \ cameras), which are synchronized with\nthe six Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of the\
    \ vehicle and the segmentation maps. Other approaches use\nsupervised learning\
    \ algorithms that are based on learning through examples. Such examples consist\n\
    of a representation of the environment provided by the raw sensor data and the\
    \ actions taken by an\nexpert in the same conditions. The learning process returns\
    \ the policy that best imitates the action of\nthe experts according to the given\
    \ examples [49,50,52,55]. A limiting factor of the previous supervised\napproaches\
    \ is the need for large amounts of data to train models with generalization capabilities\
    \ in\ndifferent real-world environments. This necessity involves human experts\
    \ during the collection and\nannotation of the data. In order to minimize human\
    \ effort, self-supervised algorithms automate the\ncollection and annotation processes\
    \ to generate large scale datasets [48,49].\nIn addition to the mentioned learning\
    \ techniques, transfer learning [61] allows for starting from a\nmodel previously\
    \ trained with related data. Such a model is further trained for a speciﬁc application\n\
    domain, thus reducing the total amount of data needed for training. For example,\
    \ the policies\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n5 of 29\nlearned from data collected\
    \ by cars and bicycles can be applied to a UAV for autonomous ﬂights [62].\nSuch\
    \ navigation policies are generic, despite having been trained from the viewpoint\
    \ of urban vehicles.\nTransfer learning from models trained on virtual worlds,\
    \ but applied to real data, have also been\nstudied in the literature [59,63–65].\n\
    There are different DL architectures.\nOn the one hand, a Convolutional Neural\
    \ Network\n(CNN) is a type of hierarchical architecture for feature extraction\
    \ that allows for generating a\nset of high-dimensional feature maps from the\
    \ raw sensor data acquired for the robotic system.\nThus, CNN-based models [45]\
    \ are widely used in the context of collision avoidance, especially in the\nstages\
    \ related to environment perception or to depth estimation [52]. On the other\
    \ hand, in the context\nof continuous autonomous ﬂights, the use of temporary\
    \ information becomes relevant. Considering\nthat the information extracted from\
    \ the sensors at each observation is related to a partial representation\nof the\
    \ environment surrounding the robotic system, the possibility of storing and tracking\
    \ all the\nrelevant information obtained in the past allows for getting a more\
    \ complete representation of the\nenvironment. For such a purpose, the use of\
    \ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures [66]\nprovides the ability to learn\
    \ temporal dependencies from the information of an arbitrarily long\nsequence\
    \ of observations. Therefore, there are RNN-based approaches that allow for keeping\
    \ track\nof past observations such as the depth maps obtained from RGB images\
    \ [53], poses, or recently\navoided obstacles. In addition, the incorporation\
    \ of Temporal Attention [67] allows for evaluating the\ninformation given by each\
    \ observation of a sequence, and it can be used by weighting each of the recent\n\
    observations based on its importance in decision-making. Such a technique increases\
    \ training speed\nand provides a better generalization over the training dataset.\
    \ A type of RNN is Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) [68], which is capable of learning\
    \ long-term dependencies with the ability of removing\nold information or by adding\
    \ new information at any point, thus allowing the use of all the relevant\npast\
    \ information.\n3.1. On the Application of DL to UAVs\nTable 1 summarizes the\
    \ main characteristics of the approaches that enable UAVs for autonomous\nﬂight\
    \ through the use of DL techniques. All the methods mentioned in the Table feed\
    \ DL networks\nwith RGB images whose resolution ranges from 360 p to 720 p.\n\
    Depending on their ﬁnal goal, it can be distinguished among three types of methods.\n\
    Some methods learn to navigate from raw images, indicating the next movement of\
    \ the UAV, thus being\nable to navigate avoiding obstacles [49,59,62,69]. Other\
    \ authors proposed speciﬁc solutions for\ncertain applications that involve following\
    \ a trail or a gate [55,70]. However, such methods do\nnot include a collision\
    \ avoidance module. There are also other methods that generate an obstacle map,\n\
    which represents the probability of collision on the scene or the distance to\
    \ nearby obstacles [53].\nIt is important to note that none of the compared systems\
    \ make use of depth maps extracted\ndirectly from stereo or depth cameras. However,\
    \ some try to estimate depth maps from just one single\nRGB camera [53]. The combination\
    \ of depth maps provided by a hardware sensor with RGB images\nthat feed a DL\
    \ architecture is an interesting approach that has not been described so far in\
    \ the literature.\nRegarding the application scenario, the most relevant solutions\
    \ of Table 1 are focused on\nunstructured outdoor environments such as forests,\
    \ which enable applications like search and rescue,\nwilderness monitoring, target\
    \ tracking, exploration, or environmental mapping. For instance, in [55],\nthe\
    \ authors describe a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) for autonomous low-ﬂying that\
    \ follows a artiﬁcial\ntrail. This approach is based on a Deep Neural Network\
    \ (DNN) architecture for trail detection that\nuses transfer learning to estimate\
    \ the view orientation and the lateral offset of the MAV with respect\nto the\
    \ center of the trail. Another proposal in forest environments is presented in\
    \ the work by the\nauthors of [71], which uses a pretrained AlexNet [45] for tree\
    \ detection and for the prediction of the\ndirection for collision avoidance.\
    \ Other outdoor UAV solutions are trained for urban spaces, such as\nCNN-based\
    \ models that detect all the potential obstacles [72] or that control a UAV through\
    \ the streets\nof a city environment [62].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n6 of\

    \ that enable\ndata automatic annotation. Then, a local motion planning policy\
    \ translates the distance predictions to a\nsingle control command that modulates\
    \ the yaw and forward linear velocity to guide the UAV towards\nthe direction\
    \ for which the longest navigable space is predicted within the current FoV. Another\n\
    custom dataset is created to train the end-to-end approach proposed by Gandhi\
    \ et al. [49]. Such a work,\nin contrast to other datasets related to collision\
    \ avoidance, uses a UAV crash dataset in order to collect\nthe different ways\
    \ in which a UAV can crash. This negative ﬂying data is used in conjunction with\
    \ the\nequivalent positive data sampled from the same trajectories to learn a\
    \ robust policy for UAV navigation.\nThis CNN-based approach uses, in particular,\
    \ an AlexNet architecture [45] that is initialized with\npretrained weights. Self-supervised\
    \ learning is used to predict the probability to move in a certain\ndirection.\
    \ Then, the decision to turn the UAV to the left or to the right while moving\
    \ forward is\ntaken according to the conﬁdence of the CNN predictions. Another\
    \ custom dataset was created to\ntrain the system proposed in the work by the\
    \ authors of [50], which focuses on enabling autonomous\nnavigation in indoor\
    \ corridors by means of the DenseNet-161 architecture [74] with pretrained weights.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n7 of 29\nThe dataset is composed by images at several\
    \ positions from corridors with different lengths captured\nby means of a front-facing\
    \ camera attached to a quadcopter and the corresponding ground-truth values\n\
    in terms of in-ﬂight commands. The model is trained over the custom dataset using\
    \ supervised learning\nto predict the probability of different classes that decide\
    \ whether to move forward, shift left/right,\nor stop. Sadeghi et al. [59] explore\
    \ the possibility of performing collision-free indoor ﬂights in the real\nworld\
    \ by only training with data generated in a simulated environment. Such an approach\
    \ combines\nCNN networks to process the raw input data with RL without requiring\
    \ any human demonstration\ndata or real images during training. Singla et al.\
    \ [53] proposed a two-way method for UAV navigation\nthat avoids stationary and\
    \ mobile obstacles. The proposed method involves intermediate depth\nestimations\
    \ and a RNN-base method with RL that incorporates Temporal Attention [67] to integrate\n\
    the relevant data gathered over time.\nAmong the most popular e-sports, drone\
    \ racing has recently gained a lot of popularity, giving rise to\nthe call for\
    \ challenges to promote the development of this field, such as the autonomous\
    \ drone racing\ncompetitions celebrated during IROS conference. These competitions\
    \ motivated the development of UAV\nsystems that make use of DL techniques. For\
    \ example, in [70], the authors consider the nature of the\ncompetitions, which\
    \ involve moving as fast as possible through a series of gates. Thus, the researchers\n\
    devised a real-time gate detection network that is complemented with a guidance\
    \ algorithm.\n3.2. Datasets\nThe previously mentioned DL techniques provide effective\
    \ solutions that extract hierarchical\nabstractions from large amounts of data\
    \ through the training stages. There are several publicly\navailable large-scale\
    \ datasets that include labeled data acquired from real or simulated environments\n\
    in challenging conditions:\n•\nKITTI online benchmark [75] is a widely-used outdoor\
    \ dataset that contains stereo gray and color\nvideo, 3D LIDAR, inertial, and\
    \ GPS navigation data for depth estimation, depth completion or\nodometry estimation.\n\
    •\nIDSIA forest trail dataset [76] includes footage of hikes recorded by three\
    \ cameras to predict view\norientation (left/center/right) throughout a large\
    \ variety of trails.\n•\nUdacity [62] provides over 70,000 images of car driving\
    \ distributed over six experiments, which\ninclude timestamped images from three\
    \ cameras (left, central, right) and the data from different\nsensors (e.g., an\
    \ IMU, GPS, gear, brake, throttle, steering angles, and speed).\n•\nUAV crash\
    \ dataset [49] focuses on representing the different ways in which a UAV can crash.\n\
    It contains 11,500 trajectories of collisions in 20 diverse indoor environments\
    \ collected over\n40 ﬂying hours.\n•\nOxford RobotCar Dataset [77] provides data\
    \ of six cameras, LIDAR, GPS, and inertial navigation\ncaptured from 100 repetitions\
    \ of a consistent route over a period of over a year. This dataset\ncaptures many\
    \ different combinations of weather, trafﬁc, and pedestrians, along with longer\
    \ term\nchanges such as construction and roadworks.\n•\nSYNTHIA [78] is a synthetic\
    \ dataset in the context of driving scenarios that consists of a collection\n\
    of photo-realistic frames rendered from a virtual city including diverse scenes,\
    \ variety of dynamic\nobjects like cars, pedestrians and cyclists, different lighting\
    \ conditions and weather. The sensors\ninvolved in the dataset include eight RGB\
    \ cameras that conform a binocular 360o camera and\neight depth sensors.\n•\n\
    AirSIM [60] is a simulation environment that allows for simulating UAV trajectories\
    \ in different\nscenarios and conditions that produce raw images, depth maps and\
    \ the data that represent the\nUAV trajectories.\nIn addition to the data speciﬁcally\
    \ gathered to generate a training dataset, techniques of data\naugmentation are\
    \ frequently used to obtain more representative data that cover different conditions\n\
    in order to train models with high generalization capabilities. Methods for data\
    \ augmentation\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n8 of 29\nusually include left–right\
    \ ﬂips, random horizontal ﬂips, random crops, or variations in scale,\ncontrast,\
    \ brightness, saturation, sharpness, rotation, and jitter with random permutations\
    \ of these\ntransformations [55,79].\n4. DL-UAV Hardware and Communications Architecture\n\
    The underlying DL-UAV hardware and its communications architecture are essential\
    \ for the\nsuccess of the system, as they provide the support for implementing\
    \ DL techniques and advanced\nfeatures. Speciﬁcally, the use of a DL approach\
    \ for autonomous obstacle detection and collision\navoidance imposes UAV hardware\
    \ and communications design restrictions (e.g., a high computational\ncost) that\
    \ should be carefully addressed. This section reviews the latest DL-UAV communication\n\
    architectures, detailing the main components of the different subsystems and analyzing\
    \ the most\ncommon hardware used for developing such subsystems.\n4.1. Typical\
    \ Deep Learning UAV System Architecture\nFigure 1 shows the typical cloud-based\
    \ communications architecture for DL-UAV systems.\nSuch an architecture is divided\
    \ into three main layers:\n•\nThe layer at the bottom is the UAV layer, which\
    \ includes the aerial vehicles and their subsystems:\n–\nPropeller subsystem:\
    \ it controls the UAV propellers through the motors that actuate on them.\n–\n\
    Main control subsystem and ﬂight control subsystem: it is responsible for coordinating\
    \ the\nactions of the other subsystems and for collecting the data sent by them.\
    \ In some cases,\nit delegates the maneuvering tasks on a ﬂight controller that\
    \ receives data from different\nsensors and then acts on the propeller subsystem.\n\
    –\nSensing and Actuation subsystem: it makes use of sensors to estimate diverse\
    \ physical\nparameters of the environment and then actuates according to the instructions\
    \ given by the\non-board controllers.\n–\nPositioning subsystem: it is able to\
    \ position the UAV outdoors (e.g., through GPS) or indoors\n(e.g., by using reference\
    \ markers).\n–\nCommunications subsystem:\nit allows for exchanging information\
    \ wirelessly with\nremote stations.\n–\nPower subsystem: it provides energy and\
    \ voltage regulation to the diverse electronic\ncomponents of the UAV.\n–\nStorage\
    \ subsystem: it stores the data collected by the different subsystems. For instance,\
    \ it is\noften used for storing the video stream recorded by an on-board camera.\n\
    –\nIdentiﬁcation subsystem: it is able to identify remotely other UAVs, objects,\
    \ and obstacles.\nThe most common identiﬁcation subsystems are based on image/video\
    \ processing,\nbut wireless communications systems can also be used.\n–\nDeep\
    \ Learning subsystem: it implements deep learning techniques to process the collected\n\
    data and then determine the appropriate response from the UAV in terms of maneuvering.\n\
    •\nThe data sent by every UAV are sent to either a remote control ground station\
    \ or to a UAV\npilot that makes use of a manual controller. The former case is\
    \ related to autonomous guiding\nand collision-avoidance systems, and often involves\
    \ the use of high-performance computers\nable to collect, process, and respond\
    \ in real-time to the information gathered from the UAV.\nThus, such high-performance\
    \ computers run different data collection and processing services,\nalgorithms\
    \ that make use of deep learning techniques, and a subsystem that is responsible\
    \ for\nsending control commands to the UAVs.\n•\nAt the top of the architecture\
    \ is the remote service layer, which is essentially a cloud composed by\nmultiple\
    \ remote servers that store data and carry out the most computationally-intensive\
    \ data\nprocessing tasks that do not require real-time responses (e.g., certain\
    \ data analysis). It is also\nusual to provide through the cloud some kind of\
    \ front-end so that remote users can manage the\nDL-UAV system in a user-friendly\
    \ way.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n9 of 29\nHigh-Performance Computer\nGround\

    \ cloud-based deep learning UAV-based communications architecture.\n4.2. Advanced\
    \ UAV Architectures\nIn the last years, UAV IoT architectures evolved towards\
    \ more sophisticated architectures that\nessentially attempt to avoid the reliance\
    \ on a remote cloud. This is due to the fact that a cloud may\nnot scale properly,\
    \ and thus it may constitute a bottleneck when a signiﬁcant number of UAVs or\n\
    IoT devices exchange communications with it [80]. In addition, cyberattacks may\
    \ compromise the\navailability of the cloud servers, therefore preventing the\
    \ UAV system from working properly.\nDue to the previously mentioned reason, UAV\
    \ architectures evolved toward IoT edge computing\narchitectures, which allow\
    \ unburdening the cloud from part of its tasks through the use of devices\non\
    \ the edge of a network (i.e., in the limit between the last network routing devices\
    \ and the\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n10 of 29\nsensing/actuation devices that\
    \ act on the physical world). There are basically two variants of edge\ncomputing\
    \ that are commonly applied to UAV applications, depicted in Figure 2:\nRemote\

    \ 2. Advanced DL-UAV communications architecture.\n•\nFog Computing: It is based\
    \ on the deployment of medium-performance gateways (known as\nfog gateways) that\
    \ are placed locally (close to a UAV ground station). It is usual to make use\
    \ of\nSingle-Board Computers (SBCs), like Raspberry Pi [81], Beagle Bone [82],\
    \ or Orange Pi PC [83],\nto implement such fog gateways. Despite its hardware,\
    \ fog gateways are able to provide fast\nresponses to the UAV, thus avoiding the\
    \ communications with the cloud. It is also worth noting\nthat fog gateways can\
    \ collaborate among themselves and collect data from sensors deployed on\nthe\
    \ ﬁeld, which can help to decide on the maneuver commands to be sent to the UAVs\
    \ in order to\ndetect obstacles and prevent collisions.\n•\nCloudlets. They are\
    \ based on high-performance computers (i.e., powerful CPUs and GPUs) that\ncarry\
    \ out computationally intensive tasks that require real-time or quasi real-time\
    \ responses [84].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n11 of 29\nLike fog gateways, cloudlets\
    \ are deployed close to the ground station (they may even be part of\nthe ground\
    \ station hardware), so that the response lag is clearly lower than the one that\
    \ would be\nprovided by a remote Internet cloud.\nFigure 2 also includes in the\
    \ Remote Service Layer the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies\n(DLTs) like\
    \ blockchain, which have been previously applied to multiple IoT applications\
    \ [85–87],\nincluding UAV systems [88]. In the ﬁeld of UAV, the main advantage\
    \ of blockchain and similar DLTs\nis that they are able to provide information\
    \ redundancy, data security, and trustworthiness to the\npotential applications\
    \ [89]. In addition, a blockchain can execute smart contracts, which translate\n\
    legal terms into code that can be run autonomously [90], and therefore can automate\
    \ certain tasks\ndepending on the detection of certain events.\n4.3. Hardware\
    \ for Collision Avoidance and Obstacle Detection Deep Learning UAV Systems\nIn\
    \ the literature, diverse researchers have addressed the problem of what hardware\
    \ may be used\nby a UAV to prevent collisions and detect obstacles when harnessing\
    \ the outputs of deep learning\nsystems. Table 2 summarizes the features of the\
    \ most relevant previous DL-UAV systems that deal\nwith such a topic, including\
    \ the hardware used for building their communications architecture and the\nprovided\
    \ DL-based collision-avoidance and obstacle-detection functionality.\nAs seen\
    \ in Table 2, most UAVs are commercial platforms. In fact, the majority are manufactured\n\
    by Parrot due to their easy-to-use developer APIs [91], which allow for monitoring\
    \ and controlling\nremotely the UAVs. There are also in the list a couple of self-assembled\
    \ drones, which need an\nadditional effort from the researchers during the assembly\
    \ and validation of the UAV, but that enable\ncustomizing it with speciﬁc sensors,\
    \ powerful controllers and extended batteries that increase the type\nand number\
    \ of tests that can be carried out.\nThe following subsections analyze the characteristics\
    \ of the subsystems of the UAVs listed in\nTable 2 and detail some of the most\
    \ popular alternatives for implementing each subsystem.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11,\

    \ and Flight Time\nThe UAV platforms listed in Table 2 can be considered light,\
    \ with an average weight of roughly\n400 g. Nonetheless, extremely light platforms\
    \ like Crazyﬂie have also been used for developing\nMicro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV)\
    \ applications. In contrast, relatively heavy platforms like DJI Matrice\n100,\
    \ which weights ~2.4 Kg, are able to move heavier payloads (more than 1 Kg). In\
    \ fact, most of the\ncommercial drones on the list have not been designed to transport\
    \ additional payloads, but some of\nthem, like Parrot’s AR.Drone 2.0, thanks to\
    \ their powerful propellers, are able to carry up to 500 g.\nRegarding ﬂight time,\
    \ it is related to their weight and maximum payload: the higher the weight,\n\
    the larger the carried batteries, so the longer the ﬂight time. Moreover, it is\
    \ worth pointing out that\nsome UAVs have optional batteries and modules that\
    \ are able to double (e.g., in the case of DJI Matrice\n100) or triple (e.g.,\
    \ with the AR.Drone 2.0 Power Edition) the original battery life.\n4.3.2. Propeller\
    \ Subsystem\nUAVs are usually conceived for ﬂying indoors and/or outdoors, what\
    \ inﬂuences signiﬁcantly\ntheir ﬂight capabilities. In any case, the selected\
    \ hardware must provide a good trade-off among\ncost, payload capacity and reliability.\
    \ All the UAVs listed in Table 2 are multirotor UAVs (speciﬁcally,\nquadrotors),\
    \ which offer good reliability and may minimize vibration during operation (this\
    \ is useful\nfor collecting stabilized images and videos from a DL-UAV), but it\
    \ is also more expensive and heavier\nthan alternatives like single-rotor UAVs.\
    \ In contrast, single-rotor UAVs beneﬁt from slower spinning\nspeeds and less\
    \ power consumption, which is key for some applications where an extended ﬂight\
    \ time\nor heavy payload transport are necessary.\n4.3.3. Control Subsystem\n\
    The controller hardware has greater power in comparison to the traditional IoT\
    \ node hardware.\nThe majority of the hardware can be considered powerful and\
    \ low-power; it is the typical hardware\nused for mobile device platforms. Most\
    \ controllers run on ARM devices (e.g., ARM Cortex-M4,\nARM Cortex A8, ARM9, or\
    \ ARM A57 Complex in the case of the NVIDIA Jetson TX2), which\ncurrently provide\
    \ the best trade-off for mobile computing devices in terms of power consumption\n\
    and performance by including 32/64-bit architectures, fast multicore processors,\
    \ dedicated GPUs and\nsupport for managing several gigabytes of RAM. In fact,\
    \ some of the listed UAVs are so powerful that\nthey actually run certain versions\
    \ of the Linux operating system.\nIt is important to note that some UAVs distinguish\
    \ between the hardware used for controlling the\nﬂight and the one that interacts\
    \ with the other subsystems. For instance, it is usual in self-assembled\ndrones\
    \ to make use of a PixHawk controller [97] as ﬂight controller, which embeds a\
    \ programmable\nprocessor, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a GPS, and provides\
    \ connectors for radio telemetry\nand control interfaces.\nBoth the main control\
    \ subsystem and the ﬂight controller can make use of different electronic\ndevices.\
    \ The most common are microcontrollers, Application-Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits\
    \ (ASIC), and\nSystem-on-Chips (SOCs), but it is also possible to embed Field-Programmable\
    \ Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or\nCentral Processing Units (CPUs) optimized for mobile\
    \ computing devices (i.e., that provide a good\ntrade-off between performance\
    \ and power consumption).\nHigh-performance microcontrollers are probably the\
    \ most commonly used devices, owing to their\nlow power consumption, their ability\
    \ to be reprogrammed easily, and the fact that they have enough\nprocessing power\
    \ for carrying out the required control tasks. SoCs usually integrate a medium-to-high\n\
    performance microcontroller and multiple peripherals (e.g., wireless transceivers),\
    \ which makes them\nmore appropriate for lightweight systems, but causes them\
    \ to have greater energy consumption that\ntraditional microcontrollers.\nIn the\
    \ case of FPGAs, they are able to provide excellent performance for executing\
    \ certain\ndeterministic demanding tasks and that can be reconﬁgured easily with\
    \ a different design;\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n15 of 29\nbut, unfortunately,\
    \ FPGA design is usually clearly slower (and consequently more expensive) and\n\
    often consumes more energy due to the requirement to power the used logic continuously.\n\
    ASICs provide even higher performance and signiﬁcantly lower power consumption\
    \ that FPGAs\nand other embedded devices thanks to being designed explicitly for\
    \ very speciﬁc applications.\nNonetheless, in ASIC, the development cost is very\
    \ high (in the order of several millions of U.S.\ndollars), so their application\
    \ in DL-UAV systems is limited to already programmed Commercial\nOff-The-Shelf\
    \ (COTS) products.\n4.3.4. Sensing Subsystem\nSensors are essential for UAV maneuvering.\
    \ The most common are Inertial Measurement Units\n(IMUs), which include accelerometers,\
    \ gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Photo and video cameras are\nalso necessary for\
    \ providing feedback to drone pilots and inputs to neural networks.\nPerform control\
    \ tasks and, at the same time, processing the large amount of data that comes\
    \ from\nsensors and cameras is difﬁcult. For instance, there are video cameras\
    \ that can stream up to 60 frames\nper second (fps), but such an amount of video\
    \ data may not be processed in real-time by the on-board\nUAV hardware, so two\
    \ alternatives are often implemented: UAVs either sample frames to reduce the\n\
    input frame rate or they make use of external remote hardware that carries out\
    \ the video processing\ntasks. In practice, only a few UAVs perform the mentioned\
    \ processing on-board in real-time: most\nUAVs delegate such a task to external\
    \ systems, which are usually powerful servers that integrate\nhigh-performance\
    \ graphic cards (the characteristics of some of such servers are indicated in\
    \ the last\ntwo columns of Table 2). In addition, such a powerful hardware is\
    \ often used during the training\nphase of the deep learning networks in order\
    \ to save time.\nIn summary, it can be stated that the most commonly used sensors\
    \ in DL-UAV systems are\nas follows.\n•\nIMUs that embed 3-axis accelerometers,\
    \ gyroscopes and magnetometers.\n•\nHigh-precision pressure sensors (barometers).\n\
    •\nPhoto and video cameras.\n•\n3D-camera systems (e.g., Kinect).\n•\nVideo Graphics\
    \ Array (VGA)/Quarter Video Graphics Array (QVGA) cameras.\n•\nLaser scanners\
    \ (e.g., RP-LIDAR).\n•\nUltrasonic sensors.\nThe reliability and safety of the\
    \ previously mentioned sensors and actuators should be ensured\nto guarantee the\
    \ security of the DL-UAV system. There are just a few examples in the literature\
    \ on\nthis speciﬁc research area. For instance, the authors of [98] designed a\
    \ fault detection and diagnosis\nsystem for a quadrotor under total failures (e.g.,\
    \ loss of a propeller or a motor) or with partial faults\n(e.g., degradation or\
    \ displacement of a component). The obtained numerical results illustrate the\n\
    effectiveness of the proposed method under partial and total rotor faults. Another\
    \ example is presented\nin [99], where the authors propose a hybrid feature model\
    \ and CNN-based fault diagnosis system\nvalidated through ﬂight experiments.\n\
    4.3.5. Positioning Subsystem\nBesides the sensing subsystem, the positioning subsystem\
    \ is probably the most important\nfor autonomous UAV navigation. Outdoors, most\
    \ UAV systems make use of GPS/ Global’naya\nNavigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema\
    \ (GLONASS) in combination with an altimeter based on\nultrasound measurements.\
    \ The most sophisticated UAVs make use of LIDARs and special cameras\nthat measure\
    \ both odometry and speed. Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) transceivers are only used in\
    \ one of\nthe UAV systems listed in Table 2 [92], although they have been previously\
    \ analyzed in the literature\nwhen performing accurate (centimeter-precision)\
    \ distance measurements [100].\nAmong the different available indoor location\
    \ techniques, those based on Received Signal Strength\nIndicator (RSSI) or Received\
    \ Signal Strength (RSS) have proved their accuracy when positioning in\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n16 of 29\nlimited areas [101,102], but their heavily depend\
    \ on characteristics of the scenario (e.g., presence of\nmetallic objects) and\
    \ on the used UAV hardware (e.g., antennas) [103]. There are also positioning\n\
    techniques based on computing the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the received signals\
    \ [104], or their time\nof arrival (through Time of Arrival (ToA) and Time Difference\
    \ of Arrival (TDoA) techniques) [105].\n4.3.6. Communications Subsystem\nThe data\
    \ to/from the different subsystems is transmitted to remote computers by using\
    \ different\nwireless communications technologies. The most common is Wi-Fi (IEEE\
    \ 802.11 standard), which\noperates in unlicensed bands and provides a good trade-off\
    \ among hardware cost, outdoor range\nand speed rate. Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)\
    \ is also often used, but it is usually aimed at providing\nshort-range communications.\n\
    There are also many other communications technologies that can be used by DL-UAVs,\
    \ like\n3G/4G/5G [106,107], ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) [103], Long-Range Wide Area\
    \ Network (LoRaWAN) [108],\nUltra Wide Band (UWB) [109], IEEE 802.11ah [110],\
    \ or Wi-Fi Direct [111]. Table 3 shows a comparison\non the main characteristics\
    \ of the latest communications technologies for DL-UAVs [4], indicating their\n\
    frequency band, coverage, data rate, power consumption, and potential applications.\n\

    17 of 29\nThe DL-UAV communication network is one of the main factors that affect\
    \ energy consumption.\nAs a result, there is ongoing research on different network\
    \ topologies such as rings, stars and, specially,\non ad hoc networks (i.e., on\
    \ Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETS)). There is also research on path\nplanning and\
    \ on relay selection to optimize network efﬁciency. It is important to note that\
    \ in some\nIoT applications, delay requirements of the DL-UAV data trafﬁc can\
    \ be very strict and real-time data\ntransfer models may be required (e.g., in\
    \ emergency situations). Some alternatives for UAV-based data\ncollection frameworks\
    \ are presented in the work by the authors of [123]. For instance, a model that\n\
    increases the efﬁciency of collaborative UAV data transmission while optimizing\
    \ energy consumption\nis described in the work by the authors of [124]. Another\
    \ example of a data gathering framework\nfor UAV-assisted Wireless Sensor Networks\
    \ (WSNs) is described in the work by the authors of [125].\nIn such a paper, to\
    \ increase the efﬁciency of data collection, and thus maximize the system throughput,\n\
    the authors propose to use a priority-based data access scheme that considers\
    \ UAV mobility to suppress\nredundant data transmissions between sensor nodes\
    \ and the UAV. Thus, the authors classify the nodes\nwithin the UAV coverage area\
    \ into different frames according to their locations, and assign them\ndifferent\
    \ transmission priorities. The authors also introduce a novel routing algorithm\
    \ to extend the\nlifetime of the WSN.\n4.3.7. Power Subsystem\nA UAV power subsystem\
    \ is responsible for powering the different electronic components. In the\ncase\
    \ of the DL-UAVs listed in Table 2, their main energy source are either Li-Po\
    \ or Li-ion batteries,\nwhich are appropriate for high-power electronics (usually\
    \ of up to several tens of Watts) and for\npowering the propeller subsystem.\n\
    However, it must be noted that the higher the battery power, the heavier the battery.\
    \ This derives\ninto the fact that current UAV battery technologies like Li-ion\
    \ or Li-Polymer are a bottleneck when\ndesigning systems that require long battery\
    \ life and reduced weight. Therefore, nowadays, it is\nnecessary either to reduce\
    \ on-board electronics power consumption by introducing novel technologies\n(e.g.,\
    \ Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells [126]) or make use of additional\
    \ power sources.\nFor the latter case, it is possible to embed energy harvesting\
    \ devices, which can collect ambient energy\nand store it into the batteries [127]\
    \ or supercapacitors, which are environmentally friendly and provide\nan energy\
    \ density similar to lead–acid batteries, fast charging/discharging speed and\
    \ a long life\ncycle [128]. For UAVs, it seems that motion can be harvested by\
    \ generating mechanical energy that\ncan be collected through thermoelectric systems\
    \ [129]. Other power sources can be collected through\nphotovoltaic panels [130]\
    \ or by rectifying electromagnetic waves [131].\nRegarding UAV recharging, most\
    \ systems make use of USB connectors, DC power jacks, or special\ndock stations\
    \ where the batteries are connected. There are a few recent examples in the literature\n\
    of wireless UAV recharging, as wireless rechargers are currently inefﬁcient and\
    \ require the wireless\nreceiver to be next to the transmitter [132,133].\nThe\
    \ impact of the battery on UAV ﬂight time depends mainly on the aircraft and its\
    \ payload\nand on the wind conditions, but it is commonly in the range of minutes.\
    \ As a result, there is a clear\nneed for developing systems that can endure longer\
    \ ﬂights. There are some recent studies on the\ntopic, but none of them is explicitly\
    \ focused on DL-UAV systems. For example, the authors of [134]\npropose an automated\
    \ battery-management platform for small-scale UAVs (with a typical endurance\n\
    of less than 10 min) that consists of an autonomous battery change/recharge station.\
    \ The autonomous\nbattery recharger uses a swapping mechanism with a linear sweeping\
    \ motion to exchange batteries.\nThe obtained results indicate that the system\
    \ lasts at least 5 h. The researchers also evaluated the\nproposed recharge stations\
    \ through ﬂight validation with Markov Decision Process based planning\nand a\
    \ learning algorithm in a 3-h mission with more than 100 swaps. However, the article\
    \ points out\nthat there are still open issues with the developed recharge station\
    \ in relation to accurate landing and\nto non-balanced charging. Another alternative\
    \ is proposed in [135], where the authors jointly manage\nthe battery levels of\
    \ UAVs with recharger stations (i.e., solar panels and batteries installed in\
    \ a set of\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n18 of 29\nground sites in a cellular\
    \ network). A more sophisticated approach is presented in [136], where a UAV\n\
    is able to transfer energy and information to several ground IoT devices at the\
    \ same time, being each\ndevice equipped with a power splitter.\n4.3.8. Storage\
    \ Subsystem\nAs it can be observed in Table 2, most UAVs include several gigabytes\
    \ of ﬂash memory for storing\nthe collected video and data. Such data are ﬁrst\
    \ processed by the main control subsystem in a light\nway and then stored in static\
    \ memories such as EEPROMs or SD cards.\nNonetheless, the majority of the DL-UAV\
    \ systems in Table 2 stream the collected data to a ground\nstation, but it could\
    \ be upload to a cloud server, a cloudlet or to a fog computing gateway to further\n\
    process and store the data, which can be ultimately presented to the user through\
    \ a graphical interface,\n(e.g., through a web application).\nIt is worth pointing\
    \ out that, although local storage can be inexpensive, it is prone to technical\n\
    failures (e.g., SD card failures) or external factors (e.g., UAV impacts), which\
    \ can harm the storage\nsubsystem and then loss the stored information. This fact\
    \ is essential for fostering remote storage\nsubsystems in cloud servers, fog\
    \ gateways or cloudlets, which provide redundancy. However, the\ninformation stored\
    \ in such systems may be affected by cyberattacks (e.g., Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n\
    attacks) that affect the availability of the data, and their trustworthiness and\
    \ integrity. Due to such\nproblems, DLTs like blockchain have been proposed as\
    \ an alternative for storing certain data (or a\nproof of such data) securely\
    \ and between entities that may not trust each other [137–141].\nThere is recent\
    \ speciﬁc research devoted to UAV deployments with limited storage. For example,\n\
    the authors of [142] studied joint cooperative transmissions inﬂuenced, not only\
    \ by location planning,\nbut also by strategic content placement. In addition,\
    \ in [143] the researchers analyzed a swarm of\nminiature UAVs that make use of\
    \ distributed in-network storage, which allows them to behave as\nsensor nodes\
    \ specialized in detecting certain features. However, none of the above studies\
    \ takes the\nstorage issues into account when dealing with DL-UAV systems.\n4.3.9.\
    \ Identiﬁcation Subsystem\nThe majority of the UAVs stream images collected with\
    \ a video camera to the deep learning\nsubsystem, which process them in order\
    \ to determine whether there are obstacles in the path of the\ndrone and then\
    \ performs the appropriate movement to avoid them.\nHowever, there are other identiﬁcation\
    \ technologies that can be used by DL-UAVs, speciﬁcally\nin conjunction with location,\
    \ inventory, and traceability applications. For instance, Radio-Frequency\nIDentiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) is one of the most commonly used technologies for such applications [7].\
    \ It uses\nradio frequency transponders (i.e., tags) that transmit unique identiﬁers\
    \ and at least one RFID\nreader that communicates with them. The most relevant\
    \ advantage of RFID over other traditional\nidentiﬁcation technologies (e.g.,\
    \ barcodes and QR codes) is that no Line-of-Sight (LoS) is required\nbetween the\
    \ tag and reader.\nIn the literature, there are several solutions that make use\
    \ of RFID. For example, in the\nwork by the authors of [144], an autonomous UAV\
    \ is described that makes use of RFID and\nself-positioning/mapping techniques\
    \ based on a 3D LIDAR device. Table 4 shows a comparison\nof the most relevant\
    \ UAVs that make use of identiﬁcation technologies [88].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11,\

    \ deep learning techniques, which are commonly used for avoiding collisions\n\
    and detecting obstacles, were previously discussed in detail in Section 3.\n5.\
    \ Main Challenges and Technical Limitations\n5.1. DL Challenges\nGiven the nature\
    \ of the DL methods that extract complex hierarchical abstractions from the data\n\
    used throughout the training stages, the effectiveness and capability of generalization\
    \ is bounded by\nthe quantity and quality of the used data. Therefore, most of\
    \ the shortcomings of the DL models are\ndue to the data used for the learning\
    \ processes:\n•\nA limiting factor of the supervised approaches is the large amount\
    \ of data required to generate\nrobust models with generalization capability in\
    \ different real-world environments. In order\nto minimize annotation effort,\
    \ self-supervised algorithms allow automating the collection and\nannotation processes\
    \ to generate large-scale datasets, the results of which are bounded by the\n\
    strategy for generating labeled data.\n•\nThe diversity of the datasets in terms\
    \ of representative scenarios and conditions, the variety\nof sensors, or the\
    \ balance between the different classes are also conditioning factors for\nlearning\
    \ processes.\n•\nThe trial and error nature of RL raises safety concerns and suffers\
    \ from crashes operating in\nreal-world environments [48]. An alternative is the\
    \ use of synthetic data or virtual environments\nfor generating the training datasets.\n\
    •\nThe gap between real and virtual environments limits the applicability of the\
    \ simulation policies\nin the physical world. The development of more realistic\
    \ virtual datasets is still an open issue.\n•\nThe accuracy of the spatial and\
    \ temporal alignment between different sensors in a multimodal\nrobotic system\
    \ impacts data quality.\n5.2. Other Challenges\nAs it can be observed after reviewing\
    \ the different aspects of the DL-UAV hardware and the\nproposed communications\
    \ architecture, it is possible to highlight several additional shortcomings:\n\
    •\nMost current DL-UAV architectures rely on a remote cloud.\nThis solution does\
    \ not fulﬁll\nthe requirements of IoT applications in terms of cost, coverage,\
    \ availability, latency, power\nconsumption, and scalability. Furthermore, a cloud\
    \ may be compromised by cyberattacks.\nTo confront this challenge, the fog/edge\
    \ computing and blockchain architecture analyzed in\nSection 4.2 can help to comply\
    \ with the strict requirements of IoT applications.\n•\nFlight time is related\
    \ directly to the drone weight and its maximum payload. Moreover, a trade-off\n\
    among cost, payload capacity, and reliability should be achieved when choosing\
    \ between single\nand multirotor UAVs (as of writing, quardrotors are the preferred\
    \ solution for DL-UAVs).\n•\nConsidering the computational complexity of most\
    \ DL techniques, the controller hardware must\nbe much more powerful than traditional\
    \ IoT nodes and UAV controllers, so such a hardware\nneeds to be enhanced to provide\
    \ a good trade-off between performance and power consumption.\nIn fact, some of\
    \ the analyzed DL-UAVs have been already enhanced, some of which even have\nthe\
    \ ability to run certain versions of Linux and embedding dedicated GPUs. The improvements\n\
    to be performed can affect both the hardware to control the ﬂight and the one\
    \ aimed at interacting\nwith the other UAV subsystems.\n•\nAlthough some ﬂight\
    \ controllers embed speciﬁc hardware, most of the analyzed DL-UAVs\nshare similar\
    \ sensors, mainly differing in the photo and video camera features.\nFuture\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2144\n21 of 29\nDL-UAV developers should consider complementing\
    \ visual identiﬁcation techniques with other\nidentiﬁcation technologies (e.g.,\
    \ UWB and RFID) in order to improve their accuracy.\n•\nRegarding the ways for\
    \ powering a UAV, most DL-UAVs are limited by the use of heavy Li-Po or\nLi-ion\
    \ batteries, but future developers should analyze the use of energy harvesting\
    \ mechanisms\nto extend UAV ﬂight autonomy.\n•\nRobustness against cyberattacks\
    \ is a key challenge. In order to ensure a secure operation,\nchallenges such\
    \ as interference management, mobility management or cooperative data\ntransmission\
    \ have to be taken into account. For instance, in [154], the authors provide a\
    \ summary\nof the main wireless and security challenges, and introduce different\
    \ AI-based solutions for\naddressing them. DL can be leveraged to classify various\
    \ security events and alerts. For example,\nin the work by the authors of [155],\
    \ the ML and DL methods are reviewed for network analysis\nof intrusion detection.\
    \ Nonetheless, there are few examples in the literature that deal with\ncybersecure\
    \ DL-UAV systems. One such work is by the authors of [156], where an RNN-based\n\
    abnormal behavior detection scheme for UAVs is presented. Another relevant work\
    \ is by the\nauthors of [157], which details a DL framework for reconstructing\
    \ the missing data in remote\nsensing analysis. Other authors focused on studying\
    \ drone detection and identiﬁcation methods\nusing DL techniques [158]. In such\
    \ a paper, the proposed algorithms exploit the unique acoustic\nﬁngerprints of\
    \ UAVs to detect and identify them. In addition, a comparison on the performance\n\
    of different neural networks (e.g., CNN, RNN, and Convolutional Recurrent Neural\
    \ Network\n(CRNN)) tested with different audio samples is also presented. In the\
    \ case of DL-UAV systems,\nthe integrity of the classiﬁcation is of paramount\
    \ importance (e.g., to avoid adversarial samples\n[159] or inputs that deliberately\
    \ result in an incorrect output classiﬁcation). Adversarial samples\nare created\
    \ at test time and do not require any alteration of the training process. The\
    \ defense\nagainst the so-called adversarial machine learning [160] focuses on\
    \ hardening the training phase\nof the DL algorithm. Finally, it is worth pointing\
    \ out that cyber-physical attacks (e.g., spooﬁng\nattacks [161] and signal jamming)\
    \ and authentication issues (e.g., forging of the identities of the\ntransmitting\
    \ UAVs or sending disrupted data using their identities) remain open research\
    \ topics.\n6. Conclusions\nThis article reviewed the latest advances on the development\
    \ of autonomous IoT UAV systems\ncontrolled by DL techniques. After analyzing\
    \ the problems that arise when UAVs need to detect and\navoid obstacles, the paper\
    \ presented a thorough survey on the state-of-the-art of DL techniques for\nautonomous\
    \ obstacle detection and collision avoidance. In addition, the most relevant datasets\
    \ and\nDL-UAV applications were detailed together with the required hardware.\
    \ In relation to such hardware,\nthe most common and the newest DL-UAV communications\
    \ architectures were described, with special\nemphasis on the different subsystems\
    \ of the architecture and the few academic developments that\nhave proposed DL-UAV\
    \ systems. Finally, the most relevant open challenges for current DL-UAVs were\n\
    enumerated, thus deﬁning a clear roadmap for the future DL-UAV developers that\
    \ will create the next\ngeneration of affordable autonomous UAV IoT solutions.\n\

    Abstract.

    The plethora of sensors deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) environments generate
    unprecedented volumes of

    data, thereby creating a data deluge. Data collected from these sensors can be
    used to comprehend, examine and control intricate

    environments around us, facilitating greater intelligence, smarter decision-making,
    and better performance. The key challenge here

    is how to mine out proﬁcient information from such immense data.

    Copious solutions have been put forth to obtain valuable

    inferences and insights, however, these solutions are still in their developing
    stages. Moreover, conventional procedures do not

    address the surging analytical demands of IoT systems. Motivated to resolve this
    concern, this work investigates the key enablers

    for performing desired data analytics in IoT applications. A comprehensive survey
    on the identiﬁed key enablers including their

    role in IoT data analytics, use-cases in which they have been applied and the
    performance results of the use-cases is presented.

    Furthermore, open research challenges and future research opportunities are also
    discussed. This article can be used as a basis to

    foster advanced research in the arena of IoT data analytics.

    1. Introduction. IoT is regarded as the vital research paradigm in the current
    epoch. It has dramatically

    revolutionized every facet of our lives. This technology is characterized by enormous
    amounts of smart devices

    that cooperate seamlessly with each other by means of a global network infrastructure,
    thereby facilitating

    a wide number of pervasive and ubiquitous applications spanning diverse ﬁelds
    [1].

    It is an ecosystem of

    smart devices, i.e., devices that possess sensing and processing eﬃcacies and
    can comprehend and respond to

    their surroundings via sensors and actuators. The blend of diverse technological
    advancements like near ﬁeld

    communication, Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID), real-time localization, embedded
    systems, and the

    networking expedite the conversion of day to day entities into smart entities
    [2]. These entities are incorporated

    impeccably into a web like framework so that they can communicate with one another
    and with other cyber

    agents so as to accomplish goal-oriented tasks [3]. IoT enables sensors and objects
    to interact coherently within

    smart environs and facilitates information transfer in a suitable manner. The
    continuum of devices in IoT are

    connected via several diverse access networks and communication solutions equipped
    with technologies such as

    RFID, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, GSM etc. [4]. Over
    30 billion [5] devices

    ranging from smart phones, to vehicles are prophesied to be linked to the Internet
    by 2020. The large number of

    sensors deployed in IoT environments continuously generate unprecedented volumes
    of structured, unstructured

    and semi-structured data (Big Data), that cant be handled by conventional processing,
    storage and analytical

    systems [6]. Data generated from IoT is diﬀerent from traditional data in following
    ways [7]: (i) data is generated

    continuously at high speed, (ii) Apart from structured data, data may be of semi-structured
    or unstructured

    nature as well, (iii) data sources are diverse and fully distributed, and (iv)
    integration of multi-modal data

    becomes complex.

    The fundamental objective of IoT is to augment the standard of living. Nevertheless,
    this vision is based

    on being able to eﬃciently process, analyze, and comprehend the data generated
    by IoT devices [8]. Hence,

    analyzing IoT data in order to divulge trends, concealed patterns, hidden correlations,
    inferences, and action-

    able insights is crucial for dispensing elite services to IoT users. In this regard,
    investigating the technological

    advancements that can assist in analyzing unstructured and semi-structured data
    apart from structured data, in-

    tegrating the data from heterogeneous data sources, performing real-time analytics
    in delay critical applications

    as well as in optimizing the process of data analytics becomes indispensable.

    1.1. Related Surveys. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst of this
    kind that investigates

    the key enablers for IoT data analytics and surveys their role in the IoT use-cases.
    There are few research works

    in the literature that have surveyed data analytics in IoT applications, however,
    the focus of those research

    works is diﬀerent from the prime concern of this article. The main focus of this
    article is on the key enablers for

    IoT data analytics, the use-cases in which they have been applied, their purpose
    in those use-cases, the datasets

    that have been used, and the performance results of the use-cases.

    In [9], Siow et al. have reviewed the applications of IoT data analytics across
    diﬀerent domains. Moreover,

    the article proposes taxonomy for IoT data analytics in order to guide future
    research in the ﬁeld. The focus

    of the paper is the enabling infrastructure for IoT data analytics that includes
    data generation, data collection,

    data aggregation and integration, storage technologies etc. However, the article
    lacks the detailed survey on the

    enablers like data mining techniques, machine learning techniques, dimensionality
    reduction techniques, time

    series forecasting, etc.

    The work in [10] by Ahmed et al.

    investigated the latest developments in big data analytics for IoT

    applications. Moreover, the opportunities created from the amalgam of big data
    analytics and IoT were also

    identiﬁed. Several research challenges in IoT data analytics were also discussed.
    However, the article lacks the

    comprehensive survey of the IoT use cases and the analytics techniques used.

    1.2. Contribution and Structure of Paper. This work provides a delineation of
    the present state-of-

    the-art in the realm of data analytics in IoT. More precisely, it:

    • investigates the key enablers for IoT data analytics

    • surveys the role of identiﬁed key enablers in IoT data analytics

    • identiﬁes the challenges that the research community still has to face in this
    arena.

    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 an introduction of
    IoT data analytics is provided.

    Section 3 presents the purpose of data analytics in IoT applications. Section
    4 discusses the key enablers for

    IoT data analytics in detail. Furthermore, the role of the key enablers in IoT
    data analytics is surveyed in this

    section. Section 5 highlights the challenges faced by IoT data analytics. Moreover,
    future research opportunities

    in the arena of IoT data analytics are also provided in this section. Section
    6 presents the concluding remarks.

    2. IoT Data Analytics. With the brisk advancements in sensing, communicating,
    analytic and actuating

    technologies, the vision of intelligent recognition, real-time observation, monitoring,
    and management is turning

    into reality [11,12]. The surfeit of sensors deployed in IoT environments generate
    masses of structured, unstruc-

    tured and semi-structured data, including health care data, logistic data, astronomical
    data, environmental

    data, etc. [13]. Data collected from these sensors can be utilized to comprehend,
    examine and control intricate

    environments around us, facilitating greater intelligence, smarter decision making,
    and better performance. The

    enormous amounts of heterogeneous and diverse data generated by millions of IoT
    devices (monitoring certain

    phenomenon) make traditional information processing solutions obsolete. This is
    because traditional informa-

    tion processing systems cannot handle such volume of data [14]. IoT data analytics
    refers to the analysis of

    every fragment of data generated from IoT devices at right time in order to extract
    intelligent insights [15]. It is

    receiving a wide range of attention from researchers and practitioners, as extracting
    intelligent insights from IoT

    data is a tricky task and demands a great deal of attention. The question of how
    to collect, aggregate, and an-

    alyze the data generated from IoT environs has become an important impediment
    that requires urgent solution

    [16, 17]. Data Mining and Machine learning may help in creating smarter IoT by
    extracting unseen patterns,

    hidden correlations, trends, inferences, and actionable insights, facilitating
    greater intelligence, smarter decision

    making, enhancing performance, automation, productivity, and accuracy. However,
    the unprecedented rise in

    the magnitude and intricacy of data pose novel challenges to these domains [18,
    19]. Moreover, it is crucial to

    formulate appropriate techniques for dealing with noisy, inaccurate, uncertain
    and real-time data. Furthermore,

    in several settings, it is indispensable to merge historical data with the current
    sensor data so as to draw out

    eﬀective insights [20].

    Most of the IoT devices continuously emanate massive volumes of time series data
    and such data are

    ephemeral in nature, thereby demanding real-time action. Consequently, apart from
    Big IoT data analytics,

    IoT demands one more category of data analytics, i.e., real-time analytics, to
    support time stringent appli-

    cations. Examples include self-driving cars, elder posture recognition, surveillance
    systems etc. Hence, the

    aforementioned applications demand fast data analytics with minimal delay. In
    such applications, transferring

    data to cloud for analysis is not feasible. The ﬁnest remedy for such time stringent
    IoT applications is to

    bring analytics closer to IoT data source in order to remove needless delays.
    However, bringing analytics closer

    to IoT data source puts forth a new set of challenges, including limitation of
    power, storage and computing

    resources [21].

    IoT data analytics can be categorized into three groups, descriptive analytics,
    predictive analytics and

    prescriptive analytics [10]. Descriptive analytics delineates what has occurred
    and what is going on. It assists

    in perceiving novel business challenges and opportunities by utilizing data aggregation
    and data mining tech-

    niques. Descriptive analytics use-cases include energy consumption [22], urban
    designing [23], etc. Predictive

    analytics describes what will happen and why. It envisages future conditions and
    states precisely with the aid

    of statistical models and prediction techniques. Predictive analytics use-cases
    include disease prediction [24],

    predicting energy usage [25], machine failure prediction [26], anomaly prediction
    [27], etc. Prescriptive analytics

    characterizes what to do and why it needs to be done. It employs decision support
    systems to explore diverse

    possibilities and provides recommendations for decision-making using optimization
    and simulation algorithms.

    Prescriptive analytics use-cases include failure risk management in industrial
    IoT [28], clinical process design

    and optimization in healthcare [29], etc.

    3. Purpose of Data Analytics in IoT Applications. IoT has brought colossal value
    to our lives by

    facilitating the growth of a myriad of business-speciﬁc and user-oriented applications
    in diﬀerent sectors. These

    applications have triumphed in providing massive beneﬁts to the users. Data analytics
    has a remarkable part

    in the development and success of IoT applications. It is used to extract meaningful
    inferences from IoT data

    and these inferences are generally in the form of intelligent control decisions,
    patterns, and statistics that assist

    IoT applications in powerful decision-making. Hence, utilization of data analytics
    in IoT applications bring

    immense beneﬁts including better services, improved productivity, automation,
    and smarter decision-making.

    Fig 3.1 presents the purpose of data analytics in IoT applications. Following
    presents a brief discussion on the

    IoT applications and the role played by data analytics in these applications.

    3.1. Smart Home. A smart home is an important development of IoT in which the
    dwellings are embodied

    with intelligence to provide smart services like user comfort, healthcare, security,
    remote monitoring and control

    of devices, energy conservation, etc. [30]. Smart homes provide a better standard
    of living by incorporating

    automation in the device access, control, and monitoring. The purpose of data
    analytics in smart home is

    to render intelligence in order to produce an interactive environment by utilizing
    foundational services like

    physiological and psychological state detection, image recognition, voice recognition
    etc. Analytics of smart

    home data help in tracking daily activities of the inhabitants, monitoring elderly
    behavior, optimization of

    energy consumption, ensuring security, health monitoring, etc.

    3.2. Smart Healthcare. Increase in the number of long-term illness cases and regularly
    aging population

    is putting a consequential burden on nowadays healthcare organizations. Consequently,
    there is a dire need to

    alleviate the stress on healthcare organizations whilst continuing to dispense
    exorbitant healthcare services to

    patients. IoT has been recognized as a prospective panacea to reduce the stress
    on healthcare organizations,

    thereby transforming healthcare into smart healthcare [31]. The purpose of data
    analytics in smart healthcare

    is to provide intelligence in order to ensure remote health monitoring, assist
    in early disease diagnostics, make

    novel ﬁndings in disease trends, etc. by utilizing foundational services like
    physiological and psychological state

    detection, image recognition, voice recognition, etc.

    3.3. Smart Industry. with the brisk advancement in communication, computing and
    manufacturing tech-

    nologies, production in industrial organizations is being shifted from digital
    to intelligent [32]. Smart Industry

    is a smart manufacturing system which integrates production and services together
    to meet the industrial re-

    quirements. The data generated from smart industry typically consist of data pertinent
    to machine logs and

    manufacturing processes.

    Analytics of such data results in services like condition monitoring of machines,

    fault detection and analysis, machine health management, production optimization,
    ﬂexible manufacturing, etc.

    [32,33].

    3.4. Smart Transportation. This system aims to exploit sturdy and leading sensing,
    computational

    and communication technologies in order to facilitate smart recognition, tracking,
    and monitoring of vehicles

    [4]. These technologies will capacitate vehicle-to-vehicle communication in a
    meticulous way without human

    arbitration.

    Moreover, incorporating IoT in transportation systems will provide smart services
    like traﬃc

    congestion management, route optimization, safe driving, etc. Furthermore, real-time
    information about the

    availability of parking slots, weather condition, road condition, engine health,
    equipment maintenance will also

    be provided [34].

    3.5. Smart Grid. Smart Grid is another consequential advancement of IoT for administering
    and dis-

    seminating electricity between suppliers and consumers in order to ameliorate
    eﬃciency, safety, reliability with

    real-time tracking and control [4]. Integrating IoT with electrical systems will
    facilitate services like optimization

    of power system performance, fault detection and analysis, security, reduction
    in operational and maintenance

    costs [35]. Sensors deployed in smart Grid continuously emanate data pertinent
    to control loops and security

    and the data generated demands fast analytics in order to optimize power consumption,
    predict future power

    supply needs, detect anomalies, etc.

    3.6. Smart Agriculture. Factors like increasing population and dwindling of cultivable
    land as a result

    of urbanization, demand extraction of the most out of available resources. Smart
    agriculture is a novel approach

    of accomplishing farming tasks by mitigating human endeavor and by eﬃcient utilization
    of farming resources.

    Smart agriculture employs advanced sensing, communication, computing and actuating
    technologies in order

    to facilitate services like climate control based on harvesting requisites, growth
    in productivity, automatic

    irrigation system monitoring, crop disease detection and prevention, soil monitoring,
    livestock monitoring, etc.

    [36]. Sensors deployed in Smart agriculture generate data pertinent to moisture
    content of soil, diameter of

    the trunk of plants, climatic conditions, humidity conditions, etc. and the generated
    data demand real-time

    analytics in order to facilitate aforementioned services.

    3.7. Smart Government. Governments can attain a number of beneﬁts from the amalgam
    of IoT and

    data analytics. Almost, all the tasks pertaining to government administration
    demand accurate analysis and

    prediction. Incorporating IoT and data analytics in the government functionalities

    3.8. Smart Education. IoT and data analytics contribute to the competence of education
    systems to

    a greater extent by enabling services like eﬃcient online learning, teaching-learning
    optimization, classroom

    occupancy monitoring, content recommendation, learner behavior monitoring etc
    [38,39]. Moreover, Integrating

    IoT with education systems helps in motivating students, identifying weak and
    struggling students, learners

    progress assessment, and hence makes learning process eﬃcient.

    4. Key Enablers for IoT Data Analytics. From the discussion on IoT data analytics
    presented in

    section 2, it is apparent that recognizing and extracting the hidden information
    from IoT data is a pressing

    chore that surpasses the potential of conventional information processing and
    analyzing strategies. However,

    recent advancements in computational intelligence, data mining, and machine learning
    approaches are paving

    way for requisite data analytics in IoT. Fig 4.1 presents the key enablers for
    IoT data analytics. In the following

    subsections, we present an elucidation of these techniques in the realm of data
    analytics.

    4.1. Data Mining Techniques. Data mining is utilized to discover concealed patterns
    and information

    from the data generated by IoT devices. The main objective of the data mining
    procedure is to reveal implicit

    knowledge from the data and mutate it into a valuable shape. Data mining techniques
    are of three types:

    classiﬁcation, clustering and association rule mining.

    Classiﬁcation is a supervised learning procedure that uses a set of labeled data
    for training purposes to

    categorize data items into pre-deﬁned classes [4]. The prime goal of utilizing
    classiﬁcation in IoT is to predict a

    class for every instance of input data (unlabelled data). The set of labeled data
    is utilized for training to build

    the classiﬁcation model while as unlabelled data is classiﬁed by the classiﬁcation
    model. The objective of classi-

    ﬁcation is to develop a classiﬁer that learns the distribution of patterns in
    the set of labeled data. Classiﬁcation

    has been used in numerous IoT use-cases including real-time ECG monitoring [40],
    twitter sentiment analysis

    [41], ebola virus outbreak control [42], real-time monitoring of breast cancer
    patients [43], automatic people

    counter in stores [44], real-time fall detection system for elderly people [45],
    defect detection in machines [46],

    612

    T. J. Saleem, M. A. Chishti

    cardiac arrest prediction [47], video surveillance [48], rice disease monitor
    and control [49], real-time condition

    monitoring of electric machines [50], etc.

    Clustering is an unsupervised learning procedure that groups data items with similar
    characteristics together

    into the same cluster [18]. In other words, data items in the same cluster have
    identical traits and data items in

    diﬀerent clusters have highly disparate traits. Examples of IoT use-cases that
    utilized clustering include activity

    recognition [51], heart disease survival prediction [52], electricity load prediction
    [53], behaviour visualization

    of Sybil attacker [54], Type 2 diabetes monitoring [55], wormhole attack detection
    [56], weather data analysis

    [57], safe driving [58], gesture recognition [59], etc.

    Association rule mining includes recognition of frequently occurring attribute-value
    relationships. It assists

    in the creation of more qualitative information for eﬀective decision-making [18].
    Association rule mining focuses

    on discovering all the frequently occurring associations from a set of data items.
    It has been used in diverse

    IoT use-cases including data mining in medical applications [60], human activity
    recognition [61], extraction of

    usage patterns of devices [62], etc.

    Table 4.1 presents the purpose of data mining in the IoT use-cases mentioned in
    this sub-section.

    4.2. Machine Learning Techniques. Machine learning oﬀers the ability to systems
    to automatically

    learn and improve from experience without demanding the obligation of adhering
    to static program directions.

    Machines learning approaches craft an eﬀective correlation among input data instances
    and the output actions

    and are competent of accomplishing forecasting and decision-making tasks in IoT
    applications [20].

    These

    approaches are generally divided into three categories: supervised, unsupervised
    and reinforcement learning.

    Supervised learning techniques model dependencies and associations between the
    target prediction outcome

    and the input attributes so that outputs for upcoming data instances are forecasted
    depending on the associations

    it learned from the dataset [63,64].

    Techniques in this category include Linear Regression, Decision tree,

    Random Forests, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) and Artiﬁcial

    Neural Network (ANN).

    Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to forecast a real-valued
    output from the cor-

    relations learned from the training data. Linear regression presumes a linear
    correlation between the input

    predictors and the target output. Example of IoT use-case that utilized linear
    regression is energy consumption

    prediction in digital manufacturing systems [65].

    Decision tree follows a greedy strategy to classify data items by arranging them
    based on attribute values.

    Example of IoT use case that utilized decision tree is activity and movement recognition
    [66].

    Random Forest is a supervised learning technique in which a myriad of decision
    trees are trained on diﬀerent

    subsets of training set chosen randomly. Example of IoT use-case that utilized
    random forest is diagnosis and

    prediction of diseases [67].

    Naive Bayes is a supervised learning technique for performing multi-class classiﬁcation.

    It uses Bayes

    theorem for determining the probability of a class given a data item. Example
    of IoT use-case that utilized

    naive bayes is device problem detection [68].

    KNN is a supervised learning technique in which outputs for new data instances
    are predicted by exploring K

    identical data instances in the dataset and taking the mode of their output values
    as the predicted output for the

    new data instance. Example of IoT use-case that utilized KNN is appliance recognition
    in power management

    systems [69].

    SVM, a supervised learning technique is based on the concept of augmenting the
    margin, i.e., each of the

    two sides of a hyperplane that splits the linearly separable input variable space
    into two classes. Example of

    IoT use-case that implemented SVM is indoor acoustic surveillance [70].

    Artiﬁcial Neuron is the elementary computational unit in an ANN. It accepts one
    or more inputs and

    performs their weighted sum, which is then passed as an input to a non-linear
    function called as activation

    function. Example of IoT use-case that implemented ANN is intelligent intrusion
    detection [71].

    Unsupervised learning applies techniques on the input data instances to mine useful
    information, detect

    patterns and group the data instances so that valuable insights are obtained [63,72].
    These techniques include

    K-Means Clustering, Apriori and FP Growth.

    K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that is utilized in scenarios
    with unlabeled data.

    The objective of this algorithm is to group data items into a K number of clusters.

    Apriori is an extensively used algorithm for association rule mining. It is used
    for recognizing frequently

    occurring attribute-value relationships in the dataset. Example of IoT use-case
    that utilized apriori is human

    sequential movement prediction [74].

    Another procedure for association rule mining is FP Growth. Apriori utilizes a
    breadth-ﬁrst search approach

    to determine the set of frequently occurring data items and hence is quite expensive
    in terms of memory usage.

    While as FP Growth algorithm utilizes a depth-ﬁrst search approach. Example of
    IoT use-case that utilized FP

    Growth is early diagnosis of liver cancer [75], etc.

    Reinforcement learning algorithms learn incessantly from the experience of the
    environment in an iterative

    manner until they inspect the full range of feasible states [63, 76] e.g., Q-Learning.

    Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is based on value instead
    of policy. It is an easy method

    for agents to comprehend how to proceed eﬃciently in controlled environments.
    It operates by continuously

    advancing its evaluation measures of the quality of speciﬁc actions at speciﬁc
    states. Example of IoT use-case

    that utilized reinforcement learning is predictive analytics in smart cities [77].

    Table 4.2 presents the purpose of machine learning in the IoT use-cases mentioned
    in this sub-section.

    4.3. Advanced Machine Learning Techniques. Apart from traditional machine learning
    approaches,

    various advanced learning approaches like deep learning, incremental learning,
    and transfer learning are also used

    to dig out valuable knowledge from IoT data. Deep learning is appropriate for
    modeling complex behaviours of

    Data Analytics in the Internet of Things: A Survey

    615

    diverse data sets and transfer learning is mostly useful for scenarios with limited
    data sets while as incremental

    learning means real-time learning. It is appropriate for the scenarios where data
    arrive over time in a sequential

    fashion.

    Deep learning is a representation learning approach that utilizes a hierarchical
    learning process to mine rep-

    resentations from data by making use of several hidden layers with non-linear
    transformations [78]. It oﬀers an

    exemplary solution for various classiﬁcation and recognition tasks as it encapsulates
    various levels of abstraction.

    It is appropriate for modeling complex behaviours of diverse datasets. Deep learning
    consists of diverse archi-

    tectures including Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN),
    Convolutional Neural

    Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
    Auto-Encoder (AE)

    etc. RBM and DBN capture high-level representations of input data in an unsupervised
    manner. CNN works

    exceptionally well with image data. RNN and LSTM are utilized for time series
    forecasting. AEs are utilized

    for dimensionality reduction of high dimensional data. Deep learning models have
    been utilized in numerous

    IoT use-cases including transportation analysis [79], localization [80], air quality
    prediction [81], human activity

    detection [82], malware detection [83], traﬃc sign detection [84], crop recognition
    [85], fault diagnosis [86], plant

    classiﬁcation [87], pose detection [88], etc.

    Incremental learning means real-time learning. It is appropriate for the scenarios
    where data arrive over

    time in a sequential fashion [20, 89]. By means of their sequential treatment,
    these learning settings oﬀer an

    elegant inferencing scheme for processing big data. To make upcoming learning
    and data analytics eﬀective and

    beneﬁcial, data-rigorous use cases demand that the learning algorithms should
    have the ability of performing

    incremental learning so that knowledge base is built over time [90]. Examples
    of IoT use-cases that utilized

    incremental learning include ﬁre detection [91], self learning [92], outlier detection
    [93], etc.

    Transfer learning is mostly useful for scenarios with limited datasets. It is
    a machine learning approach in

    which the learning parameters of a modeled predictive task are exploited to improve
    generalization in a diﬀerent

    but related problem with limited data [94, 95, 96]. Transfer learning ensures
    better performance by saving time

    while modeling a predictive problem. Given the massive resource requirements of
    deep learning models on large

    and challenging datasets, transfer learning is admired in deep learning. Transfer
    learning involves the following

    steps:

    1. Select a related source task: A related predictive modeling problem with ample
    amount of data is

    chosen.

    2. Develop a model for the chosen source task.

    3. The model developed for the source task is then used as a starting point for
    developing a model on the

    actual task.

    4. Tune model.

    Examples of IoT use-cases that harnessed transfer learning include human activity
    recognition [97], micro-

    scopic image classiﬁcation [98], acceleration of neural network model execution
    [99], etc.

    Table 4.3 presents the purpose of advanced machine learning techniques in the
    IoT use-cases mentioned in

    this sub-section.

    4.4. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques. Data pre-processing is a vital step
    for eﬀectual machine

    learning and data mining. Most machine learning, time series forecasting, and
    data mining techniques may

    not be eﬀective for high dimensional data. Dimensionality means the number of
    attributes in the input data

    instances of a dataset. When the number of attributes in the input data instances
    is very huge as opposed to

    the number of instances in the dataset, certain algorithms struggle to train eﬀective
    and eﬃcient models. This

    anomaly is known as the Curse of Dimensionality [100]. To combat this curse of
    Dimensionality phenomenon,

    data downsizing techniques have been designed. These techniques are broadly classiﬁed
    into two types: Feature

    Selection and Feature Extraction.

    Feature extraction techniques create a new, smaller set of features that are able
    to capture most of the

    useful information [101]. These techniques consist of Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA), Linear Discriminant

    Analysis (LDA), and AEs.

    PCA generates linear combination of the original attributes.

    The new attributes formed are arranged

    according to their explained variance. Examples of IoT use-cases that utilized
    PCA include include soil moisture

    retrieval [102], face recognition [103], intrusion detection [104], structural
    health monitoring [105], network

    anomaly detection [106], machine health management [107], etc.

    LDA also generates linear combinations of original attributes. However, contrary
    to PCA, LDA doesn’t

    maximize the explained variance.

    Rather, it augments the separability between classes.

    Examples of IoT

    use-cases that implemented LDA include ECG classiﬁcation [108], event prediction
    [109], irrigation system

    surveillance [110], online activity recognition [111], intrusion detection [112],
    etc.

    AEs are neural networks that are trained to regenerate their original inputs.
    The idea is to structure the

    hidden layer to have lesser neurons than the input/output layers. With the result,
    the hidden layer learns to

    build a smaller representation of the input. Examples of IoT use-cases that utilized
    AEs include human activity

    recognition [113], privacy preservation in sensor data analytics [114], prediction
    performance improvement in

    sensor and wearable systems [115], botnet traﬃc detection [116], fault diagnosis
    [117], etc.

    Feature selection techniques ﬁlter irrelevant or redundant features from the dataset.

    These techniques

    include Genetic Algorithms. Genetic Algorithm accomplishes supervised feature
    selection. It eﬃciently selects

    features from high dimensional data sets where exhaustive search is not feasible.
    Examples of IoT use-cases that

    have utilized genetic algorithm include intrusion detection [118], medical image
    feature extraction and selection

    [119], pattern recognition [120], building energy optimization [121], gait analysis
    [122], etc.

    Table 4.4 presents the purpose of dimensionality reduction techniques in IoT use-cases
    mentioned in this

    sub-section.

    4.5. Time Series Forecasting. Most of the data produced by IoT devices are time-indexed
    [123]. And

    analyzing such data to extract relevant features, predict future instances, and
    to explore the relationship between

    multiple data streams is the main aim of time series modeling [124,125]. Time
    series data exhibit the property

    of autocorrelation i.e., the current value in the time series is correlated with
    the past values. In linear models,

    the current value depends linearly on the past observations while as in nonlinear
    models, the current value

    is a nonlinear function of past values.

    If the properties of a stochastic process ﬂuctuate with time, it is

    hard to forecast the future values from its observed time series, this phenomenon
    is known as non-stationarity.

    Time series modeling techniques include Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average
    (ARIMA), Hidden Markov

    Model (HMM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

    ARIMA is an extension of Auto-Regressive Moving Average [126]. Both of these techniques
    are used to

    forecast future instances in the series. However, ARMA cannot be applied in scenarios
    where data exhibit

    non-stationarity. In order to combat this problem, ARIMA was proposed. Since ARIMA
    is inherently linear,

    it is not able to model complex data patterns as opposed to approaches like HMM
    and RNN. ARIMA has

    been applied in various IoT use-cases including failure prediction in machines
    [127], weather forecasting [128],

    occupancy prediction in smart buildings [129], load prediction [130], building
    energy consumption forecasting

    [131], etc.

    HMM is eminent for its competence in modeling short-term dependencies between
    adjoining observations.

    However, it is not suitable for scenarios with long-term dependencies [132]. Examples
    of IoT use-cases that have

    employed HMM include anomaly detection [133], physical activity recognition [134],
    traﬃc control management

    [135], health monitoring [136], prediction of user mobility [137], detection of
    sitting posture activities [138], etc.

    RNN and its variants are highly eﬀective in modeling sequences with complex structures
    because of the

    following reasons:

    • They can extract patterns in time series data with long time lags.

    • They are Robust to noise and can perform prediction in the presence of missing
    values.

    • They are inherently non-linear which makes them suitable for modeling complex
    data patterns.

    • They provide support for multi-variate and multi-step forecasting.

    RNN suﬀers from vanishing/exploding gradient problem [139] due to which its performance
    gets degraded

    signiﬁcantly while modeling long input sequences. To overcome this problem Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM),

    a variant of RNN was designed, that works exceptionally well for long input sequences.
    Examples of IoT use-cases

    that have used RNN include activity recognition based on multi-sensor data [140],
    network traﬃc classiﬁcation

    [141], real-time deterministic control [142], weather forecasting [143], etc.

    Table 4.5 provides the purpose of time series forecasting techniques in the IoT
    use-cases mentioned in this

    sub-section.

    4.6. Computing Platforms. Cloud computing [144,145,146] and Fog computing [20]
    are two important

    models for managing the enormous volume of data produced from IoT environs. With
    the brisk growth of

    the IoT, the traditional cloud computing is facing stern issues, like undesirable
    network latency, and spectral

    ineﬃciency which does not make it suitable for scenarios requiring minimal latency,
    real-time treatment, and

    mobility support. Determined to resolve these issues, new paradigm transfers the
    functioning of cloud computing

    closer to the data source. This technology is referred to as Fog computing [147].
    With the result network

    congestion is reduced and decision-making becomes fast. However, these fog devices
    generally do not have

    adequate storage and computational resources. Table 4.6 provides the comparison
    of these computing platforms.

    Examples of IoT use-cases that utilized cloud computing as the computing platform
    include industrial IoT

    big learning [148], hybrid systems for smart agriculture [149], disease diagnosis
    [150], disease prevention in

    precision agriculture [151], temperature control systems [152] etc.

    Examples of IoT use-cases that harnessed fog computing as the computing platform
    include preventive

    healthcare and assisted living in smart ambient [153], video surveillance [154],
    asset provisioning for crowd

    sensing applications in IoT [155], crime assistance [156], data analytics in smart
    cities using big data [157], etc.

    [155] proposed a fog based computing scheme known as Mist computing that provides
    cost-eﬀective resource

    provisioning for IoT crowd sensing applications.

    Apart from cloud computing and fog computing, another emerging computing paradigm
    known as crowd

    computing can be utilized for managing the data produced by IoT systems. In crowd
    computing, IoT devices

    deployed close to each other and with related interests can share computing and
    power resources so as to optimize

    the performance of the IoT systems [158]. Crowd computing has got a massive potential
    in IoT applications.

    4.7. Big Data Analytical Frameworks. This section explores the big data analytical
    frameworks that

    can be utilized for analyzing humongous volumes of data produced from IoT environments.
    Applying the right

    data analytical framework is fundamental for the successful development of an
    IoT application. Depending on

    the analytical requirements of IoT application, data analytics can be performed
    either in Cloud or near the IoT

    data source (Fog nodes). Table 4.7 summarizes big data analytical frameworks.

    4.8. Software Deﬁned Networking. Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN) is a novel technology
    that

    simpliﬁes network administration by segregating the control plane from the data
    plane, thereby centralizing

    the network intelligence [174]. It enables virtualization within the network and
    enhances networking capability.

    SDN fulﬁls following fundamental requisites of IoT applications:

    4.8.1. Network Management. Network management is a vital consideration in IoT
    for supervising

    the tremendous number of devices and the massive volume of data produced by them
    [175].

    SDN enables

    programmatically eﬃcient control mechanism and hides the complexities of network
    management from end

    users. It optimizes network management functionalities such as eﬃcient utilization
    of bandwidth, minimization

    of latency and load balancing.

    4.8.2. Eﬃcient resource utilization. Eﬃcient resource utilization is fundamental
    for improving the

    performance of the network [175]. SDN relieves the simpler edge devices from accomplishing
    the multifaceted

    networking tasks and utilizes the available resources eﬃciently [174].

    4.8.3. Energy Management. Massive number of data centers are deployed to process
    the humongous

    magnitude of data sensed by IoT devices. Consequently, large quantity of energy
    is utilized to power these data

    centers. SDN plays an important role in optimizing the energy usage as it maps
    the traﬃc eﬃciently to the

    suitable servers and switches oﬀ the other unnecessary devices in the data center
    [175].

    4.8.4. Security and Privacy. The utilization of ﬂow-rule-based traﬃc forwarding
    concept in SDN facil-

    itates secure control of ﬂows between the various devices in the network, which
    in turn improves the security

    and privacy of the data generated by IoT devices [175].

    SDN has been applied in numerous IoT use-cases including eﬃcient traﬃc management
    for emergency

    situations [176], intrusion detection [177], service delivery [178], traﬃc congestion
    avoidance [179], dynamic

    distribution of IoT analytics and eﬀective utilization of network resources [180],
    low latency anomaly detection

    in smart city [181], etc.

    5. Vision and Open Challenges. Data analytics has brought considerable beneﬁts
    to IoT applications.

    However, in order to leverage the full potential of data analytics in IoT applications,
    following major challenges

    need to be addressed:

    5.1. Data Pre-processing. In data pre-processing, noisy data are smoothened, ambiguities
    in the data

    are removed, and missing values are ﬁlled, thus making it suitable for further
    processing.

    Because of the

    622

    T. J. Saleem, M. A. Chishti

    constrained nature of IoT sensors and intermittent loss of connectivity, the massive
    scale of IoT data contains

    more irregularities and uncertainties, thereby complicating data pre-processing.
    Moreover, IoT data may contain

    missing and incomplete values that lead to poor data quality. Ensuring completeness
    in IoT data is vital for

    its data quality. Eﬃcient pre-processing techniques that can remove irregularities
    and uncertainties in the data

    and make it suitable for further processing should be researched.

    5.2. Data compression and redundancy reduction. Not all the data generated from
    IoT environments

    are useful. Also, there exists a high level of redundancy in IoT data. The closely
    deployed sensor nodes in IoT

    tend to capture similar information that leads to redundancy in IoT data. Redundant
    data not only lead to

    energy wastage but also dissipate the storage space. Moreover, it also aﬀects
    the feature extraction process.

    Hence, removing redundancy in IoT data and ensuring its uniqueness is crucial
    for its data quality. Eﬀective

    data compression and redundancy reduction techniques need to be employed so as
    to alleviate the burden of

    storage and analytics in such systems.

    5.3. Data Integration. How to integrate and analyze heterogeneous data arriving
    from distributed and

    diverse sources so that a uniﬁed view of these diverse data formats is created
    is an impediment to IoT data

    analytics.

    Deep learning is quite eﬀective in analyzing heterogeneous data.

    However, the severe resource

    requirements of deep learning algorithm limit its use in IoT applications. Hence,
    investigating the ways that

    will reduce the computational requirements of deep learning models becomes crucial.
    However, this should be

    done while preserving the accuracy of deep learning models.

    5.4. Visualization. Data visualization aims to make data more meaningful for further
    analysis and inter-

    pretation. However, inappropriate data visualization will diminish the signiﬁcance
    of the original data and may

    even thwart eﬃcient data analysis. Orchestrating visualization in IoT data is
    complex because of its massive

    scale. Moreover, visualization in case of highly heterogeneous and diverse IoT
    environments is a challenging task.

    Given the importance of appropriate data visualization, devising visualization
    techniques that are well-suited

    for the representation of highly complex IoT data becomes crucial.

    5.5. Expandability and scalability. The sharply growing IoT data bring in the
    challenges of expand-

    ability and scalability for the IoT analytical systems. Analytical paradigms that
    are proﬁcient enough to deal

    with progressively growing complex datasets are highly required. Running analytical
    techniques on distributed

    systems with parallel processing is the potential solution for this problem.

    5.6. Energy management. With the exponential growth of IoT data, transmission,
    storage, processing

    and analysis of such enormous data will certainly dissipate more energy.

    Energy consumption control and

    management solutions should be designed for such systems.

    5.7. Security and Privacy. Data generated from IoT environs are susceptible to
    external intervention.

    Hence, Authentication, authorization, and encryption techniques should be utilized
    to ensure security of IoT

    systems. However, conventional data protection solutions are not applicable to
    the IoT data because of its

    massive scale and highly diverse nature. To this purpose, design of novel Security
    and Privacy solutions for

    such systems becomes inevitable.

    6. Conclusion. Ample volumes of data have been generated since the previous decade
    with the escalation

    in the number of smart devices. Analyzing this voluminous magnitude of data so
    as to explore novel knowledge,

    forecast potential insights and to formulate management decisions is a vital procedure
    that makes IoT a laudable

    technology for enhancing the standard of our lives. The prime requisite for most
    of the IoT applications is an

    intelligent analytical mechanism that can carry out tasks like classiﬁcation,
    clustering, association rule mining,

    or time series analysis. However, conventional analytical procedures do not tackle
    the surging analytical needs

    of IoT systems. To this purpose, this paper identiﬁes the key enablers for IoT
    data analytics and surveys their

    role in data analytics. Furthermore, several challenges faced by IoT data analytics
    were identiﬁed so as to

    stimulate research directions in this arena. At last, it is worthwhile to state
    that data analytics has brought

    immense beneﬁts to IoT applications, however, a number of challenges still remain
    unaddressed, the list of

    which has been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst
    of this kind and we hope that

    this survey will be beneﬁcial for the researchers in the ﬁeld of Data Analytics
    to understand the key enablers

    and lead them to the direction of possible future research in this ﬁeld.

    Abstract: Climate change is emerging as a major threat to farming, food security\
    \ and the livelihoods\nof millions of people across the world. Agriculture is\
    \ strongly affected by climate change due to\nincreasing temperatures, water shortage,\
    \ heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity\nof excessive climatic\
    \ events such as ﬂoods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by\n\
    developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming\
    \ at lower intensity\nand occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems\
    \ constitute a promising solution, as they can\nlower reliance on external inputs,\
    \ enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efﬁciency.\nIn this\
    \ context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising\
    \ solution to\nsecure the resources for the growing world population under climate\
    \ change conditions. This work\nproposes a CSA architecture for fostering and\
    \ supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as\nMixed Farming Systems (MFS),\
    \ by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of\ncrop–livestock-=forestry\
    \ combinations towards sustainable, efﬁcient and climate resilient agricultural\n\
    systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and\
    \ processing, along\nwith fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors\
    \ and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\nthe proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA,\
    \ aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests\nand crops, while mitigating\
    \ the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual\nframework.\n\

    \ Introduction\nStarvation is one of the biggest threats we are facing as humanity\
    \ in the 21st century.\nThe global demand for food is increasing, with recent\
    \ studies forecasting that the global\npopulation will reach 9.5 billion people\
    \ by 2050 [1], and more than 80% of available land\nis already cultivated [2].\
    \ Global demand for farming products is expected to increase\nby 70% for food\
    \ production [3] and double for livestock products by 2050 [4]. However,\nagricultural\
    \ production is strongly affected by the changes in climate conditions, such as\n\
    rising temperatures [5], changing rainfall regimes [6] and variations in the frequency\
    \ and\nintensity of extreme climatic events such as ﬂoods and droughts [7]. The\
    \ estimated impacts\nof the climate change indicates that the yield loss could\
    \ be up to 35% for rice, 20% for\nwheat, 50% for sorghum, 13% for barley and 60%\
    \ for maize [8], and livestock production\nwill be also negatively affected [4].\n\
    Both farmers and breeders need to ﬁnd efﬁcient and affordable methods in order\
    \ to\nstrengthen the resilience of agriculture and livestock farming against climate\
    \ change. The\nTelecom 2021, 2, 52–74. https://doi.org/10.3390/telecom2010005\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom\nTelecom 2021, 2\n53\nconcept of Climate-Smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSA) reﬂects an ambition to improve the resilience\nof agricultural\
    \ systems against climate change [9–11]. The Food and Agriculture Organiza-\n\
    tion (FAO) of the United Nations deﬁnes CSA as agriculture that enhances productivity,\n\
    improves resilience, reduces greenhouse gases (GHG) and facilitates the achievement\
    \ of\nnational food security and development goals [9]. The CSA includes both\
    \ traditional and\ninnovative approaches; and technologies that promote agricultural\
    \ productivity, increase\nthe stability at the farm level and foster the sustainability\
    \ of the relevant value chains [11].\nA system that adopts the concept of CSA\
    \ is expected to increase its resilience against\nﬂuctuating climate conditions\
    \ and therefore offer increased food production in the face of a\nchanging climate\
    \ and increased climate variability, while improving nutritional outcomes\nand\
    \ reducing the carbon cost of farming and its contribution to GHG emissions [12–15].\n\
    It includes three major pillars: (a) increasing agricultural productivity; (b)\
    \ increasing\nadaptive capacity at multiple scales (from farm to nation); and\
    \ (c) reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions [12]. While there is a consensus on the\
    \ potential of the CSA to support\nglobal food and nutritional security in less-favored\
    \ conditions [11–13], CSA scholars have\ndifferent perspectives when approaching\
    \ the scaling of CSA options.\nIntegrated systems can combine crop production,\
    \ livestock and forestry, supporting\nthe production of at least three types of\
    \ product from the same land area over a deﬁned\nperiod [16–18]. These systems,\
    \ based on inter-cropping, succession and/or rotation, can\noptimize the biological\
    \ cycling of nutrients between plants and animals, and maintain long-\nterm soil\
    \ fertility [19–21]. According to the FAO, Mixed Farming Systems (MFS) are deﬁned\n\
    as farming systems managed by households and/or enterprises where crop cultivation\
    \ and\nlivestock rearing together form integrated components of a single farming\
    \ system. MFS\noffer a lot of advantages, such as efﬁcient use of resources by\
    \ using crops and grassland to\nfeed animals and fertilize their ﬁelds with manure\
    \ from the animals, complementarities\nbetween crops and livestock and a ﬂexibility\
    \ that allows the adjustment of crop/livestock\nratios in anticipation of risks,\
    \ opportunities and needs [19,22,23]. Such context-relevant\nintegration of crops\
    \ and animals in the same system appears to support a biological,\necological\
    \ and economic sustainability in the global food production chain [17,18,23].\n\
    Nevertheless, MFS is not a universal panacea. The economic results of MFS are\
    \ not as\noptimal as those of dedicated systems, especially considering the remuneration\
    \ of labor.\nThis is the reason why MFS are usually established in less-favored\
    \ areas, e.g., mountains or\nsloppy areas, rough landscapes and heterogeneous\
    \ terrains, where conventional farming\nor breeding does not usually take place\
    \ [24]. In order to achieve a satisﬁed level of sustain-\nability under these\
    \ conditions, MFS should be able to effectively monitor the farm area, the\nanimals\
    \ and the grasslands. That is a difﬁcult task, as MFS are extremely complex systems\n\
    that include interactions between climate and weather, surface and sub-surface\
    \ soil, crops,\npastures, animal production and human management with economic\
    \ components [25].\nCritical features such as income stability and sustainability\
    \ need special quality dimensions,\ncriteria and indicators for the evaluation\
    \ of trans-disciplinary processes [26]. Moreover,\nthe climate, through weather\
    \ patterns, as time progresses, play a decisive role, as rainfall\nand temperature\
    \ drive the productivity, proﬁtability and environmental health of the\nsystem.\
    \ In addition, there is a need for reducing the energy needed to maintain the\
    \ MFS\noperation. Another challenge is related to the role of research on MFS\
    \ and the need for\nmulti-disciplinary knowledge integration. A lack of integration\
    \ between the research of\ndifferent disciplines, such as agronomists, veterinarians\
    \ and social scientists, limits the\nnecessary integral vision and makes MFS difﬁcult\
    \ to implement [27]. Moreover, science\nlacks inﬂuence mainly because of biases\
    \ towards academic research rather than practical\napplications [28]. It should\
    \ be noticed, however, that this lack of knowledge integration\nis not always\
    \ the case. There are countries that present signiﬁcant progress in integrated\n\
    farming systems from both practical and research perspectives [18]. The complexity\
    \ of\nusing MFS is increased when combining crop and livestock production due\
    \ to the increase\nof the management demands of organizing multi-tasking activities.\
    \ Considering that\nﬁnding reliable labor with the required skills in specialized\
    \ farming systems is difﬁcult\nTelecom 2021, 2\n54\nenough [29]; the problem becomes\
    \ even more acute in a diversiﬁed farming system that\nrequires the aggregation\
    \ of various kind of knowledge and skills. Additionally, for a mixed\nfarming\
    \ system, the bureaucratic and administrative workload, which requires expertise\n\
    that especially older farmers do not possess [29], is expected to increase compared\
    \ to a\nspecialized farm.\nThe success of MFS depends heavily on the aggregation\
    \ of data, which is either\nproduced by or affects the MFS, given that new technologies\
    \ and solutions are effectively\napplied in order to collect, process and use\
    \ it during decision making [30]. Precision\nagriculture is a method in which\
    \ farmers optimize inputs such as water and fertilizer\nto enhance productivity,\
    \ quality and yield. The fact that farmers are more precise with\nplanting, harvesting,\
    \ fertilizing leads to higher efﬁciency and productivity of the farm while\necological\
    \ standards are respected [31]. Today, mobile applications [32], smart sensors\
    \ [33],\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [34], cloud computing [35] and edge computing\
    \ [31]\nmake precision agriculture possible for farming cooperatives. It goes\
    \ without saying that\nthe implementation of MFS requires extended technological\
    \ features, such as sophisticated\nequipment, extended monitoring range, real-time\
    \ processing capabilities and specialized\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI) models.\n\
    Although precision agriculture is characterized by high complexity and depends\n\
    heavily on cutting edge technologies, it constitutes a method that soon or later\
    \ is going\nbe used across the globe. Developed countries, such as USA, Australia,\
    \ Canada and\nsome European countries, including Germany, Finland, Sweden and\
    \ Denmark, have\nmade signiﬁcant progress towards this area and already show some\
    \ level of adoption\nof precision agriculture [36]. In developing countries instead,\
    \ the acquisition of cutting\nedge technologies and the lack of suitable infrastructure\
    \ constitute major impediments\nto precision agriculture exploitation. Although\
    \ precision agriculture, as it can be found\nin North America, Australia and Europe,\
    \ differs considerably in developing countries,\nthe need for accurate data and\
    \ targeted interventions is actually greater there, due to the\nstronger imperative\
    \ for change and the lack of resources [37]. What is really encouraging is\nthat\
    \ over the past few years there has been considerable effort from developing countries\n\
    to use some kinds of precision agriculture methods in various applications, such\
    \ as yield\nmonitoring and tractor auto guidance [36].\nIn developing countries,\
    \ MFS play an important role, as in some cases they act as\nthe backbone of a\
    \ sustainable agricultural policy, especially for individual farmers or\nsmall\
    \ farming communities [38]. During the last decades, research efforts in various\n\
    developing countries have been redirected to integrated farming systems rather\
    \ than\ndedicated ones, so as to cover several complementary enterprises under\
    \ various agro-\necological situations [39–41]. These efforts revealed that integrated\
    \ farming systems can not\nonly be proﬁtable and productive but also eco-friendly,\
    \ a countermeasure to unemployment\nand provide ﬁnancial stability to the stakeholders\
    \ [42].\nDesigning and applying integrated farming systems has severe constraints.\
    \ Towards\nthe technological direction, a severe constraint is the lack of long-term,\
    \ structured, concrete\ndata [43]. In the best scenarios so far, end users’ actions\
    \ heavily depend on short-term,\nbiased data. As a result, data analytic services\
    \ fail to operate on a larger scale since they\nare highly affected by area peculiarities\
    \ and seasonality [44]. That explains the fact that\ndifferent frameworks and\
    \ assessment schemes result in contradictory outcomes. Examining\nMFS implementations\
    \ in view of the end-user, a new kind of barrier that lies in farmers’\nwillingness\
    \ to cooperate, emerges. This barrier goes beyond technical solutions, adding\
    \ a\nsocio-economic dimension to the widespread exploitation of MFS.\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ architecture aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-\noriented\
    \ architecture, for advancing the current farming system to a smart, resilient\
    \ and\nintegrated/mixed farming ecosystem, aiming at increasing the resilience\
    \ of the underlying\nfarms, crops, livestock and forestry against the negative\
    \ impacts of the climate change.\nMoreover, the proposed architecture envisions\
    \ to foster cooperation between farmers and\nbreeders through the provision of\
    \ a sustainable MFS reference model.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n55\nThe remaining paper\
    \ is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights the current state-of-\nthe-art.\
    \ Section 3 presents the MiFarm-CSA architecture thoroughly; it illustrates the\
    \ four\nlayers of the architecture and delves into them in each of the subsections.\
    \ Section 4 outlines\nthe beneﬁts of the proposed architecture. In Section 5 the\
    \ conclusions are summarized.\n2. Related Work\nCurrent section reﬂects the current\
    \ state of the art in integrated agricultural systems\nfrom technological, economic\
    \ and social perspectives. It also points out current weaknesses\nthat tend to\
    \ be exacerbated due to the high complexity of a MFS.\n2.1. Data Aggregation Systems\n\
    Improving mixed farm productivity is essential for increasing farm proﬁtability\
    \ and\nmeeting the rapidly growing demand for food that is fueled by rapid population\
    \ growth\nacross the world and decreasing demand for energy. Mixed-farm productivity\
    \ can be\nincreased by understanding and forecasting crop and livestock performance\
    \ in a variety of\nenvironmental, social and ecological conditions. Both crop\
    \ and livestock recommendations\nare currently based on data collected in ﬁeld-based\
    \ agricultural studies that capture perfor-\nmance under a variety of conditions\
    \ (e.g., soil quality, diseases, environmental conditions,\netc.). The quality\
    \ of manually collected performance data is very low, because it does not\ntake\
    \ into account earlier conditions that have not been observed by the human operators,\n\
    but it is essential to ﬁlter out collected data that will lead to invalid conclusions.\
    \ Further-\nmore, due to MFS, we must increase the volume of data, the number\
    \ of the sources and the\nenergy demands for efﬁcient communication, consequently\
    \ increasing the complexity of\nthe data gathering process exponentially. To this\
    \ end, the utilization of emerging technolo-\ngies such as IoT devices, ground\
    \ sensors, livestock sensors (collars/ear-tags), multispectral\ncameras and UAVs\
    \ for data gathering purposes, is quite mature nowadays, and they can\nbe used\
    \ to collate vast amounts of environmental and crop-livestock performance data,\n\
    ranging from time series data from sensors, to spatial data from cameras, to human\
    \ obser-\nvations collected and recorded via smart applications [45]. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ their beneﬁts\nare extended in the whole spectrum of the agricultural ecosystem.\
    \ Their deployment\ndecreases the farmer’s labor tasks, facilitating his daily\
    \ routine and making resource alloca-\ntion more efﬁcient. Moreover, the quality\
    \ and quantity of data are improving and being\nenriched respectively, providing\
    \ insights that enhance productivity while sustainable and\neco-friendly processes\
    \ are identiﬁed and fostered. Precision agriculture and data analytics\nare reshaping\
    \ industry and market boundaries and interactions, with precision agricul-\nture\
    \ technologies (data holding, data specialization, data strategy) being a combination\n\
    of: Global Positioning System (GPS), sensors mounted on farm machines or standalone,\n\
    geo-mapping, automatics steering systems, electronic communications and variable\
    \ rate\ntechnologies [46]. Increasing UAVs’ obligations results in a higher energy\
    \ consumption, a\nfact that could disrupt the sustainability and eventually the\
    \ viability of the system [47]. In-\ntelligent devices are deployed to collect\
    \ specialized data and provide valuable information.\nSuch devices are photonics\
    \ which are utilized for monitoring and predicting the ripening\nprocess and quality\
    \ of produce, ear-tags that gather information about animals’ nutrition\nand multi-spectral\
    \ cameras that collect images in different spectrums. The incorporation\nof such\
    \ devices intensiﬁes data diversity, raising concerns about interoperability between\n\
    the physical components, data processing and information integration capabilities\
    \ [48].\nObviously, these new trends on the one hand manage to handle some of\
    \ the MFS concerns,\nbut on the other hand reveal new challenges that need to\
    \ be addressed.\n2.2. Socio-Technical and Socio-Economic Modeling\nModeling and\
    \ simulation tools can help in identifying opportunities for improved\nresource\
    \ management, crop production and farm system sustainability. Modeling tools may\n\
    also be used to predict the longer-term effects of suggested interventions and\
    \ technologies\nand to enhance the understanding of their impacts [49]. One such\
    \ tool developed in the\nTelecom 2021, 2\n56\ncontext of African smallholder farmers\
    \ is the integrated crop-livestock model NUANCES-\nFARMSIM [50]. Agricultural\
    \ Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is the most used\nsimulator for agriculture\
    \ proposes. Since 1990, it has grown from a ﬁeld-focused farming\nsystems framework\
    \ used by a small number of people, into a large collection of models\nused by\
    \ thousands of modelers internationally. In this vein, APSIM Initiative is developing\n\
    the next generation of APSIM [51].\nFRAM and STAMP represent the current state-of-the-art\
    \ for socio-technical model-\ning [52]. Both are deliberately lacking theoretical\
    \ background about socio-technical system\ndynamics. Thus, the structure of modeling\
    \ and inquiry is retrospective [53–55]. They are\nhindered in their utility and\
    \ applicability by this theoretical vacuum. New methods are\nneeded which are\
    \ situated in a well-considered and thought-out theoretical landscape and\nwhich\
    \ are based on evidence [56,57].\nRecent literature suggests that understanding\
    \ and considering the role of behav-\nioral factors in farmers’ adoption of sustainable\
    \ practices can help enrich the traditional\neconomic analysis of farmers’ decision-making\
    \ [58]. Within this literature, there is a bur-\ngeoning stream investigating\
    \ the role of behavioral factors. Pre-testing the impacts of\nthese behavioral\
    \ factors on farmers’ decision making can, in turn, lead to more effective\nagro-environmental\
    \ policies, a crucial challenge in view of the enhanced environmental\nand climate\
    \ ambitions for the future Common Agricultural Policy [59,60].\nMoreover, economic\
    \ experiments can be used effectively to improve the design and\nimplementation\
    \ of agriculture policy and programs. Recent developments have raised\nconﬁdence\
    \ in experiments as a useful tool for economic and policy analysis [61,62]. Beyond\n\
    their role in reshaping how economic research is conducted, social science experiments\
    \ have\nbeen used extensively to inﬂuence the designs of both markets and public\
    \ policies [63–65].\nObservation of behavior in a lab is convenient and affords\
    \ a high degree of control over\nthe environment, but the contexts of the laboratory\
    \ and the participants are in many ways\ndissimilar to those in naturally occurring\
    \ environments [66,67].\n2.3. MFS Integration Analysis and Evaluation\nMFS are\
    \ considered efﬁcient designs for sustainable, ecologically-based farming sys-\n\
    tems. The sustainability of MFS relies on the complementarities between crops,\
    \ livestock\nand forestry, and the exchange of resources within them. Not many\
    \ studies are available\nfrom the last years in integrated systems, especially\
    \ those involving all sectors of crops,\nlivestock and forestry together. Two\
    \ use cases were presented in [68], involving crops,\nanimals and grasslands in\
    \ France and Brazil. In [69] is an integration of crops and livestock\napproach,\
    \ which helps farmers to develop a broader understanding of systemic interactions\n\
    between crop and livestock activities on their farms. In [70] the authors presented\
    \ a compre-\nhensive assessment of all integrated systems identiﬁed in Mato Grosso\
    \ by 2012/13. Despite\nthe beneﬁts associated with MFS, little is known about\
    \ these systems or the challenges of\nimplementing them, and only a limited number\
    \ of farmers have adopted them so far.\n2.4. Knowledge-Based Management System\
    \ in Agriculture\nAlthough some work exists in knowledge-based management and\
    \ information sys-\ntems in the agricultural domain, none of it corresponds to\
    \ Mixed Farming Systems. GECO\nis presented in [71], which allows users formalize\
    \ knowledge in a collaborative manner and\nto make it available to a large community.\
    \ In [72] the authors propose a knowledge-based\nmanagement system for exchanging\
    \ and creating knowledge in organic farming. Smart-\nAKIS [73] is a European network\
    \ mainstreaming smart farming technologies among the\nEuropean farmer community,\
    \ aiming to bridge the gap between practitioners and research\non the identiﬁcation\
    \ and delivery of new smart farming solutions to ﬁt the farmers’ needs.\n2.5.\
    \ MFS Services\nDespite the renewed interest in MFS, these systems are facing\
    \ a number of barriers\nand are still declining worldwide, representing about\
    \ 14% of agricultural systems all over\nTelecom 2021, 2\n57\nthe world. The level\
    \ of specialization depends on economic context, labor availability\nand pedo-climatic\
    \ conditions. Despite their theoretical sustainability performance, MFS\nhave\
    \ been disappearing at the farm level. This could be partly explained by their\
    \ low\neconomic performance and social (work) constraints. First of all, MFS are\
    \ not achieving\nequally good economic results to specialized farms. According\
    \ to Farm Accountancy\nData Network (FADN) [74] data, the average productivity\
    \ of mixed farms, in terms of\noutput/input economic value ratio, is comparable\
    \ to the productivity of all European\nfarms. The efﬁciency in input is comparable\
    \ between mixed farming and all types of\nfarms. Still, the income per worker\
    \ in mixed farms remained below the EU-27 average.\nMoreover, direct payments\
    \ represent a substantial part of farm net value added for grazing\nlivestock,\
    \ and mixed and ﬁeld crop farms, due to their average farm size and the historical\n\
    orientations of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [75].\n2.6. Decision Support\
    \ Systems in Agriculture\nDSS tools are divided into four categories in terms\
    \ of applications: animals and animal\nproducts, land water and environment, crop\
    \ and agribusiness and markets. Examples of\ncrop DSS are MyCrop, ROOTMAP, Yield\
    \ Calculator and SPLAT. For management problems\nin farms, intelligent DSS in\
    \ agriculture have been introduced to monitor and to assist\nfarmers to make decisions\
    \ in a timely manner. However, designing a DSS is quite complex\nand requires\
    \ knowledge from various multidisciplinary areas. Adinarayana et al. [76]\nproposed\
    \ an information, communication and dissemination system called GeoSense. The\n\
    system was designed to help in decision making for precision farming. Other work\
    \ by\nTamayo et al. [77] implemented a DSS for fertilization, crop growth control\
    \ and prediction\nof diseases. Only two types of sensors, temperature and humidity,\
    \ were utilized in their\nsystem. Jiber, Harroud and karmouch [78] focused their\
    \ study on designing a precision\nagricultural monitoring framework. However,\
    \ this study was limited as it did not use test\nbeds to evaluate the performance\
    \ of their monitoring systems. Aiello, Giuseppe et al. [79]\nproposed a methodological\
    \ approach using a majority rule and bioeconomy strategies that\nimplements a\
    \ decision fusion algorithm which allows one to make the decisions about\nthe\
    \ possible risk of pest disease on the basis of the information (dew point temperature,\n\
    leaf temperature, etc.) collected from all sensors of the network. Grigera, Julian\
    \ et al. [80]\npresented three different usability evaluations: a heuristic evaluation,\
    \ a user test and an\nautomated diagnosis, based on 244 farmers and advisors in\

    3. MiFarm-CSA Architecture\nMFS is characterized by multiple instances of crops,\
    \ livestock and forestry, which\nmay be in small or large geographical areas.\
    \ Currently, MFS is not characterized by\nintense use of information and communication\
    \ technologies (ICT) and where it exists, it\nis only used separately per farm\
    \ or livestock level. In addition, current approaches are\neither very simplistic,\
    \ omitting important aspect of MFS, or rather complex, making them\nimpossible\
    \ to implement, which generate drawbacks in management and at the economical\n\
    level that prevent farmers from adopting MFS. MiFarm-CSA envisions to constitute\
    \ an\noverall architecture that facilitates data exchange and integration in one\
    \ platform which\nis delivered to the end users as a service, supporting several\
    \ ICT deployments in crops,\nlivestock and forestry, regardless of their geographical\
    \ location. This approach is aiming\nto leverage MFS and improve in economic,\
    \ social and environmental indicators. Figure 1\nillustrates the MiFarm-CSA view\
    \ of MFS against the current state.\nThe proposed architecture follows a layered\
    \ approach since it offers a lot of beneﬁts in\ncomparison with a non-layered\
    \ one. These beneﬁts are summarized below:\n•\nEasier to understand: architecture\
    \ will be easier to understand, not only for the\narchitects who designed it,\
    \ but also for the technicians who are going to build and\nmaintain it and for\
    \ the people who are going to participate in it.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n58\n•\nEasier\
    \ to test: having a layered architecture makes it possible to deﬁne independent\n\
    components much better, which makes component testing easier.\n•\nEasier to extend:\
    \ adding new features or changing current ones is easier in a layered\narchitecture.\n\

    \ MiFarm-CSA concept.\nIn particular, the proposed architecture consists of four\
    \ main layers:\nIntegrated Data Collection Network: In detail, the Integrated\
    \ Data Collection Network\n(IDCON) applies to the area of MFS, to monitor any\
    \ type of crops; livestock and forestry;\nand climate and soil parameters. More\
    \ speciﬁcally, this tier exploits a wide range of Internet\nof Things (IoT) sensors,\
    \ devices, gateways and servers, UAVs and FANETs, which are\ncapable of covering\
    \ large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data in near real time,\nsuch\
    \ as information about the temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, pH, dissolved\n\
    oxygen levels, temperature, conductivity, etc. IDCON encloses four main tools,\
    \ namely,\nthe data capturing and recording system, which includes the smart sensing\
    \ and tracking\nsensors, the aerial sensing systems and the weather and climate\
    \ control systems; the energy\nmanagement and harvesting system (EMHS); the semantic\
    \ middleware and gateways\n(SMG); and cloud-based event and data analytics (CEDA)\
    \ which includes the livestock\nfarm management system and the cloud application.\n\
    The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework: The second layer concerns the MiFarm-\n\
    CSA Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework (SECF) which aims to support sophisticated\n\
    capabilities such as integrated farming to yield forecasts, and optimization of\
    \ crop man-\nagement in terms of fertilization, irrigation and sowing density,\
    \ while at the same time\nTelecom 2021, 2\n59\nproviding social learning modules,\
    \ in a user-friendly way, thinking skills, virtual scenarios,\ncase studies and\
    \ long-term predictions, estimations and business-oriented best practices\nbased\
    \ on the input received from the underlying MiFarm-CSA IDCON layer.\nThe Mixed\
    \ Farming as a Service: The top layer of the architecture is the Mixed Farming\n\
    as a Service (MFaS) which provides a set of advanced and efﬁcient user applications\n\
    and services destined to farmers and stakeholders. More speciﬁcally, the MFaS\
    \ encloses\neight main applications, namely: Resource Managers (ReMa), Integrated\
    \ Irrigation and\nFertilization Application (IFRA), Anomaly and Pest Detection\
    \ Tool (APED), Novel Climate\nService and Application (NCSA), Digital Market Radar\
    \ (DiMaRa), Web-based Knowledge\nExchange Service (W-KES) and Integrated Farming\
    \ Systems Economics (IFSEC).\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology: The last\
    \ layer concerns the MiFarm-CSA\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology (EVAM),\
    \ which serves as an horizontal layer\nthat covers all the other layers, as the\
    \ socio-economic aspects should be taken into account\nduring all steps of the\
    \ development of MFS. EVAM layer includes the SCOPE methodology\nfor examining\
    \ and creating dynamic process maps focusing on process functionality, social\n\
    cohesion and the mediation of collective knowledge and information cycles. A further\n\
    element of this approach is the social license to operate (SLO) concept. This\
    \ concept relates\nto the continued acceptance of a set of business practices\
    \ or operating procedures by a\ncompany’s employees, stakeholders and the general\
    \ public. In addition, in this layer the\nbehavioral decision-making is also taken\
    \ into account as it is a method to inﬂuence the\nfarmers to adopt environmentally\
    \ suitable practices.\nTable 1, provides brief deﬁnitions of the concepts, technologies\
    \ and practices used in\nMiFarm-CSA architecture.\n3.1. Integrated Data Collection\
    \ Network\nThe provision of an advanced data collection network and autonomous\
    \ monitoring is\na major pillar of MiFarm-CSA, which is realized by the IDCON.\
    \ Figure 2 illustrates IDCON,\nwhich aims at designing and deploying the technology\
    \ means that will allow MiFarm-CSA\nto measure data from different farming systems,\
    \ e.g., forests, crops and livestock, and\nto expand the capability of the MFS\
    \ in rough and slope terrains and in large-scale lands.\nIDCON encloses six cutting-edge\

    \ telecommunication wide area network designed to allow\nlong-range communications\
    \ at a low bit rate among things,\nsuch as sensors operated on a battery.\nGeographic\
    \ Information System\nA conceptualized framework that provides the\nability to\
    \ capture and analyze spatial and geographic data.\nInitially, the data capturing\
    \ and recording takes place by using the SST, ASSM and\nWCCF. SST includes electronic\
    \ sensors (passive and active wireless sensor devices) for\nenvironmental monitoring\
    \ (quality of water, soil, air and nutrition concentration), phyto-\nelectronic\
    \ sensors for measuring environmental and soil changes via metabolic changes\n\
    in plants (e.g., pH level and phytohormones) and soil-derived GHG emissions sensors\n\
    that measure the effects of regenerative grazing regime and mixed farming practices\
    \ on\nGHG losses. In addition, low-cost IoT-enabled GHG sensors are utilized for\
    \ measuring\nthe effects of emissions on local and regional levels. Since animal\
    \ tracking is of paramount\nimportance in any MFS, specialized IoT devices (e.g.,\
    \ collars and ear-tags) are also utilized\nfor locating, monitoring and managing\
    \ livestock. Beyond the conventional information\nsuch as (i) location, (ii) motion,\
    \ (iii) temperature and (iv) animal behavior, collars and\near-tags can show (i)\
    \ the areas of the farm that have been most frequently occupied and (ii)\nthe\
    \ history of the areas where the animals have been grazing. As a result, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    architecture is able to boost feed efﬁciency, increase food quality, mitigate\
    \ risks regarding\nthe animal loss, decrease the stakeholder’s expenses and increase\
    \ his income.\nSince the beginning of the development of new generations of UAVs,\
    \ these platforms\nwere considered a well suited tool, under different conﬁgurations,\
    \ in agriculture, livestock\nand forestry because of their potential (size, weight,\
    \ ﬂight speed and altitude) [81]. ASSM\nprovides a sophisticated technology by\
    \ deploying single UAVs or groups of UAVs (FANETs)\nfor implementing several monitoring\
    \ and surveillance activities in the crops, livestock and\nTelecom 2021, 2\n61\n\
    forests [82]. The UAVs can be equipped with (i) multispectral sensors, (ii) hyperspectral\n\
    sensors, (iii) thermal sensors, (iv) cameras and (v) GPS. The information is gathered\
    \ by\nscanning crops, livestock and forest landscapes. In particular, by scanning\
    \ the crops,\nASSM will acquire (i) soil and ﬁeld analysis, (ii) crop monitoring,\
    \ (iii) yield estimation\n(iv) bidirectional reﬂectance properties of plant surfaces,\
    \ (v) health of plants (leaf area\nindex, chlorophyll content, water stress detection,\
    \ photosynthesis soil analysis) and (vi)\nsoil composition in agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ to estimate crop yields based on the computation of\nvegetation indices in farmlands\
    \ [83]. By scanning livestock, ASSM will be able to gather\ninformation related\
    \ to (i) counting animals; (ii) locations of animals; (iii) animal temperature;\n\
    (iv) body condition scoring; (v) number of newly born animals; (vi) disease detection\
    \ and\nanimal identiﬁcation using radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID). Lastly,\
    \ ASSM will be\ncapable of monitoring forests in terms of (i) carbon sequestration,\
    \ (ii) tree canopy analysis,\n(iii) conservation features, (iv) monitoring biodiversity,\
    \ (v) ecological landscape features\nand (vi) plant and tree health. As a result,\
    \ ASSM constitutes a powerful information\ngathering tool, which offers advanced,\
    \ real-time data collection and measurements tool,\nwhile expanding the monitored\
    \ landscape, thereby allowing the development of MFS in\nrough areas. ASSM is\
    \ expected to contribute to the resilience increase through instant\nmacroscopic\
    \ data gathering which enhances decision making, while reducing the cost\n(labor\
    \ cost and data acquiring) of current solutions, e.g., ground surveying. Furthermore,\n\
    based on technological advances such as edge computing, the ASSM can incorporate\n\
    on-board, real-time video analyzers which enable the autonomous and dynamic ﬂight\n\
    control of UAV according to the results of video surveillance output. As a result,\
    \ the time\nneeded for scanning an area will be highly reduced, allowing MiFarm-CSA\
    \ to expand the\nscalability of the monitored landscape.\nWCCF can further extend\
    \ the information provided to the MFS by including satellite,\nmeteorological\
    \ and climate-related information. Satellite-derived measurements are es-\nsential\
    \ inputs to monitor water management and agricultural production for improving\n\
    regional food security [84]. Observations coming from near real-time satellites\
    \ can be used\nto mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme events and promote climate\
    \ resilience.\nMiFarm-CSA architecure can beneﬁt from energy harvesting techniques\
    \ in the op-\neration of SST to reduce the environmental impact of farming. The\
    \ optimal “energy\nmanagement” policy can be deﬁned based on existing machine\
    \ learning (ML) models and\nAI algorithms [85].\nConsidering data storage and\
    \ transfer, middleware software and the necessary hard-\nware gateways and actuators\
    \ are needed for storing and forwarding the captured data.\nThe SMG component\
    \ provides the necessary middleware software and gateway infras-\ntructure to\
    \ support IDCON by gathering all kinds of information from different sources.\n\
    The middleware should able to abstract the heterogeneity and complexity of the\
    \ under-\nlying hardware devices, appliances or unmanned vehicles (data transmission\
    \ formats,\nmanufacturer particular features, operating systems, etc.) and to\
    \ provide inter-operability\namong sensors, robots and smart devices. Reliability\
    \ in communications, real-time data\ndistribution, automatic discovery of entities\
    \ and quality of service (QoS) monitoring is\nguaranteed by the middleware itself.\n\
    The CEDA component provides the data collection and processing system that is\n\
    carried through into distributed computing systems and clusters for real-time\
    \ processing.\nTo this end, robust data analytics, high performance computing,\
    \ efﬁcient data network\nmanagement and cloud computing (CC) techniques are used\
    \ [86]. More speciﬁcally, the\nmain pillars are (i) the integration of data that\
    \ originate from different sources via a\ncommon communication point, and (ii)\
    \ the provision of suitable adaptive algorithms for\neffective, dynamic and autonomous\
    \ decision-making. Taking into account the massive and\nheterogeneous characteristics\
    \ of data, acquiring and processing all of it is inefﬁcient in terms\nof communication\
    \ cost, computing complexity and the utilization of data storage resources.\n\
    For this reason, dimensionality reduction should provide a reduced version (sketch)\
    \ of\noriginal data taking into account the speciﬁc characteristics of the data\
    \ generated.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n62\nThe Panoptis platform consists of hardware\
    \ add-ons (collars and ear-tags) and soft-\nware modules that provide tools to\
    \ livestock farmers so as to locate and monitor livestock.\nThe platform allows\
    \ one to generate many types of enclosures, sub-areas and points of\ninterest.\
    \ This allows one to have records and monitoring of animal behavior in these enclo-\n\
    sures. The challenge in this component lies in the integration of information\
    \ when received\nfrom different sources: (a) IoT devices mounted on animals; (b)\
    \ satellite information about\npastures; (c) weather forecast; (d) soil sensors,\
    \ in a DSS to improve grazing management.\nThe interconnection between the data\
    \ collecting and the data storing can be achieved\nthrough low power wide area\
    \ networks (LPWAN) such as LoRA and Sigfox telecom-\nmunication networks. LoRa\
    \ and Sigfox protocols are widely used for supporting smart\napplications and\
    \ monitoring systems [87].\n3.2. Evidence-Based Assessment Methodology\nEVAM is\
    \ deﬁned as a major pillar of the proposed architecture, for fostering the\ninvolvement\
    \ of end-users in the MFS landscape, consisting of the following components:\n\
    (a) (SCOPE) methodology, (b) the SLO concept, (c) the behavioral decision-making\
    \ (BDm)\nand (d) the Behavioral Intervention Engine (BIE).\nOftentimes in technology,\
    \ development projects the social, behavioral and even hu-\nman aspects of the\
    \ technology play a secondary role to the technological aspects. The\nproposed\
    \ architecture intends to use innovative human factor approaches and method-\n\
    ologies to champion social and behavioral aspects and to prioritize the role of\
    \ the human\nin the development of technology. Doing so will ensure that the implementation\
    \ will not\nencounter barriers relating to user acceptance, usability and other\
    \ human barriers. The\nstarting point involves reﬁning new methods for modeling\
    \ the socio-technical aspects\nof farming systems and to examine the social and\
    \ behavioral aspects of mixed farming\nand agroforestry. The SCOPE methodology\
    \ examines and creates dynamic process maps\nfocusing on three interlocking and\
    \ interdependent levels of analysis: (i) process function-\nality (operational\
    \ processes); (ii) social cohesion (trust and social networks); and (iii) the\n\
    mediation of (i) and (ii) through collective knowledge and information cycles\
    \ [88].\nA further element of this layer is the SLO concept. This concept relates\
    \ to the continued\nacceptance of a set of business practices or operating procedures\
    \ by a company’s employees,\nstakeholders and the general public. The concept\
    \ of social license is closely related to the\nconcept of resilience and sustainability,\
    \ and the work to deﬁne and develop the SLO in this\narchitecture will ensure\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social\nand behavioral\
    \ change.\nAccording to many MFS experts, the problems of the end users, mostly\
    \ farmers,\nare not just about knowledge: it is about building the habit of cooperating.\
    \ Over the\nlast few decades, researchers have increasingly studied the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence farmers’\nadoption of environmentally sustainable practices [89].\
    \ Previous academic attempts to\ntake stock of the factors inﬂuencing farmers’\
    \ adoption of sustainable practices [90] did\nnot speciﬁcally focus on the roles\
    \ of behavioral factors, often resulting in an incomplete\noverview and limited\
    \ theoretical understanding of how and why these factors affect\ndecision-making.\
    \ There have been some efforts in policy circles to make an inventory\nof behavioral\
    \ factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption of sustainable practices, but their\ndisciplinary\
    \ scope was restricted to behavioral economics and communication sciences [91].\n\
    For this reason, MiFarm-CSA architecture introduces BDm which adopts the experimental\n\
    research concept combined with laboratory experiments in parallel. The innovation\
    \ of this\nconcept lies in the following twofold statement: (a) it evaluates ex-ante\
    \ farmers’ choices\nwhen they are faced with voluntary versus mandatory schemes\
    \ and with results based or\ncollective schemes, and (b) it includes experiments\
    \ in the ﬁeld, which are carried out to\ninform agricultural policies by including\
    \ a behavioral component, as the outcome variable\ngenerally consists of decisions\
    \ made by farmers [92,93]. To take a positive step forward,\nthe proposed architecture\
    \ is built on top of BDm the BIE. The latter aims at: (a) predicting\nthe expected\
    \ MFS-related behavior (behavioral intentions) of farmers on the basis of a\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n63\nset of socio-economic factors, (b) facilitating the selection\
    \ and application of appropriate\nstrategies through a number of communication\
    \ tools and channels and (c) driving the\ndesired MFS development widely. The\
    \ main operating elements of the BIE break down as\nfollows: farmers can be clustered\
    \ according to their (socio-demographic) proﬁles, and the\nsuitability of involvement\
    \ strategies is deﬁned both by the user proﬁle and by additional\nsocio-economic\
    \ factors (e.g., country culture). The resulting model will be used by the\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ decision support system.\n3.3. The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework\n\
    The lessons learnt and the experience of farmers stemming from the existing MFS\n\
    are of paramount importance for further development of MFS. The production of\
    \ more\nknowledge on MFS and the knowledge acquisition by farmers are both required\
    \ in order to\ndevelop sustainable, productive, viable and efﬁcient future MFS.\
    \ The SECF component of\nMiFarm-CSA architecture aims to foster core interactions\
    \ among animals, forests and crops,\nwhile mitigating the high complexity of these\
    \ interactions. SECF follows a participatory,\nlearning and technology-oriented\
    \ methodological approach based on knowledge-driven\ntools. This methodological\
    \ approach is deﬁned in ﬁve main pillars, namely, (a) the par-\nticipatory knowledge\
    \ building (PKB), (b) the mixed farming simulator (MFSim), (c) the\nexperimentally-oriented\
    \ co-design process (EC-P), (d) the peer learning network (PLN)\nand (e) decision-making\
    \ engine (D-ME).\nPKB involves the critical knowledge extraction, which encloses\
    \ the most important\nknowledge needed to support sustainable MFS. This knowledge\
    \ can be extracted from\nmeetings, seminars and workshops and recent literature\
    \ ﬁndings. The contributions of\ninternational experts who will analyze and evaluate\
    \ the current knowledge and remaining\nuncertainties about large-scale, commercial\
    \ MFS are crucial. The PLN pillar encourages\ntechnical and organizational innovation;\
    \ it enhances learning options, while reducing the\nisolated position of this\
    \ kind of system in a specialized world. The PLN could address\nMFS, by (a) identifying\
    \ learning issues, (b) supporting the exchange of (tacit) knowledge\nwithin the\
    \ network and (c) organizing access to relevant sources of knowledge outside the\n\
    peer network. The ﬁnal step of the PKB is related to the knowledge-exchange beyond\
    \ the\nPLN. The PLN ensures knowledge exchange among peers; e.g., it could also\
    \ be valuable\nthat experienced farmers and stakeholders organize access for other\
    \ actors (advisors,\nresearch and policy makers) who are interested in MFS. Field\
    \ visits, thematic networks and\ntechnological demonstrations constitute an immersive\
    \ type of learning which can enhance\nsigniﬁcantly the process of knowledge exchange.\n\
    The participatory knowledge building can be enriched with state-of-the-art technolo-\n\
    gies like virtual and augmented reality. Such technology could maximize the participants’\n\
    engagement in the training material, by fostering the motivation of end users\
    \ to be engaged\nto the PKB and the SECF activities in general.\nThe MFSim is\
    \ also introduced as another major pillar of SECF in order to mitigate\nthe complexity\
    \ of MFS. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across\n\
    disciplines and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage\
    \ is set for the\nmajor advances in agricultural systems science that are needed\
    \ for the next generation of\nmodels, databases, knowledge products and decision\
    \ support systems [49,94]. Specialized\nsimulation modeling of crop–livestock\
    \ integration among farms is the basis for achieving\nthe up-scaling process involved\
    \ in integrating beyond the farm level. Furthermore, com-\nputer simulation with\
    \ environmental-economic models at the farm level provide a useful\ntool for integrating\
    \ knowledge and information to predict production efﬁciency, environ-\nmental\
    \ impacts and the effects of management policies on production performance [95].\n\
    The MFSim is introduced as the main modeling and simulation tool of designing,\
    \ testing,\nvalidating and evaluating mixed farming modeling systems and complex\
    \ simulation sce-\nnarios. The aim of MFSim lies in the fact that it allows farmers,\
    \ stakeholders and supply\nchain actors to experiment with diversiﬁed cropping,\
    \ animal and forest systems without\nhaving to invest or risk resources. MFSim\
    \ could also enable stakeholders to (a) model\nTelecom 2021, 2\n64\nand simulate\
    \ different variations of forest-crop-livestock integrated farms, (b) model and\n\
    simulate different use of resources (nutrients, land, manure management, etc.)\
    \ and (c)\nmodel and simulate manure management practices and animal feeding.\
    \ In particular,\nMFSim could provide signiﬁcant insights in (a) simulating livestock\
    \ performance, while\ngrazing grain crops, (b) assessing diversifying crop rotations\
    \ in terms of sale and animal\nfeeding sources, (c) studying and evaluating tactical\
    \ and strategic responses to improve\nthe performance of livestock feed systems,\
    \ (d) modeling and evaluating the implications\nof grazing crops on the livestock\
    \ system as a whole, (e) analyzing and evaluating the\nproduction and economic\
    \ risk mitigation beneﬁts that arise from operating a mix of crop\nand livestock\
    \ systems, (f) evaluating recycling tactics in animal manure to fertilize crops\n\
    and (g) simulating the integration of alternate crops in the crop rotations.\n\
    The EC-P is also introduced as a component of SECF, as its aim is to motivate\
    \ farmers\nto cooperate in the knowledge exchange processes without feeling loss\
    \ of freedom and\nindependence [96,97]. The EC-P engages farmers in laboratory\
    \ and ﬁeld experiments,\nby conducting trials and demonstrations together with\
    \ the experts. In particular, during\nlaboratory experiments, the stakeholders\
    \ and the researchers can work together and see\nhow the technology will be used\
    \ in practice.\n3.4. Mixed Farming as a Service\nThe MFaS is the fourth main pillar\
    \ of MiFarm-CSA whose aim is to deliver a rich suite\nof tools and services to\
    \ the end users (farmers, agricultural companies, decision makers,\nregulators,\
    \ supply chain actors, stakeholders and individuals) in three dimensions, namely,\n\
    (a) environmental, (b) economic and (c) social. MFaS goes beyond than a conventional\n\
    toolkit for farmers; it constitutes the main decision support system of the proposed\
    \ architec-\nture. MFaS serves as an integrated management software that helps\
    \ farmers and growers\nto establish sustainable farm management practices and\
    \ reach proﬁtable crop production,\nby enclosing various applications and services\
    \ related to conventional farming systems.\nThe envisioned MFaS should support\
    \ the following MFS applications and services: (a)\nthe Integrated Farming Systems\
    \ Economics (IFSEC), (b) the W-KES, (c) the APED, (d) the\nIntegrated Irrigation\
    \ and Fertilization Application (IIFA), (e) the NCSA, (f) the Resource\nManagers\
    \ (ReMa) and (g) the DiMaRa.\nIFSEC is a critical component of MFaS, as it provides\
    \ the decision-making compo-\nnent of the proposed architecture. IFSEC analyses\
    \ existing case-studies of well-managed\nMFS; develops a labor-balanced analysis\
    \ based on farm surveys; develops participative\napproaches with groups of farmers\
    \ to consider their management strategies and develop\nscenarios; and identiﬁes\
    \ management tools to assess MFS labor requirements and associ-\nated costs so\
    \ as to facilitate integration between farms. In particular, IFSEC should abe\n\
    considered as completed when it is in such position to provide (a) advanced logistics,\
    \ (b)\nadvanced ﬁnancial management, (c) MFS management and (d) MFS visualizations.\
    \ The\nIFSEC advanced logistics could include (i) labor management, (ii) machinery\
    \ management\nand (iii) inventory management. In general, the end user should\
    \ be able to register a farm\nby adding ﬁnancial information, work task assignment\
    \ per worker and cost per worker.\nAdditionally, economic features for machinery\
    \ can be included, i.e., cost per individual\ncategory task per hour or area unit.\
    \ Reservation for a machine for speciﬁc hours and inven-\ntory management could\
    \ be available as well. The IFSEC advanced ﬁnancial management\ncould include\
    \ the management of (i) sales, (ii) expenses, (iii) assets, (iv) loans, (v) budget\n\
    and (vi) transactions. The end user should be able to register sales invoices\
    \ containing\nmultiple items, while the corresponding quantity per item will automatically\
    \ stored to the\ndeﬁned warehouse. The IFSEC MFS management could involve: (i)\
    \ crop-livestock diversi-\nﬁcation per individual ﬁeld; (ii) week, month, year\
    \ and long-term forecasting, including\ntemperature, wind speed and rainfall (mm).\
    \ Information for pests, weeds and diseases\nwith detailed descriptions and a\
    \ list with active substances which ﬁght or prevent them\ncould be included as\
    \ well. The IFSEC MFS visualizations will bring new dashboards with\nreal-time\
    \ data with predeﬁned templates like usage, productivity, ﬁnances, Key Perfor-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n65\nmance Indicators (KPIs) and ﬁeld analytics, while the MiFarm-CSA\
    \ engine will be featured\nto export a structured report in a user-friendly manner,\
    \ such as tasks, crop production,\nusage, ﬁnances, cost per task, inventory and\
    \ resources.\nThe W-KES applies a collaborative service to share knowledge, experiences\
    \ and\ninnovations among the different people involved in the design and application\
    \ of MFS\nagricultural systems. W-KES is composed by three components: (a) the\
    \ W-KES semantic\nmodel, (b) the W-KES web-based application and (c) W-KES forum.\
    \ The semantic model\nis organized in a set of triplets, “subject”, “predicate”\
    \ and “object” [98], and the triplets\nare interconnected. The main resources\
    \ of the W-KES semantic model are (a) web pages\ncreated in a collaborative manner,\
    \ (b) simulation results conducted by the MFSim, (c) best\npractices formed as\
    \ documents, stemming from the SECF and (d) educational material and\ntraining\
    \ modules coming from the PLN. These resources are associated with certain triplets;\n\
    for example, users can associate the triplet “wheat”, as “can be attacked by”:\
    \ “aphids” in a\nweb page presenting knowledge about wheat. Furthermore, the W-KES\
    \ intends to include\na knowledge search service, which allows users to query\
    \ web pages by keyword, string\nor sentence matching. For example, a user may\
    \ search for manure quality management\nfor MFS and the W-KES web-based application\
    \ will propose related web pages, material\ncontent from the PLN and best practices—extracted\
    \ from the SECF layer. Lastly, the W-KES\nweb-based application incorporates a\
    \ forum, which allows any user to share his opinion; or\nask the community about\
    \ information or a new topic that he cannot ﬁnd in another source.\nThe innovation\
    \ behind this service lies in the fact that it can also enable direct and indirect\n\
    exchange of resources like feed and manure.\nBased on the information collected\
    \ by the IDCON, The APED and the IIFA are en-\nvisaged as smart services for in-ﬁeld\
    \ operations and data analysis. According to the\ncharacteristics of plant pathogens,\
    \ efﬁcient plant disease management requires a high\ndensity of spatial and temporal\
    \ information regarding the condition of any parameter\nrelated to the crop growth\
    \ [99]. Hyperspectral images combined with ground sensors can\nidentify host–pathogen\
    \ interactions at an early stage. This fact can simplify the complexity\nof the\
    \ identiﬁcation and the quantiﬁcation of different kinds of stress factors that\
    \ may result\nin crop anomalies [100]. Moreover, data mining techniques [101]\
    \ (ML methods like artiﬁcial\nneural networks or support vector machines (SVM))\
    \ can be leveraged since they have\nproved to be superior for distinguishing in\
    \ between more than one type of stress factors\nand different diseases [102].\
    \ The integration of ground sensor data provided by SST and\nimage data provided\
    \ by ASSM in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\nand data mining\
    \ techniques will constitute the core of APED services. IIFA services besides\n\
    the integration between ground sensor data provided by SST and image data provided\
    \ by\nASSM will also incorporate data from WCCF. This holistic integration of\
    \ drought-causative\ninformation (precipitation) and drought-responsive information\
    \ (vegetation condition,\ncrop anomaly) aim to develop specialized variations\
    \ of well known vegetation indexes\n(e.g., normalized difference vegetation index)\
    \ (i) for superior drought monitoring and (ii)\nfor early indication of any decrease\
    \ in crop production associated with drought or lack of\nnutrients [103].\nA dashboard\
    \ will be the human–machine interface for delivering the information com-\ning\
    \ from the WCCF, and to make suggestions and recommendations based on the captured\n\
    satellite, meteorological and climate-related information. Concurrently, the dashboard\n\
    could also digest the information stemming from the meteorological stations, which\
    \ are\ninstalled at the ﬁeld, in order to provide short-term predictions and suggestions.\n\
    Recent political priorities in Europe aim to rationalize agricultural production,\
    \ reduce\npollution, upgrade the environment, maintain rural infrastructures and\
    \ meet new societal\nconcerns, such as product quality and animal welfare. For\
    \ example, soil testing has been\nproven to be a valuable tool for evaluating\
    \ the available nutrient status of soil. The soil\ninvestigation is exceptionally\
    \ useful for cultivators to discover which sort of harvests to\nbe developed in\
    \ a speciﬁc soil condition and helps to determine the proper amount of\nnutrients\
    \ to be added to a given soil based on its fertility and crop needs. The intensiﬁcation\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n66\nof livestock operations in the last few decades has resulted\
    \ in increased social concern over\nthe environmental impacts of livestock operations,\
    \ and thus making appropriate manure\nmanagement decisions is increasingly important.\
    \ Animal manure is a valuable resource\nif handled responsibly but a source of\
    \ serious challenges and public health concerns\nif managed inappropriately. Risks\
    \ associated with animal manure handling could be\nrelated to soil, water and\
    \ air quality. A socially acceptable manure management system\nthat simultaneously\
    \ achieves the pressing environmental objectives while balancing the\nsocio-economic\
    \ welfare of farmers and society at large is needed. Manure management\ndecisions\
    \ involve a number of decision makers with different and conﬂicting views of\n\
    what is acceptable in the context of sustainable development. In order to ensure\
    \ that\nthe proposed schema is complete, this kind of resource management can\
    \ not be ignored.\nFor this reason, MiFarm-CSA introduces ReMA includes a series\
    \ of resource managers to\nprovide the optimal and accurate resource allocation:\n\
    •\nThe Soil Manager (SOMA) aims provide optimal decisions, recommendations and\n\
    case studies on how the soil quality will be maximized. While each of these decisions,\n\
    recommendations and case studies represent possible techniques to effectively\
    \ manage\nsoil resources, each practice will be adequately assessed to identify\
    \ possible constraints\nor drawbacks.\n•\nThe Manure Manager (MAMA) aims to provide\
    \ optimal decisions, recommenda-\ntions and case studies on the manure management\
    \ in Mixed Farming Systems. The\nutilization of livestock manure to add nutrients\
    \ back to the soil is one of the key crop-\nlivestock interactions in MFS. Manure\
    \ when used as a soil amendment can beneﬁt the\nsoil, resulting in crop production\
    \ and resilience beneﬁts for smallholders via increased\nnutrient supply to crops\
    \ and improved soil structure and water holding capacity.\nManure has well-documented\
    \ impacts on soil chemical and physical properties.\n•\nThe Water Manager (WAMA)\
    \ will be able to make optimal decisions on the water\nmanagement on the MFS.\
    \ Improving water use efﬁciency and water management\non mixed farms is arguably\
    \ the most important and high potential improvement\nfor farmers to be climate-smart.\
    \ Optimal water management strategies increase net\nreturns and purchasing power\
    \ parity of households much more than any other and\nperhaps presents the only\
    \ viable pathway to help transition smallholder farmers out\nof poverty.\nDue\
    \ to the withdrawal of market intervention policies, market volatility has increased,\n\
    causing high income risk for specialized farms. Given that both global agricultural\
    \ markets\nand agricultural policies enhanced efﬁciency in producing more of a\
    \ same product, e.g.,\nfavouring economies of scale through intensiﬁcation, enlargement\
    \ and specialization,\nDiMaRa’s goal is to assist MFS to have the ﬂexibility to\
    \ face uncertain climate and market\nconditions. As a service, the DiMaRa should\
    \ be able to gather market-oriented data from\nseveral sources, while compiling\
    \ it using big data analytics for transforming it to knowledge\nand recommendations.\
    \ The purpose of DiMaRa lies in three axes:\n•\nAggregate accurate and timely\
    \ climate and market information (weather, demand,\nsupply and prices);\n•\nProcess\
    \ and analyze it in a way such that it will be transformed into usable knowledge\n\
    (intelligence) using big data analytics;\n•\nDisseminate it to mixed farming stakeholders\
    \ through web and mobile applications.\nData aggregation could encompass (i) data\
    \ from WCCF, (ii) information about the\nprices of commodities which are directly\
    \ or indirectly related to mixed farming ecosys-\ntems [104], (iii) data from\
    \ Agriculture Market Information Services (AMIS), which consti-\ntute another\
    \ source of interest with rich agriculture-related data [105] and (iv) data coming\n\
    from Google marketing tools such as Google Trends and Google Keyword Tool, which\
    \ will\nbe utilized to capture near-real time data for trends in the ﬁeld of agriculture.\n\
    Moreover, the complete MiFarm-CSA architecture with the four layers and their\n\

    4. The Expected Beneﬁts of Mifarm-CSA Architecture\nCSA addresses the challenges\
    \ which climate change poses to agricultural production.\nMiFarm-CSA constitutes\
    \ an efﬁcient CSA-driven architecture which forms a user-oriented,\nsocial-aware\
    \ and ecological platform, deployed as a service. Its main beneﬁts are outlined\n\
    as follows:\n•\nIncreasing agricultural productivity and income while also enhancing\
    \ resilience or\nadaptation of livelihoods and ecosystems towards climate extremes.\
    \ Through the\nIDCON, SECF and MFaS layers, the proposed architecture exploits\
    \ multi-disciplinary,\non-ﬁeld and off-ﬁeld data, to train the novel DSS, thereby\
    \ enabling it to make optimal\ndecisions, which are expected to boost MFS productivity\
    \ and stakeholders’ incomes.\nMoreover, through DiMaRa, MiFarm-CSA is anticipated\
    \ to provide MFS the ﬂexibility\nto face uncertain climate and market conditions.\n\
    •\nIncreasing synergies among different farming systems by adopting new data collection\n\
    and monitoring technologies, such as smart sensors, robots, UAVs, advanced tracking\n\
    systems, long-range IoT-enabled sensors, middleware and gateways. The IDCON\n\
    layer provides the cutting-edge technologies for applications in MFS: IoT sensors,\n\
    devices, modern UAVs and FANETs, which aspire to be fully autonomous and multi-\n\
    collective, supporting, advanced processing and integration functionalities and\
    \ are\ncapable of covering large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data\
    \ in near real\ntime. The autonomy is twofold: the energy autonomy will be accomplished\
    \ by\nTelecom 2021, 2\n68\ndeploying energy harvesting techniques for recharging\
    \ sensors and UAVs and by\ndeﬁning a pilot-sensitive energy-budget approach for\
    \ each data collection technology.\n•\nSpeeding up the establishment of a community\
    \ of practice and dynamic methodology\nin designing, developing and evaluating\
    \ mixed and integrated farming systems.\nMiFarm-CSA adopts innovative human factor\
    \ approaches and methodologies to\nchampion social and behavioral aspects and\
    \ to prioritize the role of the human in the\ntechnological development. By exploiting\
    \ SCOPE in the proposed architecture, the\naim is to facilitate a comparison between\
    \ the current ways in which mixed farming\nand agroforestry are conducted and\
    \ future ways which better account for the socio-\ntechnical system as described\
    \ by SCOPE. This whole approach enables MiFarm-CSA\nto assess the inadequacies\
    \ of the current treatment of social and behavioral issues\nand ensure that the\
    \ emerged outcomes are built around the identiﬁed social and\nbehavioral aspects\
    \ of mixed farming and agroforestry. CoP will involve a multi-actor\nand trans-disciplinary\
    \ group of end users. SLO relates to the continued acceptance\nof a set of business\
    \ practices or operating procedures by a stakeholders. Moreover,\nSLO ensures\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social and\nbehavioral\
    \ change.\n•\nForming a basis for the creation of a conceptual framework to analyze\
    \ crop-livestock\nintegration by fostering core interactions among animals, grasslands\
    \ and crops, de-\nveloping metabolic analysis of material ﬂows, devising a biodiversity\
    \ approach for\nthe development of integrated crop-livestock systems and promoting\
    \ social resources\nand stakeholder interactions.\n•\nPrescribing a rich suite\
    \ of user-friendly MFS applications and services for fostering the\noptimal combination\
    \ of production, accurate climate change estimations and optimal\ndecisions on\
    \ local and national levels.\n5. Case Study\nThe proposed architecture envisages\
    \ upgrading, in terms of sustainability, areas where\ndifferent agricultural systems,\
    \ such as crops, livestock and forestry, coexist. For the purpose\nof the paper,\
    \ a case study was considered in the area of the Western Macedonia, Greece for\n\
    evaluating the components of MiFarm-CSA architecture.\nThe area of interest is\
    \ located in a region of Western Macedonia in Greece, called\nGrevena. It is a\
    \ mountainous area which is surrounded by a forest and includes a wide\nvariety\
    \ of ﬂora, including fruit trees, grapevine, berries and vegetables. Nearby the\
    \ forest,\nthere is rich livestock activity by local farmers. The main challenges\
    \ raised in this area are\nsummarized as follows:\n•\nClimate change has affected\
    \ the biodiversity of the area, having negative impacts on\nthe yield production\
    \ and the soil quality.\n•\nHigh operational and labor costs (energy needs, animal\
    \ feeding) add a lot of pressure\nto farming businesses.\n•\nThe extensive use\
    \ of chemical inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) has negatively affected\nthe\
    \ water cycle.\n•\nThe animal waste management is not sufﬁcient, leading to negative\
    \ environmental\neffects and waste of resources.\n•\nThe lack of forestry woodland\
    \ management results in high risks of things such as\nwildﬁres.\n•\nLow cooperation\
    \ between local farming businesses due to a poor local market.\n•\nA wide skill\
    \ gap between each kind of system, deteriorating the objective of collabora-\n\
    tion considerably.\n•\nTechnological deﬁciencies, as farmers are not aware of\
    \ modern monitoring and surveil-\nlance methods to reduce their labor costs.\n\
    •\nAbsence of local professional groups in MFS rules out the possibility of combining\n\
    local agricultural and livestock practices.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n69\nThese challenges\
    \ hinder the local farmers and stakeholders from further extending and\nutilizing\
    \ their resources. In addition, farmers and stakeholders are quite skeptical towards\n\
    changing—and therefore increasing their proﬁts and sustainability—to a collaborative\n\
    farming scheme such as MFS.\nWithin MiFarm-CSA, the cooperation between the forest,\
    \ the local farms and the\nlocal stakeholders will be fostered by applying the\
    \ EVAM methodology in integrating\nsustainable agriculture, livestock and forestry\
    \ combinations. The rationale behind this lies\nin products’ attractiveness (high\
    \ nutritionally valuable products, longer shelf life of dairy\nproducts), Protected\
    \ Designation of Origin (PDO) products and livestock welfare (animal\nimmunological\
    \ status enhancement and efﬁcient animal breeding systems). Through the\nIDCON\
    \ layer a variety of combinations of mixed farming solutions will be monitored,\n\
    resulting in providing valuable data that can be further analyzed to reveal interesting\n\
    correlations that would be impossible to discover otherwise. Moreover, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    using SECF and MFaS, is expected to reduce the environmental footprint of the\
    \ system,\ndecrease input and management costs and increase the system’s overall\
    \ productivity. In\ndetail, it is expected to contribute to the decrease of atmospheric\
    \ CO2 pollution and to\nthe mitigation of global warming, through the carbon sequestration\
    \ process. In order\nto achieve it, the proposed architecture will exploit forestry\
    \ and managed woodland\nin-between the cultivation and grazing lands and the livestock\
    \ wastes so as to increase\ncarbon sequestration. Moreover, an additional increase\
    \ of the total volume of woodland\nbiomass will further increase the carbon sequestration.\
    \ Furthermore, weed management\ncost is expected to decrease with the use of animal\
    \ grazing, which leads to a reduction\nof machine hours required as an indirect\
    \ measurement of fossil fuel consumption, and\nthe use of mulched woodland material\
    \ can decrease the evaporation of soil water and\nconsequently reduce the irrigation\
    \ water volume. Last but not least, the animal waste usage\nin crop cultivation\
    \ will increase its quality, decrease use of chemicals and also decrease\ntransportation\
    \ costs. Through SECF and MFaS, the mixed treatments will aim to rationalize\n\
    agricultural production; reduce pollution and protect the environment; maintain\
    \ rural\ninfrastructure; and meet emerging social concerns, such as product quality\
    \ and animal\nwelfare. Besides the increases in animal feed supply and system\
    \ productivity, which lead,\non the one hand to income increase, and on the other\
    \ hand to decreases in operational\ncosts, a positive side-effect of this collaboration\
    \ is that job opportunities are expected to\nincrease, since more disciplines\
    \ will be required to handle the system’s complexity.\n6. Conclusions\nThe food\
    \ supply chain is a key strategic sector globally, from both economic and labor\n\
    perspectives. This sector is also critical to meet the great societal challenges\
    \ of sustainable\nfarming, food security, food safety and healthy nutrition, now\
    \ and in the future, which\nconstitute without a doubt the most important priorities\
    \ for both citizens and policy makers.\nNevertheless, agriculture is at a crossroads\
    \ on a global level. The increasing digitalization\nof agricultural practices\
    \ makes it possible to produce plant and animal products with ever\nhigher efﬁciency\
    \ and ever lower environmental impact. Therefore, the agri-food sector\nis expected\
    \ to become more and more data-driven by the use of ICT, while the need for\n\
    AgTech-enabled innovation will become greater than ever. A number of technologies\n\
    not traditionally used in the agri-food sector are now starting to play a key\
    \ role in what\nis perceived as an AgTech revolution. Automation, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ drones, big\ndata and cloud analytics offer us the opportunity to further our\
    \ mastery of agriculture.\nThe Industrial Revolution 4.0 is expected to generate\
    \ disruptive changes in agricultural\npractices and pave the way for new innovative\
    \ ideas that aspire to obtain market share\nfrom a billion dollar market. This\
    \ ICT-revolution is expected to further advance and evolve\nsmart farming/smart\
    \ agriculture, including CSA and precision agriculture.\nIn this work, a multi-actor\
    \ architecture introduced as a reference for the innovative\nconcept of CSA was\
    \ applied in integrated agricultural systems, such as MFS. The proposed\narchitecture\
    \ aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-oriented architec-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n70\nture, enhanced with models, tools, frameworks and cutting-edge\
    \ solutions, for advancing\nthe current farming system to a smart, resilient and\
    \ integrated/mixed farming ecosystem,\naiming at increasing the resilience of\
    \ the underlying farms, crops, livestock and forestry\nagainst the negative impacts\
    \ of the climate change. The next step of this work is to conduct\na qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of the performance of the proposed architecture in\n\
    the two pilots, based on speciﬁc KPIs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    computers that communicate by linking entities and \nproducing information. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) \nis the next generation of the Internet that integrates\

    \ \nand \nintelligent \ntechnologies for the purpose of handling and \nprocessing\
    \ information (Li et al., 2016). The power \nof the IoT does not only consist\
    \ of remote control. \nAnother important benefit of connecting objects is \nthe\
    \ possibility for smart objects to access any kind of \ninformation through the\
    \ Internet, information that \ncan be exploited to improve the service offered\
    \ to \nend-users (Husein, 2019; Righetti et al., 2018). The \nnetworking giant's\

    \ estimates that there will be \nmore than 12 billion connected mobile devices\
    \ \nacross the world by 2022, up from nine billion today \n(Dhanda et al., 2019).\
    \ \nThe Internet is continuously developing as \nexpected, but recently it has\
    \ developed additional \nthan merely a connected grid of workstations, but a \n\
    network of many devices (Husein, 2019). The IoT \nfunctions as a network of different\
    \ ‘connected’ \ndevices, or a network of networks (Miraz et al., \n2018), as revealed\
    \ in Fig. 1. Currently, appliances \nsuch as smartphones, vehicles, industrial\
    \ systems, \nhealthcare appliances, cameras, toys, buildings, \nhome appliances,\
    \ industrial systems, and countless \nothers can all make up part of the information\
    \ \nshared in excess of the Internet. Irrespective of their \ndimensions and utilities,\
    \ these policies can perform \nindustrial \nreformations, \ntracking, \nlocating,\
    \ \ncontrolling, real-time monitoring, and \nprocess \ncontrolling. There has\
    \ been a significant increase in \nInternet-enabled \ndevices. \nEven \nhowever\

    \ technology field, seen in \nthe rebellion of smartphones and wearable devices,\

    \ joining persons has \nbecome simply one part of a higher movement \ntowards\
    \ the fusion of the digital and physical worlds \n(Husein, 2019). The IoT is projected\
    \ to continue \nexpanding its influence, which will affect the \nappliances and\
    \ utilities that it can track. This is \nobvious from the uncertainty in the appearance\
    \ of \n‘things,’ which makes it challenging to plan the \nincreasing limits of\
    \ the IoT (Husein, 2019). The IoT \nmarks the first real evolution of the Internet.\
    \ This \npaper aims to review current applications and \nchallenges associated\
    \ with IoT adoption. Section 2 \ndiscusses \nelements \nof \nthe \nIoT’s \npotential\
    \ \napplications. This is followed by Section 3, which \ndiscusses various IoT\
    \ challenges and issues. Finally, \na conclusion is drawn in Section 4. \n \n\
    \ \nFig. 1: IoT as a network of network (Husein, 2019) \n \n2. Prospective application\
    \ domains of IoT \nThe number of IoT applications is progressively \ngrowing and\
    \ promises to bring immense value to our \nlives. With newer wireless networks,\
    \ superior \nsensors, and revolutionary computing capabilities, \nthe IoT could\
    \ be the next frontier in the race for a \nshare of the wallet. The following\
    \ is a discussion of \nthe potential applications of the IoT that can be \napplied\
    \ in many areas. \n2.1. Smart cities and urbanization \nThe number of IoT applications\
    \ for smart cities is \ngradually increasing. Progressively more cities are \n\
    installing sensors and actuators to hypothetically \nimplement all the actions\
    \ that are voted for in the \ncity. Such strategies classically connect using\
    \ end to \nend wireless connections and generate a kind of \npassageway system\
    \ saturating the city. Eco-friendly \nobserving, traffic monitoring, smart parking,\
    \ smart \nfollowing, and hands-on sensing are some of the \nunbiased collection\
    \ applications previously applied \nin many cities. A brief summary of these applications\
    \ \nis provided below, emphasizing their benefits for the \npopulace but also\
    \ highlighting their possible fears. \nDue to space limitations, a limited number\
    \ of \napplications are mentioned (Kumar et al., 2019). \nAccording to Sodhro\
    \ et al. (2018), IoT provides an \nessential aspect of the elegance of cities\
    \ and \nimproving their overall structure. Some aspects of \nthe utilization of\
    \ the IoT in constructing industrial \ncities consist of industrial construction,\
    \ traffic \njamming (Woznowski et al., 2016; Soomro et al., \n2018), waste management\
    \ (Mahmud et al., 2018), \nindustrial transportation systems (Woznowski et al.,\
    \ \n2016), industrial lighting, industrial car parks, and \ntown maps. These may\
    \ comprise seemingly different \nfunctionalities, for instance, observing existing\
    \ car \npark spaces inside the town, observing phenomena \nand the measurable\
    \ conditions of links and \nEducation\n \nInternet of Things \nTransport\n \n\
    Energy\n \nHome\n \nOthers\n \nEarth\n \nBusiness\n \nIndividual Networks \nConnected\
    \ Together \nWith Security, Analytics, and management \nShakir Khan, Mohammed\
    \ Altayar/International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages:\
    \ 104-113 \n106 \n \nbuildings, placing rigorous checking devices in \nhouses\
    \ in sensitive parts of cities, and detecting \nnumbers of walkers and means of\
    \ transportation. An \nartificial intelligence (AI) collective using the IoT has\
    \ \nthe ability to report on important challenges \nmodeled by some city groups,\
    \ which consist of traffic \norganization, healthcare, energy disasters, and \n\
    several other issues. This can improve the lives of \nthe residents and businesses\
    \ in a smart city. Before \ndiving into the joining part, let us discover some\
    \ of \nthe mechanisms of smart cities. A smart town has \ncountless use cases\
    \ for AI-driven IoT supported \ntechnology, \nfrom \nconserving \nan \nimproved\
    \ \nenvironment \nto \nenhancing \ncommunity \ntransportation and security. The\
    \ application of the \nIoT to accomplish smart cities would require \nsystematic\
    \ radio-frequency identification. According \nto Husein (2019), being equipped\
    \ with interrelated \ndevices and actuators is a component of a machine \nthat\
    \ is responsible for moving and controlling a \nmechanism or system to observe\
    \ any activity inside \na building. Most actions will be computerized based \n\
    on data collected by sensors and/or inclinations \ncommunicated by the user or\
    \ concluded by the \nclassification itself. \n2.2. Medical care \nThe IoT healthcare\
    \ network or the IoT network \nfor health care (hereafter ‘the IoThNet’) is one\
    \ of the \nmain components of the IoT in health care. It \nsupports access to\
    \ the IoT’s strengths, facilitates the \ncommunication and treatment of medical\
    \ data, and \nenables \nthe \nuse \nof \nhealthcare-tailored \ncommunications.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 2, this section \ndiscusses the IoThNet topology, architecture,\
    \ and \nplatform (Zhu et al., 2010). It should be seen that the \nplanned architectures\
    \ in Grønbæk (2008) and Dagar \net al. (2018) can be well-thought-out as a good\
    \ \nstarting point for a growing understanding of the IoT \nnetwork. \nHealthcare\
    \ \norganizations \nin \nseveral \ncountries are not capable, in their resources\
    \ and \ntraining, and can make mistakes. This can efficiently \nbe transformed\
    \ with the application of smart \nstrategies that can be computerized and upgraded\
    \ \nthrough \nequipment. \nFurther, \nequipment \nthat \nsimplifies processes\
    \ effortlessly, such as reporting \non the distribution of people and area, record\
    \ \nprotection, and distributing medicines, would go a \nlong way in altering\
    \ the medical field. \n \n \nFig. 2: IoT healthcare network (IoThNet) (Čolaković\
    \ and Hadžialić, 2018) \n \nIoT devices tagged with sensors are utilized for \n\
    tracking the real-time position of the medical \napparatus, \nsuch \nas \nwheelchairs,\
    \ \nnebulizers, \ndefibrillators, oxygen pumps, and other observing \nequipment.\
    \ The placement of medical staff at diverse \nlocations can also be examined in\
    \ real-time (Sodhro \net al., 2018). The use of the IoT in healthcare allows \n\
    for the automation of processes that have previously \ntaken time; these processes\
    \ previously allowed \nhuman \nerror. \nFor \nexample, \nnowadays, \nmany \nhospitals\
    \ use connected devices to control the \nairflow and temperature in operating\
    \ theatres. The \nadvantages of IoT in healthcare are seemingly \nendless, but\
    \ these are just a few of the major \nbenefits. The improvements in the IoT and\
    \ the \nInternet of Everything are, moreover, being drawn \nout slowly, as shown\
    \ by the emergence of the \nInternet of Nano-Things (IoNT) (Husein, 2019; Miraz\
    \ \net al., 2018). As the label suggests about the concept \nof the IoNT, is actuality\
    \ planned by incorporating \nnano-sensors in different substances (things) to\
    \ \nmake up nanonetworks. Healing deployment, as \ndisplayed in Fig. 3, is one\
    \ of the first motivations for \nthe development of the IoNT. \n2.3. Agriculture\
    \ sector  \nSmart agriculture is the application of several \ntypes of machinery\
    \ and devices such as the Internet, \ncloud, and IoT devices (Kamienski et al.,\
    \ 2018a). As \nthe population of the world is growing and it is \nexpected to\
    \ be around 9.7 billion by 2050, to nourish \nthose billions of people, we must\
    \ advance the \nproduction of food. On the other hand, the farmed \nland is being\
    \ reduced because of various issues, \nincluding mechanization, commercial markets,\
    \ and \nhousing construction taking place on farmland. \nHowever, to feed those\
    \ billions, we require an \nincrease in agriculture, and this can be accomplished\
    \ \nby using the IoT. Smart agriculture is also known as \nprecision agriculture.\
    \ The current farming situation \nis not appreciated by agriculturalists for many\
    \ \nreasons, including pest attacks, plant sickness, lack \nof knowledge of vital\
    \ supplements for the yields, and \nTopology\n \nArchitecture\n \nPlatform\n \n\
    IoT Healthcare Network\n \nPhysical configuration, application \nscenarios, activities\
    \ and use cases\n \nSoftware organisation of system as a \nwhole and hierarchical\
    \ model reflecting \n Library, framework and environment\nShakir Khan, Mohammed\
    \ Altayar/International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages:\
    \ 104-113 \n107 \n \nnumerous other difficulties. In order to remove these \n\
    difficulties and make agriculture more profitable, \nsmart, and approachable for\
    \ agriculturalists, they \nneed high-tech advancement. \n \n \nFig. 3: The internet\
    \ of nano-things (Husein, 2019) \n \nOld-style agriculture and precision agriculture\
    \ \nare different from each other in every way. Old-style \nagriculture practices\
    \ the old and outdated methods \nof cultivation, employing those ancient devices\
    \ for \nwork and planting regular crops without any \nevaluation of difficulties\
    \ in the market, rates, or \nclimate reports. Smart farming uses innovative \n\
    technologies, including smart connected devices, IoT \ndevices, the Internet,\
    \ communication, and the \nperiodical evaluation of many factors, such as the\
    \ \nbest circumstances for vegetables to grow, what \nnutrients are required,\
    \ soil excellence, and water \nsuperiority \nchecks. \nSmart \nagriculture \n\
    makes \nagriculture easy and inexpensive (cost-effective), \nreduces labor costs,\
    \ increases harvest yields, and \ndelivers healthier production. As discussed\
    \ by \nHusein (2019) and Veena et al. (2018), the IoT has \nthe capability of\
    \ supporting the improvement of the \nagricultural sector by investigating soil\
    \ humidity \nlevels and, in the case of wineries, observing the \nstem diameters.\
    \ The IoT would enable agriculturists \nto maintain and control the number of\
    \ vitamins set \nup in farming yields and to control microclimate \ncircumstances\
    \ in order to create the best growth and \nexcellence of root vegetables and fruits.\
    \ Additionally, \nconsidering the current climate circumstances, the \nIoT would\
    \ allow for the prediction of incoming rain \nor snow, deficiencies, and wind\
    \ variations, thus \nallowing for temperature and moisture levels to be \nadjusted\
    \ to stop fungus and other microbial \npollutants. \n2.4. Smart water management\
    \ \nA water shortage is the absence of adequate \nexisting water resources to\
    \ meet the requirements of \nwater usage inside a province, which is, according\
    \ to \nthe \nUnited \nNations \nDevelopment \nProgramme, \nproduced mostly by\
    \ unsuccessful management of \nresources, disturbing around 1.2 billion individuals\
    \ \nin various parts of the world. The IoT, as a system, \ncomprehends countless\
    \ possibilities to resolve \nsevere problems in numerous aspects of our \neveryday\
    \ life, including water shortages, via smart, \ninstantaneous, and expected management.\
    \ In each \npart of the water cycle, the IoT can be useful to make \nwater \n\
    resources \nhealthier \nand \nachieve \nwell-\norganized and optimal outcomes.\
    \ \nAs clarified by Husein (2019), Veena et al. (2018), \nKamienski et al. (2018b),\
    \ and Kor et al. (2016), \nmoreover, a town can be smart when they have \nhomes\
    \ that are also smart in terms of waste \ncontrolling, energy preserving, water\
    \ preserving, \nand environment preserving. IoT equipment also has \nadvantages\
    \ in developing the maintenance and \ncontrol of pumps on a systematic basis for\
    \ correctly \ncontrolling the use of water. The SWAMP project \nprogresses IoT-based\
    \ methods and tactics for smart \nwater control in the precision irrigation domain\
    \ and \nguides them in Italy, Spain, and Brazil. IoT and other \ntechnologies\
    \ are the accepted choice for smart water \ncontrol applications, and the SWAMP\
    \ project is \npredicted to verify the suitability of IoT in actual \nsurroundings\
    \ with the arrangement of on-site pilots. \n2.5. \nSupply \nchain, \nretail, \n\
    and \nproducts \nmanagement  \nAn \noriginal \nsignificant \nillustration \nof\
    \ \nan \nindustrialized IoT submission is managing the \nstrategy and inventory\
    \ series. RFIDs can be allocated \ntowards substances besides recycled to recognize\
    \ \nsupplies and belongings, including clothes, fixtures, \napparatus, foodstuff,\
    \ and water (Villanueva et al., \nShakir Khan, Mohammed Altayar/International\
    \ Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n108 \n\
    \ \n2012; Borgia, 2014). Their usage supports efficiency \nin warehouses and trades\
    \ and streamlining records \nby giving precise facts of the present record while\
    \ \ndecreasing record mistakes. The whole lifecycle of \nsubstances can be followed\
    \ (Cai et al., 2014; Borgia, \n2014). For instance, RFID readers connected in\
    \ the \nmanufacturing plant enable the screening of the \nmanufacturing procedure,\
    \ and the tag can be marked \nout all over the whole inventory sequence (e.g.,\
    \ \nwrapping, shipping, loading, sale to the consumer, \nthrowing away). Forward-thinking\
    \ IoT systems, self-\npossessed of RFID-furnished substances and shrewd \ndevices\
    \ tracing substances in actual, may help by \nsubstantially decreasing unwanted,\
    \ thus reducing \ncosts and enlightening turnover restrictions for both \nmerchants\
    \ and producers. According to Borgia \n(2014), an estimated 8.3% drop in sales\
    \ has been \npredicted if drops keep on partly allowed of goods. \nInadequate\
    \ production and excessive production \nmay decrease radically by using an accurate\
    \ \nevaluation of desired substances, which can be \nconditional by investigating\
    \ data composed by \nshrewd tags (Gruen et al., 2002). Additionally, the \nreal-time\
    \ investigation by sensors permits the \nclassification of product decline procedures\
    \ for \nfoodstuff and water with dynamic significance. Such \nas confirming the\
    \ bloom of decayable (e.g., fruits, \nroot vegetables, icy food), devices may\
    \ endlessly \nscreen heat plus moisture privileged storage \ncontainers or freezers,\
    \ and controllers may adjust \nthese, creating ideal management of the enclosed\
    \ \nfood. In addition, product reliability may be \nimproved \nwith \nRFID \n\
    founded \nvalidation \ndevelopments. Supplementary fascinating IoT bids \nare\
    \ smart supermarket run coordination. Such \nsystems observe operators’ buying\
    \ behaviors by \ntracing their portable phones and direct them in \nfactories/superstores/malls\
    \ to reduced items or \nservice in loose expense processes (e.g., spontaneous\
    \ \ncheck-out exhausting bionomics) (Borgia, 2014). \nUsing the IoT also supports\
    \ repairs and renovations \nbecause engineers can be sent to homes that forecast\
    \ \ntool failures and, at the same time, periodic repairs \ncan be automatically\
    \ scheduled before there is an \nequipment malfunction. This can be attained through\
    \ \nthe installing of tags in classified equipment or \ntechnology to screen performance\
    \ and occasionally \nguide information (Borgia, 2014; Tadejko, 2015). \n2.6. Smart\
    \ living  \nA smart living will incorporate the following: \nsmart \nhome \ncomputerization,\
    \ \nprotection, \nand \nsecurity. Smart sensors can be employed to bring \ntogether\
    \ important data about the home. For \ninstance, smart sensors could save data\
    \ about \ntenants and landowners’ temperature choices, \nfollowed by applicable\
    \ variations. Samsung has \nlaunched the Smart Home Ecosystem, which \nconnects\
    \ \nhome \ndevices \n(e.g., \nTV \nset, \nhome \nappliances, and smartphones)\
    \ by means of a single \nincorporated platform. These devices can be \norganized\
    \ by users with an application that connects \nthe devices in a household. Samsung\
    \ SmartThings \nStarter Kit offers the whole setup required to make a \nsmart\
    \ home. It is iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile \nfriendly. The SmartThings Starter\
    \ Kit offers the \nfollowing functionalities: (i) home observation from \neverywhere;\
    \ (ii) home control with an app; (iii) \nhome safety and security from loss and\
    \ threat; and \n(iv) scalability by developing hundreds of well-\nmatched \nsmart\
    \ \ndevices \nto \nboost \nhome \ncomputerization. Its components include a pivot\
    \ to \nattach smart sensors, decorations, locks, cameras, a \ngesture sensor to\
    \ observe effort in the home, a multi-\nsensor to observe whether doors, frames,\
    \ drawers, \nor garages are exposed or locked, an occurrence \nsensor to recognize\
    \ when individuals, animals, and \ncars come to or leave home and a power channel\
    \ to \nrheostat lights, electronics, and small appliances. The \nSmart Home Cloud\
    \ API (Dastbaz et al., 2017) offers \napproaches to switch and display Samsung\
    \ Smart \nHome operations. Through this Smart Home Control \nService, a partner’s\
    \ product can unite with numerous \ndevices and provide better services to their\
    \ \npurchaser. This service functions from end to end \nwith cloud-to-cloud incorporation\
    \ between the \npartner cloud and the Smart Home cloud. This is \nenabled by the\
    \ running of numerous REST APIs by \nSamsung for associates, so they are able\
    \ to \ncoordinate with the Samsung Smart Home cloud. The \nbody of the REST API\
    \ utilizes a standard JSON \ncertificate (called Smart Home Data), which means\
    \ \nthat associate developers are required to know the \nJSON document (Dastbaz\
    \ et al., 2017). Besides this, \nsmart homes are expected to evolve significantly\
    \ and \nwill be able to anticipate and meet the needs of their \nowners or occupants,\
    \ even without being asked. For \nexample, the AI devices will be able to know\
    \ what \nmusic a person wants to hear at a certain time of the \nday and play\
    \ it for them and will check their daily \ntask schedule and reset the alarm daily\
    \ according to \nthis schedule. When the person wakes up, the \nbathtub will be\
    \ prepared and filled with water that \nmatches the person's body temperature.\
    \ Also, Smart \nHome applications as one of the elements of smart \ncities \n\
    are \nindividually \nthe \nmost \ndemanded \napplication without question. Moreover,\
    \ washing \nmachines can permit one to monitor laundry \ndistantly. Additionally,\
    \ an extensive range of kitchen \nappliances can be reached via a smartphone,\
    \ hence \nmaking it conceivable to regulate temperature, as in \nthe case of a\
    \ microwave. Microwaves that have a \nself-cleaning component can be checked easily\
    \ as \nwell. In terms of household security, the IoT can be \nuseful for alarm\
    \ arrangements, and cameras can be \nmounted to display and discover when windows\
    \ or \ndoors are opened, thereby stopping trespassers \n(Husein, 2019; Miraz et\
    \ al., 2018). \n2.7. Public safety and environmental monitoring \nThe \nobjective\
    \ \nof \nNative \nand \nnation-wide \ngovernments is to form a protected culture\
    \ by \nensuring community security and by designing crisis \ncontrol precisely.\
    \ The community sanctuary facilities \nShakir Khan, Mohammed Altayar/International\
    \ Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n109 \n\
    \ \ncomprise the preservation of community order, the \navoidance and defense\
    \ of nations, and the protection \nof the community and private belongings. Disaster\
    \ \norganization supports the people in planning for and \nhandling natural or\
    \ artificial tragedies, such as \nbiological leaks, torrents, storms, earthquakes,\
    \ \ncyclones, floods, and the loss of the electrical power \nnetwork \nsupply\
    \ \nto \nan \nend-user. \nThe \nIoT \ncompromises \nelucidations \nfor \nobserving\
    \ \nplus \nundertaking such disaster situations (Borgia, 2014). \nStatistics combined\
    \ from security cameras placed \ninside the town and on individual legal resident’s\
    \ \nstrategies permit continuous cinematic observation \nand defensive observation\
    \ facilities even though \nserving the forces as a mechanism for community \n\
    direction in the circumstance of sporting occasions, \nharmonious shows, and politically\
    \ aware gatherings. \nThe security of isolated, in addition, community \nconstructions\
    \ (e.g., malls, workshops) can be \nprotected with the use of device technology\
    \ that will \nactivate during disturbances. Crisis processes can be \nvalue-added\
    \ \nand \nreinforced \nby \ncustom \nIoT \ntechnologies. Presently, the emergency\
    \ system is \ndeficient in exact facts about disaster sites. Devoted \ndevices\
    \ and smart camcorder along with GPS and to \ncommunicate without using cables\
    \ and wireless \ntechnologies providing real-time localization and \ntracking\
    \ can be used to form a complete map of the \nevent to forecast its trends (e.g.,\
    \ direction and/or \nspeed of fire spread, major risk areas), and thus to \nestablish\
    \ a dynamic emergency plan to coordinate \nthe rescue operations. Let's take an\
    \ example of an \nintensity in an office block somewhere the entry is \nprearranged\
    \ over and done with e-cards. If \nindividuals have to put-down their individual\
    \ access \ncards to cross the threshold of the building, the \nladder man will\
    \ identify the precise digit of persons \nin the construction and anywhere they\
    \ are located (if \nthe structure has a localization scheme) and are \nintelligent\
    \ to escort people in the direction of the \nclosest escape road or to escort\
    \ firefighters to except \nstuck people. Furthermore, records from wireless \n\
    cinematic cameras and other equipment installed on \nthe firefighters’ helmets\
    \ will deliver real-time \nstatistics on the fire development to estimate the\
    \ \nfinest seepage routes and/or construction downfall \ntime. Agitations are\
    \ caused by habiliment sensors on \nfirefighters (Borgia, 2014). \n2.8. IoT for\
    \ physically challenged persons \nIoT can be fantastically helpful for resolving\
    \ the \ndifficulties of physically or specially challenged \npeople in their everyday\
    \ life. Innovative IoT-built \nInternet or network managed applications can be\
    \ \nplanned while observing the strategies of the \nDepartment of Empowerment\
    \ of Persons with \nDisabilities (DEPwD) [Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment],\
    \ which has an ongoing Reachable \nIndia Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan), a\
    \ cross-\ncountry movement to recognize universal suitability \nfor \nPhysically\
    \ \nChallenged \nand \nPersons \nwith \nDisabilities (PwDs) (Chaudhary et al.,\
    \ 2019). Fig. 4 \nshows Figurative Depiction of Applications of IoT for \nPhysically\
    \ Challenged Persons. \n \n \nFig. 4: Figurative depiction of applications of\
    \ IoT for physically challenged persons (Chaudhary et al., 2019) \n \n3. IoT challenges\
    \ \nThe use and adoption of the IoT are likely to \nresult in a number of challenging\
    \ issues that need \nconsideration. This is due to a number of factors, \nincluding\
    \ the mushrooming number and type of \ndevices and sensors, the vast amount of\
    \ sensitive \ndata generated by people and smart objects, and the \ngrowing number\
    \ of emerging products and services \naffecting people’s daily lives (Dixit et\
    \ al., 2015). \nResearchers have addressed various challenges and \nShakir Khan,\
    \ Mohammed Altayar/International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1)\
    \ 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n110 \n \nproblems associated with the IoT. The following\
    \ is a \ndiscussion of these issues. \n \n3.1. Confidentiality, security, and\
    \ privacy issues \nSecurity gaps that occur in traditional IT systems \nare likely\
    \ to be present in the IoT environment but \nnot addressed very well. Since IoT\
    \ devices generate, \ncollect and distribute a huge amount of data, and \npart\
    \ of this data is about users and their behaviors, \ninteractions, and habits,\
    \ it is not surprising to find \nthat security and privacy are some of the most\
    \ \nimportant issues that need consideration (Dixit et al., \n2015; Padyab and\
    \ Ståhlbröst, 2018; Xu et al., 2018; \nHusein, 2019). The adoption of new business\
    \ models \nand applications that are based on the IoT requires \nrobust security\
    \ and privacy measures (Chaudhary et \nal., 2019). This is because the IoT is\
    \ based on the \nexisting wireless sensor networks (WSN); therefore, \nit inherits\
    \ the common security and privacy issues \nassociated with WSN (Husein, 2019).\
    \ According to \nWeber (2010), four broad areas related to security \nand privacy\
    \ requirements must be addressed, \nincluding resistance to attacks, data authentication,\
    \ \nand access control, and client privacy. Similarly, \nother researchers have\
    \ reported a number of \nsecurity and privacy issues, including identification,\
    \ \nconfidentiality, \nintegrity, \nnon-repudiation \nauthentication and authorization,\
    \ cryptographic \nsecurity services, trustworthiness, and the message \nintegrity\
    \ (Vermesan and Friess, 2013; Chaudhary et \nal., 2019; Husein, \n2019). Furthermore,\
    \ \nsome \nresearchers have addressed security and privacy \nissues from a legal\
    \ perspective and suggested that \ndata collection, sharing, and distribution\
    \ via IoT \nsensors, applications, and networks must be \nconducted within existing\
    \ policies, laws, and \nregulations, as there is a lack of laws at national and\
    \ \ninternational levels that govern IoT practices \n(Weber, 2010; Ahlmeyer and\
    \ Chircu, 2016; Ma et al., \n2018). \n3.2. Data management \nThe nature of the\
    \ IoT is dynamic and consists of \ndifferent devices, \nsensors, \nplatforms,\
    \ \nand \napplications that operate across various networks. In \naddition, it\
    \ generates, collects, stores, processes, and \ndistributes huge amounts of data\
    \ across different \nnetworks, \nwhich \nrequires \ndata \nmanagement \nframeworks\
    \ (Borgia, 2014; Padyab and Ståhlbröst, \n2018; Gruen et al., 2002; Alam and Al\
    \ Riyami, 2018). \nThus, the IoT requires dedicated data management \ntechniques\
    \ that fit with its nature. This is because \ntraditional database management\
    \ techniques lag and \nmay not satisfy the complex nature and needs of an \nIoT\
    \ environment that can span global networks \n(Gruen et al., 2002; Husein, 2019).\
    \ At present, most \nframeworks \napply \nan \nintegrated \nsystem \nfor \noffloading\
    \ data and information that conducts \ncomputationally intensive tasks on a worldwide\
    \ \ncloud platform. Thus, several researchers have \nproposed some IoT data management\
    \ frameworks \nfor different purposes. Gruen et al. (2002) have \ndeveloped a\
    \ distributed data management scheme \nfor storing data in an industrial IoT environment.\
    \ \nFurthermore, (Gruen et al., 2002) provided a data \nmanagement framework that\
    \ focuses on three key \nfunctions of handling data: data collection, data \n\
    storage, and data processing. Moreover, Rao and \nShorey (2017) have developed\
    \ a data aggregation \nmodel based on device-to-device data transmission. \nAnother\
    \ issue related to data management is the \navailability of data center technologies\
    \ to manage \ndata. According to Padyab and Ståhlbröst (2018), \nthere is a greater\
    \ need for different aggregate kinds \nof data generated by loT sensors and devices\
    \ in \nsmaller, multiple, distributed data centers so that \ninitial processing\
    \ can be conducted to provide \ncapture and response values in real-time. These\
    \ \ninclude big data centers, distribution data centers, \nand micro data centers.\
    \ \n3.3. Machine-to-machine communication and \nmessaging \nThe nature of the\
    \ IoT requires constant \ncommunication between different kinds of devices \n\
    and other communication systems, which is very \nchallenging (Borgia, 2014; Alam\
    \ and Al Riyami \n2018). In addition, there is no standard for an open \nIoT communication\
    \ protocol, which may further \ncomplicate the communication process (Husein,\
    \ \n2019). Communication protocols are key elements \nfor IoT devices, sensors,\
    \ and applications as they \nrepresent the main support for data flow and traffic\
    \ \namong internal and external networks (Husein, \n2019). Basically, research\
    \ has been focussed on two \nbroad categories related to M2M: The routing issues\
    \ \nand the end to end reliability (Borgia, 2014). While \nseveral MAC protocols\
    \ have been proposed for \ndifferent types of domains with frequency division\
    \ \nmultiple access, carrier sense multiple access, and \ntime division multiple\
    \ access for small traffic \ncompetence that is accident-free, more integrated\
    \ \ncircuits in nodes are correspondingly essential \n(Husein, 2019). Borgia (2014)\
    \ reviewed and \ndiscussed the M2M communications challenges in \nthe context\
    \ of the IoT thoroughly. \n3.4. Interoperability \nThe interoperability issue\
    \ has been widely \nreported \nin \nthe \nIoT \nliterature \n(Padyab \nand \n\
    Ståhlbröst, 2018; Vermesan and Friess, 2013). In the \nIoT environment, interoperability\
    \ among different \nkinds of data, networks, applications, and services is \n\
    a requirement (Borgia, 2014; Díaz et al., 2016). The \nnature \nof \nthe \nIoT\
    \ \nis \nvery \ncomplex, \nand \ninteroperability is a key challenge (Gubbi et\
    \ al., \n2013; Borgia, 2014; Shin and Park 2017). This is due \nto the fact that\
    \ IoT operation requires large and \nvarious devices at different levels; thus,\
    \ it must have \nthe ability to communicate and exchange data \nbetween these\
    \ devices (Padyab and Ståhlbröst, \nShakir Khan, Mohammed Altayar/International\
    \ Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n111 \n\
    \ \n2018; Díaz et al., 2016). In general, there are four \ntypes \nof \ninteroperability:\
    \ \nTechnical, \nsyntactic, \nsemantic, \nand \norganizational \ninteroperability\
    \ \n(Čolaković and Hadžialić, 2018). Another challenging \nissue is how interoperability\
    \ can be achieved across \nlegacy systems, achieving consistent integration and\
    \ \ninteroperability \nof \nvirtual \nand \nreal \nsensors \n(Vermesan and Friess,\
    \ 2013). \n3.5. Reliability, availability, and robustness \nThe reliability and\
    \ availability of an IoT service is \na significant challenge. It depends upon\
    \ the \nconsistency and obtainability of the communication. \nNodes in the IoT\
    \ might experience problems and \nfailure for various reasons, including software\
    \ bugs, \nlimited energy, hardware failure, and malicious \nattacks. Thus, the\
    \ reliability and robustness of \nservices are an important and challenging issue\
    \ \n(Alam and Al Riyami, 2018). The consequence of any \nloss of communication\
    \ may be enormous financial \nfatalities, or it may even risk lives, in the case\
    \ of \nIndustry 4.0 and an intelligent transportation \nsystem, respectively.\
    \ This problem may occur due to \ntwo reasons, either device failure or link failure.\
    \ For \nlink failure, there may be different solutions, but the \nprovision of\
    \ buffering or caching and the use of \ndynamic spectrum access are the prominent\
    \ ones \nthat can be pursued. In the case of device failure, \nredundancy in devices\
    \ can be introduced. This \ncalculation and placement must be done during the\
    \ \nplanning phase (Islam et al., 2015). The same \nsolution can also help in\
    \ the mobile maintenance of \nthe services. The modern IoT as a challenge for\
    \ \nhigher education (Khan, 2018) is the acceptance of \nthe IoT in the industry\
    \ (the so-called Industry \nInternet of Things [IIoT]) and the requirements for\
    \ \nhigher education in the period of the fourth \nindustrial revolution. ‘IIoT’\
    \ is similar to another \nterm, ‘Industry 4.0’. \n3.6. Technological architecture\
    \ issues \nThe IoT is still an evolving practice, and in order \nto utilize it\
    \ effectively, there is a need to develop, \nmaintain and integrate a robust technological\
    \ \narchitecture, including cloud computing, wireless \ntechnologies, artificial\
    \ intelligent sensors, machine \nlearning, blockchain, big data analysis techniques,\
    \ \nserver technologies, and data center technologies, \nwhich is very challenging\
    \ (Borgia, 2014; Čolaković \nand Hadžialić, 2018; Alam and Al Riyami, 2018). IoT\
    \ \nsystems should be developed within open IoT \ntechnological \narchitecture\
    \ \nthat \nensures \nthe \nintegration \nof \nvarious \ntechnologies, \nmobility,\
    \ \nscalability, \ninteroperability, \nopenness, \nand \nmodularity in a heterogeneous\
    \ environment and \nservice continuity (Čolaković and Hadžialić, 2018). \nOverall,\
    \ the technological architecture that needs to \nbe addressed is related to general\
    \ architecture, \nprocess architecture, software architecture, and \nhardware/network\
    \ architecture (Whitmore et al., \n2015; Čolaković and Hadžialić, 2018). \n3.7.\
    \ Standardisation \nTo improve the IoT’s efficiency, it needs to rely on \nunified\
    \ standards, and this is very challenging due to \nthe difficulty in making one\
    \ single standard for the \nIoT around the world (Whitmore et al., 2015). This\
    \ is \nbecause the IoT is a complex system that requires \nthe \nconnection \n\
    and \ninterconnection \nof \nheterogeneous sensors, devices, actuators, software,\
    \ \nsystems, and networks, all of which have their own \nunique protocols to communicate,\
    \ exchange and \nshare data. Although there has been some progress \nregarding\
    \ the development of some standards, for \nexample, Open loT Stack for Java by\
    \ Eclipse's \nfoundation, the ongoing standardization initiative at \nETSI and\
    \ oneM2M, there is still a lack of common \nstandards, which is one of the main\
    \ challenges faced \nby the IoT (Padyab and Ståhlbröst, 2018; Aloi et al., \n\
    2017). According to Gubbi et al. (2013), key \nstandardization bodies such as\
    \ W3C, ITU, ETSI, IETF, \nIEEE, OneM2M, OASIS, and NIST are involved in the \n\
    development of the IoT standards. \n4. Conclusion \n \nIoT is an emerging technology\
    \ that promises to \ndeliver unique services that will impact different \naspects\
    \ of our lives. The multifaceted nature of the \nIoT and its wide dependence on\
    \ a large number of \nvarious devices, objects, technologies, and platforms \n\
    has made it possible to be utilized in different \ndomains and areas of contemporary\
    \ society. This \npaper \nintroduced \na \nreview \nof \nthe \npossible \napplications\
    \ of IoT and its associated challenges. It \nwas \nintended \nto \nprovide \n\
    researchers \nand \npractitioners with some knowledge of the current \nthinking\
    \ about this emerging topic (IoT applications \nand challenges). Since several\
    \ governments around \nthe globe have shown interest in the idea of the IoT \n\
    by providing further funding to the topic that \nenables further investigation,\
    \ several future research \nareas can be outlined. One possible area is how the\
    \ \nIoT can be used in the different areas mentioned in \nthis study. \nAnother\
    \ research avenue could focus on one of \nthe challenging issues associated with\
    \ IoT adoption \nand utilization. Moreover, since IoT applications are \na relatively\
    \ new phenomenon, more research is \nneeded to address how it can be applied in\
    \ different \nareas of our lives, as well as researching challenges \nin different\
    \ countries around the world, such as \nsecurity and privacy issues, data management,\
    \ \nmachine-to-machine \ncommunication, \ninteroperability, \nreliability \nand\
    \ \navailability, \ntechnological \narchitecture \nissues \nand \nstandardization.\

    \a\nAbstract: It took some time indeed, but the research evolution and transformations\
    \ that occurred\nin the smart agriculture ﬁeld over the recent years tend to constitute\
    \ the latter as the main topic\nof interest in the so-called Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) domain. Undoubtedly, our era is characterized\nby the mass production\
    \ of huge amounts of data, information and content deriving from many\ndifferent\
    \ sources, mostly IoT devices and sensors, but also from environmentalists, agronomists,\n\
    winemakers, or plain farmers and interested stakeholders themselves. Being an\
    \ emerging ﬁeld,\nonly a small part of this rich content has been aggregated so\
    \ far in digital platforms that serve as\ncross-domain hubs. The latter offer\
    \ typically limited usability and accessibility of the actual content\nitself\
    \ due to problems dealing with insufﬁcient data and metadata availability, as\
    \ well as their quality.\nOver our recent involvement within a precision viticulture\
    \ environment and in an effort to make\nthe notion of smart agriculture in the\
    \ winery domain more accessible to and reusable from the\ngeneral public, we introduce\
    \ herein the model of an aggregation platform that provides enhanced\nservices\
    \ and enables human-computer collaboration for agricultural data annotations and\
    \ enrichment.\nIn principle, the proposed architecture goes beyond existing digital\
    \ content aggregation platforms\nby advancing digital data through the combination\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence automation and creative\nuser engagement, thus facilitating\
    \ its accessibility, visibility, and re-use. In particular, by using\nimage and\
    \ free text analysis methodologies for automatic metadata enrichment, in accordance\
    \ to the\nhuman expertise for enrichment, it offers a cornerstone for future researchers\
    \ focusing on improving\nthe quality of digital agricultural information analysis\
    \ and its presentation, thus establishing new\nways for its efﬁcient exploitation\
    \ in a larger scale with beneﬁts both for the agricultural and the\nconsumer domains.\n\
    Keywords:\nsmart viticulture; precision viticulture; collaborative platform; data\
    \ aggregation;\nmetadata analysis\n1. Introduction\nOver recent years, the smart\
    \ agriculture sector has evolved tremendously towards the bridging\nof two separate\
    \ worlds: information technologies and primitive agriculture. In this framework,\n\
    smart agriculture followed the general tendency and became part of the so-called\
    \ digital evolution in\nthe form primarily of massive digitization, as well as\
    \ annotation, activities, along with actions towards\nmultimedia content generation\
    \ from all possible sources. The latter resulted into an obvious problem\nof our\
    \ epoch, i.e., the one of information overload. Initiatives to aggregate the digital\
    \ content resulted\nin the solution of the so-called traditional digital platforms.\
    \ Typically, such a traditional platform\noperates as a cross-domain hub, making\
    \ the content accessible to its users, independently on whether\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 149; doi:10.3390/info10040149\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/information\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 149\n2 of 27\nthe latter are considered to be content producers (e.g.,\
    \ farmers or smart agriculture stakeholders) or\nconsumers (e.g., the general\
    \ public). Among the characteristics of the platform is the fact that data and\n\
    information are made available for search and study. Additional applications and\
    \ web services may\nreuse and re-purpose the data, whereas the main strength of\
    \ such platforms lay in the vast number of\ncontent items they contain.\nOf course,\
    \ not all issues are tackled efﬁciently by such a traditional digital platform.\
    \ In most cases,\nthey offer limited usability and accessibility due to their\
    \ insufﬁcient data and metadata quality. As it is\nthe case with many information\
    \ technology sub-domains, there is a variety of factors that affects the\nquality\
    \ of smart agriculture data and metadata:\n•\nlack of structured and rich descriptive\
    \ metadata;\n•\ncomplex, heterogeneous, and multi-channel aggregation workﬂows;\n\
    •\npossible shortcomings in the data providing process (surpassing manual quality\
    \ control of\nautomatic metadata generation in digital repositories);\nThese are\
    \ some of the main causes that result in poor information descriptions. This drawback\n\
    highly affects the accessibility, visibility and dissemination range of the available\
    \ digital content. It also\nlimits the potential of added-value services and applications\
    \ that re-use the available resources in\ninnovative ways, also limiting the overall\
    \ user experience in the process. On top of that, metadata\nquality improvement\
    \ usually faces another important problem, i.e., the problem of scale, since\n\
    improving the metadata quality coming from different sources often requires a\
    \ huge amount of\ntime, effort, and resources that aggregators cannot afford.\n\
    In this framework, metadata enrichment services through automated metadata processing\
    \ and\nfeature extraction, possibly along with crowd-sourcing annotation services,\
    \ available in a centralized\nway through a dedicated platform can offer a remarkable\
    \ opportunity for improving the metadata\nquality of digital smart agriculture\
    \ content stored in such typical platforms, while at the same time\nengaging users\
    \ and raising awareness about smart agriculture assets. In this work, we focus\
    \ on a\nviticulture-friendly (Figure 1), cooperative, content sourcing, publication\
    \ platform, aiming to enrich and\nimprove metadata quality, facilitate the exploration,\
    \ visibility, and promote digital content reprocessing\nthrough various smart\
    \ farming applications. Our project targets various types of users from the\n\
    viticulture domain with different levels of expertise and, in addition, offers\
    \ enriched capabilities\nbased on present resources deploying the platform’s existing\
    \ interfaces. The platform offers metadata\nmanagement and organization in collections\
    \ and introduces the concept of spaces, deﬁned to enable\ndata visualization based\
    \ on various intuitive levels of aggregation. Through linked data principles and\n\
    automated metadata processing services that aim to amend acquirable web resources,\
    \ while improving\nthe quality of metadata. Finally, it offers the possibility\
    \ to interested stakeholders to launch ad-hoc\ncrowd-sourcing campaigns with measurable\
    \ results, thus mobilizing and engaging users to execute\nuseful tasks for the\
    \ enrichment and validation of selected smart agriculture metadata (e.g., by adding\n\
    annotations such as semantic tagging, image tagging, geo-tagging, or by validating\
    \ existing annotations\nthrough up-voting or down-voting within user-friendly\
    \ and engaging ways).\nFinally, the rest of this paper is structured as follows:\
    \ Section 2 provides an overview of the\nsmart agriculture domain by illuminating\
    \ some related pioneer works, as well as illustrating the\noverall precision viticulture\
    \ domain. Section 3 focuses on the design and architecture of the enhanced\nplatform\
    \ and its constituent parts. It also provides a detailed description of the data\
    \ management\napproach in terms of semantic heterogeneity handling (Section 3.1),\
    \ content search and aggregation\nworkﬂow (Section 3.2), including the organization\
    \ and management of content in terms of collections\nand spaces, as well as content\
    \ metadata generation and enrichment methodologies adopted in the\nplatform (Section\
    \ 3.3). Finally, Section 4 concludes the work and addresses a couple of future\
    \ works\nwith respect to the platform’s evolution over time.\nInformation 2019,\

    \ Overview\nOver recent years, big data technologies have pushed high-performance\
    \ computing in the\ndirection of implementing machine learning (ML) for the further\
    \ development of data science\nin multi-disciplinary agri-technologies. Thus,\
    \ several ML models have been deployed within the\nagricultural production systems,\
    \ with their main focus being on approaches dealing mostly with\ncrop management\
    \ through artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) [1]. Smart agriculture, in the form\
    \ of\nmachine learning to sensor data, has evolved into an automated decision\
    \ making under the scope of\nproduction improvement [2]. The correlation of agricultural\
    \ data is based mainly on feature extraction\nrelated to the domain of study and\
    \ deﬁnes the use of proper ML tool and consequently rule setting.\nConsequently,\
    \ ML applications in agriculture tend to require indispensable tools and methods\
    \ that\nmeet the speciﬁcations of the data model that will be deployed in a speciﬁc\
    \ case study.\n2.1. Pioneer Works on Smart Agriculture/viticulture\nNew and emerging\
    \ technologies and methodologies,\nsuch as cloud computing and\ncrowd-sourcing,\
    \ aid today’s farmers towards an overall better performance of their owned farming\n\
    resources. In this framework, the notion of precision agriculture, in general,\
    \ and precision viticulture—\nwhen focusing solely on vineyards—in particular,\
    \ is precision farming applied to optimize the overall\nperformance, while minimizing\
    \ environmental impacts and risk [3]. In viticulture, for instance,\nthis is accomplished\
    \ by measuring local variation in factors that inﬂuence grape yield and quality\n\
    (i.e., soil, topography, micro-climate, vine health) and applying appropriate\
    \ viticulture management\npractices (i.e., trellis design, pruning, fertilizer\
    \ application, irrigation, timing of harvest) [4,5]. Precision\nviticulture is\
    \ based on the premise that high in-ﬁeld variability for factors that affect vine\
    \ growth\nand grape ripening warrants intensive management customized according\
    \ to local conditions. In this\nmanner, Morais et al. [6] studied the effect on\
    \ the quality of the wine of various barrel types during\naging. They developed\
    \ a control protocol for monitoring the chemical composition and quality of\n\
    the produce. The hardware part of the project was implemented through an array\
    \ of sink nodes\nbased on Raspberry Pi model 2, and the software related to the\
    \ development of a prediction model\nwas implemented using the mySENSE IoT platform.\
    \ Morais et al. focused on oxygen consumption\nduring the wine aging process,\
    \ through the discovery of substantial differences between wood barrel\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 149\n4 of 27\ntypes. Remote sensing is a very useful tool for analyzing\
    \ the impact of agro-environmental factors\nin the quality of vine yields. They\
    \ employed satellite-derived prescription maps (PM) from aerial\nimagery through\
    \ the analysis of intra-vineyard variability for vine color (vigor). Normalized\
    \ difference\nvegetation index (NDVI) maps offer surveying capabilities for the\
    \ optimization and further control in\nwine production along with ﬁeld data acquisition.\
    \ They presented a monitoring system that improves\nthe distinctive capability\
    \ for agronomic applications.\nAn application of a real-time monitoring platform\
    \ in viticulture is presented in the work of\nCanete et al. [7]. Their research\
    \ emphasized the control of structural health and ullage of wine\ncasks on the\
    \ wine aging process through detection system for possible crevices on the cask’s\
    \ surface.\nThey managed to gather information from inside the aging containers\
    \ with the introduction of the\nprototype “Smart Cork”, which provides the capability\
    \ to real-time monitor and resolve any issues.\nMore speciﬁcally the sensing device\
    \ was based on IoT technologies and supported by a cloud platform\nand a control\
    \ interface for on-site warning in order to evaluate the suitability of the aging\
    \ process in\nreal time.\nInsular environmental monitoring is a research subject\
    \ was studied by Naumowicz et al. [8].\nThey implemented an IoT platform that\
    \ based on deployed wireless sensor network for three years\ndesign on the scope\
    \ of monitoring seabirds on Skomer Island (UK National Reserve, West Wales).\n\
    Although their application was not speciﬁc to agriculture their research focused\
    \ on the particular\ncharacteristics of insular areas. Their sensory arrangement\
    \ consists of a real-world deployable sensor\nnetwork based on battery powered\
    \ sensor nodes to investigate the habitat of the Manx shearwater\n(Pufﬁnus pufﬁnus)\
    \ seabird.\nMuangprathub et al. [9] proposed an optimization system for water\
    \ supply in agricultural crops.\nThey developed a wireless sensor network infrastructure\
    \ under the scope of controlling and managing\ndata and operations remotely. Furthermore,\
    \ the deployed nodes provided concrete and use full data\nfor irrigation while\
    \ increasing agricultural productivity.\nFinally, to conclude this brief overview\
    \ of related research literature, we should stress the fact\nthat the herein discussed\
    \ approach differs from all the aforementioned depicted in Table 1, in the\nsense\
    \ that it combines on-site soil and atmospheric monitoring based on integrated\
    \ equipment of\nweather instruments. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that\
    \ its gathered data are employed within\na semantic structure for smart viticulture\
    \ through integrated data handling on the scope of current\nstate-of-the-art artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence [10].\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n5 of 27\nTable 1. Overview of\

    \ demand the adoption\nof spatially aware management systems that assist the optimization\
    \ of wine quality and yield.\nAdditionally, technological innovations allow specialized\
    \ vineyard management that promotes high\nquality and reduction of environmental\
    \ impact. Furthermore, further advancements on the ﬁeld\nof applied geography\
    \ and information communication technologies (ICT) enhance the probability\nof\
    \ scientiﬁc leaps in precision viticulture. Novel optimized solutions provide\
    \ a plethora of tools\nfor advanced monitoring and control in vine growth. In\
    \ conclusion, smart viticulture aims at the\nexploitation of methods that identify\
    \ high-resolution spatial variability on vine ﬁelds that provide a\nrecommendation\
    \ basis for improved quality, yield, and sustainable management.\nAgricultural\
    \ impact on the environment is reduced through sustainable and efﬁcient practices\n\
    derived from smart farming that permits the management of various agricultural\
    \ factors along with\nenvironmental preservation. It is based on a management\
    \ approach that estimates the localized needs\nof the vineyards, based on heterogeneous\
    \ structural factors of the yield. The managerial requirements\nevolve around\
    \ the variability on the physiological response, strongly related to grape quality,\
    \ which\nin terms of agronomy it will satisfy the efﬁciency and quality of crop\
    \ production. Vineyard spatial\nvariability directs the development of specialized\
    \ tools that assist monitoring and control vine growth\nthrough. These technological\
    \ solutions are based on remote and proximal sensing sensors that monitor\nvineyard\
    \ status, namely water and nutrient availability, plant health and pathogen attacks,\
    \ or soil\nconditions. More speciﬁcally precision viticulture exploits the widest\
    \ range of available sensory\nobservations to interpret high-resolution spatial\
    \ variability within the vineyard, and assist the efﬁcient\nyield management efﬁciency\
    \ in relation to quality, production, and sustainability.\nThe rise of machine\
    \ learning and artiﬁcial intelligence has offered novel tools for vineyard\nmanagement,\
    \ early pest detection, growth stage and the potential quality of vine grapes\
    \ estimation.\nUnmanned aerial vehicles equipped with red-green-blue (RGB) and\
    \ near infrared (NIR) cameras are\ncommonly used in precision viticulture to acquire\
    \ image data that are used to extract color information\nin terms of various indices\
    \ (e.g., excess green index, excess red index, color index of vegetation\nextraction,\
    \ etc.) that are often used to segment the green vegetation regions in remote\
    \ sensing images.\nComputer vision techniques can be applied on remote sensing\
    \ images to extract various color, shape\nand size related features and vegetative\
    \ indices, to estimate canopy features in the ﬁeld, to estimate\ncluster morphology\
    \ which not only impact the cluster architecture and compactness (leading to looser\n\
    or tighter clusters), but are also considered as indicators of grape and wine\
    \ quality. Machine learning\ntechniques combined with machine vision technology\
    \ has been widely used and studied in agriculture\nto identify and detect plants\
    \ (crops and weeds). In viticulture, machine learning approaches are used\ntypically\
    \ for grape and foliage detection, classiﬁcation of early-stage grape yield estimation,\
    \ whereas\nneural networks are used to classify wine samples into different varieties,\
    \ locations, and years of\nproduction. In the following two subsections, we shall\
    \ investigate further research with respect to two\nimportant traits of precision\
    \ viticulture, namely soil management and yield/quality estimation.\n2.3. Utilization\
    \ of Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nOne of the most important and studied sub-ﬁelds of\
    \ the above is soil management because it\nheavily affects the production and\
    \ outcome of the vineyard. One of the ﬁrst integrated works on\nthe subject is\
    \ from Mehdizadeh et al. [12]; the authors investigated the performance of equations\n\
    and soft computing approaches, implementing 16 empirical equations from temperature-based,\
    \ mass\ntransfer-based, radiation-based, and meteorological parameters-based categories.\
    \ More speciﬁcally\nthey calibrated different types of used empirical equations\
    \ and evaluated their performances in\nestimating ETo (reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (mm day−1)). Thereafter, they addressed the capabilities\nof soft computing\
    \ approaches, including multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), support\n\
    vector machines (SVM) and gene expression programming (GEP) and in result they\
    \ conducted a\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n7 of 27\ncomparative analysis between\
    \ empirical equations and the soft computing approaches. Their ﬁndings\nconcluded\
    \ that precise estimation of ETo is required in many ﬁelds related to water and\
    \ aquatic domain,\nwhile testing the effectiveness of the empirical equations.\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence provides a plethora of methodologies on modeling continuous\
    \ and variable\nenvironmental factors. Feng et al. [13] developed an estimation\
    \ model for daily ETo based on\ntemperature data that introduced two models along\
    \ with extreme learning machine (ELM) and\ngeneralized regression neural network\
    \ (GRNN). They gathered data from six meteorological stations\nfrom the Sichuan\
    \ basin (SW China) and thereafter compared them using the ELM and GRNN models\n\
    along with the temperature-based Hargreaves (HG) model. Their data sequence corresponded\
    \ to a\ncalibrated version considering FAO-56 Penman–Monteith ETo as the benchmark,\
    \ that produced two\ndata management scenarios: (1) the models were trained and\
    \ tested using the local data of each station\nand (2) the models were trained\
    \ using the pooled data from all the stations and tested in each station,\nwhich\
    \ were compared against to the well-known empirical Hargreaves models.\nThe development\
    \ of Artiﬁcial Intelligence models for daily ETo estimation solely with temperature\n\
    data was addressed by Feng et al. [13]. More speciﬁcally they introduced two models\
    \ along with ELM\nand GRNN in six meteorological stations from the Sichuan basin,\
    \ in southwest China, and compared\nthe proposed ELM and GRNN with the corresponding\
    \ temperature-based Hargreaves (HG) model\nand its calibrated version considering\
    \ FAO-56 Penman–Monteith ETo as the benchmark. In relation to\nthe implementation\
    \ of the above they considered that the models’ training was based on local weather\n\
    station data and derived data from the all of the stations in total, compared\
    \ altogether against the\nempirical Hargreaves models. Furthermore, the authors’\
    \ research showed the great capabilities for\nETo estimation of ELM and GRNN models,\
    \ mainly because they performed much better than the\noriginal models. In conclusion,\
    \ Feng et al. [13] stated that ELM and GRNN provided a slight better\nperformance\
    \ than the local ELM and GRNN, they render a better ﬁt for ETo estimation methodology\n\
    based on incomplete local meteorological data.\nPrecise estimation of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial for accurate crop-water estimation by\nimplementing machine learning\
    \ (ML) techniques, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs).\nSpeciﬁcally, the\
    \ estimation of weekly reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) was assessed by\
    \ Patil\nand Deka [14] by developing an improved extreme learning machine (ELM)\
    \ algorithm. The authors\nattempted to model the process of evapotranspiration\
    \ in arid regions of India under limited data\nscenario through the evaluation\
    \ of the capabilities of ELM to model the process of evapotranspiration\nand input\
    \ selection. They concluded that the proposed ELM model performed better than\
    \ the\nHargreaves and ANN model, as the best to estimate weekly evapotranspiration\
    \ at Jodhpur and Pali\nweather station, based less human intervention to select\
    \ the optimum model parameters. In addition\nto that the effectiveness of using\
    \ such extrinsic inputs is proved by the evaluation of suitability of\nusing (ETo)\
    \ values from various weather stations modeling the process of evapotranspiration.\n\
    Prediction of daily dew point temperature was studied by Mohammadi et al. [15]\
    \ by proposing an\nextreme learning machine (ELM)-based model. The effectiveness\
    \ of ELM was validated against SVM\nand ANN based on the case studies of daily\
    \ averaged measured databases for two stations in Iran\nwith different climate\
    \ conditions by focusing on the input elements of the physical factors inﬂuencing\n\
    the formation of dew, ﬁve widely available parameters, average air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity,\natmospheric pressure, vapor pressure, and horizontal global\
    \ solar radiation. More speciﬁcally they\ndeployed statistical indicators to provide\
    \ a statistical comparison between the predicted and measured\ndata for three\
    \ modeling techniques to address that the ELM model is superior over SVM and ANN\n\
    for the predictions of daily dew point temperature. In conclusion, the ELM was\
    \ found better to\npredict the nonlinear variations of daily dew point temperature\
    \ in its different ranges by estimating\nthe probability of occurrence of predicted\
    \ values compared to measured data revealed that for both\nstations the probability\
    \ distribution of the predicted values.\nIn principle, it is a rather challenging\
    \ task to perform accurate yield prediction, estimation\nand quality control [16],\
    \ because such factors are affected by environmental variables. Still, many\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n8 of 27\napproaches for enhanced vineyard management\
    \ techniques are introduced, which involve automatic yield\nestimation [17–19],\
    \ grape quality evaluation [20], and grapevine variety identification [21]. In\
    \ a relevant\napproach, Ramos et al. [22] proposed a method of calculating the\
    \ number of fruits on a coffee branch in the\nfield. Their system categorized\
    \ fruits as either harvestable or non-harvestable through identifying their\n\
    number, weight, and maturation percentage non destructively. They were based on\
    \ data obtained from\nmobile devices and image processing algorithms along with\
    \ the development of a dedicated detection\nmethod of masking occluded from un-occluded\
    \ fruits from field images. Ramos et al. produced estimation\nmodels based on\
    \ assessing determination coefficients higher than 0.93 and exploiting direct\
    \ measurements\ncapable of higher coefficient rate, comparable to similar models.\n\
    Taking this a step further, the scope of a machine vision system for automated\
    \ harvesting\nwas studied by Amatya et al. [23] through branch detection used\
    \ morphological features including\norientation, length, and thickness of partially\
    \ visible segments. The authors aimed at detecting cherry\ntree branches during\
    \ full foliage season that support automated cherry harvesting operation using\n\
    mechanical shaking of limbs. Furthermore, they deployed RGB images of cherry tree\
    \ canopies using a\nBayesian classiﬁer for the identiﬁcation of the segmentation\
    \ branch pixels, in which they managed a\nclassiﬁcation accuracy of 89.6%. They\
    \ also implemented noise ﬁltering and grouping techniques of\nthe same branch\
    \ in a speciﬁed neighborhood, along with curve ﬁtting method was then used to\
    \ ﬁt\nan equation through detected branch segments, providing overall accuracy\
    \ in detecting individual\nbranches was by 89.2%. In conclusion, their study showed\
    \ promising results in detecting branches of\nsweet cherry trees during harvest\
    \ season in the presence of full foliage and fruit on their study sample.\nOne\
    \ of the worth-noting works in the ﬁeld is the one by Radhika and M. Shashi [24],\
    \ where they\nexploit support vector machines (SVMs) for the task of predicting\
    \ the maximum daily temperature.\nMoreover, as a baseline, they use a multi-layer\
    \ perceptron (MLP) trained through back-propagation.\nTo accomplish the aforementioned\
    \ prediction task, they rely on weather data provided by the\nUniversity of Cambridge\
    \ for the time period of 2003–2007. Through their experimental ﬁndings, the\n\
    authors showcase that the SVM-based approach, is able to achieve signiﬁcant results,\
    \ thus showcasing\nits suitability for this particular prediction problem.\nSimilarly,\
    \ Gill et al. [25] develop an SVM regression model, in order to predict the moisture\
    \ of soil.\nIn particular, the authors utilize both meteorological, and soil moisture\
    \ data, from 11 weather stations\nfrom the Oklahoma region in the United States,\
    \ for training and testing their prediction model. Finally,\nby comparing their\
    \ proposed model against an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), they showcase its\n\
    efﬁciency. Huuskonen and Oksanen [26] presented a methodology in relation to remote\
    \ soil sampling\nwhile presenting the results on the augmented reality platform.\
    \ Their work intended to reproduce a top\nsoil map with management zones for precision\
    \ farming based on the gaming experience. They deployed\na UAV on pre-destined\
    \ sampling sites in order to create soil maps. The maps feed a platform with content\n\
    that enhances user experience in order to assist agricultural research.\nLastly,\
    \ another novel approach in agriculture was implemented by Fuentes et al. [27]\
    \ in which they\nemployed machine learning models for the categorization of cultivars.\
    \ They used morpho-colorimetry\nand NIR spectroscopy in grapevine leaves in order\
    \ to assess the main differences between cultivars, and\ntheir according levels\
    \ of water stress. The researcher employed automated image analysis under the\
    \ scope\nof morphological and color feature extraction from scanned vine leaves\
    \ along with an AI-based model\n(ANN) for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive ampelography/cultivar\
    \ classification. Fuentes et al. method\nproved to be highly accurate in recognizing\
    \ different cultivar classes in a large sample of vine leaves.\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a brief comparative overview of the above fundamental research efforts. As it\n\
    was the case with previous Table 1, Table 2 includes six columns: The ﬁrst contains\

    \ it should have been made obvious by the previous analysis that through the use\
    \ of\ninnovative new technologies, farmers may be supported in activities related\
    \ to the management of\ntheir crops so that they can achieve higher yields and\
    \ better quality while at the same time they apply\nthe exact amounts of inputs\
    \ (e.g., irrigation water, fertilizers, and pesticides) needed by their crops.\n\
    This not only improves the ﬁnancial beneﬁt of farmers (thanks to the minimized\
    \ production costs),\nbut also minimizes the impact of agriculture on the environment.\
    \ Within this challenging framework,\nthe main motivation behind the creation\
    \ of a viticulture-friendly platform is to utilize different data\nrepositories\
    \ in unison and promote the digital content by enhancing its accessibility and\
    \ discoverability,\nand provide artiﬁcial intelligence based services for further\
    \ analyzing available data (e.g., images\nof various modalities, multi-source\
    \ measurements, sensor data, historical data). Thus the discussed\nplatform can\
    \ be viewed as a complete ecosystem that offers enriched services, aggregates\
    \ content from\nmultiple sources, resolves interoperability issues by performing\
    \ automatic mappings in the back-end,\nimproves metadata quality through linked\
    \ data principles and automated free text and image analysis\nservices where applicable,\
    \ and mobilizes and engages its users (i.e., farmers, winemakers, stakeholders,\n\
    the general public) to execute useful tasks for the enrichment and validation\
    \ of selected metadata,\nas well as the provision and extraction of new information.\
    \ In its core, it is a platform especially\ndesigned with a focus on human-computer\
    \ collaboration with application in the area of viticulture.\nThe latter offers\
    \ a set of services such as content integration, management, retrieval, and curation,\n\
    automatic metadata enrichment, information retrieval and extraction, and inserts\
    \ the human being in\nthe loop in order to accommodate human expertise and intelligence.\n\
    The main characteristics, as well as beneﬁts from the introduction and utilization\
    \ of such a\nplatform may be summarized in the following, whereas a diagrammatic\
    \ overview of the proposed\nplatform is illustrated in Figure 2:\n•\nViticulture\
    \ data are aggregated from multiple repositories and published;\n•\nViticulture\
    \ data are translated into usable information consumable for decision-making purposes;\n\
    •\nHeterogeneous data are translated into the same form using a common data model;\n\
    •\nThe data model is able to actually evolve, so as to include additional requirements,\
    \ data sources\nand other models;\n•\nData can be made more accessible to a wide\
    \ range of users, such as data scientists, business\nanalysts, etc., by granting\
    \ a uniﬁed access to knowledge from multiple sources, thus promoting\nthe viti-cultural\
    \ content;\n•\nData can be queried and queries may be asked in multiple ways that\
    \ haven’t been anticipated\nwhile modeling the data;\n•\nBack-end processing can\
    \ be initiated to extract useful information from translated data;\n•\nViticulture-related\
    \ information is retrieved, stored, extracted and sustained for future use;\n\
    A more descriptive architectural ﬂowchart of the proposed implementation is illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 3. The information ﬂow starts on the left, where related content\
    \ providers (e.g., user archives\nor even libraries of related content) and corresponding\
    \ aggregators provide their content metadata\ndescriptions to the developed platform.\
    \ In principle, this ﬁrst inaugural part of the process tends to be a\nrather\
    \ difﬁcult task, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the various available content\
    \ metadata formats.\nUsing the proposed modular system, the metadata transformation\
    \ module maps and transforms\nthe uploaded data to elements through an automatic\
    \ transformation process. The outcome of this\nmodule remains a transformed version\
    \ of the content metadata. Continuing, translated metadata are\nrepresented as\
    \ KB expressions by exploiting the semantic enrichment module and are then stored\n\
    in the semantic repository module on the upper right corner of the ﬂowchart. It\
    \ is worth noting at\nthis point that all metadata elements are represented within\
    \ the semantic repository as entities of\nthe terminological knowledge. This knowledge\
    \ has the form of an ontology, which is related to both\nvarious popular ontology\
    \ metadata standards, such as Dublin Core or LIDO, as well as to more speciﬁc\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n11 of 27\nterminological axioms providing details about\
    \ crop varieties, categories of agricultural crops, physical\nproperties, numerous\
    \ interrelations, and other important agricultural features. Content providers\n\
    and aggregators develop this type of knowledge in the form of so-called thematic\
    \ terminologies.\nThe exploitation of such knowledge types is then expected to\
    \ happen within the semantic query\nanswering module, responsible for the semantic\
    \ enrichment of the available content metadata, as well\nas for the implementation\
    \ of meaningful reasoning tasks so as to extract efﬁcient related results.\nFigure\

    \ are able to upload their historic data from a speciﬁc\nvineyard, like for instance\
    \ soil data, management data, meteorological information, and actual\nyields per\
    \ season. Data can be stored in the platform’s repository and then plugged into\

    \ of the\navailable data and services to anyone willing to utilize for further\
    \ exploitation.\nAbove depiction of the main possible utilization of the platform\
    \ by the aforementioned kinds of\nviticulture users’ expertise depicts the expansion\
    \ capabilities and potential of the proposed system,\nbeing a modular platform\
    \ with varying levels of granularity. The latter may be deﬁned as the lesser or\n\
    greater extent in the description of the expected behavior of the platform, according\
    \ to its functional\nspeciﬁcations and the particular goal associated with its\
    \ requirements and allows for its great impact\nwith respect to making agriculture\

    the user involvement in the data services of the platform; the latter is designed\

    \ data content descriptions.\nBased on the above system architecture, the platform’s\
    \ user involvement may be summarized\nin four interactive processes, as depicted\
    \ in Figure 4. The content search and the content management\nprocesses that enable\
    \ users to collect content and organize content, as well as the Metadata enrichment\n\
    and the crowd-sourcing processes that enable users to advance content descriptions,\
    \ using AI content\nanalysis tools or human annotations, respectively. In the\
    \ next subsections, we shall focus on these\nmain processes, providing further\
    \ technical details and use-case examples where applicable.\nFigure 4. User involvement\
    \ in the proposed platform.\n3.1. Handling of Metadata Semantic Heterogeneity\n\
    As the world becomes full of sensor networks producing information, smart viticulture\
    \ enters the\nsomehow “foreign” ﬁelds of data processing, storage and retrieval\
    \ at a fast pace. Through various\nsources of information derived from a wide\
    \ data spectrum (e.g., geo-information, soil measurements,\nweather forecasts,\
    \ chemical analyses, to mention just a few data streams), grapevine-powered\n\
    stakeholders are in a position to grow an extremely rich system of integrated\
    \ Internet of things data to\npower more informed decisions. The main challenge\
    \ lies in the high heterogeneity of data types in the\nagricultural/viticultural\
    \ sector. Agriculture makes use of various data (e.g., research, meteorological,\n\
    soil, ﬁnancial/economic, statistical, satellite/remote sensing, administrative,\
    \ germplasm, crop\nexperiments, and ﬁeld trials, to name a few) and for each data\
    \ type, there are numerous standards\nused. These standards are not always linked\
    \ between each other or at least with the most prominent\none of the sector.\n\
    In principle, all data collected from a viticultural object (i.e., a vineyard,\
    \ parcel, etc.) are stored\nin metadata records. The records are an important\
    \ aspect for documenting and maintaining the\nsemantic interrelations among various\
    \ sources of information. These types are used in querying\nrelevant data like\
    \ viticulture historical data, over long periods of time. It is worth mentioning\
    \ that\nstandardized descriptive metadata enhances the overall search experience\
    \ and render reliable the\nretrieval techniques within or across multiple collections.\
    \ Information management is assisted by\ndescriptive, administrative, technical,\
    \ and preservation metadata, which they ensure data intellectual\nintegrity. Furthermore,\
    \ the primary sector in the now has employed ICT research groups under the\nscope\
    \ of disseminating knowledge related to smart agriculture. Inter-operability introduces\
    \ itself\nas an important factor for management and aggregation of digital resources\
    \ among proprietary\ndata structures. As an effect, many types of software applications\
    \ have evolved implementing\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n14 of 27\nexisting methodologies\
    \ such as crosswalks, translation algorithms, metadata registries, and specialized\n\
    data dictionaries.\nIn the ﬁeld of smart viticulture, in particular, the crosswalk\
    \ provides a mapping of metadata\nentities within various schemata. Metadata deﬁnition\
    \ is highlighted as the precise interpretation\nfor implemented the required framework.\
    \ Furthermore, common elements are hardly distinguished\namong different schemata\
    \ due to existing incompatible records. Tables of equivalent elements serve\n\
    the purpose of crosswalks and, even though the equivalences may be inexact, they\
    \ represent an\nexpert’s judgment on the matter of software processes. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ the conceptual differences are\nimmaterial to the software’s operation that\
    \ involves records encoded in the two models. Therein-after,\nretrieval mechanisms\
    \ support querying capabilities among different data sources that wholly support\n\
    the desired semantic inter-operability of viticulture schemata.\nAn additional\
    \ important factor on the adoption of crosswalks is the support to convertibility\n\
    among data formats. Apart from single point of access or cross-domain searching\
    \ capabilities, the\naggregation of metadata records among varied from viticulture\
    \ sources (e.g., vineyards located in quite\ndistinct geographical areas or producing\
    \ different wine types) presumably creates conﬂicting results.\nIn the case of\
    \ automatically generated metadata, organizations or individuals that did not\
    \ follow best\npractices or standard thesauri and controlled vocabularies in the\
    \ process, provide mapping metadata\nelements from different schemas under the\
    \ scope of cross walking. Furthermore, datatype registration\nand formatting address\
    \ the capabilities of semantic interoperability in relation to the values included\
    \ in\nthe metadata elements (e.g., rules for recording wine types or encoding\
    \ standards for dates) assessing\nthe local authority ﬁles for adopted terminologies.\n\
    As a solution to this issue, we introduce a novel adaptation of the MINT-mapping\
    \ tool that\nprovides an aggregation mechanism on critical activities, such as:\n\
    •\nharvesting and aggregating metadata inputs, created under shared community\
    \ standards or\nproprietary metadata schemata,\n•\nmigrating from providers’standard\
    \ or local models to a reference model,\n•\ntransforming records among intermediate\
    \ standards to pan-European (Europeana Semantic\nElements and the Europeana Data\
    \ Model [30,31]).\n3.2. Content Search and Management\nContent search and management\
    \ is divided into two distinct, yet collaborating parts, namely\ncontent aggregation\
    \ and content collection and spaces management. In the following subsections,\
    \ we shall\ntry to provide a brief overview, together with an illustrative example\
    \ case of their interchangeability.\n3.2.1. Content Aggregation\nThe content aggregation\
    \ task is mainly accomplished through searching in external agricultural\ndigital\
    \ repositories and libraries. In the herein proposed framework, the utilization\
    \ of WITH tool allows\nus to mash-up APIs from different digital resources and\
    \ provide a single, yet powerful, service, which\ngives access to a large set\
    \ of heterogeneous multimedia items (e.g., images, text, different metadata\n\
    schemata, videos). The tool supports a variety of different data models (e.g.,\
    \ EDM, LIDO, etc.)\nand formats (e.g., XML, JSON-LD), and thus resolves most of\
    \ the aforementioned interoperability\nissues. The latter is achieved by integrating\
    \ the tool in the proposed architecture of fully implemented\nworkﬂows or the\
    \ ingestion, formal mapping, transformation and aggregation of viticulture records\
    \ in\nthe back-end through the proposed open-source metadata web-based platform.\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n15 of 27\nThe user interface (UI) of the knowledge\
    \ base platform (http://withculture.eu/#/custom/evinos)\noffers federated and\
    \ faceted search services, which enable its user to apply multiple search criteria\n\
    in different combinations based on the metadata of search results, navigate through\
    \ the results via\ndifferent presentation views and retrieve more information\
    \ about items of interest (see Figure 5).\nOne of the system’s provisions is the\
    \ parallel query into all of the selected repositories, based on a\nspeciﬁc search\
    \ term or phrase, in order to create facets to be used for narrowing down results.\
    \ As most\ndigital data in external repositories are accompanied with rich metadata,\
    \ the user may choose from a\nvariety of specialized ﬁlters such as rights, creator,\
    \ media type and dates, resulting in the desirable\nobjects among thousands of\
    \ others. Figure 6 indicates the improved adaptability that offers the search\n\
    results and facets are accessed through the API, so other developers can include\
    \ the query features\ninto their customized applications.\nFigure 5. User data\
    \ collection.\nFigure 6. Selected item from the collection.\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 149\n16 of 27\nIt worth mentioning that the required data model is based\
    \ on the imported records following\nthe paradigm of major repositories. More\
    \ particularly, the model demands extensions for fulﬁlling\ncompatibility issues\
    \ among various data models. The proposed platform is compliant with Europeana\n\
    data model (EDM) [30,31] and supports two-way transformation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ any\ntype of data amendment is possible to be implemented through its two-way\
    \ transformation\ncapabilities. Regarding the matter of its application programming\
    \ interface, we introduced a common\nsupport framework on serialization types\
    \ (JSON, XML, and RDF). This enhanced share-ability and\nexport-ability of data\
    \ among similar platforms worldwide.\n3.2.2. Collections and Spaces Management\n\
    As a next step, platform users are able to create collections that become available\
    \ under their\nspeciﬁc proﬁle. Data management is implemented through an internal\
    \ data model that assesses record\nimports and transformations in the platform,\
    \ under the scope of collection enrichment through user\ninputs. Particularly\
    \ the system keeps intact the users’ original records in the form of an accessible\n\
    backup and while allowing the amendment of data into their custom collections.\
    \ Along with collections,\nplatform users may organize their content, which was\
    \ either uploaded or collected from external\nrepositories, into exhibitions that\
    \ provide enhanced and more playful visualization features.\nThe platform also\
    \ provides thematic content organization in the so-called spaces. Spaces is a\n\
    concept that corresponds to speciﬁc, access-based views of stored data, enables\
    \ the organization of\ndigital content in different thematic categories and views,\
    \ and allows different ways of interaction\nwith the end-user (e.g., users are\
    \ able to re-use the provided content, comment and share). This added\nfeature\
    \ enables interested wine professionals to design and host custom web spaces in\
    \ order to promote\ntheir content and engage with users. Furthermore, devoted\
    \ expansions of content holder serve the\npurpose of visualizing and disseminating\
    \ on the web digital collections, exhibitions and stories, in\naddition to content\
    \ access and use capabilities made to the public by the platform. Alternatively,\
    \ linked\nopen data (LOD) are published by the means of speciﬁc structures, namely\
    \ the spaces. For the sake\nof efﬁcient organization, content access within a\
    \ space (collections and exhibitions, etc.) is limited\nto speciﬁed user groups.\
    \ The scope of the search engine in each space can be customized as well,\nfor\
    \ example to exclude some sources or, to only search for speciﬁc type of sources,\
    \ such as pictures,\netc.. Individual customization of the individual front-end\
    \ (e.g., descriptive texts, images, CSS) is also\navailable within each space.\n\
    As a case in point, let’s introduce Yorghos, a wine enthusiast fascinated by Greek\
    \ wines of the\nIonian Islands region, who wants to explore and discover relevant\
    \ viticulture artifacts and build,\norganize and contextualize his own related\
    \ library. The ﬁrst thing for Yorghos to do within the\nplatform is to create\
    \ a user proﬁle and to initialize an empty collection, where all the assets will\
    \ be\nsaved in the following. Let us assume that Yorghos owns content from Greek\
    \ wineries, so he uploads\nand curates it by providing some initial metadata,\
    \ such as name, description, and rights. To enrich his\ncollection and add more\
    \ assets, he uses the platform’s search service to look for traditional Greek\
    \ wine\ntypes of the Ionian Islands geographical region, like “Avgoustiatis” and\
    \ “Moschato”. Yorghos collects\nassets from worldwide repositories, such as the\
    \ Digital Public Library of America, Europeana, and the\nEuropean Wine Database\
    \ (http://www.eu-vitis.de/index.php), and further ﬁlters the results by setting\n\
    the preferable rights and mime type illustrated in Figure 7a. From a set of 15\
    \ items returned containing\n“Avgoustiatis”, he opens the ones he is interested\
    \ in, as shown in Figure 7b, reviews related images,\ninspects the accompanying\
    \ metadata and collects the items he wants. Collected items are automatically\n\
    transformed into the platform’s data model, an excerpt of which, is shown in Algorithm\
    \ 1. Yorghos\nmay then observe and manage his collection shown in Figure 7c.\n\

    \ and interlink viticulture data that in principle come from a\nplethora of different\
    \ sources (e.g., sensors, IoT devices), we utilize the platform’s characteristics.\n\
    In particular, the viticulture information that is collected and aggregated in\
    \ the platform initially\ncontains the original metadata that are provided directly\
    \ by the various smart viticulture information\nsources. These are stored in the\
    \ respective representation of each item using the described data model.\nTo allow\
    \ enrichment of these metadata with additional, either manually or automatically\
    \ generated,\nmetadata, the developed platform supports the use of annotations.\n\
    To facilitate annotation creation, retrieval, management, and interoperability,\
    \ the platform includes\na thesauri manager that is responsible for importing,\
    \ through an ofﬂine process, the Linked Data\nvocabularies and datasets that make\
    \ up the pool of potential annotation resources. The thesauri\nmanager converts\
    \ the imported vocabularies from their source format (e.g., SKOS thesauri, OWL\n\
    ontologies, N-triples datasets) to a common model, stores them in the platform’s\
    \ thesauri database\nand indexes them to allow fast search and retrieval. In all\
    \ the above vocabularies and datasets, each\nresource is always accompanied by\
    \ one or more textual labels, possibly in more than one language.\nThese labels\
    \ provide textual representations for the speciﬁc resource and are used for indexing\
    \ the\nresources and facilitating look-up.\nThe herein utilized annotation model\
    \ is based on W3C’s Web Annotation Model [32], which\nis a structured model and\
    \ format to enable annotations to be shared and reused across different\nhardware\
    \ and software platforms. In brief, an annotation consists of an id, a list of\
    \ annotators, a body,\na target, and a list of scores. An annotation may be generated\
    \ either automatically by a content analysis\nsoftware, a web-service etc., or\
    \ manually by a human annotator. Thus, the list of annotators contains\nall relevant\
    \ information about the origins of each annotation. The core part of the annotation\
    \ is its\nbody which identiﬁes the relevant Linked Data resource. The target of\
    \ an annotation identiﬁes the\nitem, or the part of an item, which the particular\
    \ annotation relates to the body resource.\nBased on the above annotation model,\
    \ the platform provides a number of tools for the manual\nand automatic generation\
    \ of annotations. The latter are based on natural language processing,\nstring\
    \ matching, dictionary look-up tools, as well as three supervised learning models,\
    \ namely\nk-nearest neighbors, linear and random forest regression to analyze\
    \ the existing textual metadata\nof records in order to detect in them occurrences\
    \ of named entities and terms that belong to the\nunderlying set of vocabulary\
    \ and dataset resources; an indicative illustration of the latter is included\n\
    in the Appendix A of the manuscript. In the case of the manual annotation process,\
    \ the user has\nto directly choose a resource from the underlying thesauri database\
    \ and add it as annotation for a\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n19 of 27\nparticular\
    \ item. The user starts typing in a keyword and the user interface assists him\
    \ through an\nauto-complete functionality (shown in Figure 8), which consults\
    \ the underlying thesauri index, and\nsuggests to the user resources having textually\
    \ matching labels. The user can restrict the scope of\nauto-complete suggestions\
    \ by selecting only speciﬁc vocabularies.\nAn important part of the manual annotation\
    \ tools forms the geo-tagging tool, which allows the\ngeneration of annotations\
    \ with a geo-URI in their body, so as to represent geographical locations.\nTo\
    \ generate such an annotation, the user of the platform may click on the desired\
    \ points of the provided\nmap. In conclusion, the automatic annotation tools are\
    \ aimed to provide textual and visual metadata\nanalysis. Textual metadata are\
    \ the main descriptive metadata of the items, namely their title and\ndescription\
    \ ﬁelds. Textual item data can also be used to automatically generate annotations\
    \ through\nthe dictionary look-up tool that is implemented in the platform. Beyond\
    \ the scope of the current\npublication, the deployment of further services is\
    \ implemented by the extraction of textual and image\nrelated metadata that assist\
    \ the enforcement of automated tools on image annotation tasks.\nFigure 8. Manual\
    \ annotation paradigm.\n3.4. Case Study: The Zakytnhian Variety Selection\nThe\
    \ herein discussed platform has been successfully utilized in farms across the\
    \ Ionian Islands.\nAmong the ﬁrst venues involved was a large winery in Zakynthos,\
    \ Greece. The installation of the\nenvironmental monitoring system in Zakynthos\
    \ focuses on the basic characteristics of the cultivation\nthat is found in the\
    \ “Klima Grampsa” estate on the island. The entire unit consists of a vineyard\
    \ and a\nwine production station. In addition, the company manufactures typical\
    \ Zakynthian varieties of wine,\nsuch as Avgoustiatis and Goustolidi, maintaining\
    \ complete production characteristics. The cultivation\nis located in a lowland\
    \ area surrounded by farmland and residential environments in south-west\nZakynthos\
    \ island and the ﬁeld of study refers to the wider area of the Gramsa estate near\
    \ the village\nLagopodo (see Figure 9) belonging to the municipal unit of Artemision.\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n20 of 27\nFigure 9. Map of Klima Grampsa installation.\n\
    The vineyard owners immediately embraced the initiative and contributed practically\
    \ and\ntheoretically to the project, aiming to increase conversions and product\
    \ revenue for their clients\nvia upgraded quality and optimized production. They\
    \ used the platform to collect, organize, analyze,\nand publicize winery data\
    \ on behalf of their winery products. By looking at the interests and behaviors\n\
    of the people engaged most with their varieties, they were able to feed these\
    \ insights back into the\noverall company planning to inform their strategy on\
    \ how to best reach these consumers.\nAs a ﬁrst step, the owners provided multimedia\
    \ content (mostly photos and textual data) of their\nland, premises, plants and\
    \ products (see Figure 10). This formed the so-called Grampsas collection in the\n\
    knowledge base.\nFigure 10. Grampsas collection.\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n\
    21 of 27\nAs a second step, detailed information about the individual items of\
    \ the collection were provided.\nThese included descriptions of the produced varieties,\
    \ such as Avgoustiatis, Goustolidi, and Kakotrygis,\nas well as the respective\
    \ wines produced by each variety (e.g., Avgoustiatis Red, see Figure 11).\nFigure\
    \ 11. Grampsas knowledge base item collection.\nInitially the vineyard owner provided\
    \ a recent high resolution photo of the item under\nexamination. So, for instance\
    \ in the case of the Avgoustiatis variety, Figure 12a depicts its overview.\n\
    Continuing, the entries of the knowledge base were ﬁlled up with data. The Info\
    \ tab (Figure 12b)\ncontains information about the rights of the multimedia item\
    \ uploaded, the item’s Uniform Resource\nLocator (URL) and the actual knowledge\
    \ base record’s source. The latter is typically the user who\nuploaded the actual\
    \ content item. The second tab Related presents similar to the uploaded content\n\
    items that are already included in the knowledge base. In the case of a photo,\
    \ given the single uploaded\nimage, it retrieves similar images from the knowledge\
    \ base and depicts them. The platform is also\nable to suggest tags that may be\
    \ attached to the original uploaded image (Figure 12c). The Comments\ntab (Figure\
    \ 12d) enables the public to participate in the process because it provides a\
    \ fully functional\ncomments section based on the popular Disqus (https://disqus.com/)\
    \ service. Disqus is a networked\ncommunity platform used by hundreds of thousands\
    \ of sites all over the world. By incorporating the\nDisqus functionality, the\
    \ platform gained a feature-rich comment system complete with social network\n\
    integration, advanced administration, and moderation options.\nTab Sharing (Figure12e)\
    \ deals with social media integration of the platform and allows its visitors\n\
    to quickly associate, post, or comment about the knowledge base items on their\
    \ favorite social media\nsites. This is of crucial importance because social media\
    \ is nowadays integrated in almost every aspect\nof the people’s everyday life,\
    \ and at the same time forms a great way to leverage the power of social\nmedia\
    \ to increase awareness of the owners of the vineyards marketing efforts. Lastly,\
    \ tab Annotations\n(Figure 12f) offers the ability to the content uploader to\
    \ provide important annotations describing\nthe actual content uploaded by either\
    \ inserting them manually during the process or by allowing the\nplatform to process\
    \ them and add them in a semi-automated way during an ofﬂine post-processing\n\
    step. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that at this point, after the initial\
    \ stage of content uploaded\nmainly by the vineyard owners has been concluded,\
    \ any interested stakeholder may now use the\nplatform to add new, edit or delete\
    \ existing information; the latter two actions are subject to the\nadministrator’s\
    \ approval, of course. This allows for a great user participatory approach to\
    \ smart\nviticulture, actively involving all stakeholders in the process to help\
    \ ensure the results meet their needs\nand are rather exploitable.\nInformation\

    As a ﬁnal, not yet implemented, step, vineyard owners will be able to use machine-learning\n\
    tools that predict the likelihood of a customer to engage with a speciﬁc wine\
    \ variety product,\nand automatically adjusts the target customers with those\
    \ ﬁndings. The overall feedback we are\ngetting so far from them is that they\
    \ were able to signiﬁcantly increase conversions using the\nplatform’s technology.\n\
    4. Discussion and Conclusions\nIn this paper, we presented a collaboration platform\
    \ based on linked data and machine principles\nwith unique features, such as automatic\
    \ metadata enrichment and services, speciﬁcally aimed for the\nviticulture domain.\
    \ We provided a detailed description of the workﬂow and the user engagement in\
    \ the\nplatform and illustrated its basic principles, alongside with a respective\
    \ real-life case study paradigm.\nThe platform forms an evolving, ﬂexible, and\
    \ interconnected integrated information system. It follows\na modular design and\
    \ implementation that allows it to efﬁciently adapt over time over numerous\n\
    distinct tasks. For instance, new knowledge base repositories may be aggregated,\
    \ new knowledge base\nspaces may be created and new platform features and services\
    \ may constantly be designed, deployed\nand utilized within the proposed architecture.\
    \ It was designed and developed aiming at strengthening\ncooperation of the interested\
    \ stakeholders within the viticulture domain, initially within the Region of\n\
    Ionian Islands and beyond.\nThe herein proposed part of the platform aims to propose\
    \ innovative solutions for the\nimprovement of smart viticulture/agriculture services,\
    \ their efﬁcient management, including all\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n23 of 27\n\
    key stakeholders, by providing incentives for the role of vineyard owners and\
    \ consumers of viticulture\nproducts.\nMoreover, it aims at involving the wisdom\
    \ of the crowd, in order to ensure wider\ndissemination of the achieved results.\
    \ This, of course, remains a work in progress for our research\nteam, in the sense\
    \ that among our future goals are the extension of the current platform to include\
    \ data\nform other than viticulture application sub-domains of the general smart\
    \ agriculture domain, as well\nas the introduction of enhanced features for the\
    \ already implemented viticulture one.\nAmong the technical improvements of the\
    \ platform that we plan to implement in the near\nfuture lies an automated tag\
    \ extraction service, based on speciﬁcally trained deep convolutional\nneural\
    \ networks (CNNs), to be included in the tabular knowledge base item approach\
    \ (Figure 12a).\nThis service will be used to provide automated tags that will\
    \ be fed to users for veriﬁcation and\nvalidation and then will be included in\
    \ the training set. In addition, we plan to exploit the provided user\nannotations\
    \ of knowledge base items for the training of new, or improving the existing,\
    \ ML algorithms,\ntowards an enhanced promotion of digital agriculture data from\
    \ various sources. Analytics of\nuser-generated data or data simply derived from\
    \ private sources, coupled together with huge amounts\nof publicly available data\
    \ from large-scale organizations (e.g., the Hellenic National Meteorological\n\
    Service) will allow the utilization of new types and combinations of data that\
    \ were never available\nbefore. For instance, data on farming production costs\
    \ (i.e., seeds, fertilizer, labor and yield levels) for\nvarious crops collected\
    \ directly from farmers, combined with spatial, weather and commodity datasets,\n\
    as well as insights like cost curves, may be successfully analyzed by machine\
    \ learning algorithms, so\nas to predict market prices of agricultural products\
    \ with a reliable degree of accuracy.\nSo, ﬁnally, with respect to the marketing\
    \ part of our initiative, we plan to initiate deeper wine\ncustomer connections\
    \ to drive better marketing results for the vineyard owners by utilizing existing,\n\
    or developing from scratch, analytics solutions. The goal is to obtain reliable\
    \ data from large numbers\nof real-world people, process them in a single framework,\
    \ where we may identify peoples’ insights,\nwhat actions should be implemented\
    \ and towards which audience, how it is performing, and make\nchanges almost in\
    \ real-time. Taking this a step further, we intend to transform the system into\
    \ an\nintegrated agriculture analytics platform used to predict the acceptance\
    \ of products by the market and\ntheir economic performance in economic terms,\

    \ Every aspect of the 21st century has undergone a revolution because of the Internet\
    \ of\nThings (IoT) and smart computing technologies. These technologies are applied\
    \ in many different\nways, from monitoring the state of crops and the moisture\
    \ level of the soil in real-time to using\ndrones to help with chores such as\
    \ spraying pesticides. The extensive integration of both recent\nIT and conventional\
    \ agriculture has brought in the phase of agriculture 4.0, often known as smart\n\
    agriculture. Agriculture intelligence and automation are addressed by smart agriculture.\
    \ However,\nwith the advancement of agriculture brought about by recent digital\
    \ technology, information security\nchallenges cannot be overlooked. The article\
    \ begins by providing an overview of the development of\nagriculture 4.0 with\
    \ pros and cons. This study focused on layered architectural design, identiﬁed\n\
    security issues, and presented security demands and upcoming prospects. In addition\
    \ to that, we\npropose a security architectural framework for agriculture 4.0\
    \ that combines blockchain technology,\nfog computing, and software-deﬁned networking.\
    \ The suggested framework combines Ethereum\nblockchain and software-deﬁned networking\
    \ technologies on an open-source IoT platform. It is then\ntested with three different\
    \ cases under a DDoS attack. The results of the performance analysis show\nthat\
    \ overall, the proposed security framework has performed well.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ blockchain; SDN; precision farming; cyber security; fog computing\n1. Introduction\n\
    Farming is the main source of food and contributes signiﬁcantly to the economy.\n\
    According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),\
    \ by 2050,\nthe demand for producing food must be increased by 70% to satisfy\
    \ the world’s demand.\nIn recent studies, 550 million people of the world’s population\
    \ are in nutrition deﬁciencies;\nevery day, around 820 million people are still\
    \ not obtaining food. The study says that\nthe world’s population will increase\
    \ to more than two billion, and most of the population\nwill live in cities. It\
    \ has also been observed that the population in India and Nigeria will\nincrease\
    \ to around 482 million between 2019 and 2050 [1].\nThe biggest challenging situation\
    \ arises with this population growth to achieve the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) of zero hunger [2]. These projections for the near\nfuture have an impact\
    \ on overall food demand. Because of the scarcity of water today, it is\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757. https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11030757\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n2 of 27\ndifﬁcult to meet only 40% of the water supply\
    \ by 2030, and the unavailability of farming\nland will lead to a reduction in\
    \ the food supply. As a result, the agriculture sector needs\nsufﬁcient resources\
    \ than are presently available, as well as more self-sustaining systems\nto boost\
    \ cultivation percentages while reducing environmental resource use [3]. Though\n\
    it might be appropriate to reach rising demand, it is unclear how to do so in\
    \ an equitable\nand resilient manner. Again, there is a vital need to accelerate\
    \ and scale up the agricultural\nproduction transformation [4]. Agriculture 4.0\
    \ can provide a way to increase agricultural\nefﬁciency with the available crop\
    \ area. It also optimizes irrigation to use limited water and\nenergy and allocate\
    \ resources to protect crops effectively. Those would be possible through\nthe\
    \ integration of environmental monitoring, forecasting, and smart devices [5].\
    \ Smart\nfarming’s new technologies can enhance agricultural mechanisms, allowing\
    \ cultivation\nto increase while using natural resources efﬁciently. Agricultural\
    \ sector innovations are\nreferred to as the “digital agricultural revolution”,\
    \ which turns most factors of agriculture,\nensuing in more effective, efﬁcient,\
    \ self-sustaining, integrated, truthful, and self-reliant\nagriculture. Cellular\
    \ devices, sensors, data analysis, fog computing, information security,\nand intelligent\
    \ systems inﬂuence how technologies are integrated into the agricultural\nsector\
    \ [6].\nNowadays, agriculture is changing quickly as it enters a new age known\
    \ as Agriculture\n4.0. Agriculture 4.0 seeks to employ new technology and approaches\
    \ to address the issues\nfacing modern agriculture (such as climatic alteration,\
    \ illnesses, extreme application of\nresources, etc.) and to lower risks while\
    \ enhancing production efﬁciency and safety [7]. To\ndo this, it makes extensive\
    \ use of cutting-edge ICTs.\nIn addition to this evolution, there is a rising\
    \ trend in food needs. Given the continual\nevolution and the rising need for\
    \ food, it is anticipated that the market for agriculture 4.0\nwill expand greatly\
    \ in the years to come.\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) technologies are\nwidely utilized in Agriculture 4.0 and provide farmers\
    \ with a number of advantages,\nincluding observing numerous environmental factors\
    \ connected to crops, spotting crop\nillnesses, predicting yield, and lowering\
    \ labor costs [8]. However, the Sensor and network\nconnectivity and communications\
    \ in farming might act as a base factor for many types of\nattacks since these\
    \ devices frequently have obsolete or unpatched ﬁrmware or software [9].\nSecurity\
    \ is a top priority in agriculture, and any interruption or distortion may present\n\
    difﬁcult problems and have disastrous outcomes. Monitoring and categorization\
    \ of net-\nwork trafﬁc, which have attracted a lot of attention since the earliest\
    \ beginnings of the\nInternet, can be crucial to preventing network assaults [10].\
    \ Scientiﬁc research on network\ntrafﬁc categorization for IoT system security\
    \ has been extensive. It is an essential part of\nintrusion detection systems\
    \ (IDS) and aids in the identiﬁcation and detection of harmful\nnetwork activity.\n\
    This revolution in agricultural technology is built on having access to all the\
    \ data\nproduced by every sensor used on a farm, centralized via the internet,\
    \ and analyzed for the\nbest possible decision-making [11]. Any sensor employed\
    \ generates a signiﬁcant amount\nof data that can be extensively examined and\
    \ provides useful information to enhance crop\nquality or lessen environmental\
    \ impact. Cloud computing, physical hardware, and the\nIoT are the three key components\
    \ that enable the automation and data sharing needed by\nthis new smart agriculture\
    \ [12]. With the help of technical improvements (drones, sensors,\nsoftware, etc.),\
    \ we can complete agricultural jobs faster and more effectively than humans.\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 must make sure that an appropriate security mechanism is imple-\n\
    mented to avert an attack to build scalable and secure systems. The integrity\
    \ of data is\nimportant for the effective functioning of information technological\
    \ advances such as data\nanalysis and intelligent devices [13]. Because agriculture\
    \ 4.0 incorporates elements from\nconventional Internet, cellular, and wireless\
    \ technologies, which may include all of the\nsecurity risks that advancements\
    \ present situation. It also addresses current security risks\nsuch as data and\
    \ device integrity, consistency, and accessibility. Devices in agriculture 4.0\n\
    are implemented in outdoor spaces where they are subjected to external factors\
    \ such as ani-\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n3 of 27\nmals, human beings, or farming\
    \ equipment. Unknowingly, these factors remove or damage\nsensors. Since the 6th\
    \ century B.C., there has been a threat known as Agro terrorism [5].\nThis type\
    \ of terrorism could have a variety of goals, including causing ﬁnancial harm,\
    \ fear,\nand social unrest [6,7]. Terrorists could incite community disturbance\
    \ and lack of credibility\nin administration by exploiting agricultural and food\
    \ corporate crises, which can lead to\nundivided attention in the world. Cyber-agro-terrorism\
    \ in agriculture 4.0 is an electronic\nsystem in agricultural settings to harm\
    \ crops and animals while causing economic loss.\nCyber-agro-terrorists can operate\
    \ attacks on ﬁelds and through the internet, using cyber\nresources [8].\n2. Overview\
    \ of Agriculture 4.0\nAgriculture has gone through many revolutionary movements,\
    \ all of which have\nincreased the agriculture industry’s performance and effectiveness.\n\
    Plant cultivation “in 10,000 BC” resulted in the birth of the world’s ﬁrst societies\n\
    and civilizations. Machines were used in the farming sector to execute work, which\n\
    increased production from 1900 to 1930. Farmers were able to use newly discovered\
    \ crops\nand agrochemicals during the Green Revolution (from around the 1960s).\
    \ Biotechnology\nfacilitated the production of plants with previously selected\
    \ attributes, with increased yield\nand pest resistance, desertiﬁcation, and herbicide,\
    \ from 1990 to 2000. Now, in the 21st\ncentury, digitalization has the potential\

    \ and the constrained\nfood output. The advancement of science and technology\
    \ fuels the revolution in agriculture,\nwhich is based on both the rise in output\
    \ and the limitations of the time [14]. Figure 1 is\nused to explain the features\

    4 of 27\nAgriculture 1.0: During the conventional agricultural age (1784–1870),\
    \ which was\ndominated by animal and human resources, the fundamental problem\
    \ with agriculture\nwas its lack of operational efﬁciency.\nAgriculture 2.0: During\
    \ the automated agricultural period of the 20th century, resource\nwaste was the\
    \ major problem.\nAgriculture 3.0: During the period of rapid advancement of automated\
    \ agriculture\n(1992–2017), the key problem was the lack of intelligence.\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0: the age of smart agriculture (which began in 2017 and is deﬁned\nby unmanned\
    \ operations) is primarily characterized by the application of contemporary\n\
    information technology to both support and intelligently improve agriculture.\n\
    The term “smart agriculture” [15] refers to a new approach to agriculture that\
    \ per-\nsonalized service through the integration of contemporary information\
    \ technologies such\nas the internet, big data, IoT, and many more [16]. In a\
    \ nutshell, the new mode is an\nintelligent agricultural solution that fuses current\
    \ information technology with agriculture.\nAlthough recent information technology\
    \ opens up new possibilities for the progress of\nagricultural output, it also\
    \ places heavy demands on security and privacy in the context of\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and poses signiﬁcant obstacles therein [17].\nMore than a movement, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 represents the next development in the sector’s\ntransition to a more intelligent,\
    \ effective, and environmentally responsible one. The supply\nchain’s daily operations\
    \ produce a tremendous amount of data [18]. Most of the time, this\ninformation\
    \ went unused, but thanks to big data and new technology, it can now be used\n\
    to boost any crop’s performance and productivity.\n2.1. Advantages of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\nThe effects of smart agriculture are covered in the following sections.\n\
    Production volume: The use of smart technology in agriculture can signiﬁcantly\n\
    boost the number of products produced on the farm. This will contribute to feeding\
    \ a\ngrowing population.\nProduction quality: The wellness and nutrition of people\
    \ from all socioeconomic strata\nin the nation can be signiﬁcantly impacted by\
    \ the quality of food produced. A country’s\npopulation will live longer and in\
    \ better health with better food, which will improve its\ncitizens’ economic contribution.\n\
    Effectiveness of farming practices and resource use: The application of smart\
    \ technolo-\ngies to conventional agricultural operations can increase their effectiveness.\
    \ In turn, this\nencourages more efﬁcient use of agricultural resources.\nIdeal\
    \ cost of cultivation: It is achieved when there is a balance between quantity,\
    \ quality,\nand efﬁciency in the procedures used. This results in a higher price\
    \ for the agricultural\noutput that is produced.\nReducing wastage: The farming\
    \ industry, one of the main economic sectors, is in great\npart to blame for the\
    \ massive quantities of food and other secondary resources that are\nwasted. Smart\
    \ technology could be employed to track and cut down on this waste.\nEcologically\
    \ sustainable: The reduced agricultural waste and improved agricultural\nprocess\
    \ efﬁciency directly reduce the environmental and ecological footprint.\nEffective\
    \ use of Time: Timely delivery of the necessary insecticides, fertilizers, and\n\
    other chemicals can provide timely and high-quality agricultural output with fewer\
    \ losses\nthanks to smart agriculture.\nThe farming industry may be at threat\
    \ by the following while deploying agricultural\n4.0 technology:\n•\nTheft of\
    \ business and customer data.\n•\nTaking resources under the control of sensors\
    \ and gadgets.\n•\nDestroying the objects that devices control.\n•\nDamage to\
    \ reputation if a data breach is disclosed.\nAgriculture 4.0 may be at risk from\
    \ infrastructure damage, sensor failures may affect\npoultry and cattle breeding,\
    \ and control system hacks may affect greenhouse farming. All\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n5 of 27\nof these could cause problems or malfunction in agricultural\
    \ operations by harming the\nIoT architecture’s hardware and software. In addition,\
    \ data-collecting technologies face\nchallenges from malicious assaults, unauthorized\
    \ access, privacy breaches, and other issues.\nThe landscape has shifted, with\
    \ AI and ML research concentrating on agro-based\ncontexts, water management,\
    \ livestock, and farmlands. Monitoring, control, and decision-\nmaking alternatives\
    \ in the irrigation ﬁeld repeatedly tried to save water and enhance\nproductivity\
    \ [8–13]. Some research concentrated on plant leaf disease [14], horticulture\
    \ [15],\nvineyards [16], hydroponic [17], alert facilities [18], integration of\
    \ IoT technological innova-\ntions [19], tracking resources [20], and cloud control\
    \ [21].\n2.2. IoT in Agriculture 4.0\nTable 1 lists several well-known uses of\

    \ technologies\nto breed animals and uses precision agriculture to enhance the\
    \ quantity and quality of\nthe produce.\nSmart harvesting system: This system\
    \ harvests a ﬁeld effectively by using IoT-\nbased methods.\nSmart farm management\

    \ The ﬁnal product is greatly\ninﬂuenced by the quantity and quality of the groundwater.\
    \ As a result, this system uses\nIoT approaches to maintain appropriate groundwater\
    \ levels.\nThough there are many smart agriculture alternatives, they are still\
    \ underdeveloped\nand offer a low degree of intellect. Many initiatives are limited\
    \ in their automated systems,\nwith the internet of things sending data to the\
    \ base station [53]. There is also no implemen-\ntation with the Internet in several\
    \ cases, except that in a few cases, data is stored in the\ncloud by the local\
    \ systems.\nThe multi-layer architecture of IoT used in agriculture 4.0 consists\
    \ of four layers,\nwhich are the physical layer, network layer, edge layer, and\
    \ application layer. Table 2 below\ngives a detailed description of Resources\

    \ these devices are all implemented in\nthe physical layer, which collects data\
    \ from the farming ﬁeld and digitizes them using\nan Analog to Digital converter\
    \ (ADC). As the equipment at the physical layer does not\ncompute and store the\
    \ data, this needs to connect with the edge layer through the network\nlayer.\
    \ The edge layer includes various resources such as decision-making, gateway,\
    \ data\nﬁlters, data security, and interfaces [55].\nThe advancement of devices\
    \ and technological developments will allow for the in-\ncorporation of more computer\
    \ capabilities into systems. This type of integration aims to\nmeet the various\
    \ needs of agricultural mechanization, farming techniques, and sustainable\nagriculture\
    \ [56,57]. A further issue is data security. This is very important to focus on\n\
    data privacy, the trustworthiness of data, and the correctness of data from generation\
    \ to\ndecision-making.\n2.3. Research Motivation\nThree factors serve as inspiration\
    \ for this article:\n1.\nSmart agriculture is a new paradigm that integrates information\
    \ technology with\nconventional farming as a result of the low productivity of\
    \ traditional agriculture\nand the extensive usage of information technology.\
    \ It has the potential to become the\nnext big thing in agricultural development.\
    \ Consequently, it is crucial to outline the\ncurrent manufacturing model and\
    \ particular studies [58].\n2.\nDespite substantial research on smart agriculture,\
    \ less has been conducted in compar-\nison to industrial security solutions to\
    \ analyze security problems.\n3.\nIt is crucial to examine the features of security\
    \ concerns in relation to situations\ninvolving smart agriculture [59]. This article\
    \ attempts to give a review of the security\nchallenges raised by smart agriculture\
    \ in light of the aforementioned variables, which\ninevitably results in a signiﬁcant\
    \ number of open research questions.\n2.4. Research Contributions\nThe research\

    \ with physical equipment such as sensors and actuators.\nPhysical devices can\
    \ fail due to unintentional or intentional human behavior, viruses,\nspyware,\
    \ or cyber-attacks. Smart farming applications use a wide range of sensors and\n\
    technologies, and this diversity opens up several security risks, including the\
    \ following:\nRandom device incidents: This is the unintended alteration of physical\
    \ equipment\nthat causes it to deviate from its normal performance. The physical\
    \ equipment may be\ndamaged by farm machinery, causing short- or long-term physical\
    \ damage, as a result,\ngenerates false data and affects data accessibility.\n\
    Mobile node hijacking: It is the theft of farm equipment such as tractors, drones,\
    \ and\nsowing robots. Drones can indeed be pesticides, fertilizers sprinkling\
    \ could be performed\nby Drone, and robots could do weeding detecting disease.\
    \ The intruder may access and\nuse the farm equipment remotely without having\
    \ access permission.\nFake node: An intruder introduces imitation or harmful nodes\
    \ into the automated\nagriculture ﬁeld to disturb the smooth functioning of the\
    \ system [55]. This attack could be\ntriggered by capturing a node and making\
    \ a replica of it. This type of attack typically aims\nto either alter or modify\
    \ data-shuttered devices and applications.\nAbnormal Measurement: It senses unusual\
    \ observations due to data falsiﬁcation,\nenergy exhaustion, radio radiation,\
    \ detection of various connections, extreme storms,\nmalfunctions, or wrong inputs.\
    \ Incorrect data can jeopardize making decisions that result\nin the analysis\
    \ of data will be inaccurate, which minimizes system correctness.\nSleeplessness\
    \ attack: The sleeplessness attack sends a series of seemingly legitimate\nrequests\
    \ in order to keep the devices awake for prolonged life. As a result, the device’s\n\
    battery runs out, and the device stops working [56,57]. When the devices are turned\n\
    off, the observed information is not properly sent, jeopardizing decision-making\
    \ and\nsystem efﬁciency.\n3.2. Security Risks at Network Layer\nThe objective\
    \ of this layer is to send the generated data by the sensors from the physical\n\
    layer to the most trustable computational unit, which is the cloud. The most common\n\
    attacks, which affect the resources used in the network layer, are focused on\
    \ [58,59]. The\nsecurity risks in network layers are:\nDistributed Denial of Service\
    \ (DDoS): It attempts to affect access to service providers\nby overburdening\
    \ the communication link or manipulating protocol ﬂaws, which cause\nresources,\
    \ such as CPU and memory collapse [60].\nDue to resource exhaustion brought on\
    \ by a DDoS attack, the victim server is forced\nto block connections from new\
    \ reliable clients. The victim server’s buffer capacity or\nbandwidth may have\
    \ reached its limit of resources. The overall probability of resource\nscarcity\
    \ at the target end is provided by Equation (1) [15].\nPAttack = 1 − (1 − PBandwidth)\n\
    \01 − Pmemory\n\x01\n(1)\nwhere,\nPAttack: Probability of total attack,\nPBandwidth:\
    \ Probability of Consumption of bandwidth\nPmemory: Probability of Consumption\
    \ of memory\nAttacks on Data Transit: These types of attacks aim to retrieve information\
    \ shared\nbetween network devices in order to obtain conﬁdential information [61].\
    \ An adversary\ncould intercept trafﬁc via malicious routers or man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks [62]. Intercep-\ntion of trafﬁc reveals conﬁdential data such as private\
    \ keys, access credentials, or digital\nsignatures.\nAttacks on Routers: They\
    \ plan to change network routes in order to gain trafﬁc control.\nInimical nodes\
    \ in IoT networks might attempt to reroute communicating paths during the\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757\n10 of 27\nprocess of transmission. As a result of attacks, the\
    \ receiver might receive information lately,\npartially, or incorrectly, or not\
    \ at all [63,64].\nMalware Injection Attacks: The malware injection attack [34],\
    \ in which malware is\ninjected by an attacker into a connected computing device.\
    \ This is a very common attack\non smart farming. Malware is a very signiﬁcant\
    \ threat in distributed projects because it\nautomatically spreads through the\
    \ system, making it an appealing target for intruders.\nMalware damage comes in\
    \ multiple varieties of sizes. Malware can steal data about farm\nmaterial usage,\
    \ buying information for fruits, vegetables, and farm animals, data about\nfarm\
    \ equipment, and so on. It could hire automated devices to form a botnet that\
    \ would be\nused to commit harmful attacks under the inﬂuence of an intruder.\n\
    Botnet: At each architectural layer of the precision farming system, there are\
    \ numer-\nous IoT devices. These machines are vulnerable to attack and could be\
    \ taken over by a\ncentralized malicious system. This results in a ‘Botnet of\
    \ Things’ (BoT) [35]. A mutant farm\nworkforce IoT equipment that is already infected\
    \ [36] is easily used to infect other networks\nvia various communication links,\
    \ and thus automated farming could become an internet of\ndestructibility for\
    \ cyber illegitimates. The security features are not added in many of the\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture devices, but still, they are used frequently for establishing adequate\n\
    data security defensive system frameworks.\n3.3. Security Risks at Edge Layer\n\
    The edge contains important aspects that monitor, and control modules communicate\n\
    with all layers and access resources. The physical layer’s large volumes of data\
    \ can be\nprocessed locally rather than centralized in the cloud. The following\
    \ are major edge\nsecurity issues.\nActuator control Forge: It introduces false\
    \ measures of data into the system in order to\nmanipulate it. Typically, the\
    \ data is received by the gateway in plain text. Corrupted data\nwill lead to\
    \ poor decision-making. An opponent, for example, could inject incorrect soil\n\
    moisture measurements into a smart irrigation system to manipulate it.\nBooting\
    \ Attacks: Devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of security processes\n\
    during boot [37]. Memory cards and ﬂash drive sticks, for example, may detect\
    \ dangerous\ncodes which run at startup [38]. Suspicious booting practices could\
    \ launch numerous\nattacks on the edge with insufﬁcient protection.\nSignature\
    \ wrapping: The attacker modulates the cipher text by inserting a bogus\nelement\
    \ that allows you to perform a random Web Application requisition while identifying\n\
    as an authenticated user [39].\nMeasure infusion Forgery: It is the injection\
    \ of wrong speciﬁcations into a system in\norder to modify it. An attacker sends\
    \ known data patterns through actuators to the cloud\nstorage, which is then injected\
    \ into the system through computational units. Corrupted\ndata could lead to poor\
    \ decision-making.\nUnauthorized access: The process of validating is a critical\
    \ security component. The\nauthentication process is a technology that ensures\
    \ security and privacy, honesty, and\naccessibility [40]. Several agricultural\
    \ practices, however, use gateways with insufﬁcient or\nno access controls.\n\
    Gateway-cloud fabrication: The cloud and the gateway are linked by ISPs or wireless\n\
    connections. A network attacker could fabricate cloud requests by interrogating\
    \ a gateway.\nThe attacker could use these requests to change parameters in precision\
    \ agriculture, control\nqueries for sensitive services, or interpret system equipment.\
    \ The cloud can implement\nsecurity services as it has computational power. In\
    \ order to ensure maximum system\nreliability, these strategies must be incorporated\
    \ into the system.\n3.4. Security Risks at Application Layer\nThis layer provides\

    \ security concerns are application-speciﬁc, focusing on preventing data theft\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n11 of 27\nand ensuring privacy. Some of the attacks that\
    \ might affect cloud services and applications\nare listed below in terms of security.\n\
    Malicious scripts: Malicious scripts can deceive clients, infuse malicious data,\
    \ access\nconﬁdential material, and compromise security features. This type of\
    \ attack is frequently\ncarried out by cybercriminals for speciﬁc, economic, or\
    \ political reasons. They can damage\nor destabilize operational processes by\
    \ using malicious scripts, presenting unnecessary ad\ncampaigns, and stealing\
    \ money [41].\nPhishing: It is an attack that attempts to obtain highly classiﬁed\
    \ personal informa-\ntion, such as an Identity and password, fraudulently. Phishing\
    \ typically targets end-users\nthrough fraud and sites [42]. The attacker also\
    \ affects decision-making and internal opera-\ntions in many cases. The most effective\
    \ protection would be for users to remain vigilant\nwhile surﬁng the web [43].\n\
    Denial of Service (DoS): This threat disrupts service by overburdening trafﬁc\
    \ on the\nnetwork or ﬂooding the provider with repeated attempts [44]. Because\
    \ of ﬂaws in security\nsetup, an attacker can launch this attack from the Web\
    \ or a sub-system.\n4. Security Threats in Modern Agriculture\nFarmers typically\
    \ carry out the developed smart system initiatives in physical ﬁelds\nor green\
    \ ﬁelds. In Agriculture 4.0, most efforts are focused on water processes, disease\n\
    monitoring, seed production, and record keeping. It can be either automatically\
    \ con-\ntrolled or manually controlled. In both cases, the system monitors the\
    \ environment with\nsensors and changes it with actuators. Some initiatives only\
    \ digitize farms, whereas oth-\ners incorporate industry 4.0 or IoT technologies.\
    \ As an immature industry, open-ﬁeld\nagriculture is the focus of this work, with\
    \ security issues restricted to access control and\nweb-encrypted communications.\n\
    It is too difﬁcult to execute different security measures in rural areas since\
    \ there is a\nshortage of modern technical infrastructure and advanced technology.\
    \ Many difﬁculties\ncan arise if security measures are attempted in rural agriculture.\
    \ Table 3 lists a few of the\nsecurity challenges that are prevalent in rural\
    \ locations.\nTable 3. Rural-Agriculture Security Issues.\nRural-Agriculture\n\

    \ 4.0 projects have implemented IoT, but the security\nfeatures in that have become\
    \ disabled by default. It has been introduced that a server con-\ntrols and manages\
    \ these devices remotely via a web application. Opportunistic opponents\ndid not\
    \ know details about security resources. They gain unauthorized access to the\
    \ system,\ninsert fabricated measures, fabricate actuator controls, or report\
    \ earlier attacks to divert\nthe system from its normal functioning [45–64]. The\
    \ author proposed a smart watering\nsystem that remotely controls and observes\
    \ the ﬂow of water in the farm but is not focused\non security risks to detect\
    \ malicious attacks and unallowed access that manipulate the\nmonitored data.\
    \ To monitor the growing environment, ref. [65] introduce a Hydroponic\nFarming\
    \ Ecosystem (HFE). It is automatically controlled, and the client can monitor\
    \ the\nfarming via a web interface. These automated systems require high-security\
    \ concerns to\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n12 of 27\ndetect or avoid random sensor\
    \ incidents, weak sensors, wrong data injection, and other\nattacks, which could\
    \ corrupt data and affect system reliability.\nSimilarly, in [66], the author\
    \ focused on creating a system for monitoring ﬁelds based\non humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ light levels, and temperature. Irrigation can be controlled\nmanually or automatically\
    \ via web or mobile systems. An intelligent solution for detecting\ndiseases in\
    \ leaves focused in [67]. By using sensor data and camera images, the system\n\
    identiﬁes leaf diseases. A mobile or web application is used by the end-user to\
    \ interact\nwith the system. This paper does not go into detail about the implementation\
    \ of security.\nSimilarly, ref. [68] proposed an intelligent agricultural system\
    \ for information inter-\nchange among farm equipment. The article discusses the\
    \ system’s construction but makes\nno mention of manual intervention or remote\
    \ control, nor does it concern any security\nchallenges. As this is a data exchange\
    \ system, the DoS attack can affect the network layer.\nRef. [69] provides NETPIE,\
    \ a solution that gives agricultural product information. The\ngrowing environment\
    \ can be controlled and monitored with a set of physical devices. The\ngenerated\
    \ data is analyzed saved in a QR code, and which is then available to the customer.\n\
    NETPIE does not discuss security resources. Ref. [51] Introduced monitoring of\
    \ crop ﬁelds\nand watering using IoT, which measures data and controls data to\
    \ avoid unauthorized\naccess to these data but could not protect the other devices,\
    \ which leads to weak security,\nwhich might result in a major loss. Ref. [52]\
    \ Proposed a system known as SEnviro, which\nobserves the crop ﬁeld and detects\
    \ diseases remotely. This system does not focus on the\nprediction of disease,\
    \ but unauthorized access is controlled here.\nAccording to the relevant literature,\
    \ from a security standpoint, farming equipment\nis used without security features.\
    \ Furthermore, the gateway contains no security infor-\nmation. Transmission privacy\
    \ or device authentication is not presented in any of the\nabove-discussed systems.\
    \ Access control and management and encryption of data need\nto add security technologies\
    \ to Information dissemination. Smart agriculture is currently\na convenient target\
    \ for cyber criminals’ agents. Attacks can be motivated by a variety of\nfactors,\
    \ including an advertisement, intellectual, or even terrorist reasons. Terrorist\
    \ groups,\nfor example, can cause ecological loss to a country, economic chancers\
    \ may take part in\nmarket manipulation, and workers can attack a range of factors\
    \ [53].\n4.1. Data and Device Security Issues and Threats in Agriculture 4.0\n\
    As was previously mentioned, harsh environmental factors that can seriously harm\n\
    electromechanical equipment, such as extreme heat, moisture, moisture, shocks,\
    \ and other\nanomalies, have a direct impact on the agricultural sector [70].\
    \ The majority of these\nsensors are prone to failure, making it feasible for\
    \ them to produce inaccurate data and\ninstructions that could cause a manufacturing\
    \ disaster [71]. Additionally, sensors and\nnetwork equipment are predominance\
    \ reachable. This poses a serious risk to farmlands\nsince anybody with bad intentions\
    \ can access them and corrupt or harm them to cause\nthem to malfunction [72].\n\
    Another potential security concern is the online transfer of the information gathered\n\
    by IoT sensors and other agricultural machines. Major security concern in the\
    \ agriculture\nindustry is security, privacy, and control [73], as farmers may\
    \ incur a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial\nand personal loss in the event of a data breach.\
    \ Ref. [74] Divides the threats to conﬁdentiality\ninto four distinct categories:\n\
    •\nIntentional data theft through smart platforms and applications that do not\
    \ adhere to\nsecurity and privacy standards;\n•\nInternal information thefts from\
    \ a stakeholder in the supply chain intended to harm\nan agri-business or a farmer;\n\
    •\nUnethical data sales intended to reduce proﬁts for farmers or to harm them;\
    \ and\nother threats.\n•\nUnsupervised foreign access to private and sensitive\
    \ information using drones, sensors,\nand cameras with the intention of utilizing\
    \ them to harm farmers or jeopardize public\nsafety [64,75].\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n13 of 27\nEvery application of modern technology, IoT in agriculture,\
    \ carries the aforementioned\ndangers, weaknesses, and threats. A more thorough\
    \ and complex explanation of the risks\nand their sources in aspects of cyberattacks\
    \ in the agro sector is provided in the following\nparagraph, which is primarily\
    \ focused on illegal behavior and exploited vulnerabilities in\nICT systems.\n\
    4.2. Cybercrime and Cybersecurity in Agriculture\nA cyber-attack on an agribusiness\
    \ or food industry is increasingly likely today thanks\nto automation and the\
    \ widespread use of internet-connected equipment, which give poten-\ntial (cyber)\
    \ criminals greater chances in ﬁelds that were previously too remote or difﬁcult\n\
    to physically access [61]. Consequently, a potential cyber-attack or security\
    \ problem in\nan agricultural organization could have serious human or ﬁnancial\
    \ repercussions. This\nimplies that pertinent security concerns brought about\
    \ by the widespread and ongoing\nusage of IoT, as well as the emergence of agro-terrorism,\
    \ require adequate attention, better\nequipment, and solutions [62].\nThe bulk\
    \ of system operations in the agriculture sector are network-based, and fre-\n\
    quently these systems are not protected from cyber threats, which can have substantial\n\
    ﬁnancial and security ramiﬁcations [76–86]. Five important elements, as identiﬁed\
    \ in [87],\nstrengthen these risks in the agricultural sector:\n•\nIncreasing\
    \ the farm consolidation highly depends on technology;\n•\nThe joint ventures\
    \ of the food supply chains, allow manufacturers to conduct processes\nand trade\
    \ products directly;\n•\nFood-related technologies in intelligent markets depend\
    \ on more components, which\nincreases their vulnerability to errors and malfunctions.\n\
    •\nEffective monitoring of food-related systems, social networks, and industries\
    \ in a safe,\ndynamic, and almost real-time manner is lacking, making it difﬁcult\
    \ to identify serious\ndigital and security vulnerabilities that could be the\
    \ root of signiﬁcant data breaches\nand system defects.\nDue to the heightened\
    \ risk of cybercrime, the agriculture sector may be impacted by\nsuch threats\
    \ in a number of ways. Categorize these methods as in [84]. Threats of tampering\n\
    include delivery disruption, conﬁdential information interception, formula modiﬁcation,\n\
    and delivery disruption. These risks are undoubtedly closely related to the adoption\
    \ and\napplication of technological advancements in the agriculture and food sectors.\n\
    Cooper et al. and Bogaardt et al. identify the following as the primary technical\n\
    advancement areas that are commonly used in the agri-sector and contain vulnerable\n\
    places for harmful cyber-attacks [86–88]:\n•\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID);\
    \ wireless communications (such as Wi-Fi);\n•\nSensors for the infrastructure,\
    \ soil, and crops;\n•\nDrones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);\n•\n\
    PA-speciﬁc automation solutions (such Real Time Kinematic Technology);\n•\nPortable\
    \ electronics (such as laptops, smartphones, and GPS trackers);\n•\nSmart agriculture\
    \ and vertical agriculture;\n•\nThe use of AI in conjunction with biotech and\
    \ nanotech (AI).\nTable 4 provides a summary of the study performed on different\

    [62,79,92,97,98]\n4.3. IoT Vulnerabilities, Risks, and Threats in Agriculture\n\
    IoT is made up of four main systems that make it possible to communicate between\n\
    nodes. Sensing technology, IoT gateways, cloud servers, data storage, and mobile\
    \ appli-\ncations for remote control make up an IoT system. The architectures\
    \ of IoT systems in\nagriculture come with current and new threats and vulnerabilities.\
    \ These ﬂaws can be\nlinked to IoT device hardware and software problems, communication\
    \ protocols, and also\ndata processing and storage solutions (found, for example,\
    \ in cloud infrastructures, data\ncenters, and smartphones) [2,11].\nAccording\
    \ to [99–101], the following is a concise but accurate classiﬁcation of the\n\
    primary causes of low security in the IoT:\n•\nFirmware that is not patched and/or\
    \ default passwords that have been used for a long\ntime allow for device compromise\
    \ in an IoT network.\n•\nBecause of the limited computing power of smart devices\
    \ and vendors’ efforts to\nkeep their prices low in a cutthroat market, it is\
    \ difﬁcult to incorporate complicated\ncryptographic algorithms.\n•\nFlaws in\
    \ the routing protocols used by smart devices (such as Bluetooth and ZigBee);\n\
    •\nThe Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol’s outdated, low-security version,\
    \ which is\nfrequently still in use;\n•\nConducting passive vulnerability detection\
    \ using search engines;\n•\nThe risk of assembling millions of smart devices into\
    \ a potent botnet (such as Mirai),\ngiven how simple it is to ﬁnd vulnerabilities\
    \ via internet scanning;\n•\nA general disregard for the security of smart gadgets\n\
    Finally, a variety of criteria can be used to categorize IoT vulnerabilities,\
    \ hazards, and\nthreats. These risks apply to all IoT applications, including\
    \ those in the agricultural sector.\nFirst, internal vs. external risks and passive\
    \ vs. active risks are the two basic classiﬁcation\ngroups of security concerns\
    \ in IoT systems in the agriculture sector [79].\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n15\
    \ of 27\nIoT hazards are categorized in another intriguing way using a layer-based\
    \ system.\nAccording to [22], each of the levels below integrates many technologies\
    \ that could lead\nto a variety of security threats, vulnerabilities, and/or breaches.\
    \ The application layer,\nmiddleware layer, internet layer, access gateway layer,\
    \ and edge technology layer are the\nﬁve main layers that make up the IoT architecture.\n\
    5. Existing Research on Security in Agriculture 4.0\nIn [54], the author states\
    \ that The United States Department of Homeland Security\nissued a report emphasizing\
    \ the signiﬁcance of agriculture 4.0 and the associated internet\nsecurity threat\
    \ and possible attacks.\nThe report emphasizes the information security model\
    \ of conﬁdential information,\ncredibility, and accessibility in farming. The\
    \ researchers of [55] suggested a new access\ncontrol solution that combines session\
    \ keys and public keys to speed up the encrypted\ncommunications tasks. It yields\
    \ quick and lightweight appropriate control measures\nthat are ideal for precision\
    \ agriculture communication. Ref. [56] Proposed a framework\nfor understanding\
    \ vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and their application in an\nintelligent\
    \ farming environment. The goal of the approach is to determine the level to\n\
    which intelligent farming emerging innovations are prone to cyber. It assesses\
    \ the threat\nprediction model using the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS).\n\
    Nowadays, The Blockchain is not only used in cryptocurrency but also utilized\
    \ in\nother ﬁelds and different applications such as in the medical sector, agriculture\
    \ sector,\netc. [57–59]. This article concentrated on the application of blockchain\
    \ technology to food\nsafety. For tracking and monitoring the food items and stages\
    \ of production, such as\ncultivation/breeding, raw resources, processing, transporting,\
    \ warehousing, and selling,\nthe author developed a system [60]. In addition,\
    \ the system employs a variety of sensor-\nbased equipment to adopt sustainable\
    \ recording and conﬁrmation with sensor-based\nveriﬁcation. Ref. [61] Proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based easy and simple security framework for\nsmart Greenﬁeld farming.\
    \ Each IoT node can nominate the cluster member’s leader, which\nhelps to avoid\
    \ a hot spot problem if an intruder focuses on the leader node. Furthermore,\n\
    the authors discussed the security risks of their suggested scheme, which adhered\
    \ to the\ntraditional conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability principles.\
    \ Ref. [62] proposed a cost-\neffective IoT-based security monitoring system.\
    \ The physical layer is the primary concern\nof this system of precision agriculture,\
    \ where data are collected from sensors. These data\nare sent to a controller,\
    \ which analyses it to take action, such as activating the actuators for\nwater\
    \ sprinklers on farms. Table 5 describes some of the recent research which has\
    \ already\nbeen performed on security issues related to smart farming.\nGupta,\
    \ M et al. explained [102] the necessity of clouds applied in vehicles in this\
    \ time-\nand location-sensitive context and present an extended access control\
    \ oriented (E-ACO)\narchitecture that is pertinent to IoV. Here, they describe\
    \ using scenarios to highlight access\ncontrol needs in our vision of cloud-assisted\
    \ connected automobiles and vehicular IoT, as\nwell as approaches to various access\
    \ control models that may be applied at different tiers\nof the E-ACO architecture\
    \ and in the authorization framework.\nGupta, M et al. [103], in their work, describe\
    \ an edge infrastructure-based solution to\nV2V and V2I communication that is\
    \ safe and trustworthy in place of direct peer-to-peer\nconnection. To approve,\
    \ check, and verify the authenticity, integrity, and anonymity of\ncommunications\
    \ sent in the system, they add trusted cloudlets in this section. Along with\n\
    a proof of concept implementation of the suggested approach on the AWS IoT platform,\n\
    they also describe a formal attribute-based model for V2V and V2I communication,\
    \ known\nas AB-ITS. This cloudlet-supported architecture supports crucial use\
    \ cases such as an\naccident or ice-threat warning and other safety applications.\
    \ It supplements direct V2V or\nV2I communication.\nSontowski, S. et al. [104]\
    \ presented a DoS attack that can impair a smart farm’s\noperation by interfering\
    \ with the functioning of installed on-ﬁeld sensors. They speciﬁcally\ncovered\
    \ a Wi-Fi de-authentication attack that makes use of ﬂaws in IEEE 802.11, where\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n16 of 27\nthe management packets are not encrypted. A\
    \ development board for the ESP8266 maker\nfocus When a Raspberry Pi is attached,\
    \ WiFi Deauther Monster is used to disconnect it\nfrom the network and stop sensor\
    \ data from being transferred to a distant cloud.\nThe notion of Activity-Centric\
    \ Access Control (ACAC) for smart and connected ecosys-\ntems was ﬁrst proposed\
    \ by Gupta, M. et al. in [105] and discussed in this article as a ﬁrst\nstep.\
    \ Here, they examined the idea of activity with regard to cooperative and dispersed\n\
    yet interconnected systems, identifying the many parties involved as well as the\
    \ crucial\nelements to consider when making an activity control choice. They provide\
    \ an initial\nframework for developing activity control expressions that may be\
    \ used by various smart\nobjects in the system.\nThe biggest obstacle to the growth\
    \ of cloud computing is security worries. Information\nsecurity continues to have\
    \ an impact on the market even though it raises inconveniences\nrelated to information\
    \ security. The threat of security breaches in the cloud infrastructure\nmust\
    \ be understood by clients. Cloud-computing capacity, networking, and computing\n\
    powers are brought to the edge by fog computing. One of the most critical challenges\
    \ with\nfog computing platforms is safety and security. Lightweight devices have\
    \ beneﬁted greatly\nfrom edge computing’s ability to complete difﬁcult tasks quickly,\
    \ but the technology’s hasty\ndevelopment has led to a general disregard for safety\
    \ risks in edge computing stages and\nthe applications they allow.\nIn our proposed\
    \ framework we have focused on the threats in fog computing-based\nIoT environment\
    \ via blockchain for the application in agriculture 4.0.\nTable 5. Related Research\

    \ manage devices, and store some of it locally. The user can\nobtain information\
    \ from the fog layer while smoothly synchronizing cloud-directed data.\nBlock-chain\
    \ Client software: This consists of a piece of programs that is installed on\n\
    the fog node. Its primary goal is to sync authentic sensitive Sensor data to the\
    \ Blockchain.\nIt is in charge of producing transactions, batching them, and sending\
    \ them to the validator\nso that they can be aggregated into blocks and recorded\
    \ to the Blockchain.\nSimulated Switch: Additionally, this node is used as a transmitting\
    \ device with the\nsupport of virtual switch software, which provides NFV and\
    \ SDN technologies to enhance\nnetwork services by establishing the routing features\
    \ for computational extension and\ncontrol. Some network virtual functions include\
    \ security, quality of service (QoS), and\nautomated control. The main objective\
    \ is to create switching layers for virtual machine\nenvironments while continuing\
    \ to support the OpenFlow protocol [107], which allows this\nnode to interact\
    \ directly with the SDN Controller; an outstanding demonstration of such\nimplementation\
    \ is Open vSwitch, an interactive multilayered software switch.\n6.3. Distributed\
    \ Network Using SDN\nThis network is made up of numerous geologically dispersed\
    \ and SDN controllers\nlinked to it that operates as a common Networking Operating\
    \ System (NOS), combining\nnominally autonomous operations with centralized control\
    \ [108]. The main component of\nan SDN network is the SDN controller. This can\
    \ help with network monitoring by managing\nall transactions among network and\
    \ application devices, allowing it to manage and adjust\nnetwork ﬂows more efﬁciently\
    \ in response to new requirements [109]. It maintains a\nconsistent glimpse of\
    \ the network from afar, delivering data to fog nodes via one APIs and\napplication\
    \ via other APIs (MQTT, CoAP...) [109]. In addition, the SDN controller employs\n\
    a Block-chain contractor to properly secure ﬂow tables of SDN in the Block-chain,\
    \ hence\navoiding rule counterfeit.\n6.4. Block-Chain Based Network\nTo keep all\
    \ the nodes up to date, all Blockchain modules are interconnected and con-\nstantly\
    \ exchange the most updated information in the Blockchain among themselves. Smart\n\
    contracts will trigger and enforce relevant actions based on the data provided,\
    \ allowing\nfor veriﬁable transactions in the Blockchain when such circumstances\
    \ are met without the\nrequirement for third-party involvement [110,111]. The\
    \ Ethereum Blockchain platform\nserves as the foundation for the blockchain network\
    \ architecture because it provides a\nhighly ﬂexible and modular design that separates\
    \ the runtime environment as per the\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n19 of 27\napplication\
    \ domain, permitting agreements to deﬁne the business rules for the application\n\
    that are not necessary for the core system’s fundamental design.\nThe Blockchain\
    \ complete node is made up of the following components:\n1.\nNode for Validation:\
    \ This is a key component that veriﬁes batches of transactions\nbefore combining\
    \ them into blocks. It also ensures that candidate blocks are added to\nthe Blockchain\
    \ version for each node.\n2.\nBlockchain Software: it determines which transactions\
    \ or operations are permitted on\nthe block-chain and contains the following:\n\
    •\nDatabase model: it deﬁnes relevant operations and the description of the transac-\n\
    tion’s payload.\n•\nTransaction Processor: deﬁnes the business logic for different\
    \ applications, vali-\ndates batches of transactions, and modiﬁes the blockchain\
    \ system based on the\napplication’s rules.\n•\nClient: it speciﬁes the service\
    \ client functionality, which the client develops and\ndelivers to the validator.\
    \ The client also shows blockchain information.\n•\nREST API: This protocol is\
    \ used to communicate within the clients and the\ntransactions processing system.\n\
    3.\nDigital Signature: To ensure transaction integrity, the data used in the transactions\
    \ is\nhashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted using the sender’s secret key to\
    \ produce a\nsignature. The processor then validates the transaction by verifying\
    \ this signature.\n7. Case Studies and Experimental Results\nTo test the security\
    \ framework, we allowed DDoS attacks against the Blockchain\nNetwork. A distributed\
    \ denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targets websites and servers by\ndisrupting\
    \ network services. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application’s resources.\n\

    Modernization of agricultural methods is required to increase productivity levels\n\
    while conserving nature. Precision agriculture could improve farming works by\
    \ controlling\nactuators more efﬁciently, enhancing the use of resources, increasing\
    \ revenues, and mini-\nmizing expenses. In order to accomplish this objective,\
    \ IoT technologies have to incorporate\nmore computing performance, such as edge\
    \ computing, big data handling, automated\nresources, and safety features. As\
    \ limited devices sense a huge amount of data and forward\nit to the gateway or\
    \ the cloud, security requires special attention. The data must be secured\nthroughout\
    \ the agricultural system, from diagnosis to risks and inventory.\nEven though\
    \ numerous security issues may affect farming production, they still\ninclude\
    \ a few security measures. This could be because these technologies were in their\n\
    initial phases of development. For most of the points, only computing resources\
    \ are\nincorporated, and that has limited computation power. As a result, security\
    \ mechanisms\nare very rare in the current list of requirement speciﬁcations.\
    \ Reaching a higher level\nof agricultural development, on the other hand, necessitates\
    \ technologies with security\nfeatures that provide enough quality and validity\
    \ to incorporate these technologies on a\nhigh level. As precision agriculture\
    \ introduces new complexities, it also opens up new\nfuture directions in security\
    \ and other areas.\nIn this study, we suggested a security framework for the agricultural\
    \ internet of things\nthat integrates blockchain technology, fog computing, and\
    \ software-deﬁned networking.\nThe suggested architecture avoids the requirement\
    \ for simulation-based work with both\nprivate and public blockchain for communication\
    \ between SDN controllers and IoT devices.\nHere, for IoT connectivity, each SDN\
    \ controller is linked to a blockchain. SDN controllers\nare interconnected by\
    \ a network’s topology. One of the key objectives of the proposed\narchitecture\
    \ is to enhance communication security for IoT devices. For IoT devices with\n\
    limited resources, distributed trust-based veriﬁcation makes blockchain even more\
    \ use-\nful. With a focus on ﬁxing security and data reliability issues in a distributed\
    \ controller\ncontext. Additionally, we want to increase the accuracy of our system\
    \ using machine\nlearning methods.\nIt might be signiﬁcant to add an intrusion\
    \ detection system utilizing various deep\nlearning algorithms in future work\
    \ to prevent the insertion of fake Sensor data in the\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.P., S.D. and S.R.; methodology,\

    effective utilization of information technology are likely to increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of companies.\nBecause of the broad variety of sensors that are currently accessible,\
    \ the possibilities for Internet of\nThings (IoT) applications in the olive oil\
    \ industry are almost limitless. Although previous studies\nhave investigated\
    \ the impact of the IoT on the performance of industries, this issue has yet to\
    \ be\nexplored in the olive oil industry. In this study we aimed to develop a\

    \ their performance.\nKeywords: Internet of things; performance; machine learning;\
    \ supply chain; olive oil industry\n1. Introduction\nDigital transformation is\
    \ the application of digital innovations to enable a company to\nmake large advancements\
    \ and to inﬂuence all aspects of clients’ and customers’ lives [1,2].\nThe ability\
    \ of businesses to participate in the so-called industrial revolution 4.0, deﬁned\n\
    by the convergence of digital, physical, and biological technology, may determine\
    \ their\nchances of surviving and competing in the global market in the medium\
    \ term [3]. At\nthe organizational level, digital transformation focuses on innovative\
    \ tactics that leverage\ndigital technology to improve and boost corporate operations\
    \ [4].\nUsing digital tools for business and process management, the manufacturing\
    \ industry\nhas experienced a digital revolution in the last few decades [5–7].\
    \ The Internet of the future\nwill be based on heterogeneous devices that will\
    \ further expand the boundaries of the\nworld’s physical and virtual entities\
    \ [8]. As a result, human intervention is not required\nto transmit these data\
    \ via computers through a network. They can form an interface with\nother operators\
    \ or machines to make the operation more efﬁcient and easier. Technology\nhas\
    \ evolved as the backbone of the industrial sector in today’s technologically\
    \ advanced\nand diverse globe. The IoT or Internet of Things is widely recognized\
    \ as a new information\ntechnology revolution, producing a paradigm shift in various\
    \ industries, including the\nentire production of supply chain management [9,10].\
    \ The IoT refers to networked comput-\ning devices, both digital and mechanical,\
    \ that use sensors linked to people and machines to\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11010271\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n2 of 22\ngenerate unprecedented volumes of valuable and\
    \ precise data about processes in order to\nimprove them [11].\nAccording to previous\
    \ research, today’s global food supply chains are highly dis-\npersed and complex,\
    \ spanning a large geographical range, involving complex operational\nprocesses\
    \ and involving many stakeholders [12,13]. Researchers claim that this complexity\n\
    leads to numerous issues with operational efﬁciency, quality management, and public\n\
    food safety. In the food supply chain, the IoT, which collects data through sensors,\
    \ has\nsigniﬁcantly affected the normal operations of supply chains [12,14].\n\
    Utilizing IoT in the food industry’s supply chain has enabled the measurement\
    \ and\nmonitoring of numerous sustainability indicators such as water efﬁciency,\
    \ crop produc-\ntivity, and the amount of fertilizer used [15,16]. The IoT has\
    \ been utilized extensively to\nfacilitate the interconnection of objects regardless\
    \ of their location to share data through-\nout the supply chain [17,18]. Perishable\
    \ food items can be tracked using radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation or RFID in the\
    \ food supply chain, including temperature monitoring during\nstorage and shipping\
    \ and the determination of shelf life. Livestock, quality control, cold-\nchain\
    \ monitoring management, supply chain management, and food traceability are other\n\
    RFID applications.\nAdopting and effectively utilizing IT is likely to increase\
    \ a company’s efﬁciency.\nWorkers must change their abilities to more analytical\
    \ and computational abilities in\nan organization. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ machine learning, and the IoT all work together\nto support a company’s overall\
    \ growth strategy. Market organization has beneﬁted from\ntechnological advancements\
    \ because they have made it more convenient.\nAs a result, rather than changing\
    \ a single component, the entire process must be up-\ndated to achieve the result\
    \ desired from the technology. The organization must concentrate\non a competitive\
    \ strategy to avoid disruptions to the current business model. As a result\nof\
    \ technical improvements, business organizations have grown tremendously, and\
    \ these\nimprovements help to improve existing company processes and work practices.\
    \ Technolog-\nical innovation has led to the discovery of a new and more efﬁcient\
    \ manner of conducting\nbusiness, enabling companies to function more efﬁciently,\
    \ rapidly, and easily. According to\nFord, humans must also learn about the talents\
    \ of automation in order to beneﬁt from its\ncheaper costs and faster performance.\n\
    Because of the wide variety of sensors that are currently accessible, as well\
    \ as the\neven greater availability of tools based on AI solutions to analyze\
    \ the large number of\ndata collected, the possibilities for IoT applications\
    \ in the olive oil industry are almost\nlimitless. It is possible to improve supply\
    \ chain processes and control at all levels, from\nraw materials within a plant\
    \ to the distribution of products to businesses, by using IoT\ntechnologies in\
    \ agri-food industries [15,16], such as the olive oil industry. It also streamlines\n\
    the data-collecting process, assisting the olive oil sector in maintaining greater\
    \ levels of\nsafety and traceability throughout the whole supply chain, as well\
    \ as reducing costs, waste,\nand even risks.\nIt is widely accepted that the IoT\
    \ can signiﬁcantly affect industry performance from\ndifferent perspectives, such\
    \ as supply chain performance, ﬁnancial performance, and\nenvironmental performance\
    \ [19]. However, although previous studies have investigated\nthe impact of the\
    \ IoT on the performance of industries [20,21], this issue has yet to be\nexplored\
    \ in the olive oil industry. In addition, most previous studies have used old-style\n\
    mythologies to assess the IoT’s contributions to industries’ performance. Machine\
    \ learning\ntechniques have rarely been explored and implemented to ﬁnd the relationship\
    \ between\nsupply chain improvement and olive oil companies’ performance. This\
    \ problem was\ninvestigated in relation to olive oil companies in this study.\
    \ To understand the role of the\nIoT in olive oil company performance, in this\
    \ study, we aimed to develop a new model\nto investigate the factors inﬂuencing\
    \ supply chain improvement in olive oil companies.\nIn addition, through the use\
    \ of a model, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between\nsupply chain improvement\
    \ and olive oil companies’ performance. Demand planning,\nmanufacturing, transportation,\
    \ customer service, warehousing, and inventory management\nProcesses 2023, 11,\
    \ 271\n3 of 22\nwere the main factors incorporated into the proposed model. Accordingly,\
    \ a new method of\ndata analysis using machine-learning techniques was developed.\
    \ Clustering and decision\ntrees were employed in the development of the method.\
    \ The proposed model used several\nfactors discovered through a literature review.\
    \ The data for this study were collected from\nrespondents with knowledge of the\
    \ integration of new technologies into the industry. Self-\norganizing map (SOM)\
    \ clustering and decision trees were employed in the development\nof the method.\
    \ SOM has been an effective technique for data clustering. In addition, the\n\
    decision tree technique is robust for output prediction from a set of input variables.\
    \ The\nhybrid combination of these techniques was believed to accurately predict\
    \ the relationship\nbetween supply chain improvement and olive oil companies’\
    \ performance. We present the\nabbreviations used in this study in Table 1.\n\

    \ Oil Industry\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture, or IoT-based smart\
    \ agriculture, refers to\na network in which the physical components of the system\
    \ (plants and animals, production\ntools, environmental elements, and various\
    \ virtual objects) are connected to the Internet\nthrough the use of equipment\
    \ for agricultural information management under certain\nprotocols to exchange\
    \ information within different components [22,23]. Sensors made\nusing new technologies\
    \ based on the IoT are constantly being developed in the agricultural\nsector\
    \ for different purposes, driven by the development of the Internet, digital technology,\n\
    and sensing technology [24]. These sensors are moving in the direction of being\
    \ embedded,\nintegrated, intelligent, and miniaturized. The United States, Japan,\
    \ and Germany currently\nhold leading positions in relation to sensor technology\
    \ and manufacturing methods. The\nroles of agricultural sensors are becoming increasingly\
    \ diverse and now include weather,\nwater, soil, and plant sensors. These sensors,\
    \ which can be used to identify a wide range of\nitems, provide invaluable assistance\
    \ in collecting agricultural production data [25]. Indus-\ntrialized countries’\
    \ agricultural IoT applications are becoming more efﬁcient as information\ntechnology\
    \ progresses. Monitoring and intelligent management can be used with artiﬁcial\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n4 of 22\nintelligence technologies to maximize sensor\
    \ data utilization. When utilized in conjunction\nwith expert systems, the Internet\
    \ of Things in agriculture helps planters improve their\nplanting experience while\
    \ conducting accurate crop management. The IoT has been widely\napplied to many\
    \ elements of agricultural production, including environmental monitoring\nin\
    \ agricultural product production, farmland irrigation, and product safety traceability.\
    \ It\nhas also been utilized in veterinary medicine, aquaculture, and agricultural\
    \ planting.\nThe applications of the IoT in agri-food can be divided into three\
    \ categories depending\non their functions: tracing, tracking, and monitoring\
    \ for precision agriculture, agricul-\ntural machinery, and greenhouse applications\
    \ [25,26]. Growing plants in a controlled\nenvironment is known as greenhouse\
    \ growing or greenhouse gardening. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) are used to\
    \ monitor the conditions that allow for increased efﬁciency,\nenergy savings,\
    \ and the need for minimal human interaction [27]. Precision agriculture\ninvolves\
    \ the control of farm variables such as uniform equipment and labor availability,\n\
    cost, crop maturity, weather, and air and soil quality. Precision agriculture\
    \ refers to the\ncontrol of agricultural variables. Precision agriculture is made\
    \ possible using Internet of\nThings sensor nodes in conjunction with BDA [28,29].\
    \ Machines connected to the Internet of\nThings can be operated on autopilot,\
    \ decreasing losses and increasing production. Tracking\nagri-food goods allows\
    \ the client to understand the product’s history better. RFID provides\na data\
    \ capture process that is visible to all parties involved in the process. Internet-of-\n\
    Things-based solutions can be implemented to properly monitor animal farming,\
    \ crop\nfarming, forestry, and aquaponics operations [30,31].\nThe IoT makes it\
    \ feasible to monitor and measure several sustainability indicators\nin the agri-food\
    \ supply chain, such as fertilizer use, crop yield, and water efﬁciency. IoT-\n\
    based devices enable items to be interconnected regardless of their location,\
    \ allowing for\ninformation sharing throughout the supply chain [26]. Both RFID\
    \ and WSN enable the\ncollection of data, as well as the dissemination of data\
    \ and information. RFID is frequently\nused in the food industry’s supply chain\
    \ to monitor temperature during storage and transit\nand to estimate and calculate\
    \ shelf life [32]. Other RFID uses include quality control, supply\nchain management,\
    \ cold-chain monitoring, livestock management, and food product\ntraceability.\
    \ For example, devices measuring pressure, acceleration, humidity, temperature,\n\
    and light are frequently used in monitoring, transportation, and food storage\
    \ applications.\nIt is vital to detect and measure sustainability indicators to\
    \ develop a sustainable agriculture\nand food supply chain [33]. The fact that\
    \ agricultural sustainability indicators are always\nchanging makes measuring\
    \ and monitoring them difﬁcult. In order to evaluate and monitor\noverall sustainability\
    \ in agriculture, high levels of skills are required, in addition to the\nability\
    \ to adapt to change. IoT technology is justiﬁed in its application to the construction\
    \ of\na sustainable agriculture and food supply chain when combined with the ability\
    \ to gather\nand send data, scalability, and ﬂexibility. One of the most important\
    \ components is the\ndata collected by smart agriculture sensors. This information\
    \ can be used to monitor the\nstate of the company, as well as the performance\
    \ of the workforce and the efﬁciency of the\nequipment. When it comes to planning\
    \ for better product distribution, having the ability to\npredict the output of\
    \ production is essential.\nThe owners of farms can collect data regarding their\
    \ livestock’s location, well-being,\nand health by utilizing wireless applications\
    \ for the IoT. This information not only helps\nto stop the spread of disease\
    \ but also reduces the amount of money spent on labor.\nA climate-controlled smart\
    \ greenhouse built with the assistance of the Internet of Things\neliminates the\
    \ need for human involvement by intelligently monitoring and controlling\nthe\
    \ environment. Predicting crops is extremely important since it enables farmers\
    \ to better\nplan for the future in terms of the production of the crop, as well\
    \ as its storage, various\nmarketing strategies, and risk management. The artiﬁcial\
    \ network uses the information\ngathered by sensors on the farm to make production\
    \ rate predictions for the crop. The\ncharacteristics of soil, temperature, pressure,\
    \ rainfall, and humidity are all included in this\nreport. The dashboard or mobile\
    \ application that the farmers have speciﬁcally designed\ncan provide them with\
    \ reliable data related to the soil.\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n5 of 22\n3. Related\
    \ Works\nThere have been several studies on the use of IoT in the olive oil industry.\
    \ In one\nstudy [34], the authors examined the use of an IoT blockchain-based\
    \ framework to certify\nthe extra virgin olive oil supply chain. The authors developed\
    \ a blockchain-based system\nfor the traceability and certiﬁcation of the extra\
    \ virgin olive oil supply chain. In another\nstudy [35], the authors developed\
    \ a tool to reveal the efﬁciency of an open-source visible\nand near infra-red\
    \ spectrophotometer for the assessment of the geographical origin of\nolive oil.\
    \ They used an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) to classify extra virgin olive oil.\
    \ In\nanother study [36], the authors studied the relationship between competitive\
    \ advantage\nand the use of a blockchain in the olive oil industry. They found\
    \ that the use of a blockchain\ncombined with IoT devices could signiﬁcantly improve\
    \ visibility and avoid fraud in the\nolive oil quality, which led to a competitive\
    \ advantage in the industry. In [37], the authors\npresented a multi-sensor traceability\
    \ system using the IoT. The authors aimed to enable the\nimplementation of a supply\
    \ chain system in the industry that would allow for tracking the\nroute of olive\
    \ oil from the producer to the customer via the oil factory. In [38], the authors\n\
    focused on traceability in the olive oil production chain and indicators of its\
    \ quality, as\nwell as environmental and social sustainability indicators. They\
    \ used smart contracts and\nblockchain technology to solve this issue.\n4. Proposed\

    \ by the demand and no more or less than that number [46]. The delicate \nFigure\

    \ an effective supply chain and\nis a component of supply chain management that\
    \ involves forecasting future demand\nand tailoring company output to meet those\
    \ projections [44,45]. An effective supply\nequilibrium is one in which store\
    \ inventories contain only the number of products\nrequired by the demand and\
    \ no more or less than that number [46]. The delicate\nbalance between having\
    \ enough and too much can be difﬁcult to achieve. The primary\nconcern in demand\
    \ planning, aside from the ongoing effort to help shape demand\nthrough the effective\
    \ use of promotions, is to maintain this delicate balance at all\ntimes [47].\
    \ For effective demand planning, it is typically necessary to employ demand\n\
    forecasting techniques that accurately predict demand trends. This has additional\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n6 of 22\nbeneﬁts, including increased company efﬁciency\
    \ and customer satisfaction. Thus,\nin this study, we assumed that demand planning\
    \ would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the\ncompany supply chain in the olive oil industry\
    \ (H1).\n2.\nManufacturing: Manufacturing refers to the creation of products using\
    \ equipment,\ntools, labor, and biological or chemical processing or preparation\
    \ [48,49]. According\nto this deﬁnition, manufacturing can either refer to the\
    \ large-scale development\nand transformation of raw materials into completed\
    \ goods or the development of\nmore intricate objects through the selling of basic\
    \ goods to manufacturers to produce\nitems such as home appliances, vehicles,\
    \ and airplanes [50,51]. The manufacturing\nprocess, often known as manufacturing\
    \ engineering, is the process through which\nraw materials are turned into completed\
    \ goods. This operation is carried out by\nstarting with the design of the product\
    \ and the selection of materials [52,53]. The raw\nmaterials are turned into the\
    \ ﬁnished product throughout the manufacturing process.\nFabrication is a word\
    \ used by some manufacturers to describe the several intermediate\ntechniques\
    \ utilized to construct the components of a ﬁnal object in today’s highly\nsophisticated\
    \ manufacturing environments [54]. Manufacturing is strongly associated\nwith\
    \ engineering and the design of industrial processes [55]. Thus, in this study,\
    \ we\nassumed that the manufacturing would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the company supply\n\
    chain in the olive oil industry (H2).\n3.\nTransportation: The movement of people\
    \ and goods is the focus of the transporta-\ntion industry, which is a signiﬁcant\
    \ part of the economy and an important industry\nsector [56]. Companies that fall\
    \ within this category include airlines, trucking en-\nterprises, railroads, and\
    \ shipping and logistics businesses, as well as companies\nthat supply the infrastructure\
    \ for various modes of transportation. The availability\nof transport eases the\
    \ burden of the immobile components of production, and the\ntransport industry’s\
    \ growth encourages increased labor and capital mobility. The\nmovement of people\
    \ from one location to another can be facilitated when there is\nan effective\
    \ network of transport services [57]. The transportation and logistics sector\n\
    is experiencing signiﬁcant disruption, including digital transformation, new market\n\
    entrants, and shifting customer expectations, and new business models are still\
    \ devel-\noping. For the economy to generate products and services, transportation\
    \ products\nmust ﬁrst be manufactured from a variety of services and must then\
    \ be combined\nwith other inputs. As an intermediate good, transportation has\
    \ a “derived demand”,\nalso known as a “derived market”. The theory of production\
    \ can help direct our\nthinking about how to manufacture transportation products\
    \ efﬁciently and how to\nuse transportation to produce other things effectively\
    \ [58]. Thus, in this study, we\nassumed that transportation would signiﬁcantly\
    \ inﬂuence the company supply chain\nin the olive oil industry (H3).\n4.\nCustomer\
    \ Service: Customer service is the assistance and direction that a company\nprovides\
    \ to individuals before, during, and after purchasing a product or service from\n\
    that company [59]. This assistance and direction can be offered before, during,\
    \ or after\nthe transaction. There is a direct correlation between satisﬁed customers,\
    \ continued\nloyalty to a company’s brand, and increased sales of the company’s\
    \ products or\nservices [60]. When running a successful business, ensuring the\
    \ pleasure of one’s\nclientele has always been an important factor, but in today’s\
    \ world, this factor is more\nimportant than it has ever been in the past. The\
    \ market is ﬂooded with various options\nto meet the high expectations that consumers\
    \ place on brands. Service needs to be\nan integral part of every stage of the\
    \ customer’s journey, beginning with the very ﬁrst\ninteractions and continuing\
    \ for a signiﬁcant amount of time after the point of purchase.\nCustomer service\
    \ is essential to the customer lifecycle and loyalty in an economy\nthat prioritizes\
    \ digital transformation. In order to reduce customer churn, sales and\ncustomer\
    \ service must be able to coordinate their efforts in real time, efﬁciently share\n\
    information about individual customers in a protected environment, and use this\n\
    information better to understand their needs and expectations [61]. Thus, in this\
    \ study,\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n7 of 22\nwe assumed that customer service would\
    \ signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the company supply\nchain in the olive oil industry (H4).\n\
    5.\nWarehousing: The process of storing physical inventory in preparation for\
    \ sale or\ndistribution is known as warehousing [62]. Warehouses are utilized\
    \ by a wide variety\nof businesses, and their primary purpose is to temporarily\
    \ store products in large\nquantities before either transporting them to other\
    \ locations or selling them individu-\nally to ﬁnal customers [63]. For instance,\
    \ many e-commerce businesses buy products\nin bulk from their suppliers, who then\
    \ ship the products to the business’s warehouse,\nwhere they are stored. After\
    \ that, when an end customer places an order through the\ne-commerce site, the\
    \ company—or its third-party fulﬁllment provider—selects, packs,\nand ships the\
    \ product to the customer directly from the warehouse. The warehousing\nindustry\
    \ as a whole has been accelerated by the growth that has been driven by\ne-commerce.\
    \ The market has more than doubled over the past decade due to substan-\ntial\
    \ investments made by companies located worldwide in their respective supply\n\
    chains [64]. These investments were made to deliver goods to customers and other\n\
    businesses. This is not exclusive to businesses involved in online commerce. Most\n\
    businesses that engage in physical retail have limited space in their stores to\
    \ store\ntheir inventory, despite the fact that they still need to keep up with\
    \ demand. Even if\ntheir suppliers are located in other countries, and it takes\
    \ a long time to produce and\nship new products, they will be able to restock\
    \ their stores during high-volume times\nlike the holidays if they have additional\
    \ inventory available in nearby warehouses.\nThis helps ensure that they will\
    \ always be able to meet customer demand. Thus, in\nthis study, we assumed that\
    \ warehousing would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the company\nsupply chain in the olive\
    \ oil industry (H5).\n6.\nInventory management: The management of inventories\
    \ enables businesses to deter-\nmine which stocks to order, how much of each,\
    \ and when to place their orders [65].\nIt involves keeping track of the inventory\
    \ from the time of purchase until after the\ngoods have been sold. This practice\
    \ identiﬁes trends and reacts to them so that there\nis always enough stock to\
    \ fulﬁll customer orders and that they are given an adequate\nwarning if there\
    \ is a shortage. Inventory turnover is one metric that can be used to\nevaluate\
    \ how well an organization manages its stock. Inventory turnover is a measure-\n\
    ment used in accounting that indicates how frequently stock is sold during a given\n\
    time [66]. It is not ideal for a company to have more inventory than it sells.\
    \ A low\ninventory turnover rate can result in deadstock, another name for unsold\
    \ stock [67].\nInventory management is essential to the success of a business\
    \ because it helps to\nensure that there is never an excessive amount or insufﬁcient\
    \ amount of stock on\nhand, thereby reducing the likelihood of stockouts and inaccurate\
    \ records. Inventory\nmanagement aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of\
    \ stock levels and the\nlocation of stock within warehouses. The ﬂow of products\
    \ from the supplier through\nthe production process and to the customer is monitored\
    \ using software designed for\ninventory management. Inventory management keeps\
    \ track of all activities that occur\nin the warehouse, including stock receipts,\
    \ picking, packing, and shipping [68]. Thus,\nin this study, we assumed that the\
    \ management of inventories would signiﬁcantly\ninﬂuence the company supply chain\
    \ in the olive oil industry (H6).\n7.\nSupply chain:\nBusinesses increasingly\
    \ look to their supply chains or SCs for\na competitive advantage. The goal of\
    \ studying supply chain management is to\nincrease a company’s value by using\
    \ its resources in the best way. A company’s\nsupply chain comprises all the processes\
    \ that add value and connect the provider\nto the end-user. The fundamental SC\
    \ activities are receiving input from the ﬁrm’s\nsuppliers, adding value to that\
    \ input, and then delivering the improved product or\nservice to the ﬁrm’s customers.\
    \ The supply chain refers to all of the organizations and\nindividuals who play\
    \ a role, however indirectly, in meeting a customer’s demand.\nThe supply chain\
    \ includes producers, distributors, shippers, warehousing facilities,\nretailers,\
    \ and consumers. The SC refers to the entire sequence of steps taken within\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n8 of 22\nan enterprise, such as manufacturing, to fulﬁll\
    \ a customer order. This category in-\ncludes developing new products, promotion,\
    \ ﬁnancing, distribution, operation, and\ncustomer service. In order to create\
    \ and maintain a competitive advantage in their\nproducts and services, businesses\
    \ require efﬁcient supply chain management. Thus,\nin this study, we assumed that\
    \ the supply chain would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the\ncompany’s performance in the\
    \ olive oil industry (H7).\nThe methods adopted for data analysis are provided\
    \ in the following sections. Clus-\ntering and decision trees were employed in\
    \ the method’s development. The data for this\nstudy were collected from business\
    \ leaders with knowledge of the integration of new\ntechnologies into the business,\
    \ as well as IoT experts. Data were clustered, and decision\ntrees were implemented\
    \ to forecast the performance of the olive oil companies based on\nseveral factors.\n\

    \ of steps taken within an enterprise, \nsuch as manufacturing, to fulfill a customer\
    \ order. This category includes developing \nnew products, promotion, financing,\
    \ distribution, operation, and customer service. \nIn order to create and maintain\
    \ a competitive advantage in their products and \nservices, businesses require\
    \ efficient supply chain management. Thus, in this study, \nwe assumed that the\

    \ \n5. Materials and Methods \n5.1. Background Work \n5.1.1. SOM Clustering \n\
    There are 2 layers in an SOM: the input and output [69,70]. The output layer is\
    \ also \ncalled the Kohonen layer. The SOM’s overall architecture is depicted\
    \ in Figure 2. Many \nneurons in the output layer are completely connected to\
    \ the input neurons. As shown in \nFigure 2, the output space is 2-dimensional.\
    \ The learning algorithm utilized to train the \nSOM is based on unsupervised\
    \ and competitive learning. \n \nFigure 2. SOM architecture. \nThe following provides\
    \ a brief overview of the SOM training process. The SOM’s \ninput pattern can\
    \ be represented by the following equation [71]: \nFigure 2. SOM architecture.\n\
    The following provides a brief overview of the SOM training process. The SOM’s\n\
    input pattern can be represented by the following equation [71]:\nx = [x1, x2,\
    \ xM]T\n(1)\nwhere x is the input pattern and M represents the size of x.\nAccordingly,\
    \ synaptic weight vectors (SWVs) [72] of neurons in the output layer are\nindicated\
    \ by:\nwj =\n\x02\nwj1 , wj2, wjM\n\x03T\n(2)\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n9 of 22\n\
    where the SWVs of neuron j are indicated by wj, j = 1, 2, . . . , p, and p is\
    \ the Kohonen\nlayer’s total number of neurons.\nAt the start of the training\
    \ process, the SWVs are initialized with small random\nnumbers. This serves as\
    \ a starting point for the training process in the self-organizing map.\nThis\
    \ is identiﬁed as competitive learning in self-organizing maps because the network’s\n\
    neurons in the system compete with one another to ﬁnd which neuron will be activated\n\
    and therefore become the winning neuron in this competition. Neurons compete to\
    \ see\nwhich one has the greatest degree of similarity between their SWVs and\
    \ input patterns.\nThese SWV similarities are utilized to decide which neuron\
    \ will win the competition. As\na result, the following equation can be used to\
    \ ﬁnd the winning neuron:\ni(x) = arg min ∥x − wj∥, j = 1, 2, . . . , p\n(3)\n\
    where ∥ · ∥ represents the Euclidean distance and i(x) indicates the neuron closest\
    \ to x.\nThus, the Euclidean distance is calculated by:\n∥x − wj∥ =\nq\n∑\nM\n\
    i=1\n\0xi − wji\n\x012, j = 1, 2, . . . , p\n(4)\nThe Euclidean distance is considered\
    \ a typical comparison metric to compare two items.\nA smaller ∥x − wj∥ indicates\
    \ greater proximity between the input pattern x and the SWV\nwj. As a result,\
    \ the winning neuron is selected by calculating and comparing the distances\n\
    from the current point x in the network to all output neurons. The winning neurons\n\
    are those with the shortest distance from the current input pattern. Finally,\
    \ the lateral\ninteractions between a triumphant neuron and the others around\
    \ it are investigated. The\nwinning neuron’s impact on its neighbors is computed\
    \ through the use of the topological\nneighborhood function. A topological representation\
    \ of the area is a neighborhood function.\nhji(x)(t) = exp\n \n−\nd2\nj,i\n2σ2(t)\n\
    !\n(5)\nIn the above equation, t = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, dj,i indicates the Euclidean\
    \ distance between\nthe neighboring neuron j and the winning neuron i and σ (t)\
    \ indicates the topological\nneighborhood’s width at time t. In this equation,\
    \ hji(x)(t) indicates the topological neigh-\nborhood at time t. This is accomplished\
    \ by means of the following equation, which is used\nto alter the values of synaptic\
    \ weights based on changes in input patterns [73]:\nwj(t + 1) = wj(t) + η(t)hjj(χ)(t)\n\
    \0x − wj(t)\n\x01\n(6)\nIn the above equation, wj(t + 1) indicates the SWV of\
    \ neuron j at time t + 1 and η(t)\nindicates the learning rate at time t. The\
    \ learning rate in the learning process will decrease\nwith time according to\
    \ the following equation:\nη(t) = η(0) exp\n\x10\n−\nr\n1000\n\x11\n(7)\nin which\
    \ the initial learning rate is indicated by η(0). When the operation is repeated,\
    \ the\nwinning neuron and its neighboring neurons grow in a similar manner to\
    \ the relevant input\npattern. After the completion of network learning, a trained\
    \ SOM is obtained.\n5.1.2. Decision Trees (DTs)\nDT is a predictive learning approach\
    \ that combines observations of a phenomenon\nwith judgments about the target\
    \ value of the issue under investigation. Learning, in this\ntechnique, is performed\
    \ to discover a DT from the dataset. This technique is widely utilized\nin spatial\
    \ data mining applications [74]. Each internal node in the DT includes a variable\n\
    from the data, and each edge corresponds to a child [75]. Each leaf in the DT\
    \ indicates\na target variable’s value, depending on the input variables’ values.\
    \ A DT can be discovered\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n10 of 22\nby subdividing a\
    \ source set and observing the results of an attribute value test. It is critical\n\
    to repeat this method for each derived subset. Recursion is completed when splitting\
    \ is no\nlonger necessary or when a single categorization can be implemented for\
    \ all samples in the\nresulting subset, whichever comes ﬁrst. DTs provide human-readable\
    \ rules that describe\nthe relationships in a dataset and can be utilized for\
    \ prediction and classiﬁcation. This\nmachine-learning technology is widely used\
    \ in a variety of disciplines, including disease\ndetection [76], security [77],\
    \ business [78], and education [79]. It is important to note that\nthe obtained\
    \ DT structure must be as simple as possible. For DTs to be effective, they must\n\
    be able to reliably discover the knowledge learned from the dataset to predict\
    \ new data.\nBy adding new training data, most DTs can be augmented, which means\
    \ that the DT can\nbe modiﬁed.\nThere are various kinds of DTs. Some DTs produce\
    \ an output consisting of a set of\nvalues of a discrete nature. These types of\
    \ trees are referred to as categorization trees.\nClassiﬁcation and regression\
    \ trees, or CARTs, produce both classiﬁcation and regression\nresults. In this\
    \ study, we used the CART method to analyze the data to discover the decision\n\
    rules. The ﬁrst node (the root node) contained all the information in the CART\
    \ model. The\nsplitter variable from the data with the best purity and homogeneity\
    \ in each branch was\nthen employed in the ﬁnal step of the process to construct\
    \ a split in the root according\nto each branch’s splitter variable. At tree branches,\
    \ the classiﬁcation of variables was\nperformed until the data in the corresponding\
    \ node had become sufﬁciently homogeneous\nto fall into a speciﬁc classiﬁcation.\
    \ These were the result classes, which were represented\nby leaf or terminal nodes.\
    \ The internal nodes were the nodes that lay between the terminal\nnodes and the\
    \ root node of a network. In order to select the splitter variable, many different\n\
    indices can be used. The Gini index (GI) [80] was used in this investigation.\
    \ The greatest\nGI value, on the other hand, was obtained when all of the data\
    \ in a node belonged to every\ncategory. When all of the data for a corresponding\
    \ node belonged to a single category, the\nnode was produced with the utmost purity\
    \ possible, and the GI would be 0. When all\nvariables of a corresponding node\
    \ were determined, the GI was calculated for each variable,\nand the variable\
    \ from the dataset with the lowest GI value was chosen as the splitter. The\n\
    GI used in CART was deﬁned according to the following equation:\nGINI(P) =\nn\n\
    ∑\ni=1\npi(1 − pi) = 1 −\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(pi)2\n(8)\nin which\npi\nrepresents the\
    \ likelihood that a given object will be placed in\na speciﬁc category.\n6. Results\n\
    In this study, we collected the data using a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire\n\
    survey included questions based on a ﬁve-point Likert scale for all constructs\

    \ Most respondents were male (78.3%: 432; see Table 2). The majority of the\n\
    respondents also had Ph.D. degrees (48.4%: 267; see Table 3). The category related\
    \ to\nrespondents’ employment in the industry showed that most of them had full-time\
    \ employ-\nment (see Table 4). The demographic information demonstrated that the\
    \ respondents were\ngreatly familiar with the use of IoT devices in the industry\
    \ (see Table 5).\nTo implement the method, we used a personal laptop with an Intel(R)\
    \ Core(TM) i7-\n6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2592 MHz, four Core(s) and eight Logical\
    \ Processor(s) with 8 GB\nof memory running the Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating\
    \ system. All experiments were\nperformed using a 10-fold cross-validation. We\
    \ used SOM for data clustering. η(0) = 0.01\nwas considered in the SOM. The SOM\
    \ was performed to detect similar preferences in\ndifferent groups. We used different\
    \ map structure for SOM as: SOM 1 × 3, SOM 2 × 2,\nSOM 1 × 5, SOM 1 × 3, SOM 2\
    \ × 3, SOM 1 × 7, SOM 2 × 4, SOM 3 × 3, SOM 2 × 5, SOM\n1 × 11, SOM 3 × 4. Accordingly,\
    \ a different number of clusters was generated by SOM,\nas shown in Table 6. In\
    \ this study, we used the silhouette coefﬁcient [81] to identify the\noptimal\
    \ number of clusters. The results are presented in Table 6. We found that the\
    \ optimal\nnumber of clusters was 5 (i.e., SOM 1 × 5).\nThe results of data clustering\
    \ are presented in Tables 7–9 and A1. In Table 7, we\npresent the centroids of\
    \ the discovered clusters. This table shows that there was a signif-\nicant relationship\
    \ between demand planning, manufacturing, transportation, customer\nservice, warehousing\
    \ and inventory management, and supply chain performance. In ad-\ndition, the\
    \ results show a direct relationship between supply chain performance and the\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n12 of 22\nperformance of olive oil companies. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ it can be observed that when the supply\nchain performance was at a low level,\
    \ the company’s performance was also at a low level.\nFurthermore, with a high\

    \ increase in the population has increased the demand for additional\nfood. Agricultural\
    \ advancements are critical to the development of our sedentary human\ncivilization.\
    \ Consequently, the agri-food sector is still regarded as one of the most important\n\
    sectors in the world today. Most agricultural businesses continue to rely on traditional\n\
    farming practices despite their decreasing use. To meet this requirement, agricultural\
    \ ﬁrms\nare changing their approaches to IoT applications to gain greater capabilities.\
    \ Based on\nIoT technologies, smart farming enables farmers and growers to enhance\
    \ productivity and\nreduce waste. This can be measured in various ways, from fertilizer\
    \ use to the number\nof journeys made by farm vehicles. Smart farming also enables\
    \ the efﬁcient utilization of\nresources such as water, electricity, and other\
    \ things. An IoT smart farming solution is\na system built to monitor crop ﬁelds\
    \ with the help of sensors (crop health, temperature,\nhumidity, light, soil moisture,\
    \ etc.) and an automated irrigation system. These sensors\nmonitor light, humidity,\
    \ temperature, and crop health. Farmers can monitor the ﬁelds’\nconditions from\
    \ any location. They can also choose between manual and automated\nprocesses to\
    \ carry out the necessary actions in response to the data. Compared to traditional\n\
    farming methods, precision agriculture is signiﬁcantly more productive.\nThe IoT\
    \ has played a critical role in increasing production and expanding agricultural\n\
    product markets. Investigating the IoT’s impact on companies’ performance is a\
    \ critical\ntask. Because of the wide variety of sensors that are currently available,\
    \ the possibilities\nfor IoT applications in the olive oil industry are almost\
    \ limitless. The IoT has played\na critical role in increasing production and\
    \ expanding agricultural product markets. In the\nolive oil industry, it is possible\
    \ to improve the supply chain process from raw materials\nwithin a plant to product\
    \ distribution to customers and businesses using IoT technologies.\nPrevious studies\
    \ have investigated the impact of the IoT on the performance of industries,\n\
    but this issue has not been explored in the olive oil industry until now.\nIn\
    \ this study, we proposed a model based on seven hypotheses. The results of the\n\
    data analysis, conducted using the supervised learning technique, conﬁrmed all\
    \ of the\nhypotheses. A direct relationship between the input variables and the\
    \ output variables\nwas discovered. The results demonstrated a direct relationship\
    \ between the supply chain\nimprovement caused by the implementation of the IoT\
    \ and company performance in the\nolive oil industry. Furthermore, increasing\
    \ demand planning, manufacturing, transporta-\ntion, customer service, warehousing,\
    \ and inventory management improved supply chain\nperformance. Thus, IoT implementation\
    \ is critical for improving supply chain perfor-\nmance in the olive oil industry\
    \ through improvements in demand planning, manufacturing,\ntransportation, customer\
    \ service, warehousing, and inventory management.\nMoreover, in the olive oil\
    \ industry, various processes can be employed by IoT tech-\nnologies in the transformation\
    \ of raw products into food products. The best results are\nobtained by taking\
    \ into account both efﬁciency and the desired quality of the ﬁnal food\nproduct.\
    \ The production of high-quality extra virgin olive oil, for example, necessitates\
    \ the\noptimization of various production steps such as olive handling and harvesting,\
    \ milling,\nand the use of modern IoT technologies to control process conditions.\
    \ To avoid process\nfailures and maintain the highest possible quality in the\
    \ ﬁnal olive oil products, a high\nlevel of control by IoT technologies over standard\
    \ operating conditions can be signiﬁcant.\nIn addition, the duration of malaxation\
    \ and temperature can have an impact on olive oil\nquality [87]. Thus, IoT-based\
    \ technologies can be used to enhance extra virgin olive oil\nproduction without\
    \ having an adverse effect on the quality indicators.\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n\

    \ oil industry. We developed\na new method to investigate the IoT’s role in improving\
    \ olive oil companies’ performance.\nThe method was developed using clustering\
    \ and decision trees. The data for this study were\ncollected from respondents\
    \ with knowledge regarding the integration of new technologies\ninto the industry.\
    \ The data were clustered, and decision trees were implemented to predict\nthe\
    \ olive oil companies’ performance according to the factors inﬂuencing the supply\
    \ chain.\nThe model was implemented in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the models\
    \ learned how to\nﬁnd the relationships between demand planning, manufacturing,\
    \ transportation, customer\nservice, warehousing and inventory management, and\
    \ supply chain performance. The\nrelationship between supply chain performance\
    \ and company performance was evaluated\nin the second stage. The method was evaluated\
    \ in these two stages and compared using\ndecision trees, an ANN, and an ANFIS.\
    \ The methods were compared using RMSE, MAE,\nand the coefﬁcient of determination.\
    \ The results showed that the SOM + decision trees\nmethod outperformed the other\
    \ machine learning techniques in terms of the RMSE, MAE,\nand coefﬁcient of determination.\n\
    Limitation and Future Work\nThis study has some limitations. First, the method\
    \ was developed using SOM clus-\ntering and decision trees without an optimization\
    \ technique. The SOM method can be\ndeveloped with optimization techniques such\
    \ as particle swarm optimization (PSO) [88] to\ndiscover the clusters in the data\
    \ more effectively. In addition, ensemble-learning approaches\ncan improve the\
    \ efﬁciency of decision trees [89]. Second, in this study, we investigated the\n\
    relationships between supply chains and olive oil companies’ performance. The\
    \ model\ncould be further improved by including other factors, such as competitive\
    \ advantages and\nﬁnancial aspects of performance. Furthermore, the results could\
    \ be further developed to\naccount for the barriers to implementing IoT in olive\
    \ oil companies, speciﬁcally, the barriers\nin the context of privacy and security\
    \ related to the implementation of the IoT by olive\noil companies.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ \nPAGE 273 \n \n \n \n5 \nData Privacy and \nSecurity Risks \nThe collection,\
    \ storage, and processing of customer data present \nsignificant privacy and security\
    \ risks. Organizations must invest in \nrobust cybersecurity measures and comply\
    \ with data protection \nregulations to protect sensitive information. Failure\
    \ to safeguard \ncustomer data can result in legal liabilities, financial penalties,\
    \ and \nreputational damage. \n6 \nResistance to \nChange and \nEmployee \nMorale\
    \ \nIntroducing technology-based solutions may face resistance from \nemployees\
    \ who fear job displacement or feel overwhelmed by new \ntechnologies. Resistance\
    \ to change can impact employee morale, job \nsatisfaction, and productivity.\
    \ Organizations need to manage change \neffectively, provide adequate training\
    \ and support, and communicate \nthe benefits of technology adoption to gain employee\
    \ buy-in. \n7 \nSystem \nComplexity and \nMaintenance \nAdopting technology-driven\
    \ solutions often leads to increased system \ncomplexity. Multiple software applications,\
    \ integrations, and \ndependencies can make it challenging to manage and maintain\
    \ the \ntechnology infrastructure. Regular updates, troubleshooting, and \ntechnical\
    \ support are necessary to ensure smooth operations, which can \nstrain IT resources\
    \ and budgets. \n8 \nOveremphasis on \nEfficiency over \nHuman \nInteraction \n\
    Technology-driven solutions may prioritize efficiency and automation, \npotentially\
    \ diminishing the importance of human interaction. \nCustomers may feel disconnected\
    \ or frustrated when they cannot access \npersonalized assistance or when their\
    \ interactions are solely with \nautomated systems. This can impact customer satisfaction\
    \ and loyalty. \n9 \nRapid \nTechnological \nObsolescence \nTechnology evolves\
    \ at a rapid pace, making investments in technology \nsusceptible to obsolescence.\
    \ Businesses must continually monitor and \nassess emerging technologies to remain\
    \ competitive. Outdated \ntechnology can become a hindrance, requiring additional\
    \ investments \nto upgrade or replace systems. \n10 \nEthical \nConsiderations\
    \ \nand Social \nImpact \nTechnology-based value creation can raise ethical considerations\
    \ and \nimpact society at large. Organizations must navigate the potential \n\
    consequences of their technological choices, such as the impact on \nemployment,\
    \ privacy, and social equity. Failing to address these ethical \nconsiderations\
    \ can lead to backlash from customers, employees, and the \npublic. \n \nThus,\
    \ technology-based value creation in business organizations brings about disadvantages\
    \ from an \norganizational point of view, including high initial investment costs,\
    \ complexity and integration \nchallenges, dependency and vulnerability, skills\
    \ gap, data privacy and security risks, resistance to \nchange, system complexity\
    \ and maintenance, overemphasis on efficiency, rapid technological \nobsolescence,\
    \ and ethical considerations [298]. Understanding and effectively managing these\
    \ \ndisadvantages is crucial for organizations to maximize the benefits of technology\
    \ and mitigate \npotential drawbacks [299]. \n9. CONCLUSION :   \nThe role of\
    \ twelve ICCT Underlying Technologies including AI, Blockchain, Business intelligence,\
    \ \nCloud computing, Cyber security, 3D printing, IoT, Quantum computing, Mobile\
    \ marketing, \nInformation storage technology, Ubiquitous education technology,\
    \ and VR & AR for Business Value \nCreation like Innovation and Differentiation,\
    \ Customer focus, Operational efficiency, Strategic \nPartnerships and Alliances,\
    \ Talent Management, Effective Marketing and Branding, Financial \nPerformance\
    \ and Growth, Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, and Adaptability\
    \ and \nAgility are discussed. The advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages\
    \ of Technologies based \nValue creation from various stakeholders’ point of view\
    \ are analysed. The impact of ICCT underlying \ntechnologies on business value\
    \ creation in organizations are also determined using relevant \ninformation collection\
    \ & evaluation. New knowledge and interpretation are presented on how to create\
    \ \nbusiness value for long time sustainability by organizations in every industry.\

    \a\nAbstract: The term intelligent agriculture, or smart farming, typically involves\
    \ the incorporation of\ncomputer science and information technologies into the\
    \ traditional notion of farming. The latter\nutilizes plain machinery and equipment\
    \ used for many decades and the only signiﬁcant improvement\nmade over the years\
    \ has been the introduction of automation in the process. Still, at the beginning\
    \ of\nthe new century, there are ways and room for further vast improvements.\
    \ More speciﬁcally, the low\ncost of rather advanced sensors and small-scale devices,\
    \ now even connected to the Internet of\nThings (IoT), allowed them to be introduced\
    \ in the process and used within agricultural production\nsystems. New and emerging\
    \ technologies and methodologies, like the utilization of cheap network\nstorage,\
    \ are expected to advance this development. In this sense, the main goals of this\
    \ paper may be\nsummarized as follows: (a) To identify, group, and acknowledge\
    \ the current state-of-the-art research\nknowledge about intelligent agriculture\
    \ approaches, (b) to categorize them according to meaningful\ndata sources categories,\
    \ and (c) to describe current efﬁcient data processing and utilization aspects\n\
    from the perspective of the main trends in the ﬁeld.\nKeywords: smart agriculture\
    \ survey; intelligent knowledge acquisition; machine learning methodologies\n\
    1. Introduction\nOver the last hundred years technological achievements, like\
    \ the utilization of heavy machinery\nand the industrialization of the production\
    \ chain, introduced major changes to the agricultural working\nstatus quo. These\
    \ changes, although pivotal for the current development of agriculture as we know\n\
    it until the recent years, are not considered to be the last resort of agriculture,\
    \ as world population\nfeeding needs increase over time. The term intelligent\
    \ agriculture, or smart farming, typically involves\nincorporation of computer\
    \ science and information technologies into the traditional notion of farming.\n\
    It allows the creation of large volumes of data, with the progressive introduction\
    \ of intelligence in the\nprocess of their transformation into organized information,\
    \ and the extraction of meaningful semantic\nknowledge, as the last link of this\
    \ virtual chain of actions.\nFactors such as climate change, demographic parameters,\
    \ population movements, and overall\naging and migration issues between rural\
    \ and urban areas, all play a signiﬁcant role and come into play\nwhen dealing\
    \ with intelligent agriculture research. Speciﬁcally, climate parameters like\
    \ temperature,\nprecipitation, and soil moisture have signiﬁcant impact on most\
    \ of the aforementioned factors, thus the\nexploitation of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and machine learning techniques towards their efﬁcient, reliable\nand accurate\
    \ prediction is of great importance in modern agricultural activities, since they\
    \ may heavily\naffect the corresponding production costs and can assist in minimizing\
    \ environmental constraints.\nHaving declared the necessity and importance of\
    \ the discussed domain, we may further elaborate\non the speciﬁc aims of this\
    \ paper. First of all, it is rather true that, being a modern application domain,\n\

    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n2 of 23\nmost of the corresponding research literature\
    \ on intelligent agriculture has been published over the\nrecent years. Still,\
    \ there are important research works, included herein, that deal with aspects\
    \ either\ndirectly or indirectly related to the modern ﬁeld. Considering this\
    \ context, our research aims to achieve\nthe following objectives: (a) To identify,\
    \ group, and acknowledge the research knowledge about current\nintelligent agriculture\
    \ that are state-of-the-art, (b) to categorize them according to meaningful data\n\
    source categories, and (c) to describe current efﬁcient data processing and utilization\
    \ aspects from the\nperspective of the main trends in the ﬁeld.\nOur main motivation\
    \ behind the production of this research work was our belief that\nidentifying\
    \ how computer science interprets intelligent agriculture over time, geographical\
    \ space,\nand methodologies may aid the production of new, advanced, and innovative\
    \ research with the\nobjective of covering areas that have received less attention\
    \ up until now and may introduce brand\nnew applications in the process. Thus,\
    \ we summarized and organized in a researcher-friendly tabular\nmanner important\
    \ or pioneer related research works deriving from diverse agricultural intelligence\n\
    domains. In the following sections, we initially focus on different data collection\
    \ techniques, ranging\nfrom meteorological data at the macro- (i.e., geographical\
    \ region), meso- (i.e., ﬁeld), and micro-level\n(i.e., speciﬁc intra-ﬁeld areas),\
    \ to GIS and remote sensing data, image data from drones, or even\ninnovative\
    \ crowd-sourcing activities. Moreover, we present the prevailing data processing\
    \ and\nutilization methodologies that exploit notions from the machine learning\
    \ computer science ﬁelds.\nWe categorize them into two main groups, namely machine\
    \ learning algorithms focusing on numerical\ndata processing, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ exemplars from the drone or even satellite imagery domain.\nOn top of that,\
    \ efﬁcient environmental monitoring suggests innovatice procedures of meaningful\n\
    knowledge extraction through various observation and evaluation techniques. In\
    \ the typical case,\n“machines”, under the generic auspice of computer science,\
    \ support and preserve acquisition and\nmanagement of such information into accessible\
    \ semantic modules [1], whereas the goal of integrating\nthe task of monitoring,\
    \ physical computing, information technologies and knowledge representation\n\
    has been served in the past by the semantic sensor network ontology and it’s many\
    \ variations [2].\nIn this framework, the two main factors are formed around the\
    \ tasks of a knowledge base creation and\ncorresponding data visualization.\n\
    It should be also noted at this point that this paper attempts to conduct a broad\
    \ modern survey of\nthe illustrated topics and, thus, form a somehow point of\
    \ reference for fellow researchers. It attempts\nto study the existence, importance\
    \ and impact of the notion of agriculture information handling\nmethodologies\
    \ within the scope of the modern and quite popular “smart” agriculture computing\n\
    framework. Still, this is a tedious task to tackle, since mainly given to its\
    \ inherent diversity, the term\nis nowadays widely acknowledged and has become\
    \ a topic of interest in several multi-disciplinary\nsub-ﬁelds, ranging from traditional\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms to contextual semantics and other\nrecently\
    \ emerged innovative applications. Focus is also given on the identiﬁed challenges\
    \ and potential\nfuture research directions that emerge from the herein discussed\
    \ approaches. To the best of our recent\nknowledge, researcher, academics, but\
    \ also interested stakeholders and even farmers themselves\nare nowadays eager\
    \ to obtain comprehensive and perspicacious written reviews of related studies\n\
    on modern smart agriculture information handling. Thus, this survey attempts to\
    \ provide a rich\nsource of ideas for them and a good point of reference for those\
    \ who want to start studying related\nsub-ﬁelds in depth within the framework\
    \ imposed by the latest related disciplines advances, namely\nagriculture and\
    \ informatics. Among its goals is the identiﬁcation of different types of methodologies\n\
    in agricultural informatics and the provision of an overview on the deﬁnition\
    \ and utilization of related\nresearch approaches exploited within recent approaches\
    \ and applications.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section\
    \ 2, we present related research works\nconcerning the various data sources utilized\
    \ with respect to agricultural aspects. Then, in Section 3,\nwe present the main\
    \ machine learning methodologies that may be efﬁciently applied on agricultural\n\
    data. Section 4 discusses ad-hoc topics that are built on top of the data and\
    \ algorithmic fronts, such as\nintelligent knowledge acquisition, data visualization,\
    \ and crowd-wisdom exploitation. Finally, a short\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n\
    3 of 23\ndiscussion together with drawn conclusions and future prospects relating\
    \ to the proposed framework\nare presented within Section 5 that concludes the\
    \ paper.\n2. Data Sources and Collection\nThe natural conditions of agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds and their neighbor areas are characterized by their\nmeteorological, climatic,\
    \ and soil attributes. Information Technologies (IT) have been shown to\nimprove\
    \ agricultural productivity in a number of ways. Furthermore, the study of conditions\
    \ is\nusually performed through different type of datasets and in a multi-level\
    \ scale. More speciﬁcally,\nin the following we reason agricultural monitoring\
    \ as a classiﬁcation of four concrete methods for data\nretrieval on the scope\
    \ of analysis and machine learning. In Section 2.1 we present works related to\n\
    on-site climatic sensory observations that largely produce numerical data, in\
    \ contrast to Section 2.2\nthat exhibits spatially correlated physical factors.\
    \ Additionally, satellite imagery presents a wealth of\nnumerical, spatial-aware,\
    \ and image data from remote sensing acquisition techniques (Section 2.3),\nwhich\
    \ is enriched through the advent of aerial imagery applications in agricultural\
    \ monitoring.\nLastly, application of drone-aided technology (Section 2.4) uniﬁes\
    \ all physical characteristics of the\napproximate environment on an accessible\
    \ research context.\n2.1. Meteorological Sensory Data\nManaging climatic and environmental\
    \ challenges in relation to wine production can be\nimplemented by recording and\
    \ assessing meteorological data. Hunter et al. [3] studied the impact on\nmicroclimatic\
    \ conditions using the distribution of local conditions for existing vineyards.\
    \ The vines\nhave a distinctive topology that is subjective to atmospheric, climatic\
    \ and soil conditions of their given\nlocation. The scientists studied different\
    \ orientations of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz variety in South\nAfrica and tested\
    \ their distinct environmental factors in three levels - macro, meso and micro.\
    \ They’ve\nrecorded temperature, radiation, rainfall and wind speed (at the macro\
    \ level), ambient photosynthetic\nactive radiation on top of the vines, wind speed\
    \ and direction (at the meso level) and ambient\ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ (at the micro level). Additionally, they measured relative humidity,\nleaf temperature,\
    \ photosynthetic photo ﬂux density (PPFD), transpiration, CO2 concentration and\n\
    photosynthetic activity at the canopy level, six weeks after the berry colouring\
    \ phase. Hunter et al.\nmanaged to provide novel knowledge on the effect of row\
    \ orientation on vineyard meso-, macro- and\nmicroclimate in addition to vine\
    \ physiological status. Their results produced quantitative data related\nto the\
    \ complex relationship between row orientation and physiological characteristics\
    \ of vines.\nThe vision of sustainable management in agriculture was studied by\
    \ Kaewmard and Saiyod [4]\nby introducing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) control\
    \ system. They deployed several experimental\nsensing devices to monitor crop\
    \ irrigation and produced a platform for water management, employing\nmobile application\
    \ and services along with a wireless communication platform under the scope of\
    \ the\nInternet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, their experimental results were\
    \ related to the plants’ growth rate\nindicating highly accurate measurements\
    \ based on soil moisture, air humidity and temperature sensors.\nReal-time data\
    \ collection and distribution is an important aspect on the direction of applied\n\
    monitoring in agriculture. Under this scope Kiyoshi et al. [5] proposed a decision\
    \ support system based\non multilevel sensor measurements. Their interoperable\
    \ applications were capable of dynamically\nquerying sensor metadata and analyzing\
    \ historical weather data. Kiyoshi et al. produced predictions\nconcerning the\
    \ evaluation of various weather scenarios by implementing crop modeling and simulations.\n\
    Furthermore, the authors used heterogenous data sources, promoting efficient crop\
    \ management and\ncontrol and subsequently assisting farmers’ operation cycles\
    \ at all stages of cultivation.\nThe research of Bock et al. [6] is related to\
    \ the actual grapevine yield and quality and is\nbased on long-term data accumulation\
    \ for over the last two centuries (between years 1805–2010)\nin Germany. The authors\
    \ analyzed long-term time series of grapevine yield in yield per hectare\n(hL/ha)\
    \ measurements and the sugar content of must (i.e., the grape juice) in Degree\
    \ Oechsle (◦Oe)\nmeasurements, as well as climate data through bibliographical\
    \ references and sensor recordings.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n4 of 23\n\
    It should be noted that Degree Oechsle measures the relative sweetness of the\
    \ must and shows how\nmuch more 1 L of must weighs, compared to 1 L of water,\
    \ whereas the entire dataset was homogenized\nby monthly observations depending\
    \ on available resources. This long-term, multi-factoral research\nresulted into\
    \ a veriﬁed upward trend in both yield and must sugar content over the examined\n\
    time period. The researchers distinguished further between the anthropogenic and\
    \ climatic impacts\non yield in relation to temperature; their study underlines\
    \ the need for continuous and calibrated\nmeasurements of morphological and chemical\
    \ characteristics, along with meteorological conditions\nduring vine production\
    \ in relation to their productivity.\nAnother WSN agricultural monitoring platform\
    \ was introduced by Tarange et al. [7]. The researches\nproposed an automated\
    \ control system for crop irrigation based on soil moisture and temperature senors.\n\
    In particular, the sensor information was collected from the nodes in a continuous\
    \ manner, allowing\nthe system to control irrigation uniformly and reducing the\
    \ fresh water consumption without the need\nof human interaction.\nAndreoli et\
    \ al. [8] developed a simulation related to vine growth parametric processes for\n\
    the understanding of plant conditions at vineyard scale of Vitis vinifera L. Nebbiolo\
    \ of NW Italy.\nThe simulation is based on experimental observations from model\
    \ vineyards. Their model required\na set of meteorological data, soil parameters,\
    \ vine’s physical characteristics, geographic information\nand variety characteristics,\
    \ which was then evaluated through existing empirical equations. Recording\nfrequency\
    \ is adjusted depending on the nature of the data and the sampling took place\
    \ on 15 grid\npoints over the Piedmontese territory in mixed elevation. Furthermore,\
    \ the IVINE model showed that\nmeteorological data produce more stable results\
    \ and contrary to vine growth and phenological phases\nthat were less accurately\
    \ predicted.\nWater is one of the fundamental aspects of life on earth and provides\
    \ precious nutrients for\nmany types of crop. Yuan and Zhen [9] estimated water\
    \ consumption by agricultural activities in\nChina. More specifically their research\
    \ focused on agricultural water and irrigation net consumption for the\nperiod\
    \ between 1984 to 2008 in the Hebei province. Meteorological data were used to\
    \ calculate a baseline\nof evapotranspiration (ET0), along with grain yield to\
    \ find the actual evapotranspiration. Atmospheric\nand ground measurements included\
    \ daily average temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, duration\nof sunshine,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, vapor pressure, and wind speed, which emanate from 55\
    \ weather\nstations located in the Hebei area. Their study showed a spatial pattern\
    \ of increased ET0 that is\npossibly related to intensiﬁed agricultural activity\
    \ and increasing temperatures. This work points\nout the use of meteorological\
    \ monitoring (i.e., large scale monitoring, in this particular case) that\nmay\
    \ help researchers further understand the interdependent relations of climatic\
    \ conditions and\nhuman activities.\nThe work of Tagami et al. [10] was related\
    \ to the development and application of Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSN) in viticulture,\
    \ under the notion of developing appropriate management practices.\nThey deployed\
    \ a use-case scenario based on a network of highly usable hardware components\
    \ for\ndata collection. Their study was mainly focused on networking and software\
    \ infrastructures that\nsupport an array of prototype weather stations and sensors;\
    \ the latter collected information relevant to\nrainfall, wind speed and direction,\
    \ barometric pressure, solar radiation, temperature, and humidity.\nIn addition\
    \ to atmospheric variables authors took into consideration soil matrix potential\
    \ from soil\nmoisture by using soil measurement probes buried at two different\
    \ depths. The researchers achieved\nto minimize data loss and improve data accessibility\
    \ on the scope of long-term data acquisition system.\nFurthermore, the array of\
    \ sensors was operating properly and collecting reliable data due to the correct\n\
    placement of sensors within the vineyards.\nOne of the early adopters of WSN in\
    \ viticulture were Marino et al. [11], where they proposed the\nintegration of\
    \ specialized electronic sensors for climate monitoring and soil assessment. They\
    \ deployed\nan experimental network for on-site automatic data acquisition, based\
    \ on distributed processes.\nThe network was implemented with the introduction\
    \ of Electronic Zonal Stations (EZS) to a web\nplatform and a connected database.\
    \ The EZS consist of a data logger collecting measurements from the\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n5 of 23\nstations’ sensors, and an Ultra High Frequency (UHF)\
    \ radio modem that forwards the readings to the\nbase station. The produced dataset\
    \ is organized in registers that comprise measurements (temperature,\nrelative\
    \ humidity, leaf humidity, soil temperature, solar radiation, rain gauge, and\
    \ biological\nparameters), along with date and time. Ultimately, they provided\
    \ a low-cost and low power\nconsumption network that offers real measurements\
    \ in order to consistently validate various biological\nand ecological models\
    \ used in smart viticulture.\nIndices related to grapevine development were employed\
    \ by Neethling et al. [12] while analyzing\nnatural trends of climatic and bioclimatic\
    \ parameters for the main grapevine varieties in France.\nTheir research took\
    \ place at the Loire valley in northeast France, where the wine was determined\n\
    by the unique characteristics of the approximate geographical environment. The\
    \ research team used\ntemperature data from 7 stations in the area, but not situated\
    \ within the vineyards. More speciﬁcally,\ntemperature measurements produced several\
    \ indices: Mean and seasonal temperature, growing\ndegree-days index (GDD), Huglin\
    \ index (HI), cool-night index (CI), and Diurnal Temperature Range\n(DTR). Additionally,\
    \ they gathered monthly rainfall data from 5 stations within the research area,\n\
    which used to calculate total rainfall, dry-spell-mean index, and number of days\
    \ of heavy rainfall.\nMoreover, they dissected the indices in 2 groups (climatic\
    \ and bioclimatic), which assisted them\nto conclude on a temperature rise during\
    \ the growing season (April–September). Consequently,\nNeethling et al. used a\
    \ large meteorological dataset that helped them indicate the inﬂuence of climatic\n\
    and bioclimatic variations in berry composition of the main grape varieties cultivated\
    \ in the Loire valley.\nTaking above research efforts a step further, Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) technologies are supportive\nto conventional methods of data\
    \ acquisition through the prism of prediction models development.\nParra Plazas\
    \ et al. [13] proposed a Computational Intelligence (CI) model using IoT technologies\
    \ in the\nnotion of climate monitoring. Their dataset originates from weather\
    \ stations in a time-line between 2009\nand 2011. The variables under study are\
    \ precipitation (mm of water), atmospheric pressure (mm Hg),\nrelative humidity\
    \ (HR%), temperature (Co), wind speed (km/h), and wind direction (azimuth degrees).\n\
    The data collected during the aforementioned time period produced a knowledge\
    \ base on which two\nCI models were deployed. The models demonstrated that further\
    \ experimentation is needed with\nan ampliﬁed dataset in order to improve its\
    \ responsiveness.\nHaving said that, it is rather true that modern research on\
    \ agricultural production and adaptation\ntends to be based on multi-disciplinary\
    \ methodologies focused both on quantitative and qualitative\nmeasurements. Statistics\
    \ derived solely from arithmetic/numerical data cannot provide the excepted\n\
    results on production growth and durability. Thus, most recent studies deployed\
    \ several different\nmethodologies in the ﬁelds of geography, remote sensing,\
    \ and informatics that largely enable\nresearchers to further employ state-of-the-art\
    \ agricultural analysis on top of the aforementioned\nmethodologies and approaches.\
    \ The latter are discussed in the next subsection.\n2.2. Location-Based Data\n\
    Nowadays, the so-called Geographic Information Systems (GIS) play a powerful role\
    \ in spatial\nanalysis. The investigation and management of spatial variability\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds consist of\nmapping homogeneous management zones with\
    \ the use of proximal and remote sensing methods that\nprovide increased resolution\
    \ and accuracy of spatial characterization of physical parameters. The basis\n\
    of geographical integration into Decision Support Systems (DSS) introduced by\
    \ Tian-en et al. [14]\ndescribing spatial work-ﬂows and their components, under\
    \ the scope of precision farming optimization.\nTheir proposed web platform was\
    \ based on data structures derived form sampling areas. The data\nare soil, water\
    \ and climatic factors and are accompanied by location-based data in order to\
    \ assist\nagricultural management within the the study areas.\nFurthermore, it\
    \ may reduce on-site sampling costs, and improve management of wine quality\n\
    in relation to soil, crop, and yield features. In this framework, the notion of\
    \ spatial variability of\nmeteorological conditions is presented by Matese et\
    \ al. [15] for the distinction of best vintages.\nThe authors presented novel\
    \ results on spatial variability and its deﬁnition at different topographic\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n6 of 23\nscales. They deployed several sensors\
    \ (temperature, humidity, solar radiation) within the study areas\nand developed\
    \ varied analytic methodologies depending on the climatic scale (meso, topo/macro,\n\
    micro 1 and micro 2). All factors assessed within the context of spatial variation\
    \ as dependant\ncategorical variables, which are designed hierarchically in order\
    \ to justify their meaning in parametric\nmonitoring assessment. Their results\
    \ illustrate the effects of several sources of spatial variation in\nviticulture\
    \ and presented a “proof of concept” methodology for on-site application. Additionally,\n\
    the in-ﬁeld measurements potentially provide support to production and disease\
    \ management\nfor research and technical purposes. Finally, Matese et al. highlight\
    \ the need to further develop\nmultifactorial means of analysis on the scope of\
    \ agro-meteorological monitoring in addition to the\nmanagement of large environmental\
    \ datasets.\nBai et al. [16] proposed a multi-sensor system that manages plant\
    \ phenotypic data, which based\non ﬁve sensor modules to measure crop canopy traits\
    \ from agricultural terroirs. The research team\nalso assessed data related to\
    \ canopy reﬂectance spectra thoughout RGB images on soybean and wheat\nﬁelds.\
    \ The produced integrated sensor system used solar radiation and air temperature/relative\n\
    humidity sensors, ultrasonic distance sensors, infrared thermal radiometers, NDVI\
    \ sensors, portable\nspectrometers and RGB cameras that then were synchronized\
    \ the analyzed data in order to provide\ninter-correlations among the sensor-based\
    \ traits, validated of the reliability of the apparatus in data\ncollection. Their\
    \ study indicated the useful capabilities of location based sensor systems during\n\
    plant breeding.\nGeo-statistics as a tool for monitoring agricultural practices\
    \ was the subject of study of\nIrimia et al. [17]. They used the daily averages\
    \ of temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration\nvariables for the period\
    \ between 1961 and 2013 at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees (i.e., 10 × 10\
    \ km)\nin order to produce a spatial distribution map assessing the climatic suitability\
    \ of wine production\nbased on oenoclimatic aptitude index (IAOe). Their ﬁndings\
    \ highlighted the negative evolution of\nclimate suitability for wine production\
    \ within the areas of study and where the changes are likely to\ngenerate climatic\
    \ classiﬁcation in wine growing regions in Romania.\nThe simulation of surface\
    \ ﬂows on the basis of erosion management was examined by\nRodrigo-Comino et al.\
    \ [18] in order to estimate soil erodibility, runoff discharge and erosion rate.\n\
    They’ve implemented several rainfall simulations in their study areas and produced\
    \ statistical results\nused in conjunction with spatial coefﬁcients, which indicate\
    \ spatial distribution of the mechanical\neffects of water in soil composition.\
    \ Furthermore, authors produced proportional symbol maps that\nvisualized the\
    \ results of spatial coefﬁcients, thus indicating the high soil and water losses\
    \ within the\nstudy areas.\nFinally, spatial characteristics of different energy\
    \ consumption patterns in agriculture were\npresented by Tian et al. [19]. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the authors implemented a GIS methodology in analyzing\nthe distribution between\
    \ energy types with respect to their contribution in yield. Furthermore, their\n\
    study recorded numerical data collected on-site that assisted them to analyze\
    \ the spatial variation of\nenergy consumption. They produced several thematic\
    \ maps, which visualize several indices related to\nspatial correlation, clustering,\
    \ and association. The results categorized the energy types in signiﬁcance\nand\
    \ Moran’s I index proved to be the most productive tool for large scale spatial\
    \ correlation analysis.\n2.3. Data from Satellites\nRemote sensing has proved\
    \ to be game-changing for the agricultural sector, as it is considered\nto be\
    \ fundamental for the trending “precision agriculture” framework. In principle,\
    \ remote sensing\nestimates the properties of a plant through non-destructive\
    \ processes in a fast and accurate method.\nIt may include a wide range of applications\
    \ in agriculture, such as crop growth monitoring, crop yield,\nand quality estimation,\
    \ identiﬁcation of irrigation needs, as well as biotic and abiotic damage [20].\n\
    Zarco-Tejada et al. [21] studied the effects of hyper-spectral indices in agricultural\
    \ research and\nin particular in the natural conditions of vineyards. Their scope\
    \ of research concentrated to vine\nreﬂectance along with soil spectra extracted\
    \ from images collected at spatial resolution of 1 m and on\nSustainability 2019,\
    \ 11, 3278\n7 of 23\n8 spectral bands. In particular, they concentrated at the\
    \ calculation of narrow-band indices of pigment\ndensity. Furthermore, this study\
    \ investigated the optical properties of Vitis vinifera L. leaves by taking\n\
    into consideration its reﬂectance and transmittance properties. Additionally,\
    \ the researchers measured\nthe optical index calculation along with the destructive\
    \ determination of pigments on a database\nretrieved between 2002 and 2003. The\
    \ images were obtained from 103 study sites that include 24 ﬁelds\nand enabled\
    \ the use of scaling up on leaf-level sensitive remote sensing indices. The indices\
    \ assisted\nthe researchers to assess on the effectiveness of canopy-level information\
    \ retrieval methodology.\nIt is acknowledged that water is a major resource in\
    \ agriculture and is related to arid regions.\nRemote Sensing (RS) toolkits offer\
    \ region characterization on drought through speciﬁed indices\ndeveloped for remote\
    \ study. Rhee et al. [22] proposed a RS-based drought index that monitors arid\n\
    and humid regions using multi-sensor data. Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI)\
    \ combines several\nassets of RS methodology (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI), Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer Sensor (MODIS),\
    \ and precipitation (TRMM)) in order to collect relevant\ninformation for the\
    \ effect of waterlessness on annual basis. The SDCI was affected by the varied\
    \ spatial\nresolution from each of the indices and scaling was an approach to\
    \ segregate the drought effect among\narid and humid areas, while the dataset\
    \ will get enriched over time.\nZone scaling on thematic maps of wine grape terroirs\
    \ was the subject of study of Vaudour et al. [23].\nThey proposed a mapping methodology\
    \ of implementing bootstrapped regression trees on distinct\ncombinations of morphometric\
    \ data in conjunction with 20 meter SPOT satellite images. Furthermore,\nthe authors\
    \ managed to capture expert knowledge on grape harvest quality at various spots\
    \ in South\nAfrica on a regional scale. Their proof of concept methodology relied\
    \ on a limited number of easily\navailable spatial data at a medium spatial resolution;\
    \ the positive aspect was the fact that the latter\ncould be duplicated to any\
    \ other homogeneous viticultural terroirs.\nProductivity assessment analysis while\
    \ implementing hyper-spectral reﬂectance recognition in\nrelation to vines biophysical\
    \ properties was proposed by Serrano et al. [24]. Their work focused\non berry\
    \ yield growth and quality attributes prediction in rain-fed vineyards. The indices\
    \ implied\ndifferences among vineyards with relation to their vine canopy vigor\
    \ and water status, on a water\ndeﬁcit time scale. Furthermore, their results\
    \ indicated speciﬁc correlations among indices that are\nmore susceptible to water\
    \ sufﬁciency or deﬁciency on the scope of predicting berry quality attributes\n\
    in relation to aquatic reserves.\nBourgeon et al. [25] proposed methodology for\
    \ characterizing vine foliage with the use of\nmultispectral satellite sensors.\
    \ More speciﬁcally, they introduced a proximal imaging sensor that\noperates within\
    \ the visible and near-infrared (NI) spectral bands. The camera sensor was deployed\
    \ at\nthe ground level and produced absolute reﬂectance images comparable to NDVI\
    \ maps produced by\ncommercial satellite systems. The physiological assessment\
    \ of the vines was implemented through\nradiometric calibration of multispectral\
    \ imagery by post-image processing tools on the scope of\ntemporal monitoring\
    \ the evolution of vine foliage.\nTang et al. [26] proposed both a proximal and\
    \ a remote sensing method, utilizing two\ndifferent methods for assisting in decision\
    \ support and yield estimation from existing technologies.\nThey employed ground\
    \ video feed for green pixel, in conjunction to local thresholding and\nSelf-Organizing-Maps\
    \ from satellite imagery, in order to identify non-productive vines in the available\n\
    canopy on the block level. This semi-supervised version provided recognition capabilities\
    \ at the\nphenological stage as an automatic and low-cost monitoring application,\
    \ potentially deployed over\ndifferent times within the season.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ socio-economic, and physical effects on Mediterranean vineyards is the subject\n\
    of study for Vinatier and Gonzalez-Arnaiz [27]. The researchers employed multi-temporal\
    \ satellite\nimagery in order to comprehend and track the changes in land cover\
    \ that shape agricultural landscapes.\nFurthermore, the changes in land management\
    \ were composed in transition matrices that interpret\ngains, losses, and swaps\
    \ for each category. In addition to temporal changes, images with sufﬁcient\n\
    spatial resolution were used in order to detect subtle differences in land use/cover\
    \ on a speciﬁc scale.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n8 of 23\nTheir work underlines\
    \ the usefulness of satellite imagery in classifying alterations in yield distribution\n\
    and quality, in relation to external parameters that drive land management in\
    \ agricultural areas.\nYield quality and productivity can be assessed through\
    \ satellite and proximal sensing by\nestimating spectral vegetation indices (SVIs).\
    \ Anastasiou et al. [20] employed satellite and proximal\nsensing at the various\
    \ stages of table grape growth for three cultivation years in a row (i.e., between\n\
    2015–2017). Landsat 8 satellite imagery and proximal sensing techniques produced\
    \ calculations of\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index\n(GNDVI) that the SVIs were based upon. The indices\
    \ measure seasonal plant response - exploiting soil\nand plant spectra—and produce\
    \ the type of relationship between visible and near-infrared reﬂectance.\nTheir\
    \ results indicated higher accuracy of proximal sensing, providing higher correlations\
    \ and temporal\naccuracy during the earlier period of grape growth.\nThe importance\
    \ of water resources in the quality of vine production is highlighted by Loggenberg\n\
    et al. [28]. They introduce a machine-learning based remote sensing methodology\
    \ for the study of\nwater stress in Shiraz type vineyards. The results are based\
    \ on terrestrial hyper-spectral imaging\ncapturing the study areas, which were\
    \ located in Stellenbosch at the Western Cape of South Africa.\nThey employed\
    \ several remote sensing methodologies upon data acquisition and pre-processing\n\
    techniques combining on-site and satellite sampling. The remote sensing methodology\
    \ consists of\nspectral smoothing for multi-band images, classiﬁcation (implemented\
    \ with Random Forest (RF) and\nExtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting) techniques),\
    \ dimensional reduction, and accuracy assessment.\nThe researchers concluded that\
    \ remote sensing machine learning methodologies on hyperspectral data\ndemonstrated\
    \ that Random Forest (RF) classiﬁcation optimally corresponds to water stress\
    \ modelling\nin applications related to viticulture.\n2.4. Image Data from Drones\n\
    In data-driven agriculture, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, as they\
    \ are usually\nreferred to, are a valuable tool for making inferences about grape\
    \ composition from multispectral\nmeasurements. They can acquire high-resolution\
    \ aerial images, digital RGB (Red-Green-Blue),\nhyper-spectral imagery of vineyards,\
    \ as well as data of other modalities. When equipped with\nappropriate sensors,\
    \ UAVs can collect useful data related to leaf temperature, vine water status,\n\
    and canopy vigor. Depending on the need of the applications, equipped sensors\
    \ can gather thermal,\nvisible, hyperspectral, and/or multispectral images. For\
    \ example, hyperspectral sensors can gather\na broader range of wavelengths; a\
    \ thermal camera can gather image data to determine canopy variables\nsuch as\
    \ water stress.\nComba et al. [29] introduced the adoption of detection techniques\
    \ in modern precision agriculture\nfor quality production standards. The researchers\
    \ proposed an image processing algorithm for the\nautomatic detection of vine\
    \ rows from gray-scale aerial imagery. Near-infrared (NI) images acquired\nwith\
    \ a Tetracam ADC-lite camera (http://www.tetracam.com/Products-ADC_Lite.htm) that\
    \ was\ninstalled on a Mikrokopter Hexa-II drone (http://wiki.mikrokopter.de/en/HexaKopter).\
    \ This array\nhas a ﬁeld of view and is able to achieve a 0.056 m/pixel ground\
    \ resolution at a ﬂight altitude of 150 m.\nAdditionally, the effectiveness of\
    \ the proposed method has been demonstrated by reporting the results\nof the elaborations\
    \ applied to 4 sample vineyard images. The proposed method is able to process\
    \ the\noriginal acquired image as it is, without any intervention or feedback\
    \ from the user and requires a very\nlimited number of calibration parameters.\
    \ The results obtained from the processing of a set of sample\nimages demonstrate\
    \ the effectiveness of the proposed method, with a very limited error rate, even\
    \ in\nthe case of images with disturbances and different vine row orientations\
    \ in the same image.\nThe work of Matese et al. [30] describes the implementation\
    \ probabilities of multi-sensor\nUAVs with a variety of monitoring tasks. The\
    \ researchers assessed the intra-vineyard in terms\nof characterization of the\
    \ state of vines vigor using multispectral cameras, leaf temperature (thermal\n\
    camera), and a model methodology of missing plants analysis with a high spatial\
    \ resolution of RGB\nbands camera. The aforementioned apparatus was designed speciﬁcally\
    \ for precision viticulture in the\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n9 of 23\nscope\
    \ of rapid and multi-purpose environmental monitoring within the areas of interest.\
    \ The UAV\nprovided images with discriminative details in rows and inter-rows\
    \ of vines and as a result provided\npure pixels with solely the foliage. Their\
    \ usage in agricultural applications, in general, and in viticulture,\nin particular,\
    \ is enhanced by high ﬂexibility of use, low operating costs, and a very high\
    \ spatial\nresolution that they offer.\nDe Castro et al. [31] exploited the capabilities\
    \ of UAVs to produce image data that support 3D\nlandscape models. The aerial\
    \ vehicles ﬂew over 3 vineyards with a distinct gap between the vine\nrows at\
    \ a different growth rate. More speciﬁcally they chose to make the ﬂights in July\
    \ and September\nin order to depict the two distinct phases of the crop. With\
    \ their approach, they managed to gather\ninformation from 3 ﬁelds at two crop\
    \ stages, analyzing a wide range of situations and as a result to\nproduce robust\
    \ data. The UAVs were ﬂown at 30 m of altitude, taking images with spatial resolution\
    \ of\n1cm per pixel (i.e., ground image size: 37 × 28 m) in a rate of 1 s per\
    \ frame. Therefore, they succeeded\nto get a 93% forward lap and 60% of side lap\
    \ in order to create a 3D reconstruction of crops.\nMulti-temporal monitoring\
    \ of agricultural lands demands continuous characterization of\nvegetation on\
    \ distinct dates. Pádua et al. [32] proposed a monitoring platform that uses multi-temporal\n\
    data related to precision viticulture (PV) that can be used to monitor the size,\
    \ shape, and vigour of\ngrapevines canopies. Their work aims to vegetation characterization\
    \ through multi-temporal analysis\nusing accessible and low cost UAVs for the\
    \ acquisition of very-high resolution imagery, up to ground\nsample distance (GSD)\
    \ and accompanied sensor nodes. Thereafter, the gathered data were analyzed\n\
    automatically with consideration of the natural, topographic, and morphological\
    \ variables of the area\nof interest. Their method produced RGB orthophoto mosaics\
    \ of the vineyards in whole, multi-temporal\nﬁeld analysis, and, ﬁnally, a crop-related\
    \ and non-invasive data acquisition method for farmers.\nAll in all, high-resolution\
    \ aerial images from drones can be used to determine the spatial\ndistribution\
    \ of a variety of canopy variables within a vineyard block and between different\
    \ vineyard\nblocks. In this way, UAVs can be used to measure the spatial distribution\
    \ of vigor, water stress, nutrient\nstatus, disease, yield components, and berry\
    \ composition. Rationale for employing drones in precision\nviticulture practices\
    \ are the higher ﬂexibility of use, lower operational costs compared to the usage\n\
    of conventional aircraft, and invariability to cloud cover. However, utilization\
    \ of UAVs in precision\nviticulture is a relatively new area of research, not\
    \ extensively tested and the major challenges to be\nconsidered are the massive\
    \ amount of collected data, the time required for post processing of collected\n\
    data, and the need for feature engineering in order to derive useful vegetation\
    \ indices that are speciﬁc\nto variables of interest.\n3. Machine Learning (ML)\
    \ Methodologies for Agricultural Data\nDuring the last years we have witnessed\
    \ a plethora of technological breakthroughs in domains\nsuch as computer vision\
    \ and machine translation, which have led to the establishment of Machine\nLearning\
    \ (ML) as one of the core tenets of the current technological landscape. The aforementioned\n\
    successes can mainly be attributed to the utilization of large and complex Deep\
    \ Neural Network (DNN)\narchitectures, better acknowledged as “deep learning.”\n\
    Moreover, the evolution and transformations in the smart agriculture ﬁeld over\
    \ the recent years\nresult nowadays in the mass production of huge amounts of\
    \ data, information, and content from many\ndifferent sources, such as IoT devices\
    \ and sensors, environmentalists, agronomists, winemakers, or\nplain farmers and\
    \ interested stakeholders. Thus, deep learning along with other more “conventional”\n\
    machine learning methodologies, can play a pivotal role towards addressing numerous\
    \ research\nproblems within the agricultural domain, mainly through the utilization\
    \ of the large amount of\navailable digitized agricultural information.\nIn the\
    \ following, Section 3.1 presents research works related to exploiting continuous\
    \ data\n(e.g., data from sensors such as temperature, soil moisture, etc.) for\
    \ the purpose of creating predictive\nMachine Learning models capable to provide\
    \ various forecasts, whereas Section 3.2 describes the\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 3278\n10 of 23\nusage of image-based information mostly by deep learning models,\
    \ which are capable of classifying\nplant species, detect deceases, and ﬁnally,\
    \ perform spatial-aware object classiﬁcation.\n3.1. ML-Based Forecasting on Numerical\
    \ Data\nOne of the worth-noting works in the ﬁeld is the one by Radhika and M.\
    \ Shashi [33],\nwhere they exploit Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the task\
    \ of predicting the maximum\ndaily temperature. They use a Multi-Layer Perceptron\
    \ (MLP) as a baseline, trained through\nback-propagation. To accomplish the aforementioned\
    \ prediction task, they rely on weather data\nprovided by the University of Cambridge\
    \ for the time period of 2003–2007. Through their experimental\nﬁndings, the authors\
    \ showcase that the SVM-based approach is able to achieve signiﬁcant results,\n\
    thus showcasing its suitability for this particular prediction problem.\nSimilarly,\
    \ Gill et al. [34] develop a SVM regression model in order to predict the moisture\
    \ of soil.\nIn particular, the authors utilize both meteorological and soil moisture\
    \ data, from 11 weather stations\nfrom the Oklahoma region in the United States\
    \ of America for training and testing their prediction\nmodel. Finally, by comparing\
    \ their proposed model against an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN),\nthey showcase\
    \ its efﬁciency.\nMohammadi et al. [35] develop a predictive model for the task\
    \ of inferring the dew point\ntemperature, i.e., the temperature at which water\
    \ vapor in the air condenses into liquid, since by\npredicting this, it is also\
    \ possible to determine whether it will rain or snow at a particular date.\nTo\
    \ achieve that, the authors exploit Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), i.e., feed-forward\
    \ neural\nnetworks, in which the weights of the nodes within a hidden layer do\
    \ not require any kind of tuning.\nThrough an experimental evaluation of their\
    \ model against conventional machine learning models\n(e.g., SVMs and ANNs), using\
    \ as a training dataset measurements from two meteorological stations in\nIran,\
    \ the authors were able to show that ELM can be applied for this problem with\
    \ promising results.\nSalcedo-Sanz et al. [36] propose a Machine Learning model\
    \ for long-term air temperature\nprediction, a task that is useful for a plethora\
    \ of domains, such as agriculture. They use the publicly\navailable monthly mean\
    \ temperature dataset provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology\n(BOM),\
    \ from urban and regional areas in Australia. They develop and evaluate two distinct\
    \ methods,\ni.e., a SVM regressor and an ANN, and showcase that the former is\
    \ able to outperform the latter,\nregarding the air temperature prediction task.\n\
    Abbot and Marohasy [37] exploit Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in order to predict\
    \ rainfall,\nfor the region of Queensland in Australia. More speciﬁcally, the\
    \ authors apply the aforementioned\ncategory of Machine Learning models for the\
    \ purpose of providing a medium-term rainfall\nforecast that outperforms conventional\
    \ statistical models typically exploited for this task. Similarly,\nChithra et\
    \ al. [38] utilise ANNs, for detecting the impact of climate change on the monthly\
    \ mean\nmaximum and minimum temperature in the Chaliyar river basin located in\
    \ India.\nOnal et al. [39] proposed an extended IoT Framework based on data integration,\
    \ retrieval,\nprocessing, and learning layers trough a weather data clustering\
    \ analysis methodology. Their learning\nmodel implemented unsupervised clustering\
    \ as a method of big data utilization originating from\n8000 weather stations\
    \ from North America. Air temperature, wind-speed, relative humidity, visibility,\n\
    and pressure data were analyzed by a traditional k-means clustering algorithm\
    \ under the scope of the\nstations’ geographical alignment.\nSehgal et al. [40]\
    \ developed ”ViSeed”, a Machine Learning and visualization framework\nfor weather\
    \ and yield prediction, respectively. In particular, the authors train and evaluate\n\
    a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classiﬁer on the Syngenta 2016 crop data challenge,\n\
    whereas Song et al. [41] utilize a Deep Belief Network (DBN), in order to predict\
    \ the soil moisture\ncontent in a corn ﬁeld. By training and evaluating their\
    \ proposed model on soil data collected from the\nZhangye oasis, in Northwest\
    \ China, and bench-marking against a multi-layer perceptron, the authors\nwere\
    \ able to showcase its effectiveness for the aforementioned task.\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n11 of 23\nFinally, Priya et al. [42] developed an integrated\
    \ system for precision agriculture implementing\nbig data analytics, IoT, and\
    \ Machine Learning methodologies. Their crop recommendation system\nuses Naïve\
    \ Bayes to indicate if the conditions are optimal for sowing, plant growth, and\
    \ harvesting of\na plant, in addition to yield prediction and pesticide recommendation.\
    \ Furthermore, the researchers\nproduced a scalable model based on data collected\
    \ from various sources, such as satellite images,\nsensor recorded ﬁeld data,\
    \ irrigation related reports, crop data, and weather data in India.\nThe interested\
    \ reader is able to to review a brief comparative overview of the above fundamental\n\

    In the framework of scene classiﬁcation, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard [43] apply\
    \ a deep neural\nnetwork for the task of fruit counting.\nIn particular, the authors\
    \ present two different neural\narchitectures, i.e., a novel convolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN) and a modiﬁed version of the\nwell-known Inception-ResNet network.\
    \ In order to train the presented deep neural architectures,\nauthors rely on\
    \ a synthetic dataset, whereas, in order to validate their performance, they use\
    \ real\nimages collected from Google Images. Through their experimental approach\
    \ authors showcase the\nefﬁciency of their proposed neural architecture against\
    \ various baselines.\nSimilarly, Sa et al. [44] present DeepFruit, a neural network\
    \ for fruit detection. More speciﬁcally,\nthe authors adopt the Faster Region-based\
    \ CNN architecture and through transfer learning train\nit to be able to successfully\
    \ recognize sweet peppers contained in an image. Yalcin [45] developed\nDeep-Pheno,\
    \ a CNN for the task of recognizing and classifying the phenological stages of\
    \ plants,\ni.e., its life cycle. The author uses images depicting plants such\
    \ as cotton, wheet, and pepper from\ncameras found on various agro-stations in\
    \ Turkey for training and testing the model. The presented\nneural architecture\
    \ was able to outperform various conventional machine learning algorithms in the\n\
    aforementioned classiﬁcation task.\nLee et al. [46] used CNNs in order to extract\
    \ features from images in a completely unsupervised\nway, so as to train classiﬁers\
    \ able to identify 44 different plant species. Moreover, the authors try to\n\
    understand the feature representation of the model, so as to shed some light on\
    \ its inner decision\nmechanisms. Authors train and test the CNN on a leaf dataset\
    \ collected from the Kew Royal Botanic\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n12 of 23\n\
    Gardens in England. Finally, in order to evaluate the usefulness of the features\
    \ that the network learns,\nthey use them as input to a NN and SVM classiﬁers,\
    \ and thus are able to achieve beyond state-of-the-art\nresults. In a similar\
    \ approach, Dyrmann et al. [47] propose a CNN architecture for classifying images\
    \ of\nseedings during the early growth stage of a plant. More speciﬁcally, the\
    \ authors train a classiﬁer that is\nable to predict, using vertically photographed\
    \ images of seedings, 22 different plant species, achieving\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ results by training the network on 10,413 images collected from six different\
    \ datasets.\nFurthermore, Bargoti and Underwood [48] present an image-based fruit\
    \ detection model using\nthe Faster R-CNN neural architecture for mangoes, almonds,\
    \ and apples, achieving very good results.\nIn order to train the model, the authors\
    \ use images captured from orchards in the regions of Victoria\nand Queensland\
    \ in Australia. They present ablation studies so as to showcase the inner functionality\n\
    of the neural model, as well as which factors within an image play an important\
    \ role for the object\ndetection task. Mohanty et al. [49] apply convolutional\
    \ neural networks for automatically detecting\nand diagnosing plant diseases through\
    \ images. To achieve that, the authors utilize a public dataset\ncontaining 54,306\
    \ images of both diseased and healthy plant leaves, and train two neural architectures,\n\
    i.e., AlexNet and GoogLeNet, for classifying crop species and diseases status,\
    \ achieving a 99% accuracy.\nSimilarly, Sladojevic et al. [50] use a convolutional\
    \ deep learning model in order to automatically\nclassify and detect plant diseases\
    \ from images containing leafs. The proposed model was able to detect\nleaf presence\
    \ and distinguish between healthy leaves and 13 different diseases, which can\
    \ be visually\ndiagnosed. Moreover, the authors created a new dataset for training\
    \ and testing Machine Learning\nmodels for this particular task, containing more\
    \ than 3000 images gathered from the Internet and then\nextend it to more than\
    \ 30,000 using various data augmentation techniques. Mortensen et al. [51] utilize\n\
    a deep neural network to perform semantic segmentation for mixed crops. In particular,\
    \ the authors\nwere able to use a convolutional neural architecture (i.e., VGG16)\
    \ and through transfer learning\n(i.e., ﬁne-tuning the network instead of training\
    \ it from scratch) have it successfully estimate both\nthe individual components,\
    \ as well as the total biomass of a crop using an image dataset from a plot\n\
    experiment at Foulum Research Center in Denmark.\nRußwurm and Körner [52] perform\
    \ multi-temporal classiﬁcation upon a time-series for the\nclassiﬁcation of crops\
    \ for two seasons achieving state-of-the-art results, and thus showcasing the\n\
    efﬁcacy of deep learning methodologies for this particular domain. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ to perform\nthe aforementioned task, the authors applied an encoder-decoder\
    \ neural architecture on an Earth\nobservation (EO) sensors time-series dataset\
    \ from the region of Munich, Germany. Finally, they also\nprovide a visualization\
    \ of the neural network’s activations, so as to facilitate a better understanding\n\
    of its inner decision-making mechanisms. Pound et al. [53] exploit neural networks,\
    \ to perform\nimage-based plant phenotyping, i.e., describe features such as its\
    \ anatomical, ontogenetical,\nphysiological, and biochemical properties. In particular,\
    \ the authors train two different CNN-based\nneural networks to perform root and\
    \ shoot detection for wheat varieties, using a different dataset for\neach task,\
    \ respectively. Using this experimental approach they were able to achieve state-of-the-art\n\
    results (i.e., >97% accuracy) for root and shoot feature identiﬁcation and localization.\n\
    Namin et al. [54] present a neural architecture consisting of a CNN and Long-Short\
    \ Term\nNetwork (LSTN) for the task of plant classiﬁcation. In particular, the\
    \ authors utilize the CNN\nfor the unsupervised generation of features, and the\
    \ LSTN to investigate the growth of plants.\nBy applying their presented deep\
    \ learning framework on an image-based time-series dataset depicting\n4 different\
    \ categories of Arabidopsis thaliana plant, they were able to showcase that deep\
    \ learning\nnetworks can generate more useful features than the traditional hand-crafted\
    \ image analysis features,\nas well as achieve better results than conventional\
    \ Machine Learning methodologies. Kussul et al. [55]\nperform Land Cover and Crop\
    \ Types classiﬁcation using a dataset consisting of remote sensing\ndata. To effectively\
    \ tackle this particular problem, they use a multilevel deep learning approach,\n\
    i.e., both supervised and unsupervised learning through neural networks for segmenting\
    \ and\nclassifying a multi-source satellite image dataset. Their proposed neural\
    \ architecture was able to\noutperform traditional Machine Learning techniques\
    \ such as random forests.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n13 of 23\nRiegler-Nurscher\
    \ et al. [56] studied the sustainable cultivation of arable lands by introducing\n\
    a novel generic image analysis method for the estimation of soil cover. They implemented\
    \ a machine\nlearning methodology for distinguishing between various types of\
    \ soil cover through training\na manageable amount of classiﬁcation samples. Their\
    \ method deployed entangled random forests\non a wide training data set of soil\
    \ images obtained by high resolution cameras.\nFurthermore,\nthe pixel-wise method\
    \ produced accurate classiﬁcation of living plant material, building the basis\
    \ for\nfurther development of soil cover estimation in agriculture.\nLastly, Hall\
    \ et al. [57] investigate whether traditional hand-crafted image features can\
    \ outperform\nthose generated in an unsupervised way through deep neural networks\
    \ for the task of leaf classiﬁcation.\nBy training a deep convolutional neural\
    \ network on the Flavia dataset, the authors were able to\nshowcase that features\
    \ generated by the network are more useful than hand-crafting image features,\n\
    although they stress that combining both approaches leads to optimized state-of-the-art\
    \ results.\nTable 2 provides a brief comparative overview of the above discussed\

    \ of segmenting semantic data through convolutional networks. More speciﬁcally\
    \ they\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n14 of 23\nnoted that segmentation bridges\
    \ the gap between semantics and location, based on the distinction\nof global\
    \ (i.e., ”what?”) and local (i.e., ”where?”) information. Based on deep feature\
    \ hierarchies\nthe researchers were able to encode location and semantics in a\
    \ nonlinear local-to-global pyramid.\nThey managed to deﬁne a “skip architecture”\
    \ to take advantage of a spectrum of features that\ncombine deep, coarse, semantic\
    \ information, and shallow, ﬁne, appearance information. Furthermore,\nthey stated\
    \ that fully convolutional networks are a rich class of models, which are able\
    \ to extent\ntheir classiﬁcation nets to segmentation. Additionally, Semantic\
    \ Segmentation allows to improve the\narchitecture with multi-resolution layer\
    \ combinations that dramatically improve the state-of-the-art,\nwhile simultaneously\
    \ simplifying and speeding up learning and inference tasks.\nThe importance of\
    \ aerial survey is underlined by the existing image collection and interpretation\n\
    tools.\nRecent rapid progress on these domains incur due to accessibility and\
    \ advancements in\ntechnology. However, imagery has little meaning by itself,\
    \ unless it is processed and meaningful\ninformation is derived from it. Therefore,\
    \ image classification comes as a way to address the problem of\nalgorithm generalization\
    \ through deep learning on the purposes of object recognition and detection,\n\
    scene parsing, and classification. Categorizing each image pixel to a semantic\
    \ class is typically called\n”Image Segmentation” and aims at understanding an\
    \ image at the pixel level, although images of\na fixed size are required to achieve\
    \ optimized classification, dense prediction of images of any size,\nand significantly\
    \ increased speed in the process. Still, the concept of smart agriculture convicts\
    \ the\nautomation of such tasks, especially where the optical sensors play an\
    \ important role. Guijarro et al. [59]\ndeveloped an image processing algorithm\
    \ through new automatic approach for segmenting main image\ntextures. Additionally,\
    \ they also managed to refine the identification of sub-textures inside the main\n\
    ones. They implemented a three step approach of automatic image segmentation that\
    \ proved its\neffectiveness under different illumination conditions in outdoor\
    \ environments.\nThe re-establishment of bee colonies through color satellite\
    \ image segmentation was the subject\nof study of Sammouda et al. [60]. They introduced\
    \ a pixel clustering methodology by introducing\na Hopﬁeld Neural Network (HNN)\
    \ to consider monitoring aspects such as environmental conditions,\npoor resolution,\
    \ and poor illumination. The algorithm was implemented successively with two,\n\
    three, four, ﬁve, and six clusters, as well as with data from RGB channels, taking\
    \ into consideration\naspects such as population density, ecological distribution,\
    \ and ﬂowering phenology. Furthermore,\nsupervised multispectral land-use classiﬁcation\
    \ may be implemented through multi-view deep\nlearning methodology; Luus et al.\
    \ [61] designed a deep CNN (DCNN) for a well-known dataset\n(UC Merced Land Use\
    \ dataset: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html) and used\n\
    as a benchmark for several applications. Their end-to-end learning system was\
    \ capable of complex\nland-use classiﬁcation of high-resolution multispectral\
    \ aerial imagery. Furthermore, it was shown that\nmulti-scale views can be used\
    \ to train a single network and increase classiﬁcation accuracy compared\nto using\
    \ single-view samples.\nHigh-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) provides pixel size\
    \ classiﬁcation of individual entities in\ndetail. Längkvist et al. [62] proposed\
    \ a method for classifying objects from multispectral orthoimagery\nand digital\
    \ surface models (DSMs). The researchers investigated the use of convolutional\
    \ neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for per-pixel classiﬁcation on satellite imagery with\
    \ very high resolution (VHR)\ncharacteristics. They managed to categorize large\
    \ landscapes into 5 classes (vegetation, ground, road,\nbuilding, and water) and\
    \ discovered that at the context size of about 24 pixels they can achieve\nlow\
    \ training and testing simulation time, and concurrently high and stable classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy.\nAdditionally, the researchers deployed multiple CNNs in parallel\
    \ with varying context areas in order\nto provide a stable and accurate classiﬁcation\
    \ result.\nContinuing, modelling techniques of entities of the agricultural terrain\
    \ based on remote detection\nmay be produced through suitable algorithms’ development.\
    \ Comba et al. [29] proposed a categorizing\nmethod for parallel and equidistant\
    \ vine rows in order to eliminate spatial periodicity during the image\nelaboration\
    \ process. More speciﬁcally, the proposed algorithm is able to remove disturbance\
    \ image\nelements (e.g., roads, shadows) and minimize cloud obstruction. Their\
    \ multi-parameter technique was\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n15 of 23\nimplemented\
    \ autonomously, without user intervention, while allowing automatic path computation\n\
    in the corridors between vineyards. Finally the computational effort is affordable\
    \ and the results can\nbe obtained in a few minutes of elaboration for complex\
    \ images.\nThe use of crowd-sourcing geo-tagged ﬁeld photos in agricultural monitoring\
    \ applications forms\nanother interesting approach and was investigated by Xu\
    \ et al. [63]. They developed a land cover type\nrecognition model for ﬁeld photos\
    \ based on deep learning techniques. More speciﬁcally they combined\na pre-trained\
    \ convolutional neural network (CNN), as the image feature extractor, and a multinomial\n\
    logistic regression model, as the feature classiﬁer. Their model was able to describe\
    \ its prediction\nconﬁdence and can enable users to distinguish reliable and unreliable\
    \ predictions. The researchers were\nalso able to provide a new research direction\
    \ in citizen science by proving the possibility that Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence is\
    \ capable of helping with land cover classiﬁcation and evaluating the model’s\
    \ performance.\nThe topic of land classiﬁcation is strongly related to agricultural\
    \ applications through its\nmapping changes and transformation on the landscape.\
    \ Wurm et al. [64] investigated the application\nof Fully Convolutional Networks\
    \ (FCNs) in map entities categorization from various satellite\nimages. They deployed\
    \ high resolution optical imagery form Quickbird (https://bit.ly/2Fvpq4u),\nin\
    \ conjunction with Sentinel-2 (https://bit.ly/2UVFO3C) and TerraSAR-X (https://bit.ly/2WlZHBb)\n\
    data, by using them in FCNs without fully connected the existing layers popularized\
    \ by CNN\narchitectures. Furthermore, they explored the capabilities of this process\
    \ of ”transfer learning” to later\nadopt a pre-trained CNN from VHR optical Quickbird\
    \ imagery. The images were then applied to\ndatasets with larger mapping areas\
    \ but lower geometric resolution such as Sentinel-2. Additionally,\nthey assessed\
    \ the capabilities of transfer learning from optical imagery to existing active\
    \ SAR imagery\nfrom TerraSAR-X. Their results produced extremely promising segmentation\
    \ outcomes that can be used\nas a proof-of-concept in transfer learning and fully\
    \ convolutional networks for landscape mapping in\nsatellite imagery.\nLastly,\
    \ following the previous notation we introduce Table 3, which provides the comparative\n\
    overview of the above-mentioned research efforts in the same four-column tabular\
    \ manner. It should\nalso be clear at this point that the above research works\
    \ present image processing techniques that\ncan be used to enhance agricultural\
    \ practices, by improving accuracy and consistency of processes,\nwhile at the\
    \ same time reducing farmers’ manual monitoring procedures. These techniques are\
    \ quite\nimportant, since they offer ﬂexibility and effectively substitutes the\
    \ farmers’ visual decision making,\nalong with the identiﬁcation of textures belonging\
    \ to the soil and other variables, such as humidity\nand smoothness.\nTable 3.\

    The adoption of smart technology (e.g., sensors) within the domain of agriculture\
    \ has lead to\nan ever-increasing amount of digital information that can be utilized\
    \ for various knowledge extraction\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n16 of 23\n\
    tasks through visualization platforms and predictive models. Moreover, the datasets\
    \ created from the\naforementioned smart devices may be further enriched through\
    \ manual and/or automated annotation\ntechniques in order to improve their usefulness.\
    \ Following Section 4.1 describes how the domain\nof knowledge base creation may\
    \ beneﬁt agriculture, whereas Section 4.2 depicts how leveraging\nvarious data\
    \ visualization techniques can contribute towards a better understanding towards\
    \ the\napplicability of agricultural data. Finally, Section 4.3 showcases the\
    \ applicability of crowd-sourcing for\nthe domain of agriculture, stressing various\
    \ use-cases that can potentially enhance the efﬁciency of\nvarious agriculture-related\
    \ tasks.\n4.1. Knowledge Base Creation Characteristics\nAs the world becomes full\
    \ of sensor networks producing information, agriculture enters the ﬁelds\nof data\
    \ processing, storage, and retrieval at a very fast pace. Through various sources\
    \ of information\nderiving from a wide data spectrum (e.g., geo-information, soil\
    \ measurements, weather forecast,\nchemical analyses, to mention just a few data\
    \ streams), the agriculture industry is in a position to grow\nan extremely rich\
    \ system of integrated IoT data to power more informed decisions. The main challenge\n\
    lies in the high heterogeneity of data types in the agricultural sector; agriculture\
    \ makes use of various\ndifferent data (e.g., research, meteorological, soil,\
    \ ﬁnancial/economic, statistical, satellite/remote\nsensing, administrative, germplasm,\
    \ crop experiments, and ﬁeld trials, to name a few) and for each\ndata type there\
    \ are numerous standards used and these standards are not always linked between\
    \ each\nother or at least with the most prominent one of the sector. Thus, all\
    \ collected data that accompany\nan agricultural object (i.e., crops, seeds, etc.)\
    \ are typically stored in metadata records.\nMetadata records are critical to\
    \ the documentation and maintenance of interrelationships between\ninformation\
    \ resources and are being used to ﬁnd, gather, and maintain resources over long\
    \ periods\nof time, like viticulture historical data. The consistent application\
    \ of a descriptive metadata standard\nimproves the user’s search experience and\
    \ makes information retrieval within a single collection\nor across multiple datasets\
    \ more reliable. Descriptive, administrative, technical, and preservation\nmetadata\
    \ contribute to the management of information resources and help to ensure their\
    \ intellectual\nintegrity both now and in the future. In parallel with other domains,\
    \ many researchers in the digital\nagricultural community recognized the need\
    \ to lower the barriers for the management and aggregation\nof digital resources,\
    \ by implementing some measure of interoperability among metadata standards\n\
    and then with proprietary data structures. As a result, there is a wide range\
    \ of proposed solutions,\nincluding crosswalks, translation algorithms, metadata\
    \ registries, and specialized data dictionaries.\nTypically, a crosswalk provides\
    \ mapping of metadata elements from one metadata schema to\nanother and is considered\
    \ one of the most robust and ﬂexible solution. The prerequisite to a meaningful\n\
    mapping requires a clear and precise deﬁnition of the elements in each schema.\
    \ The primary difﬁculty\nis to identify the common elements in different metadata\
    \ schemas and put this information to use in\nsystems that resolve differences\
    \ between incompatible records. Crosswalks are typically presented\nas tables\
    \ of equivalent elements in two schemas and, even though the equivalences may\
    \ be inexact,\nthey represent an expert’s judgment that the conceptual differences\
    \ are immaterial to the successful\noperation of a software process that involves\
    \ records encoded in the two models. A crosswalk supports\nthe ability of a retrieval\
    \ mechanism to query ﬁelds with the same or similar content in different data\n\
    sources. In other words, it supports the well-known and much desired - in the\
    \ digital world - notion of\n”semantic interoperability”.\nCrosswalks are not\
    \ only important for supporting the demand for single point of access or\ncross-domain\
    \ searching; they are also instrumental for converting data from one format to\
    \ another.\nHowever, aggregating metadata records from different repositories\
    \ may create confusing display\nresults, especially if some of the metadata were\
    \ automatically generated or created by institutions\nor individuals that did\
    \ not follow best practices or standard thesauri and controlled vocabularies.\n\
    Still, mapping metadata elements from different schemas is only one level of cross\
    \ walking. Another\nlevel of semantic interoperability addresses datatype registration\
    \ and formatting of the values that\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n17 of 23\n\
    populate the metadata elements, e.g., rules for recording personal names or encoding\
    \ standards for\ndates, and the alignment between local authority ﬁles and adopted\
    \ terminologies, but these topics\nexceed the scope of the current survey work.\n\
    4.2. Data Visualization\nTaking above discussion a step further, the scope of\
    \ developing conceptual understanding through\ndata on agriculture is implemented\
    \ with the assistance of visual representations of natural processes.\nGraphical\
    \ representation, computer animation, and spatial overlay of agricultural data\
    \ are often used\nin visualizing natural phenomena, as a derivative of data analysis\
    \ and ML. Furthermore, scientiﬁc\nillustrations provide guidance on constructing\
    \ visual models for knowledge systems and connection\nfor visual modeling of the\
    \ corresponding ﬁndings. Scientiﬁc papers facilitate the important concepts,\n\
    schemata, processes, and rules that enhance learning through paradigms. Each ﬁgure\
    \ or diagram\nposses the particular element and processing step that will guide\
    \ researchers to form the appropriate\nresearch concept. Additionally, dynamic\
    \ visualizations offer comparisons that investigate the effect\nof visualization\
    \ components on the acquisition of environmental and spatial factors of agricultural\n\
    research. On the aspect of image processing and analysis, visualization techniques\
    \ are used to monitor\nand manage images that reduce transition complexities and\
    \ raising future potentials for the research.\nThe goal of data visualization\
    \ is to bridge the gap between researcher and data concepts on\nthe basis of their\
    \ underlying physical laws and properties. Thereafter, the presentation of massive\n\
    amounts of data as ﬁgures, allow the researcher to trim ineffectual information,\
    \ focus on the necessary,\nand comprehend the semantics of data. In this framework,\
    \ Bajaj [65] categorized the aspects of dynamic\nrepresentation of data in three\
    \ categories, namely computation, display and querying, which address the\nparameters\
    \ of every visualization environment. It is remarkable that visualization techniques\
    \ are not\nonly based on data types, but also on the processing operators that\
    \ are inherent in each visualization\ntechnique [66]. The techniques could be\
    \ described a visualization data pipeline that distinguishes\nthem into four data\
    \ stages: Value, analytical abstraction, visualization abstraction, and view.\
    \ These stages\ndescribe the states of data and their according processing operations.\n\
    The familiarity of information entities in relation to their real world representation\
    \ is crucial\nfor human perception.\nThe distinction between visualization were\
    \ “science visualization” and\n“information visualization” and is implemented\
    \ through the development of “visual analytics”.\nInformation visualizatio as\
    \ a branch of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) utilizes graphics to assist\nresearchers\
    \ in grasping and interpreting data on the purpose of developing form mental models\
    \ of data.\nAccordingly, numerical entities can reveal speciﬁc features and patterns\
    \ of the obtained information.\nFurthermore, the deployed toolset aims on improving\
    \ ”the clarity and aesthetic appeal of the displayed\ninformation and allows a\
    \ person to understand large amount of data and interact with it” [67].\nThe advent\
    \ of Big Data and ML guides data research towards shaping the goal of visual\n\
    representation on the scope of identifying hidden patterns or extremities in data,\
    \ increasing query\nﬂexibility and specialization, comparing various units in\
    \ order to obtain relative difference in\nquantities and enabling on-the-ﬂy human\
    \ interaction. New possibilities of visualization distinguish\nits techniques\
    \ by three factors, namely: Data type, process, and interoperability. It’s worth\
    \ noting that\nhuman perceptional capabilities are not sufﬁcient to embrace data\
    \ in large amounts, thus each method\ncan support varied data types, various optical\
    \ tools, and varied methods for interaction. In particular,\nagricultural space,\
    \ as a scientiﬁc ﬁeld that employs interdisciplinary research methods, utilizes\n\
    spatio-temporal transitions of land characteristics in conjunction with their\
    \ physical parameters.\nThe various facets of digital representation are based\
    \ on important aspects of each dataset on\nthe distinctions between data and phenomena.\
    \ Supplementary to that, agricultural research is\nbased on ﬁeld-collected data\
    \ that require high-level abstract models of data processing [68].\nThe data-ﬂow-driven\
    \ model is overlaid on cartographic representation of the areas of interest, utilizing\n\
    static and dynamic maps. Furthermore, such a system is optimally supported by\
    \ a client-server\narchitecture, in order sustain scalability for handling data-intensive\
    \ agriculture applications. Quite on\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n18 of 23\n\
    the contrary, numerically based analytics produce outputs that are displayed in\
    \ the form of queries,\nreports, charts, and diagrams. Those static numerical\
    \ conceptions can in the typical case be utilized\nstandalone, or superimposed\
    \ on a dynamic visualization platform.\n4.3. Crowd-Wisdom Exploitation\nDuring\
    \ the past decade, the wisdom of the crowd, or, in other words, the so-called\
    \ crowd-sourcing\nestablished itself as a dominant platform for exploiting the\
    \ skills and knowledge of online Internet\nusers. In particular, crowd-sourcing\
    \ can be perceived as outsourcing the task of data collection and/or\ndata annotation\
    \ to a group of non-professionals. The contributors to a crowd-sourcing platform\
    \ may\nreceive monetary compensation, or provide their services free of charge,\
    \ having in mind the collective\ngood. In the agriculture case crowd-sourcing\
    \ may be used in order to increase the efﬁciency of\na multitude of tasks within\
    \ the aforementioned domain. For example, sensors can be used in a number\nof\
    \ contexts for agriculture. By developing a platform that stores this type of\
    \ information, users will be\nable to submit data stemming from their own sensor-based\
    \ projects, something that can lead to the\naggregation of information regarding\
    \ different plant and/or crop species, and geography. Moreover,\nthe task of identifying\
    \ the species that a plant belongs to, may be enhanced through crowd-sourcing.\n\
    In particular, a potential contributor can improve the performance of a Machine\
    \ Learning classiﬁer\nby providing hand-annotated images along with the correct\
    \ labels, as well as various metadata that\ncan be utilized as features by the\
    \ predictive model. Finally, weather information is pivotal for farmers.\nA number\
    \ of mobile applications, use forecast information and measurements both from\
    \ ofﬁcial\nweather stations, along with data provided by amateur stations, respectively.\n\
    However, in order for the aforementioned applications to reach their full potential,\
    \ a number of\ninitiatives and standards must be enforced in the future within\
    \ crowd-sourcing platforms, so as to\nensure open participation, implement data\
    \ quality policies, along with privacy and security issues\nwith respect to storing\
    \ and utilizing the crowd-sourced information. In addition, care should be\ntaken\
    \ about the identities of the contributors, whereas easy-to-use interfaces have\
    \ to be provided,\ndue to the fact that the Information Communication Technology\
    \ (ICT) skills of the contributors may\nsigniﬁcantly vary in the process. One\
    \ may identify different criteria for the crowd-sourcing initiative\nto be appealing\
    \ and sustainable in a mass scale in the ﬁeld. Among others, good participatory\n\
    user interfaces, service and information salience provided to farmers, as well\
    \ as the provision of\nreliable services are considered absolutely necessary for\
    \ the advance of this initiative. In addition,\ncare should be taken about the\
    \ credibility of the provided information to the farmers or the agricultural\n\
    stakeholders, together with appropriate data quality policies, yet to be deﬁned\
    \ at least at the European\nlevel. As a ﬁnal thought, sustainability is quite\
    \ dependent on both the contextual information feedback\nfrom a farmer’s perspective\
    \ and the community’s to which the farmer may or may not belong to.\n5. Discussion\
    \ and Conclusions\nIn this smart agriculture survey paper we attempted to brieﬂy\
    \ report on the basic steps and\nmethods of indicative solutions that span across\
    \ different disciplines and research areas, and as a result\ncover quite diverse\
    \ research directions. From the above analysis and presentation it should have\n\
    been obvious by now that most presented methodologies and scenarios are based\
    \ on both traditional,\nwell-established computer science algorithms and techniques,\
    \ that are currently being adapted to\nwork on the newly acquired agricultural\
    \ data, as well as innovative, new aspects, enabled by modern\ntechnologies, such\
    \ as drones and satellites, whose usage and exploitation were not available until\
    \ the\nvery recent years. Thus, the overall conclusion drawn may be summarized\
    \ in the following quotation:\nWhen dealing with intelligent agricultural information\
    \ and data, computing applications and systems,\nresearchers should in principle\
    \ initially target more ﬂexible and rather generic approaches and then\ntry to\
    \ identify additional but inherent sources of meaningful information to boost\
    \ and enhance their\nﬁndings in a qualitative manner. Since smart agriculture\
    \ is now becoming widely accepted to have\nmany forms and depictions, the era\
    \ of extremely focused and domain-speciﬁc applications and systems\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n19 of 23\nis considered to be quite over. By integrating the\
    \ herein brieﬂy presented works and by providing\na short discussion and interpretation\
    \ for each identiﬁed group, we deem and, at the same time,\nanticipate that the\
    \ herein instigated classiﬁcation will be used by both fellow academics and people\n\
    involved in almost all steps of the agricultural production chain towards a bouquet\
    \ of meaningful\nresearch directions.\nWithin this review work we presented several\
    \ studies, focusing on intelligent agricultural\ninformation handling methodologies,\
    \ for improving and/or gaining insight into a multitude of\ndifferent tasks within\
    \ the agricultural domain. We organized the aforementioned studies into three\n\
    major categories, namely data sources and collection, machine learning methodologies\
    \ for agricultural\ndata, and ﬁnally, intelligent knowledge acquisition. We believe\
    \ that the economic importance of\nagricultural industry worldwide demands the\
    \ development of innovative methodologies for precision\nand optimal farming.\
    \ Irrespectively of the geographical region at hand, the harvest varies from year\n\
    to year due to soil conditions, disease, pests, climate and variation in yield\
    \ management practices.\nThese factors make the production of high quality produce\
    \ a rather challenging task. Still, traditional\nand innovative computational\
    \ methodologies, such as image analysis, remote monitoring and Machine\nLearning\
    \ have the potential to provide an inexpensive, non-destructive way of capturing\
    \ precise\ninformation about the crop. From the analysis of the herein included\
    \ research works it is rather evident\nthat the particular problems identiﬁed\
    \ within most agricultural learning applications are focused on\nthe speciﬁc models\
    \ and frameworks employed, the sources, the actual nature and pre-processing of\n\
    data used, and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics deployed\
    \ for each research\nwork. Agricultural monitoring provide data and knowledge\
    \ for deep learning and other existing\npopular computational techniques, in respect\
    \ to differences in classiﬁcation or regression performance.\nConsidering the\
    \ impact and applicability of Machine Learning, our motivation was to identify\
    \ the main\nrecent trends within this particular application domain, in order\
    \ to facilitate a better understanding of\nthe speciﬁc ﬁeld for future studies.\n\
    Overall, a clear trend is to be identiﬁed and this may be summarized into the\
    \ active utilization of\nMachine Learning methodologies for a multitude of agricultural\
    \ tasks. Our future plans include the\nexamination of innovative areas of smart\
    \ agriculture in narrower, yet trending, application domains,\nlike speciﬁc popular\
    \ social networks (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.), so as to be able to monitor\
    \ evolving\ntrends in agricultural data utilization and identify potential new\
    \ emerging data models in the process.\nClearly, it is not possible to tackle\
    \ all aspects of modern agricultural-related computing in a single paper\nnor\
    \ discuss all expressions in the process and consequently several open remaining\
    \ issues are to be\nidentiﬁed by the experienced reader as food for thoughts.\
    \ The latter should also take into account not\nonly the researchers’, but also\
    \ the developers’ point of view on the matter. Developers are encouraged\nto take\
    \ this survey’s observations into account, but at the same time they would need\
    \ to do so without\nsacriﬁcing the required usability or without increasing the\
    \ related computational complexity of their\napplications in the process. All\
    \ these remarks are considered to be crucial for enabling sufﬁcient\nand innovative\
    \ agricultural information distribution in wide-area, real-life deployments, both\
    \ within\ncurrent and future informatics’ applications, system and scientiﬁc research.\n\

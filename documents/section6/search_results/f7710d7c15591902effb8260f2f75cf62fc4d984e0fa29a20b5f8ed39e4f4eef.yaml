    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\

    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    \ internet of things, monitoring and control \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nDue to rising\
    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nplant and schedule water\
    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\
    \ that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a \n\
    result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control\
    \ mechanisms and their relevance to \ngreenhouses and irrigation. \nThis study\
    \ aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and\
    \ bridge them with future trends \nto identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses\
    \ research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation \nmethods used\
    \ by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring\
    \ and controlling \nstrategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing\
    \ the integration of artificial intelligence. The last \nchapter discusses future\
    \ directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. \n2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY \nThe\
    \ methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent\
    \ farming focuses on the topic \nof intelligent irrigation systems and their control\
    \ systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of \nmultidisciplinary\
    \ journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well\
    \ as online \nengineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique\
    \ produces many research articles relevant to \nintelligent farming and irrigation\
    \ systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is\
    \ essential \nto check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using\
    \ the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR \nwebsites. This review's selection\
    \ of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven\
    \ years \n(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a\
    \ surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in\
    \ SCOPUS indexed \njournals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b,\
    \ which shows the percentage of articles indexed by \nSCOPUS with articles with\
    \ Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally\
    \ \nrecognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming,\
    \ intelligent irrigation system, and \nprecision agriculture. Articles are carefully\
    \ selected by reading and summarizing them to ensure continuity of ideas.  \n\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nthrough the General Packet\
    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\
    Decision Support System \nWater management for irrigation requires extensive and\

    \ -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nmake irrigation management decisions; this is\
    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n5.2 \nFuzzy Logic Model \nA fuzzy logic\
    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \ncomputations, and output\
    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\

    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

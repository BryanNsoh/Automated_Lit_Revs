    19 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The entire world is moving towards the era
    of smart technology. Internet of Things (IoT) is the key factor behind this revolutionary
    change. IoT converts real-world objects into interactive smart systems which can
    be controlled from remote locations. These physical real-world objects tagged
    as ‘Things’ in IoT should have a unique identity. These ‘things’ can be remotely
    controlled and monitored from anywhere in the world through Internet. Due to this
    feature it has been applied in various domains like home automation, patient health
    monitoring, agricultural sector, environment surveillance and so on. Due to the
    increased use of IoT-based system, there arises a need for a well-defined software
    architecture. Though various IoT developers follow their own design strategies
    for IoT architecture, there is a need for domain specific architecture for IoT
    applications. The authors propose a software architecture pattern selection model
    which can be followed in designing IoT systems. Non-functional requirements such
    as scalability, availability, reliability, security and heterogeneity determine
    the decision making of the proposed model. Analytical results prove that this
    model can be used as a reference model, for IoT developers in choosing a suitable
    software architecture pattern for their IoT system. 1 Introduction Internet of
    Things (IoT) is an emerging field which can play a vital role in almost all fields
    and disciplines including agriculture, health sector, home automation, aviation,
    transport, defence and military applications. IoT is an inter-networked collection
    of various physical things embedded with network connectivity, software, actuators
    and sensors for data collection and data processing [1]. IoT converts real-world
    objects into interactive smart systems which can be controlled from remote locations.
    These physical real-world objects tagged as ‘Things’ in IoT should have a unique
    identity [2]. Things are usually interconnected using a wireless communication
    mode. Actuators and sensors use various sorts of connections like wireless fidelity,
    near-field communication, radio frequency identification, Bluetooth, ZigBee and
    even use wide area connectivity like GSM, 3G, LTE and so on [1]. The typical IoT
    architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is simply a networked set of devices
    and software embedded components. The embedded system may consist of a mini processor
    or boards which has some processing capability, for example, Raspberry PI [3],
    Arduino [4], Intel Galileo [5] and so on. IPv6 addressing is used, though it can
    address up to millions of device. There will be some application domain where
    the central things or sensors are deployed for monitoring and controlling. It
    will sense the relevant information and will pass towards some cyber physical
    system which performs the computation and coordination. Every component is networked
    for data communication. Based on the provided instructions or feedback, the actuators
    will initiate the necessary actions to be performed. Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Typical architecture of IoT Though software plays a critical role in
    IoT system, there arises a need for a well-defined software architecture. The
    software architecture of a program or software system consists of various components
    (modules) in that system, externally visible properties of those components and
    the inter-relationship between those components [6]. Software architectures are
    described in terms of components, connectors and configurations. Architectural
    components describe the computations and state of a system; connectors describe
    the rules of interaction among the components; configurations define topologies
    of components and connectors. Architectural design is the process of defining
    a set of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the
    framework for the development of a computer system [7]. Requirements of the software
    should be transformed into an architecture that describes the software''s top-level
    structure and identifies its components. This is accomplished using architectural
    design and pattern selection. It is not feasible to follow all the traditional
    software architectural patterns for IoT application development. The traditional
    software pattern selection primarily depends on functional requirements. However,
    in case of IoT systems much priority is given to non-functional requirements.
    So the existing pattern selection tools or models may not be applicable for IoT
    domain. Existing pattern selection tools and their limitations in applying IoT
    domain are discussed in related works section. Though these tools are good in
    recording, documenting and making architectural decisions, they are not successfully
    evaluated in IoT perspective. Still there exist some gap between architectural
    pattern selection for generic software and that for IoT system. The possible solution
    is to select the architectural patterns based on some empirical evaluation or
    by analysing real-time IoT projects. Our research focuses to resolve the following
    queries: Q1: How important is architectural pattern selection in IoT system design?
    Q2: How can we choose the best architectural pattern for an IoT system? Q3: How
    can we select an architectural pattern when system has heterogeneous nature? We
    propose an architectural pattern selection model to resolve the above said queries
    based on some real-time case studies on IoT systems. The performance evaluation
    and results are discussed. This paper includes six sections as follows: Section
    2 reviews the related works about various existing software architecture pattern
    selection models; Section 3 illustrates the necessity of an IoT architecture pattern
    selection model. It also provides an overview regarding software architectural
    styles and patterns which can be applied in IoT based system; Sections 4 and 5
    discuss about the case study and its experimental evaluation using real-time IoT
    systems and finally we summarise our conclusions. 2 Related works Janson and Bosch
    [8] presented a new perspective which views software architecture as a set of
    explicit design decisions. They presented Archium model which portrays the mapping
    between design decisions and software architecture. Márquez and Astudillo proposed
    [9] a model called COMPACT for selecting components using some architectural tactics.
    From the non-functional requirements, the proposed model follows some tactics
    to search and identify the suitable components for design. They have deployed
    this model in health-care centre. The real-time evaluation pointed out that COMPACT
    is not using any criteria to select the software components. Márquez and Astudillo
    [10] addressed this challenge by proposing a new model for selecting the software
    components from business scenarios. This work describes the necessity of building
    a bridge between software architecture and system requirements. They created a
    semantic recommendation system, which will generate component assemblies from
    business scenarios. Their work offers a solution for assembling software components.
    It also tries to find relationships among various components and thereby help
    the software architects in decision making. Capilla et al. [11] proposed a web-based
    tool, which is capable of recording and managing architectural design decisions.
    That tool will assist various stakeholders to upload architectural patterns and
    styles in a repository. The decision-making process provides facility to the user
    to select the design pattern and style which is applicable for their domain. This
    tool fails to address design decisions based on quality attributes. Jansen et
    al. [12] developed a tool for making architectural decisions. This system documents
    the architectural decisions in semi-automatic manner and shares it with all the
    stakeholders. They have used Archium tool for the implementation and evaluation
    phase. Similar to Capilla''s model [11], this too fails to address the architectural
    pattern selection based on quality attributes. Nocera [13] proposed a fuzzy ontology
    based web framework for supporting architectural design. It proposes a framework
    to represent the relationship between non-functional requirements and software
    design patterns. This system provides the minimal subset of patterns applicable
    for the given sample of non-functional requirements. Most of the existing work
    focuses on documenting and storing of architectural discussions using some tools.
    Some use the concept of fuzzy logic during the software development. But none
    addresses the pattern selection methodology for IoT-based systems. In this scenario,
    our proposed model can assist the project manager to choose the suitable architectural
    pattern for their project by considering the non-functional requirements. Most
    of the IoT-based systems use different software architecture patterns based on
    various communication protocols, hardware components and central processing device
    that are used in the system. The tradeoff in design is between performance and
    uniform interoperable protocol design. Uniformity in protocols decreases the system
    performance in some application domains. Scalability is also a big challenge for
    the designers. Scalability is the ability of a system to expand its capacity and
    boundaries whenever needed without affecting the underlying base architecture
    and capabilities. We analyse the various software architectural patterns for IoT
    based on parameters like availability, scalability, reliability, interoperability,
    performance, security, privacy and ease of use. We replicated various small-scale
    IoT projects in same domain to validate the above-mentioned parameters and to
    study the pros and cons of each model. 3 Software patterns for IoT systems IoT
    differs from other web applications and embedded system applications due to the
    following characteristics: Integrated system with hardware, software, sensors,
    connectors and gateways. Live data stream analytics with complex event processing.
    Support for data volume and velocity. Visualisation of big data. Cloud services
    and computing. Various interoperable communication protocols. Due to the above
    said characteristics, it is not an easy task for the IoT architects to derive
    a suitable architectural pattern for IoT-based systems. Factors to be considered
    in IoT design are listed below. Dynamic environment: We cannot follow the design
    principles of software applications working in a defined environment though it
    deals with the integrated working of various sensors and device controlled by
    some application software. Complexity: Though IoT system operates on multiple
    device and communication protocols, there is a large set of use cases which makes
    the architectural design complex. Scalability: It is not an easy task to design
    a scalable architecture though most IoT-based systems are dynamic and there will
    be a need to expand the system boundaries and capabilities at any time. Reliability:
    Due to the inter-processing and intercommunicating device, the system reliability
    is to be considered while designing the architecture. Security: Subsystems and
    components may be managed by third parties which may lead to privacy and security
    issues. Integration of hardware and software: Though IoT system uses much hardware,
    it is necessary to define a scheme which will integrate the required hardware
    and software. We analyse the following software architectural patterns and styles
    [14, 15] that can be applied for designing IoT-based software systems. Our aim
    includes: Developing a reference model to choose suitable architectural patterns
    or styles for each IoT application. Identifying the alternate architectural patterns
    that can be followed in designing an IoT application. Analysing the capabilities
    and features of each available IoT architectural patterns. Listing out the parameters
    or metrics to be considered while choosing a suitable architectural pattern. 3.1
    Client–server architecture Client–server architecture [16] is a typical software
    architectural model followed in web-based software. Here the client always initiates
    the communication with the server system by sending a request and suitable response
    is provided by the server. In this scenario, the server should be always active
    and the client should be aware of the server network address. A server can act
    as a client to any other servers based on various tiered architectures. In an
    IoT system, server can be central storage or processing system and clients are
    various mobile device or monitoring or sensing device used in the IoT environment.
    A typical client–server architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. In an IoT-based
    system, we can follow two variants of this client–server model: centralised cloud
    model and centralised hierarchical model. Fig. 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Client–server architecture model In centralised cloud model there will be a central
    server usually a cloud system which is connected to various clients with user
    interfaces. Clients can be either mobile device or device used in IoT environment
    for data sensing or monitoring. Each IoT environment may deploy with a subset
    of various cloud-based model to provide improved scalability and availability.
    In centralised hierarchical model, there will be central nodal server which is
    connected to a set of IoT devices and is also a client for another set IoT-based
    system. This pattern is specifically applicable for intercommunication between
    various IoT-based systems in a wide environment such as weather monitoring in
    a region, forest fire detection, air pollution monitoring and so on. Though all
    the clients are communicating with the centralised cloud server, server load will
    be more in centralised cloud model system. Increased workload of the server results
    in decreased performance and scalability. If the central server cannot withstand
    the incoming client requests, there will be a chance of server crashing which
    may further lead to the entire system failure. This disadvantage can be resolved
    by using a centralised hierarchical model. Centralised model uses various interconnected
    clusters of client–server architecture. Suitable load balancing algorithms [17]
    can be followed for uniformly distributing the client requests among clusters.
    Improved performance, scalability and availability are the pros of using hierarchical
    model in designing IoT systems. Another challenge for the designers is to integrate
    the different communication protocols used in various subsystems. Device and cloud
    storage may use different protocol hierarchy. This mismatch of protocols is to
    be resolved by choosing some interoperable protocol models. 3.2 Peer-to-peer architecture
    Peer-to-peer is a variant of client–server architecture [16] where every system
    has equal priority. Each system can act as either client or server at instances
    based on the service they demanded for. This model is widely applicable in IoT
    domains like smart irrigation projects in agricultural sector, militrary applications
    and so on. Here the sensors are deployed in every subsystem and they sense the
    data and will process the data by itself. Each subsystem may be equipped with
    some low-powered device with minimum processing capability. This data can be sent
    to other neighbourhood systems whenever it is needed. So single system can act
    as both client and server. Typical peer-to-peer architecture is illustrated in
    Fig. 3. In this model, all peers use same communication protocol. This might not
    be feasible in all scenarios since various IoT devices provide various range of
    functionalities. This similarity constraint of peers makes this model much better
    in terms of scalability and performance aspects. Fig. 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Peer-to-peer architecture model 3.3 Publisher–subscriber architecture
    This can be considered as one of the most unexplored architectural styles used
    in an IoT-based system. It consists of three categories of communication systems
    such as publisher, subscriber and a broker. Publisher: Sources of data and send
    data to brokers. Consumer: Subscribe to the topics managed by brokers. Broker:
    Receives data for a topic from a publisher and sends data to all the subscribed
    consumers. In this model, the publisher publishes the data to a broker. The consumers
    who all are interested in receiving this published data will register with central
    broker. The broker provides the published data to the needed consumers based on
    priority schedulers. This applicable IoT domains of this model include traffic
    alert system for drivers in highways, intrusion detection in a sensitive area,
    health monitoring applications and so on. This model can be applied whenever we
    require a model in which the receiver of some sensed data is a limited population.
    Here the consumer is interested only in receiving the data of their interest regardless
    of the source of data. The publish–subscribe style is illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig.
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Publisher–subscriber architecture model Though
    the data is provided only to the subscribed authenticated receivers, security
    and privacy of data can be maintained in this system. The disadvantage of this
    model is that the producer will never get a feedback message from consumer. Thus,
    producer cannot ensure whether the required actions are performed or not. For
    instance, consider a home automation system integrated with an android app of
    the house owner. The house owner provides command to the home automation system
    to ‘power off’ through his user interface. The home automation central system
    may act as the broker and may send signal to the actuator to power off. The actuator
    may perform the action but does not provide the feedback of the actions performed
    to the house owner. This is a challenge for the designer to use this architectural
    model in IoT-based system. Another challenge in this scenario is the bandwidth
    and latency of producer and consumer should be almost unique. Otherwise there
    is a chance of occurring request flooding. This can be resolved by using a variant
    of publish–subscribe model called push–pull architecture as shown in Fig. 5. Fig.
    5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Push–pull architecture In this variant the
    publisher pushes the data to a queue. The consumers will pull out the subscribed
    information from the queue. The challenge in publish–subscribe IoT model is the
    difficulty in addressing various individual devices and subsystems used in IoT
    environment. 3.4 Representational state transfer (REST) architecture REST architecture
    is a software pattern similar to client–server architecture. Here the various
    device components use a uniform interface, thereby improve the interoperability
    of IoT system. The tradeoff is between interoperability and system performance
    though the data is to be transformed to the various forms based on communication
    protocols rather than end-user needs. A typical REST model [1] is illustrated
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint REST architecture It designs
    web APIs based on system resources and how they are addressed or transferred.
    It uses request–response communication model. The interface constraints between
    client and server must possess uniformity. Each resource is identified with uniform
    resource identifier and separated from resource representations. Resource representation
    holds information about deleting or updating resources along with appropriate
    messages. It can be used for IoT application that runs on private intranet or
    even bigger public Internet-based networks. Reusability of sensors and actuators
    is one of the advantages of this architectural style. The uniform interface improves
    interoperability which may result in decreased system performance. Though these
    are the widely used architectural patterns for IoT-based systems, it is possible
    to use repository architecture (black board style), layered architecture, pipe
    and filter patterns and so on in particular domain-specific IoT systems. 4 Proposed
    architectural pattern selection model Though there are various software patterns
    available, still designers are incapable of choosing right pattern for the right
    system. In order to address this ambiguity we propose an architectural pattern
    selection model. This model can be used as a reference model for IoT system developers
    while choosing the architecture pattern which well suits for their requirements.
    The model is derived by considering the following IoT architectural design constraints
    listed below. Scalability: Scalability is the ability of a system to expand its
    capacity and boundaries whenever needed without affecting the underlying base
    architecture and capabilities. Availability: It can be defined as the ratio of
    time in which a system is available for functioning to the total time it is supposed
    to be functioned. Reliability: It is the ability of a system to consistently provide
    the expected outcome to the intended user. It can be defined as the probability
    at which the system provides the functionality accurately and precisely. Its value
    ranges between 0 and 1. Interoperability: The capability of a system and subsystems
    to work together without flaws regardless of the protocol or methods used. Security:
    Ensuring whether the system is vulnerable to various security threats like unauthorised
    access, hacking, misuse or manipulating data and so on. Privacy: Ensuring the
    data which is collected or sensed is transmitted only to the authorised person
    or subsystems. Performance: It can be described using various factors like capacity,
    utilisation of resources and response time. Our proposed model forces the software
    architect to tradeoff between interoperability and security. It is practically
    a difficult task to design an IoT system of heterogeneous nature with high security.
    So if the designer''s choice is to design an interoperable system, the decision
    tree shown in Fig. 7 can be used as reference model; else if the choice is for
    security, follow the model illustrated in Fig. 8. The pseudocode regarding the
    work flow of our pattern selector is provided below. Fig. 7 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Selection model based on interoperability Fig. 8 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Selection model for secure IoT systems 4.1 Pseudocode for pattern selection
    See Fig. 9. Fig. 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Pseudocode for pattern selection
    4.2 Interoperability-based pattern selection (IBPS) One of the critical challenges
    in designing IoT-based system is incorporating the interoperability feature. The
    IBPS is illustrated in Fig. 7. Software architect should first point out whether
    the proposed system consists of homogeneous or heterogeneous things [18]. Most
    of the IoT systems are heterogeneous, though it uses different class of devices,
    networks and communication protocols which can be implemented using typical client–server
    pattern. The con of client–server pattern is less availability which can be resolved
    by following a REST architecture. In case of homogenous things with similar features,
    scalability and availability may be the major concern for the architect. In this
    scenario, peer-to-peer pattern provides better availability and can be easily
    scalable. Publish–subscribe is not a good choice in terms of performance aspects
    but works well when security plays a vital role. 4.2 Security-based pattern selection
    (SBPS) SBPS is shown in Fig. 8. Security of data is a major concern in critical
    IoT applications like military, industrial automation, health monitoring and so
    on. Though the data is transferred between various communication objects, sensors
    and actuators, there is a possibility for the intruder to manipulate or steal
    the data. Preventive measures should be done in the root level itself by providing
    a secure and stable software architecture pattern. Publish–subscribe architecture
    is the best choice for highly secure devices with more privacy. Client–server
    architecture ensures security. But privacy cannot be guaranteed always though
    it is more vulnerable to attacks. The pattern selection decision tree for privacy
    concerns (upper sub-tree) is illustrated in Fig. 8. The next major expectation
    from most of the real-time IoT projects deal with performance aspects. The sensors
    or data collectors may fetch the data and will send or update to some remote server
    or a central controller. The performance in this scenario mainly depends on the
    hardware capabilities, bandwidth used for data transfer, state of the things (moving
    or stationary) and so on. An efficient system should be always available whenever
    the client initiates a request and should be capable of responding to the client
    request in minimal time. In this scenario, peer-to-peer architecture plays a crucial
    role. Though every connected system acts as both client and server at a time,
    the load for each system is comparatively less and is capable of providing load
    balancing mechanisms [17, 19] to improve performance. REST architecture suits
    well for low-powered device with limited performance capabilities. It is lightweight
    and is capable of providing quick response for client requests. The decision tree
    (lower sub-tree) for selecting architecture pattern based on performance is shown
    in Fig. 8. 5 Case study and experimental analysis We have evaluated the capabilities
    and performance of various architectural styles based on the parameters discussed
    in Section 4. These are considered as the various constraints that can be used
    for determining the suitable software architecture scheme to be used in an IoT-based
    system. The execution of our architectural pattern selector based on the pseudocode
    is shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Pattern suggestion
    based on user input For experimental validation of our model, we replicated various
    versions of IoT-based smart farm irrigation systems based on the above-mentioned
    architectural patterns. IoT can perform an appreciable task by deploying sensors
    in the fields to monitor various factors like water level, temperature level,
    humidity level, soil PH values, fertiliser content in soil and so on, and hence
    monitoring and controlling the various farming phases. Ram et al. [20] proposed
    an IoT system for regulating water in the agricultural fields. Nagothu [21] proposed
    an automatic field watering system using ARM processor. Agrawal and Singhal [22]
    proposed a water dripping scheme that will inject water directly to the root base
    of a plant. Based on the above-listed projects, we executed a case study using
    various software architectural patterns as mentioned below. We replicated above
    systems [23] using Raspberry PI and Arduino boards along with soil moisture sensors
    for our experimental analysis. Different architectural patterns are used for the
    same scenario. The experimental evaluation is performed for all patterns and detailed
    analytics are discussed in our blog [23]. Though security is not a major concern
    in case of smart agriculture, we evaluated the performance aspects of these systems
    by considering the various parameters like availability, reliability, scalability
    and interoperability. Reliability ‘R’ of the system is calculated using (1) Availability
    ‘A’ of the system is calculated using (2) We evaluated all the four systems for
    a period of 24 h to measure the system availability and reliability. The measured
    values are rounded up to the nearest integer as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Estimated
    reliability and availability for architectural patterns Architectural pattern
    MTBF, h MTTR, h R A client–server 23 0.3 0.95 96.50% peer-to-peer 23.8 0.1 0.98
    99.17% publish–subscribe 22.5 0.8 0.91 91.46% REST 22.8 0.3 0.97 97.64% R, reliability;
    A, availability. Scalability is measured by following load scalability. We evaluated
    the system by performing vertical scaling. We add the load of the central coordinator
    by adding more sensors and actuators. Though we make every node as processing
    element in peer-to-peer architecture, we can measure the performance tuning versus
    hardware scalability. It is much better to add more processing nodes instead of
    increasing the capability and capacity of a single node. It can be computed using
    Amdahl''s law (3) where P is the number of processing nodes; α is the fraction
    of computation that is sequential; 1−α is the fraction of computation that can
    be parallelised. The computed scalability metrics based on performance tuning
    for the various case study models are illustrated in Table 2. Experimental discussion
    is provided in the blog [23]. Table 2. Estimated performance tuning of architectural
    patterns Architectural pattern Number of processing nodes SCF (α) Speed client-server
    2 0.2 1.66 peer-to-peer 4 0.1 3.07 publish–subscribe 1 0.6 1 REST 1 0.5 1 SCF,
    sequential computation fraction. Interoperability concerns how well the discrete
    system components work together. Ducq et al. proposed a quantitative metric model
    [23] for measuring interoperability but is not widely accepted. Still interoperability
    is a sort of qualitative metric. We evaluated the interoperability of various
    architectural patterns by retrieving opinions from software architects and academicians
    works in IoT fields. Based on their experience and knowledge they used to rate
    the interoperability capability of each architectural pattern in a point scale
    of 1 to 5. Point 1 shows less interoperability and it slightly increases for each
    point, where point 5 shows strong interoperable capability. We also requested
    the experts to rate the ease of design for each architectural pattern. We estimated
    the average rating for each architectural pattern based on expert feedback and
    is shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Interoperability
    versus ease of design for architectural patterns Security and privacy can be ensured
    by providing authentication and authorisation in each layer of publish–subscribe
    architectural style. Asymmetric public key cryptography in device level and pretty
    good privacy (PGP) can be considered as a method of creating secure sockets layer
    (SSL) sessions between device and applications. Device management policies like
    usage of device identity, device registration, secure key registration and so
    on can be followed along with end–end encryption in storage and transmission of
    data. Based on the system architectural analysis [23], we derived the following
    characteristics as shown in Table 3 for each architectural pattern. The evaluation
    results are illustrated in Fig. 12. A software architect can map his various system
    requirements or constraints with the various parameters considered in Table 3.
    Based on the constraint cases, they can choose an architectural design which is
    much suitable and relevant for their IoT-based system. Different architectural
    patterns are applicable for different IoT use cases. It will be much effective
    if the architect chooses a pattern in such a manner that it can be reusable for
    similar use case classes. Table 3. Comparison of architectural styles based on

    architectural patterns Thus, our experimental evaluation confirms the validity
    of proposed architectural pattern selection scheme. By considering the IoT system
    requirements and applicability the system architect should tradeoff between the
    non-functional parameters. Though the existing models failed to address the IoT
    pattern selection methodologies, our decision model can be a reference model for
    the IoT architects. This model will suggest an architectural pattern for heterogeneous
    as well as for secure IoT systems. Our experimental analysis proves the importance
    of choosing the right software architecture pattern. If we fail to choose the
    appropriate pattern, it will result in low performance or even system failure.
    6 Conclusions IoT made a drastic change in the entire world and has made much
    impact in man''s day-to-day life activities. Everything that we see in our real
    world is made smarter by using suitable sensors and actuators with a central controlling
    system. Though this IoT-based system design is in its early stage of advancements,
    there is lack of proper architectural pattern selection models that can be applied
    to IoT systems. Our work suggests some commonly used software architectural styles
    and patterns that can be integrated with the IoT-based system so that the resultant
    system will perform with improved efficiency, scalability, heterogeneity, availability
    and interoperability. We propose an architectural pattern selection model for
    the designers to easily choose the architecture for their need. This model will
    suggest an architectural pattern for heterogeneous as well as for secure IoT systems.
    Our experimental analysis proves the importance of choosing the right software
    architecture pattern. If we fail to choose the appropriate pattern, it will result
    in low performance or even system failure. The future work may incorporate various
    hybrid lightweight architectural models that can be implemented in IoT systems
    with power constraints and mobility. The inclusion of prediction models for architectural
    patterns selection is also under consideration. 7 References Citing Literature

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\
    \ 8.\nTable 2. Common wireless nodes used in the agriculture domain.\nSr #\nWN1\n\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\

    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\

    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Digital twin can
    be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled through data
    and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling,
    and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics
    solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management
    tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to
    reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications.
    Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system,
    avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital
    twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical
    intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary
    systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary
    modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies
    and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling
    perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges
    and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various
    stakeholders. A working digital twin of an offshore oil platform. Screenshot from

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    rise in the population has immensely increased the pressure on the agriculture
    sector. With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from
    conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization
    of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource
    optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations
    across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative
    projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry
    is racing to provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide sufficient
    scope to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve the activities
    in the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability of
    the devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are also
    opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards the

    term ‘Agriculture’ is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’
    means ‘Cultivation’. It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one
    of the benchmark areas. This field is the withstander of the economies of various
    nations. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), more than 60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival
    and around 12% of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted
    by FAO, the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year
    2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of
    this data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of
    70% in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is
    also the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based
    fertilizers, biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations,
    the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution
    in the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been

    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4

    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7

    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,

    \ 3 August 2017\nAbstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in agriculture\
    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\
    \ farm ﬁeld-based Internet of Things (IoT) and provided by a solar cell battery\n\
    charger: (a) Agriculture sensor node with related sensor and solar cell, (b) Sink\
    \ and actuator nodes,\nand (c) Gateway node and cloud computing.\n4. Agriculture\
    \ Requirements for IoT\nThe IoT represents the visibility of a group of systems,\
    \ technologies, platforms, and design\nprinciples for joining things, depending\

    \ the\nquality of yields, reduce the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence\
    \ of plant-eating pests or\nplant diseases, alert farmers about farm ﬁres [141],\
    \ and increase the proﬁtability of several agricultural\nproduction schemes. Agriculture\

    \ 3, Part B). The use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number of\n\

    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    Intelligence (AI) have been employed in agriculture over a long \nperiod of time,\
    \ alongside other advanced computing technologies. \nHowever, increased attention\
    \ is currently being paid to the use of \nsuch smart technologies. Agriculture\
    \ has provided an important \nsource of food for human beings over many thousands\
    \ of years, \nincluding the development of appropriate farming methods for \n\
    different types of crops. The emergence of new advanced IoT \ntechnologies has\
    \ the potential to monitor the agricultural \nenvironment to ensure high-quality\
    \ products. However, there \nremains a lack of research and development in relation\
    \ to Smart \nSustainable Agriculture (SSA), accompanied by complex \nobstacles\
    \ arising from the fragmentation of agricultural \nprocesses, i.e. the control\
    \ and operation of IoT/AI machines; data \nsharing and management; interoperability;\
    \ and large amounts of \ndata analysis and storage. This study firstly, explores\
    \ existing \nIoT/AI technologies adopted for SSA and secondly, identifies \nIoT/AI\
    \ technical architecture capable of underpinning the \ndevelopment of SSA platforms.\
    \ As well as contributing to the \ncurrent body of knowledge, this research reviews\
    \ research and \ndevelopment within SSA and provides an IoT/AI architecture to\

    \ Smart Sustainable \nAgriculture solutions \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture\
    \ forms a critical activity vital to the survival of \nhumanity for approximately\
    \ many thousands of years [1].This \nrelationship has resulted in the advancement\
    \ of agricultural \nactivities, initially through the time-consuming methods of\
    \ \ntraditional agriculture [2]. The current recent rapid increase in \nin the\
    \ global population (predicted to rise to 8.9 billion by \n2050) has now led to\
    \ an urgent need to balance demand and \nsupply through the use of new technologies\
    \ [3] to increase food \nproduction [4, 5]. This development places pressure on\
    \ natural \nresources, with agriculture now consuming 70% of the world‟s \nfresh\
    \ water supply for the purposes of irrigation. Limited \nresources and the impact\
    \ of climate change will therefore lead \nto considerable challenges in producing\
    \ sufficient high quality \nfood to support the population [6]. Smart Agricultural\
    \ is a \nglobal initiative to preserve resources and maintain sustainable \nagriculture\
    \ [7]. Recently, researchers have adopted the Internet \nof Things (IoT) [8, 9],\
    \ with a number of studies emphasizing \nthe adoption and implementation of IoT\
    \ in agriculture, \nfarming, and irrigation [10]. Around the globe, many private\
    \ \ncompanies and organizations are now focusing on investigating \nnew technologies\
    \ to create a smarter agriculture environment. \nThese include mechanical and\
    \ economic aspects, engineering, \nfood retailers and computing. However, agricultural\
    \ processes \nare fragmented, resulting in a number of issues, i.e. difficulties\
    \ \nin operating and managing smart machines, data sharing and \nmanagement, data\
    \ analysis and storage [11, 12]. It is therefore \nimportant to facilitate cooperation\
    \ when developing standards \nfor smart agriculture, while also enhancing interoperability\
    \ \namong different stakeholders, systems and technologies [13]. \nThe use of\
    \ IoT and AI technologies has the potential to \nresult in a positive transformation\
    \ of traditional agriculture [3], \nincluding: (a) improved use of data collected\
    \ from smart \nagriculture sensors; (b) managing and governing the internal \n\
    processes within the smart agriculture environment (including \nthe management\
    \ of the harvesting and storage of crops); (c) \nwaste reduction and cost saving;\
    \ (d) increasing business \nefficiency by means of automating traditional processes;\
    \ and \n(e) improving the quality and volume of products [14]. A major \nchallenge\
    \ is to provide farmers with the required information in \na rapid manner [15].\
    \ AI therefore has significant potential to \naddress the urgent challenges faced\
    \ by traditional agriculture. \nThere has, over previous decades, been considerable\
    \ research \nand application of AI, including in: (a) smart agriculture; (b) \n\
    robotics; (c) agricultural optimization management; (d) \nautomation; (e) agricultural\
    \ expert systems; (f) agricultural \nknowledge-based systems; and (g) decision\
    \ support systems \n[16]. \nThere remains a lack of research and development in\
    \ \nrelation to Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA), accompanied \nby complex\
    \ obstacles arising from the fragmentation of \nagricultural processes, i.e. the\
    \ control and operation of IoT/AI \nmachines; data sharing and management; interoperability;\
    \ and \nlarge amounts of generated data analysis and storage. \nTherefore, this\
    \ study firstly, explores existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies adopted for SSA and secondly,\
    \ establishes an \nIoT/AI technical architecture to underpin SSA platforms, in\
    \ \norder to tackle fragmentation in traditional agriculture \nprocesses and enrich\
    \ the research and development of future \nsmart agriculture worldwide via establishment\
    \ of a Smart, \nSustainable Agriculture platform as a solution. \nThere now follows\
    \ an outline of the methodology \nunderpinning this research, supported by related\
    \ work \nhighlighting the history of smart agriculture, smart and \nadvanced computing\
    \ technologies and examples of IoT/AI \ntechnologies in current agricultural practices.\

    \ \nby an in-depth discussion of Smart Agriculture and IoT/AI \nSSA technical\
    \ architecture, along with the most significant \noutcomes from this study. The\
    \ paper finishes with concluding \nremarks and plans for future work. \nII. BACKGROUND\
    \ \nDue to the lack of literature concerning the development of \nIoT frameworks\
    \ for SSA, this study focuses on: (a) the history \nof smart agriculture, its\
    \ potential and challenges; (b) smart and \nadvanced computing technologies; and\
    \ (c) existing smart, \nsustainable agricultural frameworks. \nA. Smart Sustainable\
    \ Agriculture \nThere has recently been considerable research into SSA, \nemploying\
    \ various different terms, including Precision \nFarming, Smart Irrigation and\
    \ Smart Greenhouse. This paper \ncommences with an examination of these concepts\
    \ to \ndetermine the definition of SSA used in this study. \nPrecision Farming\
    \ refers to a method of managing farms \nand conserving resources through the\
    \ use of IoT and \nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT). It \nobtains\
    \ real-time data concerning the condition of farm \nelements, (i.e. crops, soil\
    \ and air) to protect the environment \nwhile ensuring profits and sustainability\
    \ [15]. Smart Irrigation \nis a method of improving the efficiency of irrigation\
    \ processes \nand reducing water losses, while conserving existing water \nresources\
    \ using IoT-based smart irrigation systems [16]. \nDrones are employed in many\
    \ agricultural applications, \nincluding monitoring field crops and livestock,\
    \ and scanning \nlarge areas, while sensors on the ground collect a huge range\
    \ of \ninformation [13]. Smart greenhouses promote the cultivation of \ncrops\
    \ with the least degree of human intervention possible, \nthrough use of continuously\
    \ monitored climatic conditions (i.e. \nhumidity, \ntemperature, luminosity \n\
    and \nsoil \nmoisture), \ntriggering automated actions based on the evaluated\
    \ changes \nand implementing corrective action to maintain the most \nbeneficial\
    \ conditions for growth [17]. \nFarm Management Systems (FMS) can assist farmers\
    \ with \na variety of collected information, by managing and controlling \nvarious\
    \ \ntracking \ndevices \nand \nsensors. \nThe \ncollected \ninformation is analysed\
    \ for the undertaking of complex \ndecision-making tasks before being placed in\
    \ a storage \nmedium. This enables the use of the most effective agricultural\
    \ \ndata analysis practices [18]. Soil Monitoring Systems help to \ntrack and\
    \ improve the quality of soil through the monitoring of \nits physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological properties. Livestock \nmonitoring systems provide real-time\
    \ assessment of the \nproductivity, health and welfare of livestock, to promote\
    \ the \nhealth of animals [19]. The IoT/AI SSA platform Cloud offers \nreal-time\
    \ information to farmers to facilitate decision-making \nand reduce operational\
    \ costs, while at the same time enhancing \nproductivity. Following a review of\
    \ a considerable amount of \nresearch, we define SSA as the utilization process\
    \ of IoT/AI \ntechnologies to establish, monitor, manage, process and \nanalyse\
    \ data generated from various agricultural resources, \nsuch as field, crops,\
    \ livestock and others to ensure the \nsustainability and quality of agricultural\
    \ products and further \nenrich decision-making taken by stakeholders. \nB. Smart\
    \ and Advanced Computing Technologies \nThis section provides an overview of appropriate\
    \ \ntechnologies \nunderpinning \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nsmart, \nsustainable\
    \ agriculture platforms, including: IoT; Big Data \nAnalytics (BDA); Cloud Computing\
    \ (CC); Mobile Computing \n(MC); and Artificial Intelligence (AI): \n1) Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT): IoT is a technology aimed at \nconnecting all intelligent objects\
    \ within a single network, i.e. \nthe Internet. It involves all kinds of computer\
    \ technologies, \nboth (a) hardware (i.e. intelligent boards and sensors) and\
    \ \n(b) software (i.e. advanced operating systems and AI \nalgorithms). Its primary\
    \ target is the establishment of \napplications for devices, in order to enable\
    \ the monitoring and \ncontrol of a specific domain. It has been widely adopted\
    \ in \nmany areas, i.e. industrial business processes; home machines; \nhealth\
    \ applications; and smart homes and cities. IoT \nconnectivity encompasses people,\
    \ machines, tools and \nlocations, aiming to achieve different intelligent functions\
    \ from \ndata sharing and information exchange [17]. However, it is \nprimarily\
    \ used in agriculture for management of agricultural \nproducts \nwithin \ngathered\
    \ \nreal-time \ndata, \nalongside: \n(1) searching; (2) tracking; (3) monitoring;\
    \ (4) control; (5) \nmanaging; (6) evaluating; and (7) operations within a supply\
    \ \nchain [1, 9]. \n2) Big Data Analytics (BDA): BDA refers to the large \nvolume\
    \ of data gathered from different datasets sources over a \nlong period of time,\
    \ i.e. sensor, Internet and business data. The \ndatasets used in this technology\
    \ surpass the computational and \nanalytical capabilities of typical software\
    \ applications and \nstandard database infrastructure. Its primary task is to\
    \ capture, \nstore, analyze and search for data, as well as seeking to identify\
    \ \nconcealed patterns in the gathered data. Thus, BDA involved \nthe utilization\
    \ of: (a) tools, (i.e. classification and clustering); \n(b) techniques, (i.e.\
    \ data mining, machine learning and \nstatistical analysis); and (c) technologies\
    \ (i.e. Hadoop and \nspark). These go beyond traditional data analytical approaches,\
    \ \nbeing employed to extract beneficial knowledge from a \nconsiderable amount\
    \ of data, in order to facilitate timely and \naccurate decision–making [17].\
    \ However, the use of BDA in \nagriculture focusses on management of the supply\
    \ chain of \nagricultural products, in order to enhance decision-making and \n\
    minimize the cost of production cost. It is also employed for \nthe analysis of\
    \ the properties of different types of soil for \nclassification and further enhancement.\
    \ Furthermore, it is \nuseful for the improved prediction and production of crops.\
    \ \n3) Cloud Computing (CC): CC has is a recent and rapidly \ngrowing phenomenon\
    \ within IT [18]. The Cloud is not \nrestricted to a particular business domain,\
    \ but has been \nimplemented to underpin and support various software \napplications\
    \ and platforms [19]. It offers easy access to the \nCloud provider‟s high-performance\
    \ and storage infrastructure \nover the Internet, with one of its main benefits\
    \ being to conceal \nfrom users the complexity of IT infrastructure management\
    \ \n[20] [21]. NIST [22] defined CC as “a model for enabling \nconvenient, on-demand\
    \ network access to a shared pool of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n95 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nconfigurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers,\
    \ \nstorage, applications and services) that can be rapidly \nprovisioned and\
    \ released with minimal management effort or \nservice provider interaction”.\
    \ The Cloud can be seen as high \nvirtualization method for datacenter infrastructure\
    \ distributed \nover a wide geographical area, linked by means of high \nbandwidth\
    \ network cables providing a variety of virtualized \nservices. These include\
    \ entire infrastructures, as well as small \nsoftware applications and different\
    \ types of services, i.e. high-\nperformance computing and large scalable storage\
    \ services \nbased on a pay-per-use model. CC can be divided into four \nmain\
    \ layers: (1) hardware; (2) infrastructure; (3) platform; and \n(4) application\
    \ [23]. The delivery of Cloud services can \ngenerally be divided into three different\
    \ models: (1) \nInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS); (2) Platform-as-a-Service\
    \ \n(PaaS); and (3) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) [24, 25]. CC is \nconsidered\
    \ the most effective method of storing agricultural \ndata, along with IoT [1].\
    \ \n4) Mobile Computing (MC): MC refers to infrastructure in \nwhich data processing\
    \ and data storage take place externally to \nthe mobile device [26]. MC applications\
    \ transfer computing \npower, processing and data storage from mobile devices\
    \ in the \nCloud [27, 28]. MC has had a considerable impact on modern \ndaily\
    \ life, due to the availability and low cost of purchasing and \ncommunication.\
    \ It is now widely used in every field, including \nthe agricultural sector [29],\
    \ in which MC systems collect and \nsend daily data to farmers, informing them\
    \ of both the \nproduction status and weather conditions [29]. It is crucial to\
    \ \nuse automatic Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) efficient \ntraceability\
    \ systems to store and access data on electronic data \nchips in a more rapid\
    \ and accurate manner. It has been \nprimarily applied to the logistics of industrial\
    \ products, for the \npurposes of identification and to check delivery processes\
    \ [30]. \n5) Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI has been employed in \nsmart systems\
    \ over a long period of time[31], being the science \nof creating intelligent\
    \ machines to facilitate everyday life [32]. \nAI covers many areas, including\
    \ computer vision, data mining, \ndeep learning, image processing and neural networks\
    \ [16, 33]. \nAI technologies are now emerging to assist and improve \nefficiency\
    \ and tackle many of the challenges facing the \nagricultural industry, including\
    \ soil health, crop yield and \nherbicide-resistance. According to Sennaar [34],\
    \ agricultural \nAI Cloud applications fall into three main categories, as \n\
    discussed below. \na) Robots: these are developed and programmed to \nhandle fundamental\
    \ agricultural tasks (i.e. harvesting crops) \nmore rapidly and with a higher\
    \ capacity than human workers. \nExamples of robotic applications include: (a)\
    \ See and Spray \n(i.e. a weed control robot) and (b) Harvest CROO (i.e. a crop\
    \ \nharvesting robot). Agricultural robots have the potential to \nbecome valuable\
    \ AI applications, i.e. milking robots. \nb) Monitoring Crop and Soil: this employs\
    \ computer \nvision and deep-learning algorithms for processing captured \ndata\
    \ by sensors monitoring crop and soil health, i.e. the PEAT \nmachine for diagnosing\
    \ pests and soil defects, based on deep \nlearning application known as Plantix\
    \ that identifies potential \ndefects and nutrient deficiencies in the soil. A\
    \ further example \nis Trace Genomics, a machine learning based service for \n\
    diagnosing soil defects and providing soil analysis services to \nfarmers. This\
    \ uses machine learning to provide farmers with a \nsense of both the strengths\
    \ and weaknesses of their soil, with \nthe emphasis being on the prevention of\
    \ poor crops and \noptimizing the potential for healthy crop production. A \n\
    SkySquirrel technology is an example of the use of drones and \ncomputer vision\
    \ for crop analysis. \nc) Predictive Analytics: This analysis captured data, \n\
    based on machine learning models capable of tracking and \npredicting various\
    \ environmental impacts on crop harvest, i.e. \nchanges in weather. Examples of\
    \ such AI technologies include \n(a) aWhere (i.e. prediction of weather and crop\
    \ sustainability) \nand (b) Farmshots (i.e. monitoring of crop health and \nsustainability).\
    \ Crop and soil monitoring technologies are \nimportant applications for addressing\
    \ issues related to climate \nchange. IoT/AI technologies (such as drone and satellite)\
    \ that \ngenerate a large amount of data on a daily basis have the \npotential\
    \ to enable agricultural production to forecast changes \nand detect opportunities.\
    \ It is predicted that, over the coming \nyears, IoT and AI applications will\
    \ attract a considerable \ndegree of interest from large industrial agricultural\
    \ enterprises \n[34]. \nThe benefits and advantages of the agricultural use of\
    \ IoT \nare as follows: (a) efficiency of input; (b) cost reduction; \n(c) profitability;\
    \ (d) sustainability; (e) food safety and \nenvironmental protection [35]. However,\
    \ Ferrández-Pastor, et \nal. [36] considered SSA to contain a number of barriers\
    \ \npotentially hindering its adoption: (a) initial expectations and \nadvantages\
    \ remaining unfulfilled; (b) complexity of technology \nand incompatibility of\
    \ components; (c) a lack of products; and \n(d) the high cost involved in the\
    \ establishment and \nmaintenance of such facilities. To ensure the adoption and\
    \ \nimprovement of smart technologies in the agriculture sector, it \nis vital\
    \ for farmers to be trained and given up-to-date \nknowledge of IoT/AI technologies.\
    \ Furthermore, it is crucial to \ntest and validate IoT/AI applications, due to\
    \ the high risk \ninvolved in the adoption of these technologies in a critical\
    \ \nsector, along with the influence of environmental factors. \nC. Examples of\
    \ IoT/AI Technologies in Current Agriculture \nPractices \nThere are many types\
    \ of IoT and AI sensors and \napplications in current agricultural studies and\
    \ development. \nTable 1 provides an overview of the most commonly employed \n\
    IoT/AI platforms/technologies found in smart agriculture. \nD. Examples of an\
    \ Existing AI/IoT Research in Smart \nAgriculture \nThere are a number of specific\
    \ challenges that need to be \nconsidered before investing in smart agriculture,\
    \ primarily \nthose falling into the following categories: (1) hardware; \n(2)\
    \ data analysis; (3) maintenance; (4) mobility; and \n(5) infrastructure [56].\
    \ Nonetheless, there are many research \nefforts in the field of IoT/AI to support\
    \ the creation and \nestablishment of SSA, as shown in Table 2. \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ \nTABLE II. \nIOT/AI RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SMART SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE\
    \ \nResearcher/s \nYear \nSummary \nRay [57] \n2017 \nThe researchers undertook\
    \ a review of various potential IoT applications, including the specific issues\
    \ and challenges associated \nwith IoT deployment to improve farming. They comprehensively\
    \ analyzed the specific requirements the devices and wireless \ncommunication\
    \ technologies associated with agricultural IoT applications. They presented different\
    \ case studies to explore existing \nIoT based solutions operated by various organizations\
    \ and individuals, followed by categorizing them based on their deployment \n\
    parameters. Furthermore, they identified a number of factors for the improvement\
    \ and future road map of work using IoT. \nMekala and \nViswanathan [58] \n2017\
    \ \nThe researchers surveyed a number of conventional applications of Agricultural\
    \ IoT Sensor Monitoring Network technologies \nutilizing CC. Their study aimed\
    \ at understanding the diverse technologies to build smart, sustainable agriculture.\
    \ They addressed a \nsimple IoT agriculture model with a wireless network. \n\
    Kamilaris, et al. \n[59] \n2017 \nThe researchers reviewed work in agriculture\
    \ employing the practice of big data analysis to solve various different problems.\
    \ \nTheir review emphasized the opportunities provided by big data analysis for\
    \ the development of smarter agriculture, the availability of \nhardware and software,\
    \ as well as the techniques and methods for big data analysis. \nRajeswari, et\
    \ al. \n[29] \n2017 \nThe researchers investigated a number of different features,\
    \ i.e. humidity, temperature sensing, server-based remote monitoring \nsystem\
    \ detection and soil moisture sensing. They used sensor networks to measure temperature,\
    \ moisture and humidity in place of \nmanual checking. They deployed several sensors\
    \ in different locations within farms, using a single controller. Their major\
    \ objective \nwas to collect real-time data of the agriculture production environment\
    \ to establish an easy access agricultural advice, in order to \nidentify weather\
    \ or crops patterns. \nAntonacci, et al. \n[5] \n2018 \nThe researchers attempted\
    \ to provide nanotechnology-based (bio) sensors to support farmers in delivering\
    \ an analysis that is \naccurate, fast, cost-effective, and useful in the field\
    \ to identify water and soil nutrients/pesticides, soil humidity, and plant pathogens.\
    \ \nCadavid, et al. \n[60] \n2018 \nThe researchers proposed an extension to a\
    \ popular open-source IoT platform, known as „Thingsboard‟. This formed the core\
    \ of a \nCloud-based Smart Farming platform and deliberate sensors, a decision\
    \ support system, and a configuration of remotely autonomous \nand controlled\
    \ machines (e.g. water dispensers, rovers or drones). \nSoto-Romero, et \nal.\
    \ [61] \n2019 \nThe researchers designed an easily insertable cylindrical sensor\
    \ with internal electronics to offer a low power electronic \narchitecture to\
    \ measure and communicate wirelessly with a LoRa, Sigfox network or mobile phones.\
    \ \nNóbrega, et al. \n[62] \n2019 \nThe researchers reviewed the proposed stack\
    \ and details of the recent developments within smart agriculture, focusing on\
    \ \nIoT/Machine-2-Machine interaction. They described the design and deployment\
    \ of a gateway addressing the requirements of the \nSheepIT service, evaluating\
    \ this gateway using real scenarios in terms of performance, thus demonstrating\
    \ its feasibility and \nscalability. \nIII. METHODOLOGY \nAs well as undertaking\
    \ the literature review, the current \nresearcher enhanced this study by informally\
    \ interviewing \nexperienced farmers. The study aims to establish an IoT/AI \n\
    SSA architecture, as well as exploring the potential of the use \nof IoT and AI\
    \ as a backbone to establish an SSA platform. A \nreview was employed to identify,\
    \ analyze and study key books, \njournals, reports, and white papers, in order\
    \ to achieve the \nabove-noted aim. The lack of existing studies in this area\
    \ \nensures that this current research also contributes to the body of \nknowledge\
    \ by establishing an IoT/AI framework for the \nadoption of smart technologies,\
    \ in order to establish smart \nsustainable \nagricultural \npractices. \nFig.\
    \ \n1 \nshows \nthe \nmethodology adopted for this study. \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\
    \ \nBased on the research aim outlined in the Methodology, \nthis section is divided\
    \ into (A) Domains of Smart Sustainable \nagricultural model; (B) B. Proposed\
    \ IOT/AI SSA platform as a \nsolution; and (C) Proposed IoT/AI technical architecture\
    \ for \nSSA platform. \nA. Domains of Smart Sustainable Agricultural Model \n\
    The results from the literature review revealed that several \ndomains need to\
    \ be considered when adopting the smart \nagricultural model. Fig. 2 demonstrates\
    \ the interrelation and \ncomplexity of data flow between different Smart, Sustainable\
    \ \nAgriculture domains. \n \nFig. 1. IoT/SSA Research Methodology. \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 10, No. 5, 2019 \n98 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n \nFig. 2. Chaotic\
    \ Data Flow and Interrelation of SSA Domains. \nThese domains are discussed individually,\
    \ as follows: \n Human resources: This refers to people, policies and \npractices\
    \ within the agricultural environment, which are \nas important as in any other\
    \ domain, as are weather and \ntechnology. Human resources receive careful attention,\
    \ \ndue to their significant impact on production, as well as \nfinancial and\
    \ marketing decisions. Whatever its size, an \nagricultural concern requires effective\
    \ human resources \nmanagement and planning, including hiring and \nkeeping employees\
    \ who are engaged, high-performing \nand effective communicators. Providing up-to-date\
    \ \nknowledge potentially opens the means to adopt smart \ntechnologies in an\
    \ agricultural environment. \n Crops: This refers to a plant that can be grown\
    \ and \nharvested extensively for subsistence or profit: (1) food \ncrops (i.e.\
    \ for human consumption); (2) feed crops (i.e. \nfor livestock consumption); (3)\
    \ fibre crops (i.e. for \ncordage and textiles); and (4) oil crops (i.e. for \n\
    consumption or industrial uses). \n Weather: This plays a major role in determining\
    \ the \nsuccess of agricultural processes. Most field crops and \nlivestock are\
    \ solely dependent on climactic conditions \nto provide life-sustaining water\
    \ and energy. Adverse \nweather can cause losses in agricultural products, \n\
    particularly during critical stages of growth. The \nelements of weather (solar\
    \ radiation, temperature, \nprecipitation, humidity and wind) influence the \n\
    physiology and production of agricultural plants and \nanimals. Severe weather\
    \ (i.e. tornadoes, drought, \nflooding, hail and wind storms) can cause considerable\
    \ \ndamage and destruction to fields and livestock. \n Soil: This forms a critical\
    \ aspect of successful \nagriculture, being the source of nutrients used to grow\
    \ \ncrops, which are subsequently passed into plants and \nthen to humans and\
    \ animals. Healthy soils produce \nhealthy and rich food supplies; however the\
    \ health of \nsoil tends to decline over time, forcing farmers to move \nto new\
    \ fields. Soil health depends on regional \nconditions and climates, with soil\
    \ nutrients more likely \nto deteriorate in dry climates, particularly if irrigated,\
    \ \nwhich, if not managed carefully, can result in \nsalinization, i.e. a build-up\
    \ in the level of salts and \nchemicals contained in water. Healthy and rich soil\
    \ can \nbe achieved through the use of IoT sensors to monitor \nits chemical status,\
    \ using specific sensors (e.g. moisture \nsensors), whose data readings are transferred\
    \ to the data \nmanagement and analysis layer for analysis, assisting \ndecisions\
    \ concerning the need for fertilizer. \n Pests: These consist of any living creature\
    \ that is \ninvasive, or damaging to crops, livestock or human \nstructures. Pests\
    \ often occur in high quantities, to the \ndetriment of agricultural products.\
    \ It is vital to control \nand monitor these creatures by means of IoT/AI \ntechnologies,\
    \ to avoid serious diseases, including \nplague and malaria, as well as plant\
    \ and livestock \ndiseases. \n Fertilization: Soils naturally contain many nutrients,\
    \ \ni.e. nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium and potassium. \nCrops are unable to function\
    \ effectively and produce \nhigh quality food when their nutrient level is low.\
    \ The \nnatural levels of nutrients in the soil need to be \nenhanced by the addition\
    \ of nutrients once crops have \nbeen harvested. Fertilizers have been used since\
    \ the \nbeginning of agriculture, but it is now recognized that \ntheir extensive\
    \ use can, if not correctly controlled, harm \nthe environment. Therefore, farmers\
    \ use IoT sensors to \nread and test soil samples for baseline testing to enable\
    \ \nthem to add fertilizers using correct and appropriate \nmeasurements. Fertilization\
    \ is an important method of \nmaintaining \nsustainable \nagricultural \nproduction\
    \ \nsystems. \n Agricultural Products: These are derived from \ncultivating crops\
    \ or livestock to sustain or enhance \nhuman life. Human beings also use a wide\
    \ collection of \nagricultural products on a daily basis, i.e. food and \nclothing.\
    \ Agricultural products fall into the following \ngroups: (a) grains; (b) foods;\
    \ (c) fuels; (d) fibres; \n(e) livestock; and (f) raw materials. Food is the most\
    \ \nextensively produced agricultural product. \n Irrigation/Water: Water demand\
    \ in agriculture is now \nrising globally and particularly in Mediterranean \n\
    countries, increasing the pressure to preserve available \nfreshwater resources.\
    \ Smart, sustainable agriculture \nprocesses should therefore focus on new and\
    \ efficient \ntechniques to improve agricultural productivity, which \npromote\
    \ considerable savings in terms of food \nconsumption and wasted water. \n Livestock:\
    \ These are animals raised in a domesticated \nagricultural environment, for the\
    \ purposes of labour and \nto produce commodities such as eggs, meat, milk, fur,\
    \ \nwool and leather. Animal husbandry is a component of \ncurrent agriculture\
    \ and refers to the breeding, \nmaintenance and slaughter of livestock. \n Machines:\
    \ Agricultural equipment is any kind of \nmachinery used to assist with farming.\
    \ Such machines \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n99 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \ncan be light or heavy, i.e. tractors. Modern farm \nmachinery is seen as the\
    \ important driver for increased \nagricultural \nsustainability, \nefficiency\
    \ \nand \ncompetitiveness. Smart technologies can reduce the \nimpact of farming\
    \ practices within global agriculture. \nThe current development of agricultural\
    \ machinery \naddresses environmental challenges, while increasing \nproductivity\
    \ and bringing economic benefits. These \nsmart agricultural machines should be:\
    \ (a) fast, \naccurate, versatile and intelligent; (b) produce less CO2 \nemissions\
    \ and (c) make use of bioenergy. \n Fields: This refers to an area of land used\
    \ for \nagricultural purposes, i.e. crops, cultivation or for \nlivestock. Many\
    \ fields have borders composed of a strip \nof bushes used to provide both food\
    \ and cover, in order \nto ensure the survival of wildlife. Monitoring field \n\
    activities using IoT devices can have a significantly \npositive impact on controlling\
    \ objects within the field. \nB. Proposed IOT/AI SSA Platform as a Solution \n\
    This platform would prove a valuable medium to facilitate \ndata flow and sharing\
    \ among SSA domains. Many researchers \nhave developed IoT architectures, but\
    \ their efforts have tended \nto target specific areas of IoT/AI, i.e. sensors\
    \ or weather \nmonitoring systems [58, 60, 61]. This current paper is \nproposing\
    \ a holistic IoT/AI platform to cover all areas within a \nSSA environment, performing\
    \ the following tasks: (a) manage \nand govern data flow between SSA domains;\
    \ (b) facilitate the \nintegration of the different components of SSA architecture;\
    \ \n(c) tackle interoperability issues caused by the utilization of \ndifferent\
    \ tools and software; (d) provide easy-to-use interfaces \nfor interaction; (e)\
    \ provide an ability to generate reports based \non real-time data and keep it\
    \ updated; (f) store generated data \nin sustainable storage place (i.e. the Cloud),\
    \ to enable it to \npermanently recorded for future reuse; (g) isolate different\
    \ \nlayers to improve the development process in the future; and \n(h) the platform\
    \ should consist of several nodes, so that, in the \ncase of any failure, other\
    \ nodes can keep the system up and \nrunning. Fig. 3 shows how the SSA-IoT/AI\
    \ platform would be \nused at the center of the SSA domain to facilitate business\
    \ \nprocess and data flow and to share within a smart, sustainable \nagricultural\
    \ environment. \n \nFig. 3. Proposed SSA-IoT/AI Platform. \nC. Proposed IoT/AI\
    \ Technical Architecture for SSA Platform \nFig. 4 shows the overall AI/IoT technical\
    \ architecture for \nSSA. It consists of two main components: (a) the first \n\
    component: SSA Layers and AI/IoT technologies; and (b) the \nsecond component:\
    \ data lifecycle within SSA architecture and \ndata process location. In order\
    \ to provide additional detail \nconcerning the framework, the following description\
    \ gives \nfurther details about each component: \n1) The First component: Smart\
    \ Sustainable Agriculture \n(SSA) layers and (SSA) AI/IoT technologies \nThe first\
    \ component of smart, sustainable agriculture \n(SSA), AI/IOT framework, consists\
    \ of the following layers: \n(a) Physical Hardware and Storage layer; (b) AI and\
    \ Data \nManagement layer, and Governance layer; (c) Network layer; \n(d) Security\
    \ layer; (e) Application layer; (f) IoT and sensing \nlayer; and (g) SSA domain\
    \ layer. Fig. 4 demonstrates the \nfollowing description of each layer, highlighting\
    \ its primary \nrole: \n Physical hardware and Storage layer: This layer \nconsists\
    \ of powerful hardware to host virtualized \nmachines, as well as dedicated traditional\
    \ storage \nmedium, cloud storage solutions or hybrid storage \nsolutions. It\
    \ contains the supporting hardware for IoT \ndevices that exist in Internet of\
    \ Thins and Sensing layer. \n Artificial Intelligence and Data Management Layer:\
    \ \nThis layer is responsible for managing processes and \ncontrolling the business\
    \ logic, focussing on three main \nactivities: (i) data analysis and processing,\
    \ using data \nmining and intelligence statistical analysis on generated \ndata;\
    \ (ii) data classification and transformation, using \nontologies, and machine\
    \ learning to classify and \ntransform analysed data; and (iii) data interpretation,\
    \ \nrepresenting the transformed data into knowledge to \nmake machines smarter.\
    \ \n Network Layer: This layer contains all the different \ntypes of network\
    \ connections exist, with this cloud \nconsisting \nof \nwired \nor \nwireless\
    \ \nnetwork \nconnections/devices. It is important that this layer uses \nthe\
    \ latest networking technologies to keep up with the \nmost recent developments\
    \ in other sectors. Its main job \nis to facilitate the transaction of all data\
    \ to and from \ndifferent \nlayers \nwithin \nthe \narchitecture. \nThe \ntechnologies\
    \ of IoT in this layer include Internet, WIFI \nand GSM/CMDA. It is responsible\
    \ for data accessibility \nand availability throughout other layers. Further,\
    \ it \nmanages data and its flow within between all layers. \n Security Layer:\
    \ This layer is responsible for data \nsecurity transferred among different layers\
    \ and should \nbe the means of addressing any security concerns and \nvulnerabilities\
    \ within all other IoT/SSA layers, i.e. \nmalware, spyware and viruses. It should\
    \ employ up-to-\ndate security solutions and AI algorithms to block and \nquarantine\
    \ any threat to the platform. \n Applications Layers: This layer gathers different\
    \ \napplications related to smart sustainable agriculture. It \nis built based\
    \ on AI and data management layers. Many \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n100 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nsmart, sustainable agricultural applications could be\
    \ \ndeveloped and integrated into this layer, i.e. crop \nmonitoring \napplications\
    \ \nand \ndrone-controlled \napplications. This layer focuses on the supervision\
    \ \naspect of the data flow and migration between all layers \nand can provide\
    \ an authorized institution with full or \npartial governance on data migration,\
    \ transactions and \naccess. \n Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensing Layer: This\
    \ \nforms the first interaction layer with SSA domains. It \nuses and hosts various\
    \ types of IoT devices (e.g. \nsensors), capable of collecting data from real-world\
    \ \nobjects, sharing it to provide real-time data. Many \nsensors in the Cloud\
    \ are hosted and integrated within \nthis layer, i.e. humidity sensors, moisture\
    \ sensors and \nweather monitoring systems. Furthermore, this layer is \nresponsible\
    \ for operating robotic and drone actuators to \nassist in the mobility of intelligent\
    \ machines within the \nagricultural area. It thus allows intelligent machines\
    \ to \nmove between locations, in order to cover a wide area. \n SSA Domain Layer:\
    \ This layer hosts various different \nSmart Sustainable Architectural domains\
    \ and forms the \nmain source for data generated from various \nagricultural domains,\
    \ including: fields; machines; \nhuman resources; and crops. It forms the basis\
    \ for \nIOT/AI SSA platforms, as it contains various raw data \nformats without\
    \ interference. \n2) The Second component: data lifecycle within SSA \nArchitecture\
    \ and its process location: \nFig. 5 demonstrates that data lifecycle remains\
    \ in line with \nSSA Architecture layers. This commences with the original \n\
    data source, i.e. SSA domain layers. The acquisition and \ncapturing of data is\
    \ undertaken at the layer containing sensors \nand actuators. These captured data\
    \ are then passed to the \napplication layer for business logic and control, following\
    \ \nwhich, the data must be checked for security issues before \nmoving to data\
    \ analysis and processing. This is followed by \ndata classification and transformation\
    \ of the analyzed and \nprocessed data before it moves to data interpretation\
    \ and the \nresulting building decisions. The final stage is to store the data\
    \ \nfor future retrieval. \nThere are two locations for sharing and processing\
    \ of \ngenerated data. Firstly, on-site. Here, the generated data is \nmore likely\
    \ to be shared and processed within the location of \nthe agricultural field,\
    \ covering the four architecture layers: \n(1) SSA; (2) the domain layer; (3)\
    \ the IoT layer; and (4) the \napplication layer. Secondly, off-site: here the\
    \ sharing and \nprocessing of the generated data must be outsourced to the \n\
    physical location „data centre‟, in which data is processed and \nanalyzed away\
    \ from the field. It can cover the four architecture \nlayers: (1) network; (2)\
    \ AI and data management; (3) physical; \nand (4) storage. It is also important\
    \ to highlight that the \nSecurity layer forms a common layer between on-site\
    \ and off-\nsite processing locations. \n \nFig. 4. Overall AI/IoT Platform Technical\
    \ Architecture for SSA. \n \nFig. 5. IoT/AI Data Lifecycle. \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nV. CONCLUSION \nThis paper has established\
    \ the importance of employing \nrecent and advanced computing technologies in\
    \ the agricultural \nsector, in particularly AI and IoT. Agriculture is considered\
    \ \ncentral to the survival of human beings. Supporting the current \npractices\
    \ of traditional agriculture with recent IoT/AI \ntechnologies can improve the\
    \ performance, quality and volume \nof production. This study has reviewed the\
    \ existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies discussed within the main research journals in\
    \ the \narea of agricultural. Furthermore, it categorized the main \ndomains of\
    \ smart, sustainable agriculture, i.e. human resources; \ncrops; weather; soil;\
    \ pests; fertilization; farming products; \nirrigation/water; livestock; machines;\
    \ and fields. The major \ncontribution of this paper concerns the AI/IoT technical\
    \ \narchitecture for SSA, leading to an emphasis on the research \nand development\
    \ of a unified AI/IoT platform for SSA, to \npositively resolve issues resulting\
    \ from the fragmentary nature \nof the agricultural process. Future work will\
    \ include \ninvestigation of the process of implementing AI/IoT \ntechnologies\
    \ for SSA by applying the proposed AI/IoT \ntechnical architecture in the form\
    \ of the prototype of a unified \nplatform on real test cases. This will identify\
    \ the relevant \nstrengthens and weaknesses for further improvement and \nenhancement.\

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has already
    left the state of an idea and has been applied in practical projects. The technical
    and application challenges are enormous since IoT platforms enable complex real-time
    control systems that combine the use of communication infrastructure, hardware,
    software, analytical techniques, and application knowledge combined into multiple
    layers. One of the key technical challenges is to realize the expected IoT impacts
    on systems, as IoT allows them to become service mashups, connecting things as
    services. Consequently, system development will become dynamic plug-and-play interoperable
    service composition, and system logic will become service orchestration. Overall,
    IoT allows solution flexibility to fulfill custom application needs. In the context
    of agriculture, irrigation is a key task to guarantee adequate crop yield by avoiding
    under- and over-watering. Moreover, it is an important cost driver, as the energy
    to transport water and to operate irrigation equipment is costly – in some places,
    even the water itself is costly. Smart irrigation seeks to apply IoT and analytical
    methods to leverage precision irrigation, aiming optimal cost effectiveness to
    the farmer by flowing the water in the proper amount to places where and when
    it is needed. In this article we introduce the concept of a flexible IoT-machine
    learning (ML) platform, wherein IoT and ML components are connected as services
    in an application context, allowing adaptable solutions to fulfill application
    needs. This approach benefits IoT professionals, as they can easily develop and
    deploy complex solutions involving devices, communication, data management, analytics,
    and application elements. In particular, our work on this concept has resulted
    in a platform called SWAMP1 that implements our flexible IoT-ML architecture toward
    the smart irrigation problem. This allows highly customizable soil water management
    solutions, involving flexible connectivity among data, physical models, and ML
    algorithms oriented to solve application key tasks, such as water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. We call this concept flexible data-driven
    soil water management, which in practice allows suitable solutions to a great
    variety of soil, plant, and regional weather characteristics. This approach benefits
    the farmer, as a highly customizable smart irrigation solution may reduce water
    and energy usage and mitigate crop yield risks as it keeps soil water content
    at healthy levels for plants. In the remainder of this article, we compare our
    approach to other practical IoT research projects, provide details on our flexible
    platform applied to precision irrigation, describe our flexible ML approach to
    address precision irrigation tasks, highlight the potential impacts of our approach
    to IoT professionals and farmers, and summarize our main contributions. Related
    Work In recent years, different academic and commercial initiatives have emerged,
    aiming to incorporate IoT and ML into the agriculture. IoF2020 (www.iof2020.eu)2
    and Dragon (www.data-dragon.eu) are two projects funded by the European Union
    for developing IoT platforms for agrifood. IoF2020 is organized into five sectors
    that adopt different solutions: arable crops, dairy, vegetables, fruits, and meat.
    Arable crops use sensors to monitor production and intelligent analysis of images
    to assess crop development. GPS data from cattle neck collars or livestock movements
    monitor dairy chain, and ML is used for early lameness detection. IoT devices
    track the production chain of vegetables, fruits, and meat. Dragon aims to integrate
    IoT data with phenomics, genomics, and metagenomics data associated with ML methods
    to increase production. Other recent academic studies include a platform for precision
    agriculture and experimentation in turmeric cultivation [1]. The platform provides
    a graphical interface for connecting sensors and actuators and uses analytical
    methods to analyze the delay of messages. Another study uses thermal images generated
    by drones and transmitted throughout a cloud-fog system to identify non-uniform
    irrigation zones [2]. Commercial companies are also putting some of these ideas
    into the market. Examples include Agrosmart (www.agrosmart.com.br) in Brazil,
    Agricolus (www.agricolus.com) in Italy, and Cropmetrics (www.cropmetrics.com)
    in the United States. Among other technologies, they use soil sensors, weather
    stations, and weather forecasts for irrigation advising. However, their underlying
    approaches for water need estimation and irrigation optimization and operation
    are not available. Despite the richness of recent approaches adopting IoT in the
    agri-food chain, they do not yet fully explore: (a) the architectural aspects
    to hold flexible solutions involving IoT and ML components and (b) the potential
    of the collected data for a more accurate analysis of water needs. In this article,
    we advocate that data-intensive methods provided by ML algorithms, in combination
    with IoT technologies and weather-soil-atmosphere simulations, can provide a considerable
    impact in precision irrigation and its solution deployment. A Flexible IoT-ML
    Platform for Smart Irrigation The success of next generation systems for precision
    irrigation based on IoT technologies coupled with intelligent ML data processing
    techniques depends on the ability of the solution to adapt to different contexts
    found in farms. A flexible IoT-ML platform must allow different deployment configurations
    of hardware, software, and communication technologies, customized to deal with
    the requirements and constraints of different settings, countries, climate, soils,
    and crops. Here we advocate that an IoT-ML infrastructure for providing smart
    irrigation services be defined by two complementary dimensions, namely core components
    and deployment locations. Core components are a set of software, hardware, and
    communication technologies, such as soil moisture sensor probes, long-range WAN
    (LoRaWAN) [3], Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [4], LoRa Server (www.loraserver.io),
    FIWARE [5], and SEPA [6], as well as specific services for water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. On the other hand, deployment locations
    define where core components can be placed, and how they communicate with each
    other. This generates distinctive configuration scenarios for different deployments.
    Locations follow an IoT computing continuum, composed of things (sensors and actuators),
    mist (field nodes such as radio gateways), fog (farm on-premise computing infrastructure),
    cloud (data storage and processing), and terminal (a smartphone, tablet, or laptop
    where the end user interacts with the application). The five instances of this
    continuum define the end-to-end information path starting with data collected
    by sensors up to commands executed by actuators. The five instances might not
    necessarily be present in all scenarios. Rather, depending on farm characteristics,
    requirements, and constraints, fog or cloud may not be present. This feature provides
    additional flexibility to the IoT-ML platform, as the differences are understood,
    and the platform adapts to the farm and not the opposite. Figure 1 depicts the
    IoT infrastructure for providing smart irrigation services, composed of core components
    and deployment locations. In smart agriculture, each farm has particular objectives
    and characteristics, so different deployment configurations may be used, representing
    instances of the same platform. Figure 1 presents a simpler version of the deployment
    of the IoT-ML platform where locations are thing, mist, cloud, and terminal (i.e.,
    no fog is used). This configuration was chosen for simplicity and a farmer''s
    choice of not hosting anyon-premises infrastructure. Figure 1. IoT-ML platform
    overview and end-to-end data path for a smart irrigation scenario. Show All In
    Fig. 1, the numbers in blue circles represent a simplified sequence of the end-to-end
    data flow through this deployment of the IoT-ML platform. Soil moisture sensors
    send data via LoRaWAN to the gateway installed in the mist node. Particularly
    for the SWAMP Project, we have built a custom-made three-depth soil moisture sensor,
    but also use commercial sensors from Libelium (www.libelium.com) and Meter (www.metergroup.com).
    A weather station also sends data to the mist node via a serial wired interface
    (1). From there, the mist node forwards data via 4G through the Internet directly
    to the cloud (2). Within the cloud, sensor data are treated by the LoRaWAN server
    and sent to the IoT protocol translator (3), such as a FIWARE IoT Agent. Weather
    data goes directly to the IoT protocol translator using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol,
    as well as weather forecasts obtained from an external service. The Translator
    converts the three different types of input data – soil, weather conditions, and
    weather forecast – into the format of the particular IoT underlying platform transmitting
    them to the context broker (4) (e.g., NGSI JSON format for FIWARE Orion). Once
    data arrives at the context broker, it is forwarded to time series storage (5)
    that makes it available for further processing (e.g., FIWARE QuantumLeap using
    CrateDB), where the first part of the end-to-end data flow ends. Here, depending
    on the volume and velocity of data, the time series storage may be replaced by
    a distributed data pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka) connected to a big data processing
    system (e.g., Apache Spark). However, for most smart agriculture scenarios dealing
    with individual farms with hundreds of sensors, time series storage is a lightweight
    solution that provides adequate performance. The water need estimation component
    obtains soil moisture, weather conditions, and weather forecast data from the
    time series storage (6) to generate ideal crop water need estimates. Water need
    estimation is further divided into physical and ML models, further explained in
    the next section. The estimates are in turn used by irrigation planning to generate
    an optimized and real plan that is aware of different physical and financial constraints
    (7). Farmers are shown the irrigation plan via the Farmer App (8) and approve
    or change the irrigation plan that is sent back to irrigation operation (9), which
    controls the irrigation system. From there, irrigation commands follow the way
    back to the mist going through the context broker (10), IoT protocol translator
    (11), and Inter-net/4G (12). Finally, irrigation commands reach sprinklers, pumps,
    and valves (13). Should the fog be present in a different scenario, the end-to-end
    communication would be preserved with small changes, as some components would
    be deployed on-premises in the farm office where the fog node is located, such
    as the LoRaWAN server. This scenario includes the direct operation of the irrigation
    system. In alternative scenarios, the irrigation plan either interacts with existing
    third-party irrigation systems (e.g., Netafim – www.netafim.com – or Focking –
    www.fockink.ind.br) already installed on the farm or even used by farmers to operate
    the irrigation systems manually. These options for interacting with an irrigation
    system are common, and we assume they are generic enough to represent an IoT ecosystem
    for smart irrigation. Flexible Data-Driven Soil Water Management Over the last
    decades, data-driven soil water management has been accomplished using physical
    models3 or triggering soil moisture sensors data4 [7]. However, as IoT enables
    more abundant data, with major spatial and temporal granularity and low latency,
    it increasingly allows the rise of data-driven approaches. Here, a key challenge
    is how to make all analytical techniques (e.g., physical models and ML) available
    to work together in a flexible IoT platform, considering that each crop, type
    of soil, and region may demand a different solution. In this sense, our work aims
    to show the roles that these analytical techniques can play in soil water management,
    and how they can be flexibly assembled together. Our approach is based on two
    main characteristics: Solution flexibility: Modularized components are integrated
    as services in the IoT platform, allowing solution flexibility. Increased ML relevance:
    Analytical solutions can be assembled from traditional physical approaches, and
    modern ML and simulation ones, and even by combining them. Benefits of this approach
    are not only improved irrigation plans, but also self-improved platforms that
    learn from experience. Soil water management is performed in two phases, namely
    water need estimation and irrigation planning. Water Need Estimation The precision
    irrigation problem can be modeled as the soil water balance system at the root
    zone, where the soil water content is the result of the balance between water
    content level and a series of mechanisms that make this level increase or decrease
    (soil water dynamics) [8]. IoT provides the ability to monitor water content levels
    and dynamics, while soil water management systems seek to maintain water content
    in an optimal range [7]. Figure 2 depicts the water need estimation process, divided
    into two key activities: Soil water content and dynamics estimation: This consists
    of estimating soil water content and dynamics through: Direct measurement of soil
    water content, rainfall, irrigation, and so on Physical models of soil water dynamics
    applied over the collected data (weather data mainly) and soil and crop characteristics
    Soil water need forecast: This consists of calculating soil water content forecasts
    and water need forecasts for each moment of a planning horizon, using techniques
    such as simulation and ML algorithms: Simulation is appropriated when working
    with physical models, iteratively applied to simulate future data points [9].
    ML takes advantage of data from multiple time series (soil moisture, soil water
    balance, soil characteristics, and weather data) of direct sensor readings or
    from variables derived out of physical models. Weather forecast data, provided
    by external services, can also be used. Different multivariate forecasting methods
    can be used to handle these multiple time series [10], [11]. Figure 2. Water need
    estimation process. Show All The process depicted in Fig. 2 allows flexibility
    once it allows different components combinations, as they are implemented as services
    in the platform. It is also possible to customize each combination, as they have
    numerous options inside them (i.e., different physical models and ML techniques).
    As an example, the SWAMP project provides two customized analytical solutions
    among all combination possibilities to fit the characteristics and needs of different
    pilots. One of them, called CRITERIA-1D [9], uses physical models and simulation,
    wherein soil water dynamics models (physical models) are the input to soil simulation
    that generates soil water content and water need forecasts. Another solution uses
    direct measurements, physical models, ML, and simulation, wherein the main input
    is direct measurement of soil moisture enriched by an evapotranspiration5 model
    (physical model) [7] as the main soil water balance contributor. ML techniques6,
    such as Panel VAR [10] and RNN-LSTM [11], are used for the processing of soil
    water content and water need forecasts, and simulation to test alternative irrigation
    scenarios. Note that the latter uses Panel VAR and RNN-LSTM, respectively, a traditional
    and a cutting-edge technique for time series, thus highlighting the solution flexibility
    in exploring different ML techniques as they gain relevance. Irrigation Planning
    and Operation The water need estimation models provide what can be called the
    ideal irrigation. There are, however, other aspects that need to be considered
    when conceiving an actual irrigation plan, that is, a plan that can be put in
    place in the farm, which include: Water availability: Water scarcity is a problem
    in various parts of the planet. Water quotas or supply schedules might not allow
    the ideal amount of water to be irrigated in time. If the needed amount of water
    is not available, the irrigation plan should allocate the existing water so that
    the best economic return to the farmer is achieved. Costs of irrigation: Even
    if the water comes from private reservoirs, irrigation is not free. Pumping the
    water to the fields consumes energy, and its cost has an impact on the farmer''s
    bottom line. For example, in certain regions of Brazil, the energy bill can account
    for up to 30 percent of the production cost. A cost-aware plan should avoid irrigation
    when tariffs are higher. Limitation of the irrigation systems: Irrigation methods
    differ in how much of the irrigated water actually reaches the plants: furrow
    irrigation has 60 percent efficiency, while sprinkler irrigation reaches 75 percent
    [12]. Other aspects of the irrigation infrastructure need to be considered when
    planning: maximum pumping capacity of the farm, uniformity of irrigation, and
    soil variability, among others. Figure 3 presents a modular approach that separates
    irrigation planning from operation, completing the data flow shown in Fig. 2.
    There are three main modules: Irrigation planning: Computes the timing and water
    volume of irrigation events that best address the crop needs, while being aware
    of operational constraints and economic interests. Linear and nonlinear programming
    techniques can be used, as well as approximate solutions such as those provided
    by metaheuristics [13]. Irrigation operation: Communicates with the sensors and
    actuators installed in the farms, sending commands and monitoring the operation
    to ensure adherence to the plan. It controls the opening and closing of valves,
    the pressure at pumps, and so on, using the underlying IoT communication infrastructure
    to send commands. The use of standard IoT interfaces and protocols enables on-demand
    addition of sensors and actuators, smoothing the transition toward fully automated
    irrigation. System Model: Computes an updated model of the system behavior as
    far as irrigation is concerned. IoT devices (e.g., soil sensors, water meters)
    in combination with data-driven techniques enable estimating the actual irrigation
    efficiency, and planning accordingly. Figure 3. General data flow between irrigation
    services. Show All Discussion and Lessons Learned Physical Models vs. Machine
    Learning The increasing use of IoT in precision irrigation brings spatial and
    temporal accuracy gain, as sensors can potentially be placed in all manageable
    locations on a farm. Thus, site-specific particularities can easily be considered,
    leveraging the exploration of data-driven approaches. In this context, the question
    of what would be the right combination of techniques to deliver adequate soil
    water management emerges. Do traditional approaches, such as using physical models
    or triggering soil moisture sensors data [7], still take place? Or is this the
    time to avoid physical models and use cutting-edge ML algorithms acting directly
    to data? Our vision is that there is no unique ideal analytical approach for all
    cases, as crops differ significantly in irrigation methods and in crop, soil,
    and regional weather characteristics. More than that, depending on crop culture
    or region, not all data features might be available or cost-effective. However,
    a discussion of the roles traditional and ML approaches can play in effective
    solutions can provide guidelines to discern the most appropriate alternatives
    to each application case. Physical models have been extensively used in irrigation,
    bringing implicit agronomic knowledge, as they connect raw data features to specific
    and relevant features. Nevertheless, there are important limitations, as general
    models involve simplifications that often ignore local particularities, while
    site-specific models work well only regionally, and few models have adequate performance
    levels for different regions. Finally, the few models of general application that
    are flexible enough to address different conditions [7] are often complex and
    require many data features that are difficult to obtain. On the other hand, pure
    ML approaches applied directly to IoT data seem promising, as cutting-edge deep
    learning is capable of capturing implicit knowledge from raw data in many application
    areas, as well as delivering highly customizable results [14]. For this reason,
    we believe that ML approaches will be extensively explored in scientific research
    in the coming years, allowing the emergence of truly cognitive smart irrigation
    systems. As such, our architecture approach, based on core components and deployment
    locations, gives the necessary flexibility not only to build customizable IoT-ML
    solutions, but also to assemble customizable data-driven solutions. For smart
    irrigation, we have shown that it is possible to use various combinations of analytical
    tools, including mixes of physical models, simulation (traditional approaches),
    and ML techniques. As ML gains momentum, existing physical models may lose room
    because ML could implicitly capture from raw data the same information physical
    models provide. Instead, IoT''s continuous growth might enhance the utilization
    of physical models, as they can calculate their outputs with better spatial and
    temporal granularity. Also, IoT tends to promote not only physical models but
    also ML. In summary, a futuristic vision may be that ML is well positioned for
    IoT-based applications. However, although ML seems to have a promising future
    for smart irrigation, we are still at the beginning of its exploration, and we
    need reliable data that now is still generated by physical models or a combination
    of data and ML techniques. All in all, considering the advantages and disadvantages
    of each side, we advocate that current solutions consider using both physical
    models and ML algorithms – physical models serving as feature engineering for
    ML approaches. We believe that physical models can aggregate agronomic knowledge
    that ML algorithms eventually cannot capture yet directly from raw data. Finally,
    as different physical models can potentially capture different aspects of reality,
    we recommend using multiple physical models, even for similar tasks. Then ML will
    hold the task of capturing valuable information from the features provided by
    the physical models to deliver more precise water need estimation. Integrating
    Different Stakeholders The approach taken is the result of a joint and largely
    interdisciplinary effort, and the authors'' ambition is to generate an impact
    on a wide community of stakeholders with the envisioned innovation. On one hand,
    the interoperability at the communication level provided by IoT is a key factor
    to promote a platform culture among not-computer-scientists, as it brings easy
    node deployment, data collection, and inter-researcher interaction. On the other
    hand, only with our flexible architecture approach due to the heterogeneities
    embedded in the agricultural scenario – heterogeneity of devices and simulation
    tools, but also farms and the stakeholders themselves – can the barriers be properly
    handled. Different stakeholders speak their own languages: for example, soil-moisture
    sensor data are numbers for computer scientists, bits for telecommunication professionals,
    voltage signals for electronic engineers, while the end users expect volumetric
    soil moisture values. As the calibration of these sensors is soil-type-dependent,
    geologists, agronomists, and other researchers must take part in the game of this
    context-dependent calibration process. Altogether, the smooth interplay between
    actors with different skills and habits is a key success factor. Each stakeholder
    needs specific and mostly mobile services, with the appropriate human-machine
    interface, if we want to deploy the appropriate level of automation with the man
    in the loop, as required in today''s agriculture. Services need to be organized
    like a chain of tools that mutually exchange information and understand each other
    thanks to a shared information model based on emerging ontologies. This shared
    data model fosters smooth and sustainable innovation because the tool chain may
    easily be extended to provide new capabilities and value propositions, and attract
    new stakeholders. Impacts For IoT Professionals Our approach incorporates the
    ML pipeline into the IoT continuum by using a structure of services deployed as
    containers that exchange messages through the FIWARE NGSI unified data model.
    This scheme impacts IoT platform development and deployment in many aspects: Automation:
    The platform provides a subscribe/notify mechanism for building automated data
    pipelines. Traceability: The storing of meta-data information about the model
    specifications and context of data used in the estimation allows keeping track
    of model forecasts, as well as quality indicators. Pluggability: The integration
    of new or updated models is facilitated by the unified data model, consuming data
    and producing water need estimates in a standard way. Flexibility: The pluggability
    allows IoT professionals to compose different data workflows flexibly by using
    various components. Hybrid environments: The architecture allows the use of different
    ML frameworks to train models, as well as hardcoded physical models. All these
    aspects have been allowing a relatively simple deployment of our platform in all
    SWAMP pilots, each one with its characteristics and different specific goals.
    In Italy, the goal is to use farm data for water management and distribution (i.e.,
    to share data outside the farm to create an even bigger system-of-systems). In
    Spain, the goal is to explore the limits of flexibility and precision in irrigation
    by going into a very fine-grained irrigation system where each sprinkler is an
    IoT node. In Bahia, Brazil, there is a large-scale use case with huge center-pivot
    irrigation systems, where the goal is to decrease operational costs through improved
    situational awareness. Near São Paulo, Brazil, the goal is to improve the quality
    of grapes and wine. For Farmers Currently, in modern farms that rely on physical
    water need estimation models and respect soil variability, farmers are provided
    with irrigation plans for long periods, such as weeks, months, or even the entire
    season. Based on their accumulated experience and daily work in the field, they
    continuously adapt the irrigation plan to avoid crops suffering from water stress.
    In this scenario, the irrigation plan plays the role of an offline longer-term
    forecast that needs to be fitted into the reality of the farm. In a fully automated
    future agriculture scenario, the IoT-based smart irrigation system will precisely
    control every aspect of the use of water, adapting it to shorter-term periods
    according to instantaneous information coming from the field, which can be daily
    or even based on intra-day micro adjustments in the irrigation plan. Between these
    two scenarios – current and future – lies a new IoT-enabled reality that will
    change the way farmers face irrigation. In any case, a requirement is that farmers
    always control the irrigation and are provided a wealth of real-time information
    to be able to make better decisions. To this end, we developed a smartphone app
    (Fig. 4) where farmers are informed of immediate water needs (Fig. 4a), measured
    and forecast water balance time series (Figure 4b), and the current soil moisture
    information for a 3-depth sensor probe (Fig. 4c). With this real-time status of
    the farm at hand, and equipped with the optimized irrigation plans computed by
    the system, the farmer can achieve better use of the water resources without harming
    productivity. Figure 4. Farmer application screenshots. Show All As the system
    reliability and precision increase and earn the trust of farmers, they can slowly
    give more power to the system to make automated decisions. In other words, the
    application will allow farmers to express policies on how to behave whenever a
    new irrigation plan is generated. Conclusion In this article, we present our flexible
    IoT-ML platform and highlight its scientific contribution over related work. The
    platform allows easy solution deployment involving IoT and ML components working
    in an application. Our real case is a smart irrigation application, where we exemplify
    how a solution can be built and customized depending on site-specific needs. Special
    attention was given to how the platform enables more exploration of ML-based solutions
    and on how it can positively impact IoT professionals'' and farmers'' needs. SWAMP
    project pilots have just been deployed; they are operating properly, and data
    is being collected. The next step, expected by the end of 2020, is to analyze
    the data and disseminate quantitative impact results. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

    \ the past years, governments, industries, and researchers have shown increasing\n\
    interest in incorporating smart techniques, including sensor monitoring, real-time\
    \ data transmitting,\nand real-time controlling into water systems. However, the\
    \ design and construction of such a smart\nwater system are still not quite standardized\
    \ for massive applications due to the lack of consensus on\nthe framework. The\
    \ major challenge impeding wide application of the smart water network is the\n\
    unavailability of a systematic framework to guide real-world design and deployment.\
    \ To address this\nchallenge, this review study aims to facilitate more extensive\
    \ adoption of the smart water system, to\nincrease eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency in\
    \ real-world water system contexts. A total of 32 literature pieces\nincluding\
    \ 1 international forum, 17 peer-reviewed papers, 10 reports, and 4 presentations\
    \ that are\ndirectly related to frameworks of smart water system have been reviewed.\
    \ A new and comprehensive\nsmart water framework, including deﬁnition and architecture,\
    \ was proposed in this review paper.\nTwo conceptual metrics (smartness and cyber\
    \ wellness) were deﬁned to evaluate the performance\nof smart water systems. Additionally,\
    \ three pieces of future research suggestions were discussed,\ncalling for broader\
    \ collaboration in the community of researchers, engineers, and industrial and\n\
    governmental sectors to promote smart water system applications.\nKeywords: smart\
    \ water system; framework; smartness; cyber wellness\n1. Introduction\nThe world’s\
    \ urban population has grown rapidly from 1.019 billion in 1960 to 4.117 billion\
    \ in\n2017 [1]. It is estimated that the population will reach 9.7 billion by\
    \ 2050 [2]. The excessive population\ngrowth will cause urgent water problems\
    \ like water shortage and water quality degradation in urban\nareas. In the 21st\
    \ century, the global water sector faces quality and quantity challenges, which\
    \ are\nhighly related to climate change and population growth [3]. The 2018 Global\
    \ Risk Report shows that\nmost of the high risks (high-likelihood and high-impact)\
    \ issues are water-related either directly or\nindirectly and are currently being\
    \ exacerbated by climate change [4]. Water crises have become one of\nthe ﬁve\
    \ most signiﬁcant risks in terms of their societal impacts. Additionally, the\
    \ breaking of economic\ngrowth and unbalanced urbanization can also contribute\
    \ to water shortage [5,6]. It is predicted that\ndue to population and industrial\
    \ growth the percentage of water scarcity will increase by 50% in\ndeveloping\
    \ countries and decrease by 18% in developed countries by 2025 [7]. One upcoming\
    \ water\nscarcity event will occur in Cape Town, where it is supposed to be the\
    \ ﬁrst city to experience day zero\nbut will not be the last if these threats\
    \ still hold [8,9].\nWater 2020, 12, 412; doi:10.3390/w12020412\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/water\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 412\n2 of 25\nHowever, due to the growing complications of water-related\
    \ issues such as water shortage, water\ndeterioration, and aging infrastructure,\
    \ traditional techniques, and management for drinking water\nsupply have gradually\
    \ shown their drawbacks and incapability to address these water issues [10].\n\
    Climate change and anthropic activities exacerbate the water issues by reducing\
    \ water quantity\nand deteriorating water quality. Especially, the limited eﬀort\
    \ on ecological maintenance results in\nthe pollution being increasingly found\
    \ in the water distribution system for the public around the\nworld. There is\
    \ an urgent need for modernized water supply technologies to alleviate current\
    \ water\nconcerns by improving water supply eﬃciency and approaching sustainable\
    \ water management\nglobally [11]. Traditionally, engineers and researchers get\
    \ used to re-sizing water supply systems.\nHowever, upgrading the existing water\
    \ distribution network is time-consuming and costly. Instead,\nretroﬁtting the\
    \ water system with smart components such as sensors, controllers, and a data\
    \ center\ncan achieve real-time monitoring, transmitting, and controlling in water\
    \ systems for decision-makers,\nwhich is a more cost-eﬀective and sustainable\
    \ approach to address the water challenges [12].\nTo date, automated control technology\
    \ (ACT) and information communication technology (ICT)\nare applied to tackle\
    \ existing problems in water distribution networks, where both technologies play\n\
    critical roles in large-scale ACT and ICT applications. A number of study cases\
    \ around the world\nconsider using smart water metering to monitor the water consumption\
    \ and further track leakage and\npipe burst issues in water distribution networks\
    \ [7]. The real-time measurements can be utilized to\nimprove the accuracy of\
    \ hydraulic model calibration and forecasting. Real-time control is commonly\n\
    applied in pumping, valve operation, and scheduling. The water supply eﬃciency\
    \ signiﬁcantly beneﬁts\nfrom automatic control technology but the electricity\
    \ energy eﬃciency needs optimization in practical\napplicability. If matched with\
    \ appropriate and eﬀective ICT or ACT solutions, in the form of a smart\nwater\
    \ system (SWS), city-wise water issues can be appropriately addressed and managed\
    \ [13]. In SWS,\nprogress can be made via smart metering (real-time monitoring\
    \ that transmits data to the utility) and\nintelligent controlling (real-time\
    \ feedback and action). For example, the Western Municipal Water\nDistrict (WMWD)\
    \ of California utilities have used the SCADA system to manage real-time alarms\
    \ and\nautomatically operate plants and networks [14]. The implementation of SCADA\
    \ has been associated\nwith 30% savings on energy use, a 20% decrease in water\
    \ loss, and a 20% decline in disruption [15].\nIn Brisbane City, Australia, the\
    \ web-based communication and information system tools are used\nby governments\
    \ and municipalities to deliver relevant water information to the public, as well\
    \ as\nto provide early warnings [16]. Another SWS case is in Singapore, where\
    \ a real-time monitoring\nsystem called WaterWiSe was built, utilizing wireless\
    \ sensor networks and data acquisition platforms\nto improve the operational eﬃciency\
    \ of the water supply system [17]. Moreover, in San Francisco, the\nautomated\
    \ real-time water meters are installed among those communities for more than 98%\
    \ of their\n178,000 customers to transmit hourly water consumption data to the\
    \ billing system via wireless sensing\nnetworks [18]. This access to frequently\
    \ updated water consumption information allows engineers\nto detect water quality\
    \ events and localize pipe leaks faster than traditional water systems that are\n\
    still using existing manually-read meters [19]. Given these ACT and ICT applications\
    \ in water sectors,\nsmart water concepts therefore emerge and inspire SWS to\
    \ be widely accepted by large amounts\nof stakeholders.\nThe terms “smart water\
    \ grid,” “smart water supply system,” “smart water system” or “smart\nwater network”\
    \ have been widely spread. The concept of SWS in the urban water ﬁeld is gaining\n\
    great impetus among academia, government, and industry, drawing attention from\
    \ international\ncommunities (SWAN, EWRI, HIC, and CCWI) to top-level organizations\
    \ (IWA, AWWA, AWC-Asian\nWater Council). Other international collaboration projects\
    \ (e.g., i-WIDGT from EU [20], CANARY\nfrom US [21], SEQ from the Australian water\
    \ resources department [22], and Smart City reports [23])\nare providing professional\
    \ support to smart urban water infrastructure all over the world [24–26].\nAlthough\
    \ researches on SWS are speeding up to meet the demand of industry and government,\
    \ the\nconceptual, technical and practical gaps between providers and clients\
    \ are still not well bridged.\nThe inﬂuences of SWS could be more signiﬁcant and\
    \ essential if priorities are precisely deﬁned and\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n3 of\
    \ 25\nimplemented into sensing technology domains in water contexts [27]. As a\
    \ consequence of the lack of\na systematic consensus from conceptual, technical,\
    \ and practical perspectives, investigating the current\narchitectures, initiatives,\
    \ and applications of SWS around the world must be required to help generate\n\
    a better understanding of the deﬁnitions, characteristics, and future trends of\
    \ SWS. While review\nstudies related to SWS and smart grid areas have already\
    \ been undertaken [28–31], a review of SWS in\nconceptual and comprehensive prospects,\
    \ with a further notiﬁcation on the deﬁnition, architecture,\nand metrics, is\
    \ missing. To address this research gap, this paper is going to analyze the existing\
    \ SWS\nconcepts, identify the possible metrics for SWS, and establish a more systematic\
    \ SWS architecture, to\nenlighten future research on its implementations.\nThis\
    \ review paper is structured as follows: ﬁrstly, the current deﬁnitions and historical\
    \ development\nof SWS are presented and discussed in the introduction section,\
    \ reviewing the evolution of SWS from\nthe past to the date and analyzing the\
    \ weakness of the current water system. Secondly, given the\nprevious literature\
    \ of SWS, a new architecture of SWS with ﬁve layers is put forward and demonstrated\n\
    explicitly. Then, by reconciling deﬁnitions and architectures, two metrics of\
    \ SWS are proposed to\ncharacterize its properties. Finally, recommendations on\
    \ future research directions are given for smart\nwater system development.\n\
    2. Literature Review of SWS\nSWS is a multidisciplinary term. A ScienceDirect\
    \ search for “Smart” or “Intelligent” in the title,\nabstract, and keyword gave\
    \ a total of 31,527 article results. However, most of them belong to smart\ntransportation,\
    \ smartphone, and smart grid ﬁelds. If “water” is included in the search, the\
    \ number\ngoes down to 9847. Further searching “Smart Water System” made the results\
    \ decline to 9517. By\nadding “framework” to the “Smart water system” only 4026\
    \ articles remained. Given that searching\nresults, we conducted the literature\
    \ review by considering relevant references from the selected papers.\nThe step-by-step\
    \ literature searching rules were summarized below: (1) “Smart” or “Intelligent”\
    \ in title,\nabstract, and keyword with 31,527 article results; (2) “Smart Water”\
    \ in title, abstract, and keyword with\n9517 article results; (3) “Framework”\
    \ and “Smart Water” in title, abstract, keyword, and body with\n4026 article results;\
    \ (4) “Structure”, “Layer”, “Framework” and “Smart Water” by manual ﬁltering with\n\
    32 article results. These 32 ﬁnal pieces of literature, including four article\
    \ forms such as forums, papers,\nreports, and presentations gain high popularity\
    \ in multiple sources like Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and\nScienceDirect. All the\
    \ papers come from the recent 10–15 years; they provide a wide presentation\n\
    of the smart water system for the readers, which include the typical arguments\
    \ of the framework\nof SWS. With insight from these literatures in Table 1, there\
    \ are 17 papers, 10 technical reports from\ndiﬀerent well-known organizations\
    \ including the International Telecommunication Union [32], U.S\nEnvironment Protection\
    \ Agency [33], UK Department for International Development [34], UN Global\nOpportunity\
    \ Committee [35–38], and Colorado State University [39]. Four key presentations\
    \ and one\nInternational forum [40,41] are also taken into consideration in this\
    \ review. As the number of studies\nthat we reviewed is limited, this paper does\
    \ not cover all aspects of SWS.\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n4 of 25\nTable 1. Classiﬁcation\

    The following is a list of works of literature related to the framework of the\
    \ smart water system in\nTable 1. We categorized these papers according to the\
    \ smart water deﬁnition, structures (Instrument\nlayer, Property layer, Function\
    \ layer, Beneﬁt layer, Application layer), and metrics, which correspond\nwith\
    \ the components of the proposed SWS framework below. The deﬁnition provides theoretical\n\
    support for SWS structures, and the metrics can be used to evaluate the SWS performance.\
    \ These ﬁve\nbasic layers inside structures consist of a comprehensive SWS architecture.\
    \ The relationship among\ndeﬁnitions, layers, and metrics make SWS work, which\
    \ is considered as the reason for the literature\nclassiﬁcation in this study.\
    \ In Table 1, “Instrument” represents the instrument layer of SWS including\n\
    the physical and ACT and ICT components. “Property” means the property layer of\
    \ SWS containing\nthe components like systems attributes. “Function” represents\
    \ the function layer of SWS such as data\nfusion in the data center. “Beneﬁt”\
    \ represents the beneﬁt layer including features like water quality\nsecurity\
    \ and energy saving. “Application” represents the application layer such as commercial\
    \ and\neducational applications. “Metrics” relate to the methods applied to evaluate\
    \ the smart water system.\n“Future research” stands for research direction recommendations\
    \ regarding the smart water system.\nEach reference might include but not all\
    \ components (deﬁnition, layers, and metrics) of the smart water\nsystem. A black\
    \ solid circle was used to mark the elements that references have covered. It\
    \ can be found\nthat most of the pieces of literature have deﬁnitions of SWS.\
    \ However, none of them have covered all\nkey layers. Since SWS is built for diﬀerent\
    \ purposes, the structure of SWS may vary from case to case.\nFurthermore, among\
    \ all those pieces of literature that we reviewed, only 7 of them discussed metrics\n\
    for SWS. How to assess the performance of SWS was not fully explored based on\
    \ currently available\nliterature. It was evident that there is still great potential\
    \ to improve the consensus and understanding\nof SWS. Table 1 also shows that\
    \ over 90% of the relevant literature has recommended future research\ndirections\
    \ for SWS. This paper will summarize these suggestions later in Section 5.\nWater\
    \ 2020, 12, 412\n9 of 25\n3. A Systematic Framework of SWS\nA systematic architecture\
    \ of SWS is comprised of various layers working synergistically to perform\nuseful\
    \ functions and applications [62]. Such a system can be represented as a set of\
    \ components, with\nspeciﬁc properties and beneﬁts. In past years, previous studies\
    \ proposed various versions of SWS to\nmeet their particular demands. The combinations\
    \ of SWS that are water management technologies and\nICT distinguished from traditional\
    \ water management technologies were put forward [54]. However,\nthe scopes and\
    \ characteristics of such SWS were not identiﬁed. Further, the term “SWG” refers\
    \ to an\nadvanced smart water grid that includes real-time information sharing\
    \ through smart measurement\nand networking and a sustainable water distribution\
    \ infrastructure [46]. The smart components in\nSWG imply that a smart water network\
    \ should comprise smart meters, smart valves, and smart\npumps by deﬁnition [28].\
    \ These smart elements including physical electronic parts, like sensors and\n\
    microcontrollers, communication protocols, and embedded systems are all folded\
    \ in the concept of the\nInternet of Things (IoT), which is the foundation of\
    \ SWS [46]. The structure of SWS, therefore, should\ncontain three frameworks:\
    \ the hierarchy framework, technical system, and function framework [61].\nIn\
    \ the hierarchy framework and technical system, there are also numerous pieces\
    \ required. An\neasy-to-understand architecture of SWS would be preferred. The\
    \ principals of the smart water network\nwere then explained [44]. This research\
    \ can be segmented in various layers: (1) physical layer (like\npipes); (2) sensing\
    \ and control layer (like ﬂow) sensors and remote control; (3) data collection\
    \ and\ncommunication layer (like data transfer); (4) data management and display;\
    \ (5) data fusion and analysis\n(like analysis tool and even detection, leakage\
    \ detection, and decision making). Nonetheless, these\nlayers still only contain\
    \ physical and cyber components and a lack of improvement to the service\nlevel.\
    \ It was proposed that SWS contains 5 layers: physical layer, sensing layer, and\
    \ control layer,\ncollection and communication layer, data management and display\
    \ layer, and data fusion and analysis\nlayer [53]. They also put forward a bottom-up\
    \ framework of SWS with 5 layers: sensing layer, transport\nlayer, processing\
    \ layer, application layer, and uniﬁed portal layer, which are based on IoT and\
    \ cloud\ncomputing [53]. Another SWS composed of 4 stages was established to secure\
    \ the vast amounts of\nhigh-resolution assumption data and customized information\
    \ [20].\nThe most widely accepted smart water architecture is characterized by\
    \ ﬁve layers: the physical\nlayer, sensing, and control layer, collection and\
    \ communication layer, data management and display\nlayer, and data fusion and\
    \ analysis layer. Each segment covers a distinct function in the network [62].\n\
    However, all SWS introduced above are under debate since most of them are deﬁned\
    \ for one particular\npurpose without complete demonstration. Some of them are\
    \ for smart water targets, some stress\nthe innovation of mechanism, while others\
    \ emphasize the application of ICT. Very few of in situ\nframeworks for understanding\
    \ SWS are comprehensive and directly applicable for education, research,\nand\
    \ public. They lack some critical elements like properties, metrics and case studies,\
    \ and the ability to\nguide future research directions. Hence, it is necessary\
    \ to build a systematic framework of SWS to\nfurther the understanding of SWS\
    \ and accelerate the implementation of SWS. In this study, we adopt\nand integrate\
    \ some of the existing architectures to propose systematic architecture. Figure\
    \ 5 illustrates\nthe authors’ conceptual representation of an orderly architecture\
    \ of SWS within a systematic smart\nwater framework. There are ﬁve layers (from\
    \ bottom to top: instruments layer, function layer, property\nlayer, beneﬁts layer,\
    \ and application layer) that are proposed in order to understand how systematic\n\
    architecture is implemented in the SWS framework. Although such a conceptual framework\
    \ has not\nbeen tested in the ﬁeld, this provides the guidance for engineers to\
    \ replicate the SWS according to their\npurposes and application. For instance,\
    \ a smart water test-bed for educational purposes can be built\non the lab by\
    \ following the SWS framework, while the application layer might be unnecessary\
    \ in this\ncase [63].\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n10 of 25\nWater 2020, 12, 412 \n9\
    \ of 24 \n \n \nFigure 5. A New Framework of Smart Water System. \n3.1. Instruments\
    \ Layer \nTypically, the instruments layer of SWS should be composed of physical\
    \ infrastructure \n(network-level components) and cyberinfrastructure (internet-related\
    \ hardware, software, and \nservices). Although the physical instruments are the\
    \ basic structure of the water system, they cannot \nmake it smart or even data-enables\
    \ only by itself. The cyberinfrastructure includes multiple \nintelligent devices\
    \ like smart sensors, smart pumps, and smart valves, etc. Their primary roles\
    \ and \napplication goals are summarized in Table 2. The smart components of cyberinfrastructure\
    \ are the \nelements in which SWS differs from the traditional water distribution\
    \ system. For example, \ntraditional water distribution systems with only physical\
    \ instruments carry on pressure or flow data. \nConversely, the SWS with cyber\
    \ instruments not only sends a flow or pressure signal, but their data \nsteam\
    \ including diagnostic information also makes the SWS detect leaks more efficiently\
    \ and \nautomatically. Additionally, for the integrated SWS, the interaction and\
    \ relationship between \nphysical and cyberinfrastructure should not be ignored.\
    \ Showing in Figure 5 below, physical \ninstruments, including pipes, valves,\
    \ and pumps provide the structural basement for the placement \nand installation\
    \ of cyber instruments like smart meter and intelligent sensors (e.g., electromagnetic\
    \ \nor ultrasonic). Meanwhile, physical infrastructures are elements that produce\
    \ the required data and \ninformation, which would be collected, transferred,\
    \ processed, and fused by internet-related \nhardware, software, and services.\
    \ In return, the cyber instruments can instruct the operation and \nmaintenance\
    \ of physical components by analyzing the newly produced data and forecasting\
    \ the \nsystem condition. For example, the automated meters are bi-direction communication\
    \ devices that \ncan execute actions on devices (e.g., valve turn off and on)\
    \ [23]. Furthermore, the different smart \nsensors might be designed to solve\
    \ various problems (shown in Figure 6) by operating systems \ndiscriminatively.\
    \ Therefore, the components layer of SWS should achieve both of the roles of physical\
    \ \ninfrastructure and cyber-infrastructure. \nFigure 5. A New Framework of Smart\
    \ Water System.\n3.1. Instruments Layer\nTypically, the instruments layer of SWS\
    \ should be composed of physical infrastructure\n(network-level components) and\
    \ cyberinfrastructure (internet-related hardware, software, and services).\nAlthough\
    \ the physical instruments are the basic structure of the water system, they cannot\
    \ make it\nsmart or even data-enables only by itself. The cyberinfrastructure\
    \ includes multiple intelligent devices\nlike smart sensors, smart pumps, and\
    \ smart valves, etc. Their primary roles and application goals\nare summarized\
    \ in Table 2. The smart components of cyberinfrastructure are the elements in\
    \ which\nSWS diﬀers from the traditional water distribution system. For example,\
    \ traditional water distribution\nsystems with only physical instruments carry\
    \ on pressure or ﬂow data. Conversely, the SWS with\ncyber instruments not only\
    \ sends a ﬂow or pressure signal, but their data steam including diagnostic\n\
    information also makes the SWS detect leaks more eﬃciently and automatically.\
    \ Additionally, for the\nintegrated SWS, the interaction and relationship between\
    \ physical and cyberinfrastructure should not\nbe ignored. Showing in Figure 5\
    \ below, physical instruments, including pipes, valves, and pumps\nprovide the\

    \ For example, the automated meters are\nbi-direction communication devices that\
    \ can execute actions on devices (e.g., valve turn oﬀ and on) [23].\nFurthermore,\
    \ the diﬀerent smart sensors might be designed to solve various problems (shown\
    \ in\nFigure 6) by operating systems discriminatively. Therefore, the components\

    \ to threat, withstand attack, and\nadapt more readily to failure risks, like\
    \ connectivity, real-time, security, resourcefulness, and robustness.\nThese properties\
    \ can be considered indicators of how smart the SWS is, and have to be quantiﬁed\n\
    either qualitatively or quantitatively through metrics. The metrics applied in\
    \ the SWS assessment,\nsuch as smartness, how eﬃcient the SWS is towards real-time,\
    \ and cyber wellness, how defensible\nthe SWS is against cyberattack, would be\
    \ discussed in the next section. In this work, we proposed\nthat SWS based on\
    \ components layer should have 4 properties: (1) Automation; (2) Resourcefulness;\n\
    (3) Real-time; (4) Connectivity. We designed the interaction between each other\
    \ within the property\nloop in Figure 7. For instance, automation is the foundation\
    \ to achieve real-time and also real-time is\nfacilitated by connectivity. Resourcefulness\
    \ is ensured by the automation and connectivity among\nvarious IoT. One common\
    \ sense is that these four properties might not be applied to each case of SWS,\n\
    and also, some researchers may consider SWS with other extra features, but these\
    \ four demonstrate\nwhat most SWS look like.\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n12 of 25\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 412 \n11 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 7. Property layer designing. \n\
    Automation is the fundamental property, which means that SWS can perform the physical\
    \ and \ncyber components’ operation automatically once the relevant parameters\
    \ are set manually. This is a \nnear-automatic process in the SWS since the application\
    \ of ACT and ICT enables the SWS to execute \none-way or two-way orders without\
    \ too many operators’ involvement. For the one-way control case \n(e.g., by setting\
    \ the sampling interval in the Arduino sketch), the smart sensor can modify the\
    \ data \ncollecting frequency. As to the two-way control example, the real-time\
    \ metering data fusion can help \nprovide feedback for the control center, where\
    \ the data analytic tools, in turn, give instructions to the \nopening status\
    \ of smart meters, smart valves, or intelligent pumps. Further, automation can\
    \ be \nimplemented not only for components providing functionality but also for\
    \ operation mechanisms. \nFor example, when water problems happen in the operation\
    \ process or the element itself, the smart \ncomponents notify the system center\
    \ and then take action to avoid a crash. Additionally, with \nautomatic self-verification,\
    \ the water utility can know when the sensor needs maintenance or re-\ninstallation\
    \ [64].  \nConnectivity is also a fundamental property, which means the degree\
    \ of interconnectedness or \nduplication [56]. In a cyber-physical system like\
    \ SWS, connectivity can be implemented by deploying \nmultiple sensors and software\
    \ for monitoring the same physical processes [65]. SWS should be \nqualified to\
    \ connect with different software and hardware to make the system collect data,\
    \ analyze \ndata, and share information publicly. For example, the SWS can be\
    \ connected with the hydraulic \nmodel, GIS platform, billing system, and Database\
    \ Model.  \nReal-time is the core property of SWS, which can also be called system\
    \ efficiency. The real-time \nperformance of SWS is characterized as online steps\
    \ like online data monitoring, online data \nassimilation, online modeling, online\
    \ plotting, and online results output, despite offline performance \nincluded\
    \ in SWS. Real-time is the property that SWS obtains to achieve the required smart\
    \ features \n[66]. However, current research mainly focuses on real-time modeling.\
    \ The real-time modeling of \nSWS is structured as 6 steps: (1) Communicate SCADA\
    \ datasets; (2) Updating the network model \nboundary conditions and operational\
    \ statuses; (3) Pausing execution; (4) Generating the \ncorresponding networks\
    \ analysis; (5) Waiting for the new SCADA measurements to reload the \nnetwork\
    \ model; (6) Return the network simulation. Mentioned in the connectivity property,\
    \ real-time \nmodeling can be performed only by connecting with data sources systems\
    \ like SCADA with \nmodeling tools like EPANET-RTX [60]. This newly produced data\
    \ from real-time hydraulic modeling \ncan forecast results and calibrate the model\
    \ by comparing measurements and predicted values. \nFigure 7. Property layer designing.\n\

    \ mechanisms.\nFor example, when water problems happen in the operation process\
    \ or the element itself, the smart\ncomponents notify the system center and then\
    \ take action to avoid a crash. Additionally, with automatic\nself-veriﬁcation,\
    \ the water utility can know when the sensor needs maintenance or re-installation\
    \ [64].\nConnectivity is also a fundamental property, which means the degree of\
    \ interconnectedness or\nduplication [56]. In a cyber-physical system like SWS,\
    \ connectivity can be implemented by deploying\nmultiple sensors and software\
    \ for monitoring the same physical processes [65]. SWS should be qualiﬁed\nto\
    \ connect with diﬀerent software and hardware to make the system collect data,\
    \ analyze data, and\nshare information publicly. For example, the SWS can be connected\
    \ with the hydraulic model, GIS\nplatform, billing system, and Database Model.\n\
    Real-time is the core property of SWS, which can also be called system eﬃciency.\
    \ The real-time\nperformance of SWS is characterized as online steps like online\
    \ data monitoring, online data assimilation,\nonline modeling, online plotting,\
    \ and online results output, despite oﬄine performance included in\nSWS. Real-time\
    \ is the property that SWS obtains to achieve the required smart features [66].\

    \ measurements and predicted values.\nResourcefulness is the ﬁnal property, which\
    \ means the SWS not only owns massive data storage\nbut also aims to timely exchange\
    \ data for further analysis. This property of data exchange can also be\nWater\
    \ 2020, 12, 412\n13 of 25\ninterpreted as interoperability, which refers to the\
    \ capability of units of an SWS to exchange and use\ninformation and services\
    \ with one another and interfaced external units [67]. SWS provides massive\n\
    information to an automation and security system, compared with the traditional\
    \ instruments [58].\nTypically, there are three types of source data open to the\
    \ processor: spatial data, attribute data,\nand multimedia data, which determine\
    \ the database model designing. However, these data can\nonly be shared with the\
    \ public and business after being analyzed by experts. Those processed data\n\
    would be input into the hydraulic model to produce forecasting data, and those\
    \ visualized data\nwould be interpreted as valuable information such as early\
    \ warning system, assessment of pipe\nleakage/breaks, or identiﬁcation of cyberattacks\
    \ or for decision support [68]. Moreover, the processed\ninformation or data would\
    \ be transmitted back to the SCADA system and stored as instrument status\nand\
    \ diagnostic information.\n3.3. Function Layer\nFunctions of SWS can be determined\
    \ by the instrument layer and property layer since diﬀerent\ncomponents and properties\
    \ lead to diﬀerent functions. For example, one SWS installed with ﬂow and\npressure\
    \ sensor would consider being featured with resourcefulness and can verify the\
    \ pressure-driven\nmodeling analysis with enormous data collection resources [69].\
    \ In contrast, SWS is equipped with\ntemperature sensors functions predicting\
    \ the inﬁltration rate in the water systems with available\ntemperature data [70].\
    \ Within the architecture of SWS, the function layer is localized in the connection\n\
    point between system’s property and metrics and plays a role in linking these\
    \ two (shown in the\nframework Figure 5). Thus, the function layer can be interpreted\
    \ as the backbone of SWS that\nincludes functionalities of intelligent sensing,\
    \ simulation, diagnosis, warning, dispatching, disposal,\nand control [43]. However,\
    \ this study does not demonstrate the status of a function layer on the whole\n\
    framework. Based on this function layer, this paper re-designs and speciﬁes the\
    \ function layer shown\nin Figure 8, which includes data producing, data sensing,\
    \ data processing, simulation operating, and\napplication supporting.\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 412 \n12 of 24 \n \nResourcefulness is the final property, which means the\
    \ SWS not only owns massive data storage \nbut also aims to timely exchange data\
    \ for further analysis. This property of data exchange can also be \ninterpreted\
    \ as interoperability, which refers to the capability of units of an SWS to exchange\
    \ and use \ninformation and services with one another and interfaced external\
    \ units [67]. SWS provides massive \ninformation to an automation and security\

    \ and \nmultimedia data, which determine the database model designing. However,\
    \ these data can only be \nshared with the public and business after being analyzed\
    \ by experts. Those processed data would be \ninput into the hydraulic model to\
    \ produce forecasting data, and those visualized data would be \ninterpreted as\
    \ valuable information such as early warning system, assessment of pipe leakage/breaks,\
    \ \nor identification of cyberattacks or for decision support [68]. Moreover,\
    \ the processed information or \ndata would be transmitted back to the SCADA system\
    \ and stored as instrument status and diagnostic \ninformation. \n3.3. Function\
    \ Layer  \nFunctions of SWS can be determined by the instrument layer and property\
    \ layer since different \ncomponents and properties lead to different functions.\
    \ For example, one SWS installed with flow and \npressure sensor would consider\
    \ being featured with resourcefulness and can verify the pressure-\ndriven modeling\
    \ analysis with enormous data collection resources [69]. In contrast, SWS is equipped\
    \ \nwith temperature sensors functions predicting the infiltration rate in the\
    \ water systems with available \ntemperature data [70]. Within the architecture\
    \ of SWS, the function layer is localized in the connection \npoint between system’s\
    \ property and metrics and plays a role in linking these two (shown in the \n\
    framework Figure 5). Thus, the function layer can be interpreted as the backbone\
    \ of SWS that includes \nfunctionalities of intelligent sensing, simulation, diagnosis,\
    \ warning, dispatching, disposal, and \ncontrol [43]. However, this study does\
    \ not demonstrate the status of a function layer on the whole \nframework. Based\
    \ on this function layer, this paper re-designs and specifies the function layer\
    \ shown \nin Figure 8, which includes data producing, data sensing, data processing,\

    \ In \nthis study, the benefit layer mainly contains four aspects including prolonging\

    \ Prolong Asset Life Cycle and Cost Saving. \nAs real-time property states, an\
    \ SWS can integrate and analyze real-time monitoring data from \nvarious instruments\
    \ for decision-making support. Especially, monitoring data regarding pipelines,\
    \ \nvalves, pumps, and tank conditions can be used to develop a risk-evaluated\
    \ model for instrument \nreplacement or maintenance. This allows SWS to plan and\
    \ schedule the replacement and \nrehabilitation of the asset program efficiently\
    \ as well as effectively so that the right assets can be \nreplaced, repaired,\
    \ and rebuilt in a timely manner. Thus, the real-time monitoring of asset status\
    \ \ncould be regarded as indicators of preventive maintenance and predictive replacement\
    \ to prolong \nthe assets’ life cycle and cost savings [74–76]. \n3.4.2. Reduce\
    \ Energy Loss and Improve System Efficiency \nEnergy is needed to extract, deliver,\
    \ treat, and heat water for municipal, industrial, and \nagricultural uses [77,78].\
    \ In the United States, the energy required to move and handle the water is \n\
    estimated to comprise 4% of total electricity consumption nationwide [79]. Knowing\
    \ the quantity of \nwater needed, and accounting for any losses, utilities can\
    \ produce less water. This will be reflected \nin lower energy consumption as\
    \ well as in water conservation. The energy loss and costs can be \nreduced by\
    \ reducing the amount of water needed to be pumped, transported, heated, or treated\
    \ [80]. \nLeakage in the water distribution system leads to additional energy\
    \ required to pump and carry \nwater to consumers as a result. Smart water sensors\
    \ can monitor online pressure and warn pressure \nchanges or significant pressure\
    \ losses along with the water network, where utilities can remotely \noptimize\
    \ the network pressure to help save energy [57]. \n3.4.3. Optimize Pressure Supply\
    \ and Water Quality \nReal-time data allows SWS to enhance system planning and\
    \ operations by monitoring the \nhydraulic and water quality situation throughout\
    \ the system [81]. On the one hand, the deficit \npressure in the water distribution\
    \ system can be detected so that actions can be taken promptly to \nalleviate\
    \ the risk of pipe bursts. On the other hand, automated valve or smart gate operations\
    \ can \nadjust the operating status to prevent pipe burst and water leakage, which\
    \ might compensate for \ninstruments changing process conditions or water treatment\
    \ plant requirements [47]. Those data \nfrom SCADA and hydraulic integration can\
    \ also be used for foreseeing the negative operating \nconsequences, predicting\
    \ future boundary conditions, and knowing the current system status in real-\n\
    time, which empowers operators and engineers to control the water systems more\
    \ effectively. \nFigure 9. Beneﬁts layer designing.\n3.4.1. Prolong Asset Life\
    \ Cycle and Cost Saving\nAs real-time property states, an SWS can integrate and\
    \ analyze real-time monitoring data from\nvarious instruments for decision-making\
    \ support. Especially, monitoring data regarding pipelines,\nvalves, pumps, and\
    \ tank conditions can be used to develop a risk-evaluated model for instrument\n\
    replacement or maintenance. This allows SWS to plan and schedule the replacement\
    \ and rehabilitation\nof the asset program eﬃciently as well as eﬀectively so\
    \ that the right assets can be replaced, repaired,\nand rebuilt in a timely manner.\
    \ Thus, the real-time monitoring of asset status could be regarded as\nindicators\
    \ of preventive maintenance and predictive replacement to prolong the assets’\

    \ of total electricity consumption nationwide [79]. Knowing the quantity of water\
    \ needed,\nand accounting for any losses, utilities can produce less water. This\
    \ will be reﬂected in lower energy\nconsumption as well as in water conservation.\
    \ The energy loss and costs can be reduced by reducing\nthe amount of water needed\
    \ to be pumped, transported, heated, or treated [80]. Leakage in the water\ndistribution\
    \ system leads to additional energy required to pump and carry water to consumers\
    \ as a\nresult. Smart water sensors can monitor online pressure and warn pressure\
    \ changes or signiﬁcant\npressure losses along with the water network, where utilities\
    \ can remotely optimize the network\npressure to help save energy [57].\n3.4.3.\
    \ Optimize Pressure Supply and Water Quality\nReal-time data allows SWS to enhance\
    \ system planning and operations by monitoring the\nhydraulic and water quality\
    \ situation throughout the system [81]. On the one hand, the deﬁcit pressure\n\
    in the water distribution system can be detected so that actions can be taken\
    \ promptly to alleviate\nthe risk of pipe bursts. On the other hand, automated\
    \ valve or smart gate operations can adjust the\noperating status to prevent pipe\
    \ burst and water leakage, which might compensate for instruments\nchanging process\
    \ conditions or water treatment plant requirements [47]. Those data from SCADA\
    \ and\nhydraulic integration can also be used for foreseeing the negative operating\
    \ consequences, predicting\nfuture boundary conditions, and knowing the current\
    \ system status in real-time, which empowers\noperators and engineers to control\
    \ the water systems more eﬀectively.\nThe implementation of cyber instruments\
    \ into the water system can be utilized for warning\npollutants intrusion.\nContinuous\
    \ online monitoring for water quality indicators, such as free\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 412\n15 of 25\nchlorine, total organic carbon, pH, conductivity, and turbidity,\
    \ assist the eﬀective response to a\nwater contamination incident and to mitigate\
    \ further consequences. For example, the real-time\nwater quality issue detection\
    \ system called CANARY can use advanced monitoring technologies and\nenhanced\
    \ surveillance instruments to collect, integrate, analyze, and communicate information\
    \ that\nprovides a timely warning of potential contamination events [82].\n3.4.4.\
    \ Obtain Real-Time Water Consumption and Consumer Billing\nSWS connected with\
    \ the billing system and consumption system can display the metering\ninformation\
    \ on the end-user’s platform, like laptops, smartphones, or tablets via internet\
    \ connection.\nThis real-time water consumption information helps customers to\
    \ save water and costs [83,84]. As\nthe crux elements of SWS, the automated meter\
    \ readings (AMR) and automatic meter infrastructure\n(AMI) provide real-time feedback\
    \ on water usage for customers. This enables customers to make\ninformed choices\
    \ towards water-consuming habits and join in the water management activity. In\n\
    reverse, the change of demand pattern would help the engineers and operators to\
    \ calibrate their model,\noptimize pump and valves schedules [85], and modify\
    \ the boundary conditions timely as eﬃciently as\naccurately [47].\n3.5. Application\
    \ Layer\nIn the application layer, there are three aspects generally classiﬁed\
    \ as the Public application,\nGovernment application, and Business application\
    \ shown in Figure 10. The application layer is\nmainly user-oriented for decision-making\
    \ support ﬁnally. These three kinds of applications can receive\nfeedback from\
    \ the corresponding users like consumers, utilities and markets, or other terminals\
    \ shown\nin Figure 10 below.\nWater 2020, 12, 412 \n15 of 24 \n  \nFigure 10.\
    \ Application layer designing. \n4. Metrics for SWS \nThe technical structure\
    \ of SWS has a pyramid structure with core information on the top to \nensure\
    \ system efficiency and security [87]. Figure 11 illustrates the features of such\
    \ a technical \nstructure. In this general structure of SWS, the configuration\
    \ of components and connections can be \ninterpreted as a network of cyber information\
    \ (e.g., leak detection, discharge control, and noise \nrecognition), data compiling\
    \ (e.g., real-time modeling, real-time controlling, and real-time sampling), \n\
    and physical instruments (e.g., sensors and loggers) domain. In Figure 11, nodes\
    \ represent system \ncomponents while the links stand for the functional relationship\
    \ between nodes. For instance, the \nbottom nodes are connected with the intermedia\
    \ nodes, which optionally means that the data from \nthe sensor is transmitted\
    \ to SCADA via links. To better assess the SWS’s efficiency and security within\
    \ \nthese domains, it is necessary to develop the metrics [45].\nFigure 10. Application\
    \ layer designing.\nThe public application aims to share real-time data and information\
    \ with consumers for their\nfeedback on billing and consumption, which is beneﬁcial\
    \ for water conservation and costs saving.\nBesides, public awareness about this\
    \ SWS and water conservation should be stressed. More community\ninvolvement might\
    \ be eliminated by providing citizens with more information regarding water\n\
    conservation and SWS. Manual ﬂow meters reading and installation may cause problems\
    \ like the\nembarrassing access of individuals and invasion of government on private\
    \ property [86]. SWS’s\ntechnology development, combined with public awareness\
    \ improvement, can reduce those risks.\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n16 of 25\nThe government\
    \ application targets water utilities, diﬀerent users from public applications.\
    \ As\nthe construction work of the water system, such as pipe replacement, instruments\
    \ installation, and\ndata center establishment, is the responsibility of the water\
    \ utility, the sensors deployed by the water\nutility are helpful to take an insight\
    \ of what is happening in SWS, and the collected sensor data would\nbe adopted\
    \ to support government decision.\nThe last application is the business application.\
    \ The current smart water market mainly focuses\non developing sensors and real-time\
    \ software. But there are only a few standards or guidelines to\nevaluate these\
    \ intelligent products. The application and development of SWS can accelerate\
    \ the\nspeed of evaluating the system on market feedback and build the rules of\
    \ the smart water market.\nAdditionally, the application layer is dependent on\
    \ the purpose of data acquisition. However, there is\nno single protocol that\
    \ can adequately suit all the applications and communication processes, and an\n\
    overall application protocol would be too complex to support eﬃcient business\
    \ processes. Therefore,\nanother business application is the on-going multi-protocol\
    \ handing devices for speciﬁc purposes since\none proprietary single-manufacturer\
    \ protocol would not be the best for interoperability in SWS. These\ndevices can\
    \ stimulate communications by using the existing or coming protocols and also\
    \ allow open\nprogrammable interfaces that can be customized for market tests\
    \ and feedback [55].\n4. Metrics for SWS\nThe technical structure of SWS has a\
    \ pyramid structure with core information on the top to ensure\nsystem eﬃciency\
    \ and security [87]. Figure 11 illustrates the features of such a technical structure.\
    \ In\nthis general structure of SWS, the conﬁguration of components and connections\
    \ can be interpreted\nas a network of cyber information (e.g., leak detection,\
    \ discharge control, and noise recognition),\ndata compiling (e.g., real-time\
    \ modeling, real-time controlling, and real-time sampling), and physical\ninstruments\
    \ (e.g., sensors and loggers) domain. In Figure 11, nodes represent system components\n\
    while the links stand for the functional relationship between nodes. For instance,\
    \ the bottom nodes\nare connected with the intermedia nodes, which optionally\
    \ means that the data from the sensor is\ntransmitted to SCADA via links. To better\
    \ assess the SWS’s eﬃciency and security within these\ndomains, it is necessary\
    \ to develop the metrics [45].\n \n  \nFigure 10. Application layer designing.\
    \ \n4. Metrics for SWS \nThe technical structure of SWS has a pyramid structure\
    \ with core information on the top to \nensure system efficiency and security\
    \ [87]. Figure 11 illustrates the features of such a technical \nstructure. In\
    \ this general structure of SWS, the configuration of components and connections\
    \ can be \ninterpreted as a network of cyber information (e.g., leak detection,\

    components while the links stand for the functional relationship between nodes.\
    \ For instance, the \nbottom nodes are connected with the intermedia nodes, which\

    \ it is necessary to develop the metrics [45]. \n \nFigure 11. Illustration of\
    \ a smart water system technical structure. \nFigure 11. Illustration of a smart\
    \ water system technical structure.\nBefore moving to the metrics discussion,\
    \ the relationship between property and metrics should\nbe clariﬁed. While metrics\
    \ are reﬁned from properties, and both metrics and properties might be\nconnected\
    \ by functions, the application of SWS ultimately aims to assess the performance\
    \ of SWS.\nTherefore, properties can be seen as the inherent components of SWS\
    \ whilst metrics are the manual\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n17 of 25\nproduct. Additionally,\
    \ properties might determine the assessment indexes on a given SWS, while\nmetrics\
    \ are those elements to achieve the terminal performance. For example, real-time\
    \ modeling is a\ncrucial property of SWS, which makes measuring the eﬃciency of\
    \ SWS one indicator for smartness.\nFurthermore, the performance of data processing\
    \ in the context of resourcefulness is related to\ninformational security. However,\
    \ the eﬀects of property layers on metrics are not certain without\nspeciﬁc analysis\
    \ of a given system. In this section, the paper proposes two new conceptual metrics\n\
    (Smartness and Cyber wellness) for assessing two essential properties of SWS,\
    \ eﬃciency and security,\nand discusses how to deﬁne these two metrics and how\
    \ they can be objectively built to deal with\nthreats of SWS.\nA brief investigation\
    \ of 27 reviewed academic studies was conducted to analyze the SWS metrics\nshown\
    \ in Figure 12, showing the number of studies (report and paper) for smartness\
    \ scope and cyber\nwellness scope. Smartness and cyber wellness are seldom discussed\
    \ directly in previous articles and\nreports. Most of them mention relationships\
    \ with metrics or present the features of these two metrics.\nThus, we consider\
    \ that these papers and reports listed should be included in the scope of the\
    \ metric.\nIn the cyber wellness scope, cyber wellness only comes from the electrical\
    \ and telecommunication\nﬁelds [30], which makes it necessary to translate the\
    \ cyber wellness into water systems. Although\nsmartness has been described in\
    \ the previous environmental studies, the vision is a little broader as\nwater\
    \ systems are only a small part of the environment [87]. More eﬀorts would be\
    \ required to narrow\ndown the scope of smartness if it is applied in the water\
    \ system sector.\n \nBefore moving to the metrics discussion, the relationship\
    \ between property and metrics should \nbe clarified. While metrics are refined\
    \ from properties, and both metrics and properties might be \nconnected by functions,\
    \ the application of SWS ultimately aims to assess the performance of SWS. \n\
    Therefore, properties can be seen as the inherent components of SWS whilst metrics\
    \ are the manual \nproduct. Additionally, properties might determine the assessment\
    \ indexes on a given SWS, while \nmetrics are those elements to achieve the terminal\
    \ performance. For example, real-time modeling is \na crucial property of SWS,\
    \ which makes measuring the efficiency of SWS one indicator for smartness. \n\
    Furthermore, the performance of data processing in the context of resourcefulness\
    \ is related to \ninformational security. However, the effects of property layers\
    \ on metrics are not certain without \nspecific analysis of a given system. In\
    \ this section, the paper proposes two new conceptual metrics \n(Smartness and\
    \ Cyber wellness) for assessing two essential properties of SWS, efficiency and\
    \ security, \nand discusses how to define these two metrics and how they can be\
    \ objectively built to deal with \nthreats of SWS. \nA brief investigation of\
    \ 27 reviewed academic studies was conducted to analyze the SWS metrics \nshown\
    \ in Figure 12, showing the number of studies (report and paper) for smartness\

    \ cyber wellness into water systems. Although \nsmartness has been described in\
    \ the previous environmental studies, the vision is a little broader as \nwater\
    \ systems are only a small part of the environment [87]. More efforts would be\
    \ required to \nnarrow down the scope of smartness if it is applied in the water\
    \ system sector. \n \nFigure 12. The number of studies for different metrics scope.\
    \ \n4.1. Smartness \nIn previous studies, researchers made many efforts in achieving\
    \ smart performance in water \nsystems. The smart performance of SWS ought to\
    \ expand to real-time modeling, real-time sampling, \nand real-time controlling,\
    \ etc., which aim to minimize the time delay between system input and \nsystem\
    \ output. It was revealed that the efficiency of data transmission would be promoted\
    \ \nsignificantly by using SCADA [88,89]. Nevertheless, SCADA system enables multiple\
    \ connections \nwith various database and real-time modeling tools; the connection\
    \ between the SCADA and offline \nor time-delay modeling tools still makes the\
    \ water system not so smart as to reduce the data \nacquisition time. Some offline\
    \ modeling tools like Hydraulic CAD and WATSYS can only process \nhistorical data,\
    \ even though they are commonly used for the hydraulic model. Even if the SCADA\
    \ \nsystem and so-called real-time simulation tools have been integrated into\
    \ the water distribution \nsystem, it is still necessary to further understand\
    \ what makes the water system smart. Real-time \nmodeling tool applications like\
    \ EPANET-RTX [90], LVVWD [91], and EPANET-CPS [92] actually \nneed two steps to\
    \ finish work: pausing execution and waiting for the new SCADA measurements to\
    \ \nreload and to update the boundary condition [93]. The Pausing and Waiting\
    \ takes typically 10 \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nPaper\nReport\nsmartness scope\ncyber\

    4.1. Smartness\nIn previous studies, researchers made many eﬀorts in achieving\
    \ smart performance in water\nsystems. The smart performance of SWS ought to expand\
    \ to real-time modeling, real-time sampling,\nand real-time controlling, etc.,\
    \ which aim to minimize the time delay between system input and system\noutput.\
    \ It was revealed that the eﬃciency of data transmission would be promoted signiﬁcantly\n\
    by using SCADA [88,89]. Nevertheless, SCADA system enables multiple connections\
    \ with various\ndatabase and real-time modeling tools; the connection between\
    \ the SCADA and oﬄine or time-delay\nmodeling tools still makes the water system\
    \ not so smart as to reduce the data acquisition time.\nSome oﬄine modeling tools\
    \ like Hydraulic CAD and WATSYS can only process historical data, even\nthough\
    \ they are commonly used for the hydraulic model. Even if the SCADA system and\
    \ so-called\nreal-time simulation tools have been integrated into the water distribution\
    \ system, it is still necessary\nto further understand what makes the water system\
    \ smart. Real-time modeling tool applications like\nEPANET-RTX [90], LVVWD [91],\
    \ and EPANET-CPS [92] actually need two steps to ﬁnish work: pausing\nexecution\
    \ and waiting for the new SCADA measurements to reload and to update the boundary\n\
    condition [93]. The Pausing and Waiting takes typically 10 seconds and 14 minutes,\
    \ respectively, which\nmakes smart modeling is close to being near real-time process\
    \ [94].\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n18 of 25\nThus, the time interval between system\
    \ input and output, which is characterized as a time lag\nequation, can be used\
    \ to assess how much smart it is. Overall, to deﬁne the SWS is to establish\n\
    the mechanism for reducing time lag among those processes like real-time monitoring,\
    \ real-time\ntransporting, real-time processing, real-time sampling, and real-time\
    \ simulation in SWS. In this study,\nthe term “Smartness” is introduced to quantify\
    \ the time lag reduction. The optimal levels of smartness\nrequire trade-oﬀs from\
    \ the source to the end [87]. This way, the smartness used in Equation (1)\naims\
    \ to minimize the system time costs from start input and terminal output. As smartness\
    \ ensures\nperformance, eﬃciency, and expediency, the maximum of smartness will\
    \ revolutionize the interaction\nrelationship between systems and engineers.\n\
    Smartness = min (Time lag: system input, system output)\n(1)\nThe unit for smartness\
    \ is minutes; a smartness below 15 min can be acceptable while a smartness\nover\
    \ 15 min is unfavorable. Smartness can be used to assess the eﬃciency of the smart\
    \ water system\nwhen dealing and interpreting measurements from real-world systems.\n\
    4.2. Cyber Wellness\nThe scale IoT devices are growing even faster than the world’s\
    \ population. There will be 20.4\nbillion connected devices by 2020, compared\
    \ with 7.8 billion global population [95]. These numbers\nhighlight IoT’s signiﬁcance\
    \ in the fourth industrial revolution, also known as the digital economy,\nwhere\
    \ IoT is expected to deliver the “smarts” needed to address common everyday challenges\
    \ in areas\nsuch as education, healthcare, utilities, transportation, and public\
    \ and residential buildings [96].\nSWS has a number of logical sub-layers in the\
    \ integration of physical components and IoT, where\nsensors and actuators are\
    \ deployed across the water distribution network to enable signiﬁcant data\nprocesses\
    \ and real-time performance. However, the pursuit of smartness without considering\
    \ data\nauthenticity and reliability would lead to information security issues.\
    \ Many information safety issues\nare from system integration [42]. Thus, security\
    \ at both IoT and network-level is critical to the operation\nof SWS [61]. Compared\
    \ with physical network level components, these data-related smart sensors\nand\
    \ intelligent devices with larger importance are the heart of SWS, occupying the\
    \ decision-making\nresources. In comparison with the physical network level, the\
    \ related data are easier to be chosen as the\nhitting points and even more vulnerable\
    \ to cyberattacks because the hackers or cyberattackers might\ntend to crush the\
    \ critical components of SWS or to steal the most crucial data saved in the database.\n\
    In this paper, we propose cyber wellness as one of the metrics to evaluate the\
    \ information security\nof SWS. Cyber wellness is ﬁrst put forward in the International\
    \ Telecommunication Union (ITU) to\ndescribe the health level of information and\
    \ communication technologies [97]. Continuously, cyber\nwellness is also introduced\
    \ into the education ﬁeld to describe the health level of Internet users [88].\
    \ In\nterms of information security, the emphasis from all cases is on how many\
    \ of the IoT works well to\nextract data and how long it will last to defend itself\
    \ when a cyberattack happens. In this work, we\ndeﬁne the well-being level of\
    \ information as “cyber wellness” in SWS. The goal of cyber wellness is,\ntherefore,\
    \ to store data as much as possible before a cyberattack and to withstand cyberattacks\
    \ as long\nas possible at the same time shown in Equation (2):\nCyber wellness\
    \ = max(Information security: capacity, endurance)\n(2)\nCyber wellness is unitless,\
    \ usually ranging from 0% to 100%. The higher cyber wellness reﬂects that\nthe\
    \ smart water system has more capacity to be against system failure and to prevent\
    \ information loss.\n5. Future Research Recommendations\nA few challenges in the\
    \ application of SWS are still waiting to be solved before the wide application\n\
    of a smart water system [47]. More coordination is needed for collective work\
    \ from the academia,\nindustry, and government to enable smart techniques for\
    \ public adoption. Based on the results of\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n19 of 25\nthis\
    \ review paper and the work from diﬀerent water organizations, several research\
    \ directions are\nrecommended to help engineers, researchers, and the public to\
    \ work on those challenges in a more\neﬃcient and focused way.\n5.1. Cyberattack\
    \ to Smart Water Micro-Components\nAs the latest information and data center systems\
    \ are vulnerable to hackers switching oﬀ the\npower easily, the smart equipment\
    \ being connected to the wider internet is revealed to be exposed to\ncyberattack\
    \ risks [98]. This ﬁnding reﬂects the current security problems in the IoTs are\
    \ a signiﬁcant\npublic concern. SWS, which is also on the basis of IoT, should\
    \ not ignore this concern, and it is required\nto build a strong defensive wall\
    \ to cyberattacks [52]. However, there are few studies discussing the\nprotection\
    \ of smart water micro-components. Diﬀerent smart devices such as sensors, loggers,\
    \ samplers,\nand controllers play roles of varying importance in water systems,\
    \ meaning that cyberattackers might\nselect the attacking intentionally in one\
    \ speciﬁc case. In this way, we need to develop eﬃcient methods\nand technologies\
    \ to benchmark the smart water micro-components protection eﬃciency. This will\n\
    budget the investment in the water system retroﬁtting where identical smart water\
    \ micro-components\nare required for diﬀerent defense costs.\n5.2. Resilience\
    \ Incorporation into Smart Water System\nThe resilience concept has been incorporated\
    \ into the traditional water distribution system,\nrainwater harvesting system,\
    \ storm drainage system, and wastewater system in some papers and\nprojects [99–102].\
    \ However, there are few papers discussing how to implement resilience in the\n\
    smart water system. The smart water system needs to be resilient since it involves\
    \ more recovery\nnot only in physical components but also in the intelligent ones.\
    \ In contrast to traditional water\nsystems, a smart water system has more complex\
    \ connections with automatic and online operations.\nThus, the performance of\
    \ SWS is determined by water, energy, and electricity availability. The\nnecessity\
    \ of incorporating resilience into the smart water system to evaluate their recovery\
    \ ability\nand function eﬃciency are therefore very important. Incorporating the\
    \ sub-resilience into the smart\nwater micro-components would also be a better\
    \ way to quantify the recovery capacity of the whole\nwater system.\n5.3. Smart\
    \ Water (End-User) Data Disaggregation and Analysis\nReal-time meter readings\
    \ generate massive data that require good organization and powerful\nanalytics\
    \ to extract useful information [103]. The high-resolution water data sampling\
    \ can enable\nend-user disaggregation to eﬃciently recognize the peak demand,\
    \ pipe leakage, and breakage [104,105].\nHowever, the smart water system ﬁeld\
    \ is still lacking proper data disaggregation and analysis tools.\nThe development\
    \ of data analysis tools that utilize the processed data to obtain water consumption\n\
    information such as peak hourly consumption, end-uses, or comparative analysis\
    \ is still at the formative\nstage [106]. Multi-Resolution data availability can\
    \ assist utilities in obtaining beneﬁts from data\nsampling and the cost of high-resolution\
    \ metering, real-time data-model coupling, and maintaining\nmetering infrastructures\
    \ [67,72]. These are the most critical challenges requiring urgent research\n\
    attention as the eﬃcient end-user data analysis approach can beneﬁt the customers’\
    \ billing and costs.\nSuch work will provide insight into future big water data\
    \ management research and commercial\napplications [107–109].\n6. Conclusions\n\
    This paper has conducted a critical review of studies that deal with smart water\
    \ techniques\napplied in water systems, with a particular focus on the understanding\
    \ of how to address the key\ncomponents for the framework of the smart water system\
    \ (SWS). Four critical components composed\nof the SWS (instrument layer, property\
    \ layer, function layer, beneﬁt layer, and application layer) and\ntwo metrics\
    \ (smartness and cyber wellness) are proposed to characterize SWS. In this review,\
    \ a total\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n20 of 25\nnumber of 32 literature including 1\
    \ international forum, 17 peer-reviewed papers, 10 reports, and 4\npresentations,\
    \ explicitly supporting the smart water system’s deﬁnition, architecture, and\
    \ metrics, are\nanalyzed. The main conclusions drawn from this study can be summarized\
    \ as follows:\n1.\nThe lack of consensus in the deﬁnition and architecture of\
    \ a smart water system and metrics of\nintelligent water system assessment is\
    \ hindering the process of smart techniques entering the\nwater sector;\n2.\n\
    A systematic and comprehensive smart water system framework is put forward including\
    \ critical\nelements like the deﬁnition, architecture, metrics, and research directions,\
    \ which can be directly\napplicable for education, research, and public knowledge;\n\
    3.\nTwo conceptual metrics (smartness and cyber wellness) to evaluate the performance\
    \ of the smart\nwater system are proposed to characterize system eﬃciency and\
    \ information security;\n4.\nExisting challenges drive concentration on future\
    \ research directions, and these future tasks can\nbe viewed as a synthetic work\
    \ where the academia, industry, and government will join in together.\nOverall,\
    \ this review has deﬁned what SWS is and established a systematic framework for\
    \ SWS,\nincluding architecture and metrics of SWS, which also shows that SWS has\
    \ great potential to maximize\nthe beneﬁts in water sectors over the coming decades.\
    \ This study is useful for designing assessing, and\nrehabilitating SWS when diﬀerent\

    Water is becoming scarcer. The unmonitored control and the extensive use of fossil
    fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate global warming and harm
    the environment. Along with the rapid population growth and the concomitant increase
    in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table and energy is becoming a
    must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In this context, Smart Agriculture
    (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages ICT (Information and Communication
    Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while enhancing crops’ yields. In this
    paper, we present an integral SA solution that leverages cost-effectiveness .
    Commercial solutions are costly and thus become impossible to adopt by small and
    medium farmers. Our solution revolves around three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering
    promotes optimal usage and conservation of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via
    real-time data collection and monitoring using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of
    Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration promotes energy-efficient agriculture
    by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation
    to promote good crops quality and quantity without harming the soil and the water-table
    ecosystems. Our solution has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm
    testbed. The results have shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the
    amount of water consumption (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%.
    Finally, our solution is open-source and can be easily adopted and adapted by
    other researchers to promote the setting of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for
    water-table usage, especially in arid and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart

    basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans use water for industrial purposes,
    sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades, the annual water withdrawal ranged
    between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters per year, out of which 69 % is
    used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of this water is wasted because of
    inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most arid and sub-Saharan countries,
    agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer of fresh water, especially after
    launching the Green Plan program in April 2008 [2]. This program aims to promote
    agriculture as an efficient sector capable of advancing the economy, fighting
    poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas efficiently and sustainably.
    Within the framework of this program, the government provided many facilities
    and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated agriculture to provide enough
    basic food for local consumption and export promotion programs. However, the level
    of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains very low. In addition, investors
    in the irrigated agricultural projects started sounding alarms of severe depletion
    of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the lack of a cost-effective real-time data
    collection in irrigation systems in farming fields that will enable them to benefit
    from the advanced modern technologies. There is a need to develop a cost-effective
    and sustainable data acquisition system for smart agriculture applications in
    sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient, and smart agriculture. The system
    should use renewable energy and the latest Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural environment. When combined
    with reasonable control and management and data analytics, the data acquisition
    system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural productivity and
    improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the traditional methods
    of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water reservoirs and resort
    to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy. Smart agriculture (SA)
    exploits modern management systems to rationalize water consumption and adopt
    renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering the agricultural sector
    eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral and cost-effective
    SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) perspective [4],
    our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors Network (WSNs) monitor,
    in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g., weather and soil conditions,
    2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric appliances such as water
    pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform for real-time data storage,
    processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic Control module decides on
    monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time acquired differences between
    desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our open-source software solution
    for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We built our cost-effective sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos. Finally, we leveraged an
    existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED [5]. In this paper, and
    by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy integration, and open-source
    ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute towards the smooth penetration
    of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan countries. We are further
    envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone for establishing a
    dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing) platform [6] to collect
    real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which falls under the big data
    category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity, and Variety) [7], and
    along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously assist in promoting
    eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are as follows: We present
    a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general architecture for a Smart
    Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt and adapt for further
    testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source software and leverage
    Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing. We demonstrate
    the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors and actuators
    using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show how integrating
    renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting our solution
    in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that by adopting
    fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption by
    up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and the
    related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and design
    are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.
    Show All FIGURE 21. Real-time soil moisture average and irrigation duration. Show
    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    \ (AI)\n1. Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy for\
    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\

    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\

    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\
    \ such as planting, seeding,\nharvesting, and soil sampling. This is making farming\
    \ more efﬁcient while reducing\nlabor costs.\nSmart agriculture is an evolving\
    \ ﬁeld that leverages technological innovations to\ntransform traditional farming\
    \ practices. The integration of digital technologies into agricul-\nture has opened\
    \ up new opportunities and possibilities, revolutionizing the way farmers\nmanage\
    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\
    \ exploring its key\ncomponents and highlighting its potential for sustainable\
    \ farming practices. One of the\ncritical aspects of precision agriculture is\
    \ data collection and acquisition planning, which\nplays a fundamental role in\
    \ optimizing farm management decisions. Through efﬁcient data\ngathering, farmers\
    \ can make informed choices regarding crop health, resource allocation,\nand yield\
    \ optimization. Decision making and execution are also vital components of preci-\n\
    sion agriculture, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies is pivotal.\
    \ Leveraging\nmachine vision technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) can\nlead to enhanced precision and efﬁciency in agricultural\
    \ processes, beneﬁting both farmers\nand the environment. Throughout this review,\
    \ successful precision agriculture proposals\nand real-world implementations are\
    \ analyzed to gain insights into their achievements and\nchallenges. By identifying\
    \ future developments required in precision agriculture, we aim\nto provide a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of how this ﬁeld can continually evolve to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable farming practices and address global food security challenges. The\n\
    amalgamation of scientiﬁc research and technological innovations holds great promise\
    \ for\nthe future of precision agriculture and its positive impact on agriculture\
    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\
    \ time related to net beneﬁts [9] while supporting the conservation of agricultural\n\
    inputs and reducing costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another\
    \ man-\nagement tool, grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into\
    \ a grid and collecting\ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach\
    \ provides representative information\nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11],\
    \ where such data are able to be used for site-\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n\
    5 of 26\nspeciﬁc management to optimize management practices precisely [7]. For\
    \ small-scale\nvariabilities of soil and crop features, a local resource management\
    \ (LRM) system was\ndeveloped with computer-aided farming (CAF), which translated\
    \ information into variable\nrate applications [11].\nThus far, humans have used\
    \ digital tools to enhance diagnosis and decision making\nwhile adding automated\
    \ machines for precise performing [14]. The accelerating changes of\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 plus these digital technologies have granted the gradual automation of the\n\
    diagnosis and decision-making steps, limiting human involvement to only monitoring\n\
    (Figure 1) [6]. This revolution mostly targets optimal farming and variability\
    \ management\nin order to enhance production. However, fulﬁlling the food demand\
    \ should not rely solely\non “more production”. At the same time, it should be\

    \ industries, like\nsocial-networking sites, to learn or predict customer behaviors\

    \ applied to understand data-intensive agri-\ncultural processes for decision\
    \ making [6], where analytic tools operate enormous data\nsets [4]. These analytic\
    \ tools consist of data mining, statistics, AI, predictive analytics,\nneural\
    \ language processing, etc. [4]. Big data science usually functions either with\
    \ ML,\ncloud computing, image processing, modeling and simulation, statistical\
    \ analysis, NDVI\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n7 of 26\nvegetation indices, or\
    \ GIS. These conjugations can discover correlations, patterns, and\ntrends from\
    \ large quantities of data via capturing, storing, exchanging, analyzing, and\n\
    marketing features of this high-performance informatics technology [6]. These\
    \ predictions\nand recommendations assist farmers with handling the upcoming outcomes,\
    \ risks, and\nchallenges in the agricultural industry [4]. Combining the data\
    \ in agricultural production\nprocesses creates traceability of product while\
    \ increasing product quality, including safety\nand taste. As customers are now\
    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n9 of 26\nage [4,13,16,28]. Those sensors can directly\
    \ combine with agricultural robots, autonomous\nplatforms, machines, and weather\

    \ leading to high-quality, high-resolution, and exceptionally reliable\nobservations\
    \ through high-throughput 3D monitoring at different geographical areas. At\n\
    the same time, various kinds of agricultural sensor nodes, autonomous farm vehicles,\
    \ and\nmobile crowd sensing have been put forward based on the IoT for ground\
    \ and undersurface\ncognition [8]. Most IoT sensors in precision agriculture are\
    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\
    \ mobile terminals, and intelligent devices in\nmodern agriculture, the integration\
    \ of machine-learning algorithms has had signiﬁcant\nimprovement. With machine-learning\
    \ models, integration into mobile detection algorithms\nhas paved the way for\
    \ innovative and more precise detection methods, overcoming certain\nlimitations\

    \ and providing accurate predictions of the dynamic nature\nof agriculture while\
    \ identifying new opportunities [1]. Supervised machine-learning\ntechniques,\
    \ such as support vector machines, decision trees, k-means, random forests,\n\
    genetic algorithms, deep learning, and fuzzy logic, are several categories of\
    \ machine-\nlearning models (Figure 3) that play a vital role in agricultural\
    \ automation, augmenting\nthe intelligence of other technologies, such as smartphones,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles,\nunmanned ground vehicles, satellite systems, automated\
    \ machines, agricultural robots,\nand big data analytics [1,28,31].\nMobile applications\
    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\
    \ ML algorithms in big data are also critically essential because this\nintegration\
    \ can learn from data to create decisions, data-based prospects, and predictions.\n\
    Due to the intricate input data requirements of machine learning (ML) and deep\
    \ learning\n(DL), the initial stage of adopting ML models in precision agriculture\
    \ may encounter\nsigniﬁcant obstacles in terms of the time and cost involved in\
    \ gathering the necessary data\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n11 of 26\nfrom commercial\
    \ farms [1,6,30]. However, with the continuous advancement of IoT sensors,\nAI-based\
    \ autonomous machines or robots together with cloud computing, edge computing,\n\
    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\
    \ ML is able to be\nused to solve diverse issues in agriculture related to yield\
    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\
    \ animal welfare, livestock production,\nwater management, and soil management\
    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\
    \ instance-based models, regression, artiﬁcial and deep neural\nnetworks, ensemble\
    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\
    \ Examples are the fuzzy-logic-based soil risk characterization decision support\
    \ system\n(SRCDSS), management-oriented modeling (MOM), artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs),\nCALEX, PROLOG, computer vision systems, ANN-GIS, invasive weed optimization\
    \ (IWO),\nand support vector machines [4]. One key application of AI is a mobile\
    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\

    \ nutrient deﬁciency, \nand weeds, stressed responses are detected using high-quality\
    \ images generated with \nUGV or UAV remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and\
    \ satellite imaging to support \nhigh-throughput phenotyping [57]. Ultimately,\
    \ high-throughput phenotyping has the po-\ntential to revolutionize agriculture\
    \ by enabling more the precise, real-time, and eﬃcient \nmonitoring of farming\
    \ practices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmen-\ntal impacts,\
    \ and increase food security [54]. \n \nFigure 4. Importance of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping in agriculture. \nThe traditional methods of plant breeding have\
    \ limitations in terms of time, cost, and \naccuracy. HTP, on the other hand,\
    \ uses nondestructive and rapid methods to gather data \non a large number of\
    \ plants, allowing breeders to identify traits of interest more eﬃciently \n[58].\
    \ A study by Yang et al. (2017) [59] described using high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ \n(HTP) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic\
    \ architecture \nof maize plant growth. The authors collected data on various\
    \ traits related to plant growth, \nsuch as plant height, leaf area, and biomass,\
    \ using HTP techniques, such as imaging and \nspectroscopy [59]. Unmanned aerial\
    \ systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary \nchange in ﬁeld high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping by providing a platform for diﬀerent sen-\nsors to collect remote-sensing\
    \ data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include regular RGB \ncameras, multispectral-imaging\
    \ cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras, thermal-imag-\ning sensors, and light\
    \ detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors that enable the nondestruc-\ntive estimation\
    \ of plant traits, such as yield, biomass, height, and leaf area index. This is\
    \ a \nsigniﬁcant advancement in agriculture, allowing for the high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping of \ncrops. In comparison to ground-based sensors, UASs increase\
    \ the frequency and through-\nput for phenotyping, while being cost-eﬀective and\
    \ providing high-resolution images as \ncompared to satellite-based techniques.\
    \ The phenotypic traits can be used to select crops \nwith high yield and strong\
    \ stress resistance, such as disease and salt resistance, ultimately \nleading\
    \ to improved production [60]. \nAs technology advances, the future of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping (HTP) appears \npromising. Multiple HTP technologies, such as drones,\
    \ sensors, and artiﬁcial intelligence, \ncan be integrated to facilitate more\
    \ eﬃcient and accurate phenotyping, which can aid \nbreeders in identifying desirable\
    \ traits and making better selections. HTP can also be used \nfor precision agriculture,\

    \ and biomass, using HTP techniques, such as imaging and spec-\ntroscopy [59].\
    \ Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary change\nin\
    \ ﬁeld high-throughput phenotyping by providing a platform for different sensors\
    \ to col-\nlect remote-sensing data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include\
    \ regular RGB cameras,\nmultispectral-imaging cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras,\
    \ thermal-imaging sensors,\nand light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors that\
    \ enable the nondestructive estimation\nof plant traits, such as yield, biomass,\
    \ height, and leaf area index. This is a signiﬁcant\nadvancement in agriculture,\
    \ allowing for the high-throughput phenotyping of crops. In\ncomparison to ground-based\
    \ sensors, UASs increase the frequency and throughput for\nphenotyping, while\
    \ being cost-effective and providing high-resolution images as compared\nto satellite-based\
    \ techniques. The phenotypic traits can be used to select crops with high\nyield\
    \ and strong stress resistance, such as disease and salt resistance, ultimately\
    \ leading to\nimproved production [60].\nAs technology advances, the future of\
    \ high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) appears\npromising. Multiple HTP technologies,\
    \ such as drones, sensors, and artiﬁcial intelligence,\ncan be integrated to facilitate\
    \ more efﬁcient and accurate phenotyping, which can aid\nbreeders in identifying\
    \ desirable traits and making better selections. HTP can also be\nused for precision\
    \ agriculture, where farmers can leverage data generated using HTP\ntechnologies\
    \ to make informed decisions on inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and water\n\
    to increase efﬁciency, reduce waste, and improve yield. HTP can also play a crucial\
    \ role\nin climate change research by identifying crop varieties that can better\
    \ adapt to changing\nclimate conditions, thereby ensuring food security. Lastly,\
    \ HTP can be used in developing\ncountries to enhance food security and improve\
    \ crop productivity, but it requires the\ndevelopment of affordable and accessible\
    \ HTP technologies that can be easily adopted by\nfarmers in those countries [56,58,59].\n\

    \ [61]. The transformative\npotential of 5G and beyond mobile networks in driving\
    \ business and societal change is\nbeing recognized. Considering environmental\
    \ concerns and climate change, the role of\nmobile networks in fostering sustainability\
    \ and innovation is questioned. Sectors like smart\nagriculture, forestry, biodiversity\
    \ monitoring, and water management are crucial for sus-\ntainable resource utilization.\
    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\
    \ domains [34]. As an example, a study in Thailand designed telematics-equipped\n\
    tractors to assist farmers in efﬁciently managing their machinery, optimizing\
    \ performance\nand enhancing overall productivity. In addition to improved management\
    \ capabilities,\nthese tractors offered features such as theft prevention, effective\
    \ maintenance monitoring,\nand machine operation tracking [62].\n4. Studies of\
    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\
    \ thinning and pruning. This system addressed\nlabor shortages, reduced fruit\
    \ production costs by approximately 30%, provided real-time\nupdates to farmers\
    \ via a mobile app, and aimed to tackle challenges faced by the agriculture\n\
    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\
    \ in\nthe cloud, reducing costs and improving productivity. Experimental validation\
    \ conﬁrmed\nthe effectiveness of the model for crop prediction and soil health\
    \ maintenance, emphasizing\nthe importance of real-time data collection and expanding\
    \ data sets and regular application\nuse for informed decision making and soil\
    \ quality enhancement [49]. The use of unmanned\naerial systems (UASs) and unmanned\
    \ ground vehicles (UGVs) in precision agriculture for\ninspecting insect traps\
    \ in olive groves was proposed by [49], with a cooperative robot archi-\ntecture\
    \ using UAS and UGV systems evaluating vision-based navigation algorithms and\n\
    augmented reality tags for return and landing. The results demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ of\nthe architecture for automating inspections and improving pest control policies.\
    \ Challenges\nremain in addressing real-world conditions and optimizing image\
    \ capture. Future work\nincludes real-world scenarios and long-term mission capabilities\
    \ of UAS vehicles [49].\nTwo studies from University Tenaga National, Malaysia,\
    \ present autonomous and\nrobotic machineries to deal with fertilizer and pesticide\
    \ spraying. The authors of [67]\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n16 of 26\npresented\
    \ a low-cost agricultural robot for fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,\n\
    and pest detection. The prototype system operated autonomously, reducing labor\
    \ costs,\nalthough productivity slightly lagged behind human workers. An autonomous\
    \ organic\nfertilizer mixer was developed in [68] based on IoT technology to reduce\
    \ labor costs and\nenhance efﬁciency. The improved mixer allowed remote monitoring,\
    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\
    \ by the Beijing Research Center\nof Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture. This\
    \ new harvesting robot system for cherry\ntomatoes was designed featuring a railed-type\
    \ vehicle, a visual servo unit, a manipulator,\nand picking end-effectors. Field\
    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\
    \ for\ndifferent seed sizes (Table 2).\nThe Cooperative Heterogeneous Robots for\
    \ Autonomous Insects Trap Monitoring\nSystem experiment in Portugal proposed a\
    \ cooperative UAS and UGV system for olive\ngrove inspection that veriﬁed the\
    \ feasibility and robustness of the multiple-cooperative\nrobot architecture in\
    \ an olive inspection scenario [49]. Russian researchers Filipe et al. [7]\nproposed\
    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\
    \ agriculture tasks,\nensuring transparency and veriﬁcation at each stage. Precision\
    \ agriculture is a strategy that\nuses advanced technologies, like sensors, remote\
    \ sensing, and data analytics, to improve\nagricultural management decisions and\
    \ increase productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainabil-\nity. Machine-learning\
    \ models have been integrated with IoT sensors to develop intelligent\nsensors\
    \ for generating of big amount of data. In the study of Smolka et al. [71], a\
    \ microchip\ncapillary electrophoresis sensor was used for soil nutrient analysis,\
    \ demonstrating its gen-\neral sensitivity to ions in liquids, particularly NO3,\
    \ NH4, K, and PO4. The sensor exhibited\nstrong linearity and detected important\
    \ plant nutrients, which could contribute to future\ndevelopments in digital agriculture.\
    \ Insufﬁcient power infrastructure is one obstacle in\nadapting novel technologies\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds. Researchers successfully developed an\nIoT-based solar-energy-powered\
    \ smart farm irrigation system in the United Arab Emirates\nthat harvested renewable\
    \ energy for smart farm irrigation [72]. This study outcome paved\nthe way to\
    \ developing three operation modes that are available for farmers’ use.\nVRT is\
    \ a major constituent in precision agriculture that deploys ﬁeld maps, GPSs, and\n\
    GNSSs to establish the precision of input applications. A study of a data fusion\
    \ method\nfor yield and soil sensor maps [21] evaluated fusion results on ﬁelds,\
    \ highlighting their\nusefulness in decision support for drainage, irrigation,\
    \ and variable yield goals. It un-\ncovered hidden areas of lost yield potential\
    \ using soil sensing, EC, pH, organic matter,\nand topography data fusion. Researchers\
    \ in Beijing, China, developed a new method\nusing image segmentation and pixel-level\
    \ visual features to accurately classify ﬁeld and\nroad areas in GNSS recordings\
    \ of agricultural machinery, surpassing existing methods\nand demonstrating a\
    \ superior performance for high-frequency GNSS trajectories [46]. A\nmultisensor\
    \ data fusion approach was used by Whattoff et al. for creating variable depth\n\
    tillage zones [27]. Variable depth tillage (VDT) reduced costs, labor, and fuel\
    \ consumption.\nA multisensor data fusion approach was developed to map soil properties\
    \ for VDT imple-\nmentation, showing the depth of tillage needed in different\
    \ areas. This approach proved\nuseful in guiding VDT operations for efﬁcient soil\
    \ management.\nOne study in Germany integrated computer-aided farming, an IoT-based\
    \ pH sensor,\nand VRT for effective VR liming, and the lime requirement was successfully\
    \ determined\nin situ by establishing a buffer curve [11]. A ﬁeld evaluation of\
    \ a VR aerial application\nwas conducted in the study of Martin and Yang [23]\
    \ utilizing prescription maps for aerial\nglyphosate applications with variable\
    \ rate nozzles. Accurate spray deposition within 20 feet\nAgriculture 2023, 13,\
    \ 1593\n17 of 26\nof the target was conﬁrmed using multispectral imagery, boosting\
    \ conﬁdence in variable\nrate application and encouraging adoption. Italian authors\
    \ Corbari et al. [73] explored the\nintegration of a satellite-driven soil–water\
    \ balance model and meteorological forecasts to\nenable precision smart irrigation.\
    \ It discussed model performance and emphasized the\nimportance of using consistent\
    \ data for the calibration and validation of soil hydrological\nparameters [73].\
    \ The short communication of Jang et al. [22], “Spatial Dependence Analysis\n\
    as a Tool to Detect the Hidden Heterogeneity in a Kenaf Field”, presented high-throughput\n\
    phenotyping as having potential in precision agriculture. This study demonstrated\
    \ its\napplication for revealing ﬁeld heterogeneity and suggested its use for\
    \ better analysis and\nmanagement in plant breeding and precision agriculture.\
    \ In [57], Kim et al. emphasized\nthe importance of evaluating drought effects\
    \ during the vegetative stages of soybean,\nindicating the potential of using\
    \ phenotypic traits as selection indicators for breeding\ndrought-resistant soybean\
    \ cultivars, especially considering the escalating crop damage\ncaused by drought\
    \ and global warming.\nAnother study asserted precision agricultural applications\
    \ in agroforestry. Tree species\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation is important\
    \ when combatting climate change, as well as\nmonitoring ecosystem health 17.\
    \ Researchers used images from SENTINEL-2 to propose\nmethods to determine tree\
    \ type distribution in a wide forest area using UAV images [14,17].\nThey effectively\
    \ distinguished evergreen, deciduous trees, and grassland areas, aiding in\nforest\
    \ planning and preparing for climate change impacts. Ma et al. [14] used a random\n\
    forest classiﬁer with satellite images to improve texture feature separation among\
    \ tree\nspecies. The overall classiﬁcation achieved 86.49% accuracy and a 0.83\
    \ Kappa coefﬁcient,\nalthough altitude, slope, and aspect inﬂuenced tree distribution.\
    \ These outcomes were\nimportant in species classiﬁcation and biodiversity monitoring,\
    \ as well as in informing\ninventory estimation [14].\nAn evaluation of soybean\
    \ wildﬁre prediction via hyperspectral transmission imag-\ning was performed with\
    \ Python, which detected bacterial wildﬁre in soybean leaves\nwhere different\
    \ varieties exhibited distinct spectral signatures. This allowed the precise\n\
    detection and differentiation of healthy and diseased plants effectively with\
    \ high accu-\nracy (97.19% and 95.69%) in early disease detection, conﬁrming its\
    \ usefulness in soybean\nplant monitoring [32].\nAasim et al. [44] focused on\
    \ establishing the efﬁcient and reproducible in vitro re-\ngeneration of common\
    \ beans through a combined approach of in vitro regeneration and\nmachine-learning\
    \ algorithms. ML models, particularly ANN algorithms, were used for\nprediction\
    \ and optimization. The ML and ANN models demonstrated superior perfor-\nmances,\
    \ proving their efﬁcacy in analyzing and optimizing complex conditions in plant\n\
    tissue culture protocols for breeding purposes.\nA computer vision and deep-learning-enabled\
    \ weed detection model for precision\nagriculture was proposed in [25] integrating\
    \ computer vision, DL, the IoT and a smartphone.\nThe proposed CVDL-WDC technique\
    \ combined multiscale object detection and ELM-based\nweed classiﬁcation. The\
    \ results showed improved outcomes over recent approaches, and\nfuture extensions\
    \ included integration with IoT and smartphones.\nAt the same time, a novel procedure\
    \ involving machine learning and UAV-based\nimagery was developed to accurately\
    \ identify crops and weeds, offering potential integra-\ntion into autonomous\
    \ weed management systems and contributing to improved precision\nagriculture\
    \ practices with reduced resource consumption [45].\nAt Sairam Institute of Technology\
    \ in India, a ﬂood detection system based on the\nIoT, big data, and a convolutional\
    \ deep neural network (CDNN) was developed [30].\nThe CDNN algorithm demonstrated\
    \ superior accuracy, achieving an impressive accu-\nracy of 93.23%, a sensitivity\
    \ of 91.43%, a speciﬁcity of 91.56%, a precision of 92.23%,\na recall of 90.36%,\
    \ and an F-score of 91.28% with a data set of 500. The ﬂood detec-\ntion system\
    \ outperformed existing methods and holds potential for further enhancement\n\
    through the integration of IoT devices and advanced algorithms, ensuring improved\
    \ ﬂood\ndetection capabilities.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n18 of 26\nIn order\
    \ to alleviate the strain on agri-food production, the introduction of alternative\n\
    nutrient sources can be explored, particularly through the utilization of cultured\
    \ meat and\n3D-printed meat as substitutes for traditional animal meats, thus\
    \ reducing the demand on\nanimal husbandry. In China, the production of lab-grown\
    \ meat using muscle stem cells\nnecessitated edible 3D scaffolds created through\
    \ electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing,\nshowcasing the signiﬁcant potential of\
    \ prolamin scaffolds for cultivating cultured meat [74].\nSimilarly, the construction\
    \ of 3D-printed meat analogs from plant-based proteins has been\nconducted, improving\
    \ the printing performance of soy protein- and gluten-based pastes\nfacilitated\
    \ by rice protein. This study examined the rheological properties and printing\n\
    performances of edible inks made from soy protein isolate (SPI), wheat gluten\
    \ (WG),\nand rice protein (RP). Increasing the proportion of rice protein improved\
    \ the 3D-printing\nperformance, holding potential for the 3D printing of plant-based\
    \ foods and constructing\nmeat analogs simulating real meat properties [75].\n\
    Several studies have shown why the adaption rate of these studies is slow, and\n\
    one case study conducted in Chumphon Province, Thailand, by Kasetsart University\n\
    examined the adoption of smart farming technology among durian farmers, highlighting\n\
    that factors such as age, occupation, access to extension services, and farm size\
    \ inﬂuenced\ntechnology adoption, with younger farmers having larger farms being\
    \ more inclined to\nadopt technology, resulting in decreased labor and fertilizer\
    \ expenses, which emphasized\nthe importance of providing continuous training\

    \ Agriculture\nHigh-tech technologies from the fourth industrial revolution have\
    \ the potential to\nrevolutionize the agriculture industry, enabling more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n22 of 26\n6. Future Developments Required\nIn recent\
    \ years, the agricultural sector has recognized the potential beneﬁts of adopting\n\
    new digital technologies. However, the slow rate of adaptation can be attributed\
    \ to several\nroadblocks and uncertainties associated with these advancements.\
    \ Despite the challenges,\nthere is a growing demand for organic foods [78], leading\
    \ to a shift from sustainable\nagriculture to smart organic farming. To capitalize\
    \ on this emerging opportunity, certain\nsteps need to be taken.\nOne crucial\
    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\
    \ novel agricultural\napproaches, we can pave the way for a more efﬁcient, sustainable,\
    \ and productive future\nin agriculture.\n7. Conclusions\nPrecision agriculture,\
    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\
    \ paper serves as a valuable resource for farmers and companies seeking\nto adopt\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. By providing insights into IoT devices,\n\
    automation systems, data analytics, and precision-farming techniques, this paper\
    \ fos-\nters awareness and understanding of the opportunities and challenges in\
    \ smart farming.\nArmed with this knowledge, companies can make informed decisions\
    \ regarding technology\ninvestments and strategic planning while promoting sustainable\
    \ farming practices and\ncollaboration within the industry. By embracing Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies, farmers and\ncompanies can enhance their agricultural operations,\
    \ optimize resource utilization, and\ncontribute to the collective progress toward\
    \ smart farming’s promising future.\nAuthor Contributions: E.M.B.M.K., A.T.L.,\

    Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) as refers to a network of devices that have\
    \ the ability to connect,\ncollect and exchange data with other devices over the\
    \ Internet. IoT is a revolutionary technology\nthat have tremendous applications\
    \ in numerous ﬁelds of engineering and sciences such as logistics,\nhealthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, oil and gas industries and agriculture. In agriculture ﬁeld, the farmer\
    \ still used\nconventional agriculture methods resulting in low crop and fruit\
    \ yields. The integration of IoT in\nconventional agriculture methods has led\
    \ to signiﬁcant developments in agriculture ﬁeld. Different\nsensors and IoT devices\
    \ are providing services to automate agriculture precision and to monitor crop\n\
    conditions. These IoT devices are deployed in agriculture environment to increase\
    \ yields production\nby making smart farming decisions and to collect data regarding\
    \ crops temperature, humidity\nand irrigation systems. However, the integration\
    \ of IoT and smart communication technologies in\nagriculture environment introduces\
    \ cyber security attacks and vulnerabilities. Such cyber attacks\nhave the capability\
    \ to adversely affect the countries’ economies that are heavily reliant on agriculture.\n\
    On the other hand, these IoT devices are resource constrained having limited memory\
    \ and power\ncapabilities and cannot be secured using conventional cyber security\
    \ protocols. Therefore, designing\nrobust and efﬁcient secure framework for smart\
    \ agriculture are required. In this paper, a Cyber\nSecured Framework for Smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSFSA) is proposed. The proposed CSFSA presents a\nrobust and tamper\
    \ resistant authentication scheme for IoT devices using Constrained Application\n\
    Protocol (CoAP) to ensure the data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA\
    \ is demonstrated\nin Contiki NG simulation tool and greatly reduces packet size,\
    \ communication overhead and power\nconsumption. The performance of proposed CSFSA\
    \ is computationally efﬁcient and is resilient against\nvarious cyber security\
    \ attacks i.e., replay attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; authentication; security; agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    With the recent advancements in communication and physical sciences, it is now\n\
    possible to connect physical objects to the Internet from any place any time for\
    \ anything\nwithout human intervention by making everything smart. This advancement\
    \ is referred to\nas the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. One of this century’s key\
    \ technological development\nhas been the IoT, which is still in its fancy stages.\
    \ In the coming years, this development is\nexpected to hit a big ﬁgure. By the\
    \ end of 2024, 62 billion IoT devices are expected to exist [2].\nAccording to\
    \ Statista report, it is predicted that this number will rise to 75.4 billion\
    \ by 2025.\nThe signiﬁcance of the IoT system has been acknowledged by major international\
    \ standards\nbodies, thereby ensuring development towards the proper functionality,\
    \ ﬂexibility and\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11060963\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n2 of 19\n\
    compatibility of this system. Due to which IoT is making an impact in the majority\n\
    of the ﬁelds i.e., healthcare, trafﬁc, logistics, oil and gas industries and agriculture\
    \ [3].\nThe IoT enables devices with a variety of features and capabilities to\
    \ connect to the Internet.\nThe rapid rise of IoT applications results to a tremendous\
    \ increase in the number of IoT\ndevices connected to the worldwide network as\
    \ well as network trafﬁc over conventional\nnetwork. Due to its constrained nature,\
    \ the IoT growth adds more security challenges to the\nconventional network, as\
    \ the conventional communication network already faces various\nsecurity challenges.\
    \ Different IoT devices are not constructed to the necessary security\nrequirements,\
    \ resulting in huge security breaches [4].\nFood consciousness has grown amongst\
    \ the people lately with the exponential increase\nof the food industries and\
    \ radical improvements in individuals’ dietary behaviors and\nways of life [5].\
    \ People nowadays are more worried about the quality and safety of the food\n\
    they consume. Food safety is perceived to include food that is liberated from\
    \ contaminants\nand chemicals that may cause the development of microscopic organisms\
    \ destructive to\nindividuals’ safety and lives [6]. Agriculture systems has a\
    \ signiﬁcant impact on a country’s\neconomic growth as it is the main source of\
    \ food. According to report published by the\nUnited Nations’ Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization [7], a signiﬁcant portion of food waste\nhappens due to various\
    \ variables during the pre-harvesting, harvest and even post-harvest\nstages and\
    \ as well the extent of its inﬂuence on the economy, environment, health and\n\
    survival of human race. According to a UN report, the world population is estimated\
    \ to\nsurpass 9 billion humans being by the end of 2050, an increase of about\
    \ a third over the\ncurrent population [8]. More than half of this increase will\
    \ occur in Pakistan, Nigeria, India,\nIndonesia, Ethiopia, the United Republic\
    \ of Tanzania, Egypt, and the United States. Such\nrise in population necessitates\
    \ a nearly 70 percent increase in food production rate. This\nfast growing population\
    \ brings with it a slew of additional challenges, including increased\ncompetition\
    \ and overuse of land, water and also other natural resources. These challenges\n\
    highlight critical need to minimize food system’s reliance on our environment.\
    \ As a\nresult, in order to meet the expanding need for food and crop production,\
    \ an evolutionary\nagricultural paradigm is required to ensure long-term development.\
    \ In an agricultural\nﬁeld, a smart sensing system is necessary to integrate the\
    \ status of the ﬁeld, its inﬂuence\non ﬁeld productivity, and to determine the\
    \ actions that must be taken on the ﬁeld for a\ngood outcome of a good produce.\
    \ A smart sensing environment is made up of a system\nof connected devices that\
    \ can constantly send and receive data from one another. It can\nalso make decisions\
    \ on behalf of a user and take action to enhance the environment [9].\nThis shift\
    \ in the environment necessitates more constant monitoring of the surroundings,\n\
    resulting in an ever-changing environment.\nAgriculture plays an important role\
    \ in country’s economic growth and it is the basis\nfor human species. Conventional\
    \ agricultural methods are still being used by farmers,\nresulting in low crop\
    \ and fruit yields. As a result, integrating IoT technologies can boost\ncrop\
    \ productivity. IoT is an essential part of the smart agriculture architecture.\
    \ With the\nintegration of IoT devices, the agriculture systems have been monitored\
    \ 24/7. These IoT\ndevices sense the surrounding environment and physical parameters\
    \ to take sensed infor-\nmation. Such sensed information is then sent to the backend\
    \ server via Internet or through\nsensor gateway, where date is stored for future\
    \ use or even user can view that sensed data.\nThe user can make decisions about\
    \ what actions to do in such a monitored environment.\nHowever, it’s not an easy\
    \ task to integrate everyday devices with the Internet. Security\nis a big challenge\
    \ faced by IoT, although each device has its unique set of characteristics\nand\
    \ requirements. First of all, each person, device and system which is connected\
    \ to the\nInternet must be identiﬁed. Intruders will acquire access to the network\
    \ and perform\nsecurity breaches if they do not have a valid identity.\nIn case\
    \ of smart agriculture systems, if information of sensors monitoring the agricul-\n\
    ture parameters is leaked, lost or tampered with, it can render the products useless\
    \ and\ndamage their value signiﬁcantly hence resulting in huge economic food loss.\
    \ Therefore,\ndeveloping a concrete framework for secure monitoring of smart agriculture\
    \ with the adap-\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n3 of 19\ntion of IoT devices is an\
    \ essential requirement of this era. Since IoT devices are designed to\nbe compact\
    \ and cost effective, because they have limited computing power and memory.\n\
    Their resource constrained nature makes it difﬁcult to secure them and has necessitated\n\
    the development of lightweight application protocols and security suites. Instead\
    \ of using\nstandard TCP/IP protocols i.e., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\
    \ and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS), these devices use the IoT protocol stack,\
    \ which is a lightweight version of\nthe TCP/IP model specially designed for IoT\
    \ devices. The CoAP has been standardized as\nlightweight application protocol\
    \ for IoT systems. However, developing a low-overhead\nsecurity solution for CoAP\
    \ remains a challenge. Though some security protocols i.e., stan-\ndard Datagram\
    \ Transport Layer Security protocol (DTLS) exists. However, it is not suitable\n\
    for IoT constrained devices and is expensive due to its computational overhead,\
    \ complexity\nand lengthy cipher suites process. Therefore, this paper proposed\
    \ a robust and lightweight\nsecure authentication framework in CoAP using symmetric\
    \ encryption i.e., Advanced\nEncryption System (AES) and HMAC-SHA-224. The main\
    \ contribution of this paper is\nto design robust and tamper-resistant secure\
    \ authentication framework for agriculture\napplication using CoAP by ensuring\
    \ data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA\nis implemented in Contiki\
    \ NG and Cooja simulator and evaluated performances in terms\nof packet size,\
    \ communication overhead and power consumption. The signiﬁcance of\nproposed CSFSA\
    \ is to make resilient against various cyber security attacks i.e., replay\nattacks,\
    \ Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion.\nThe proposed CSFSA provides\
    \ secure monitoring of various agriculture parameters\nremotely. The architecture\
    \ of proposed CSFSA has three modules i.e., 6LoWPAN based\ninternal network having\
    \ IoT devices deployed in agriculture ﬁeld for monitoring and\ncontrolling, a\
    \ border router which acts as bridge between Internal network and external\nnetwork\
    \ i.e., Internet and a web server that provides access to the sensed data as shown\
    \ in\nFigure 1.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides brief\
    \ explanation of literature\nreview that has been done in smart agriculture, IoT\
    \ and CoAP security. Section 3 provides\nan in-depth overview of standards and\
    \ protocols pertinent to our research work. Proposed\nmethodology is presented\
    \ in Section 4. Simulation and results evaluation is discussed in\nSection 5.\

    \ in the ﬁeld of CoAP\nsecurity, IoT security, various authentication techniques\
    \ used between IoT devices and\nagriculture sector.\nThe Hyper Text Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP) is an application layer protocol used by the\nWorld Wide Web to access\
    \ data on Internet and uses the Representational State Transfer\n(REST) architecture.\
    \ The HTTP request and response messages exchange data between\nHTTP server and\
    \ client [10]. This protocol is not suitable for IoT and cannot be implemented\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n4 of 19\non IoT devices due to computational overhead.\
    \ As a result, a lightweight and efﬁcient\nprotocol for constrained devices is\
    \ required. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\nConstrained RESTful Environment\
    \ (CoRE) working group has standardized lightweight\napplication protocol for\
    \ IoT systems i.e., CoAP. It is a specialized web transfer protocol,\nspecially\
    \ designed for resource constrained applications. In [11], the authors compared\
    \ the\nCoAP and HTTP protocol and evaluated their performances based on energy\
    \ consumption,\nbattery life and amount of bytes exchanged per session as shown\
    \ in Table 1.\nTable 1. HTTP and CoAP comparison based on resource consumption.\n\

    CoAP\n154\n0.744 mW\n151 days\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is used for securing\
    \ HTTP communication over Trans-\nmission Control Protocol (TCP). The CoAP communication\
    \ over User Datagram Protocol\n(UDP) is secured by using DTLS. However standard\
    \ DTLS is not suitable for constrained\nnetworks due to its computational overhead,\
    \ complexity and handshake session overhead.\nIn [12], the authors provided brief\
    \ overview of layered architecture of IoT and security\nvulnerabilities at each\
    \ layer. They discussed in details various communication technologies\nalong with\
    \ their features and limitations which are being used by IoT applications. They\n\
    also reviewed the existing security mechanisms with their limitations to secure\
    \ the IoT envi-\nronment. In [13], the authors presented two-way authentication\
    \ scheme based on DTLS and\nRSA cryptographic algorithm. DTLS protocol is implemented\
    \ in context of system architec-\nture to achieve low overhead and high interoperability.\
    \ However, due to the deployment of\nRSA encryption, the computational overhead\
    \ required by their handshake process requires\nmore energy. Shahid et al. [14]\
    \ presented lightweight secure CoAP i.e., Lithe for securing\nIoT devices communication.\
    \ This work provided secure framework by integrating CoAP\nand DTLS. The standard\
    \ DTLS is not suitable for constrained devices. The proposed scheme\nused the\
    \ DTLS header compression by leveraging 6LoWPAN standard and signiﬁcantly\nreduced\
    \ the energy consumption. The results showed that compressed DTLS performs\nbetter\
    \ in terms of energy efﬁciency, network response time, packet size and processing\
    \ time.\nIn [15], the proposed framework enables the communication between android\
    \ phones\nusing DTLS secured CoAP. This framework combines other algorithms with\
    \ DTLS that are\nnot applicable on resource constrained IoT devices. DTLS requires\
    \ public key cryptography\nwhich is a computationally expensive process and a\
    \ lengthy handshake process [16]. Al-\nthough there are certain security algorithms\
    \ which are lightweight and have less overhead\nsuch as raw public key, at least\
    \ 25 bytes per-packet overhead of DTLS takes up one-third\nof a frame. DTLS heavily\
    \ hinders the performance in terms of round-trip messages when\nretroﬁtted to\
    \ CoAP [17].\nThe authors Raza et al. [18], present a scheme for making the implementation\
    \ secure\nCoAP lightweight by applying header compression techniques. Although\
    \ header com-\npression does not offer an improvement in performance because DTLS\
    \ is computationally\nintensive. The authors Freeman et al. [19] propose a plan\
    \ that enables the client to assign\na certiﬁcate path and construction as well\
    \ as the validation of the certiﬁcation path to a\nserver. However, this protocol\
    \ is expected to be used over HTTP. This protocol relies on\nthird-party instead\
    \ of communication parties and adds a heavy communication overhead.\nIn [13],\
    \ a framework for the end-to-end security of IoT has been presented. The authors\n\
    have used DTLS in combination with other standard protocols such as RSA. The use\
    \ of RSA\nadds a high computational complexity and overhead to the network. In\
    \ addition to that,\nthe authentication handshake process in DTLS in which the\
    \ client and server authenticate\neach other takes in excess of three round trips.\
    \ Authors of [20] have suggested a technique\nfor lightweight authentication using\
    \ Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). In this tech-\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n\
    5 of 19\nnique, the client and server ensure the identity of the devices based\
    \ on the message payload.\nDuring this process, a total of four messages are exchanged\
    \ between the client and server.\nIn [21] Park et al. have presented an implementation\
    \ of an architecture that uses a\ndelegation method to send and receive messages.\
    \ In this implementation, a Secure Service\nManager (SSM) is used in the handshake\
    \ process. This system requires the SSM, sensors\nand trust manager to be located\
    \ in a constrained network. Hence it may not be suitable\nfor all kinds of IoT\
    \ setups. In [22], Granjal et al. propose a plan for end-to-end security by\n\
    using DTLS algorithm. This system uses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to\
    \ encrypt\ndata in resource constrained nodes. Although ECC consumes less power\
    \ and memory\ncompared to other public key encryption algorithms, it still uses\
    \ up more resources than\nthe symmetric key encryption algorithms [23]. Using\
    \ complex cipher suites for encryption\nresults in high energy consumption. The\
    \ authors have used a symmetric key cryptography\nalgorithm, AES to replace DTLS\
    \ in the authentication process. AES performs a four-way\nhandshake between the\
    \ CoAP based server and CoAP client. This process adds two header\noptions in\
    \ the CoAP packet for enabling secure mode.\nIn [24], the authors present a scheme\
    \ for the authentication between client and server\nby modifying the header of\
    \ the CoAP packets. AES 128 is used for the encryption process\nand UDP protocol\
    \ is used without DTLS in the transport layer. This scheme reduces the\nnumber\
    \ of messages required for authentication between two parties without any loss\n\
    in the overall efﬁciency. In [25], the various advantages of the new features\
    \ of “Future\nInternet” are described, which greatly beneﬁts farm management techniques.\
    \ The “Future\nInternet” programme overcomes the limitations of the already existing\
    \ Internet. These\nbeneﬁts include generic software modules that can be modiﬁed\
    \ to build speciﬁc modules\nrelated to farming. The main architecture of the farm\
    \ management system is speciﬁed,\ndepending on which model is stored in the cloud.\n\
    Tanmay Baranwal et al. [26] the main focus of this paper is to protect and secure\n\
    agricultural goods from rodents and insects in storage units and ﬁelds. Real-time\
    \ security\nsystems are used, which provide notiﬁcations as soon as an issue is\
    \ identiﬁed. Python\nscripts are used to integrate the various electronic devices\
    \ and sensors. The algorithm of\nthis system is based on data collection to achieve\
    \ accuracy in alerting the user and starting\nthe repellent. The system is tested\
    \ in a 10 m², the device is ﬁxed in a corner during the\ntesting. As the PIR sensor\
    \ senses heat, it immediately starts the URD sensor and starts\nvideo recording\
    \ through a webcam. The accuracy achieved from these test cases reaches up\nto\
    \ 84.8%. It will be beneﬁcial to incorporate the security system in storage units\
    \ to prevent\nrodents from attacking the goods. LIU Dan et al. [27] this paper\
    \ emphasizes on the role of\ngreenhouse technology in the agricultural ﬁeld and\
    \ presents the design and development\nof an environment monitoring system. This\
    \ system makes use of ZigBee technology and\nCC2530 chip. Data collection, processing\
    \ and communication by the wireless sensors and\nnodes is done by using the CC2530F256\
    \ core. The proposed monitoring system gives real-\ntime information to the user\
    \ regarding different parameters such as temperature control\nand fan condition\
    \ etc. This system utilizes intelligent greenhouse monitoring and control\ntechniques\
    \ and helps the farmers to produce balanced and scientiﬁc crops.\nNikesh Gondchawar\
    \ et al. [28] proposes a smart agriculture system based on IoT and\nautomation\
    \ techniques. The proposed system uses a remotely controllable robot based on\n\
    GPS to execute tasks such as weeding, spraying pesticides and monitoring moisture\
    \ levels\netc. The proposed system also incorporates smart irrigation techniques\
    \ through intelligent\ndecision making based on real-time data from the ﬁelds.\
    \ In addition to that, it also includes\nsmart warehouse management modules. It\
    \ observes the temperature, humidity as well\nas theft detection in the warehouse.\
    \ The system architecture includes various sensors,\ncameras, ZigBee devices,\
    \ actuators with microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. This system\nalerts the user\
    \ regarding irrigation and storage problems and uses a remotely controllable\n\
    robot for smart irrigation and warehouse management.\nAgostino Forestiero [29]\
    \ proposes an activity footprints based method to detect anoma-\nlies in IoT by\
    \ exploiting a multiagent algorithm. The method allows real-valued vectors to\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n6 of 19\nbe used to map sequences of speciﬁc device\
    \ activity (digital footprints). The vectors are\ngiven to mobile agents, who\
    \ act according to a modiﬁed bio-inspired model for each of\nthem. On the basis\
    \ of simple local movement rules observed by all agents onto a virtual\n2D space,\
    \ this model allows intelligent global behaviour to evolve. In [30], the authors\n\
    proposes an agent-based algorithm for achieving a distributed resources organization\n\
    in an IoT environment. In order to map the IoT objects, a natural language processing\n\
    approach was used, which was able to capture the semantic context and represent\
    \ things\nwith high-dimensional vectors, allowing advanced agents to operate.\
    \ In a highly dynamic\nand, essentially, unstructured environment, the growing\
    \ organised virtual structure, i.e., a\nsimilarity-based overlay network of agents,\
    \ allows for the development of informed re-\nsource selection/discovery services,\
    \ making them more efﬁcient. The approach’s validity\nhas been conﬁrmed by preliminary\
    \ results.\nMarco Lombardi et al. [31] proposed a preliminary study case of a\
    \ probabilistic\napproach in an intrusion detection system over the CAN-bus to\
    \ guarantee cyber security\ninside connected vehicles. An innovative two-step\
    \ detection algorithm has been used to\nexploit both the variation of the status\
    \ parameters of the various ECUs over time and the\nBayesian networks which can\
    \ identify a possible attack. Starting from a domain analysis\nis possible to\
    \ ﬁnd out what are the parameters of interests and how these are related to\n\
    each other. Marco Lombardi et al. [3] provided brief overview of IoT regarding\
    \ current\narchitectures, technologies, protocols, and applications. They discussed\
    \ in details various\napplications which is based on IoT i.e., smart Cities, smart\
    \ roads, and smart industries.\nExiting security protocols i.e., standard Datagram\
    \ Transport Layer Security protocol\n(DTLS) is not suitable for IoT constrained\
    \ devices and is expensive due to its computational\noverhead, complexity and\
    \ lengthy cipher suites process. However, the DTLS protocol\nneeds to be modiﬁed\
    \ in such a way that it’s feasible for resource constrained devices.\nHence, researchers\
    \ are looking for alternative security frameworks to replace DTLS. In this\nresearch\
    \ work, we propose a lightweight and robust authentication framework for agri-\n\
    culture application and evaluate its performance to show that it is feasible for\
    \ constrained\nIoT devices.\n3. Background\nThis section provides an in-depth\
    \ description of IoT layered architecture, CoAP ar-\nchitecture, proposed framework\
    \ architecture, standard and protocols related to our re-\nsearch work.\n3.1.\
    \ Iot Protocol Stack Development\nThe IoT protocol stack is a critical component\
    \ of IoT technology because it allows\nhardware to communicate data in a structured\
    \ and useful way. In recent years, the IoT\nhas seen an uptick in a variety of\
    \ applications, such as smart homes, smart health, smart\nagriculture, and smart\
    \ logistics, where each application has its own properties and resource\nrequirements,\
    \ as well as its own protocols to match its objectives [32].\nIoT protocols are\
    \ classiﬁed based on the role they play in the network. Table 2\nshows the logical\
    \ layering of protocol hierarchies used in network communications nowa-\ndays.\
    \ The following is a comparison of the protocols for each layer in the protocol\
    \ stack\nto determine which one is best for the smart agriculture scenario in\
    \ terms of efﬁciency\nand productivity.\nTable 2. IoT Communication Protocols.\n\
    Application Layer\nCoAP, MQTT, MQTT-SN and XMPP\nNetwork Layer\n6LoWPAN, ZigBee\
    \ and BLE\nLink Layer\nIEEE 802.15.4, 802.11 a/b/g/n/ad/ac and 802.15.1\nElectronics\
    \ 2022, 11, 963\n7 of 19\n3.1.1. Application Layer Protocols Comparison\nCoAP,\
    \ MQTT, MQTT-SN, and XMPP are the most often used application layer pro-\ntocols\
    \ in IoT. The following paragraphs offer a comparative review to choose an ideal\n\
    application layer protocol for smart agriculture based on their advantages and\
    \ limitations.\nConstrained Application protocol (CoAP) is a web transfer protocol\
    \ that is designed\nto be a lightweight version of HTTP based on Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST).\nCoAP runs over UDP, eliminating most of the TCP overhead\
    \ of HTTP, decreasing the\nbandwidth requirements, providing more simplicity,\
    \ and makes it more appropriate for\nsmart agriculture applications. CoAP is built\
    \ upon the request/response model and\nsupports methods such as GET, PUT, POST,\
    \ and DELETE as well as unicast and multicast\ntransmission. CoAP is efﬁcient\
    \ in terms of infrastructure, bandwidth and power usage [33].\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is another protocol designed for\nresource constraint\
    \ devices by IBM. It is based on an asynchronous publish/subscribe\nprotocol that\
    \ runs over TCP. The message pattern in MQTT includes a broker, publisher and\n\
    subscriber. The broker is tasked with controlling and distributing of data packets\
    \ between\nsubscribers and publishers. The addition of TCP makes it much more\
    \ reliable, however it\nadds more latency and causes a higher bandwidth and power\
    \ consumption. Hence, it is\nnot recommended for real time applications.\nMQTT-SN\
    \ is a modiﬁed version of MQTT, designed especially for sensor networks. It\n\
    uses UDP instead of TCP to minimize the drawbacks of MQTT but its core infrastructure\n\
    is the same as MQTT. The main difference between the two is that, MQTT-SN requires\n\
    a gateway to translate all MQTT-SN messages over UDP to MQTT messages over TCP.\n\
    Currently, this functionality is integrated within the brokers [34]. This extra\
    \ step for the\ninterpretation of messages, adds complexity to the overall framework\
    \ hence increases\npower consumption.\nThe Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol\
    \ (XMPP) is designed to allow short\nmessages and low latency, making it ideal\
    \ for IoT communications. The XMPP protocol may\nhandle both request/response\
    \ and publish/subscribe formats, which allow for bidirectional\nand multidirectional\
    \ communication, respectively. The decentralised nature of XMPP\nallows for high\
    \ scalability [35]. The XMPP protocol use XML for communication, which\nincreases\
    \ network trafﬁc. This results in high bandwidth use, high CPU usage, and no\n\
    guarantee of QoS.\nThe comparative analysis of various application layer protocols\
    \ show that CoAP gen-\nerates less overhead than the other protocols. In terms\
    \ of power consumption, bandwidth\nand infrastructure requirements and is most\
    \ suitable for the proposed CSFSA framework.\n3.1.2. Network Layer Protocols Comparison\n\
    Some of the most used network layer protocols used in IoT applications are IPv6\n\
    over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN), ZigBee and Bluetooth\
    \ Low\nEnergy (BLE). A comparative review of these network layer protocol is given\
    \ as follows:\n6LoWPAN is based on IP version 6 (IPv6), it features 128-bit hexadecimal\
    \ addresses,\nand uses the 802.15.4 radio frequency. It enables the use of IP\
    \ in low-power and lossy\nwireless networks, such as WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks),\
    \ IoT (Internet of Things) and\nM2M applications. One of the most unique characteristics\
    \ of 6LoWPAN is that it allows\nheader compression and encapsulation, making it\
    \ more lightweight and secure than ZigBee.\nThe most notable advantage of 6LoWPAN\
    \ is that it supports IP networks natively [36].\nThe ZigBee protocol is based\
    \ on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which allows for less\nbattery consumption in\
    \ IoT networks by keeping nodes in low power mode for the most\npart. However,\
    \ unlike 6LoWPAN, which has interoperability, ZigBee cannot readily com-\nmunicate\
    \ with other protocols.\nBluetooth 5 is the latest version of BLE. It supports\
    \ IP networks however, BLE is unable\nto establish a self-healing mesh network,\
    \ which is becoming particularly crucial for IoT\napplications. An additional\
    \ gateway is required to communicate with the internet when\nutilizing ZigBee\
    \ or classic Bluetooth, which adds extra overhead.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n\
    8 of 19\nIt can be deduced from the above discussion that due to its compression\
    \ and encap-\nsulation capabilities, interoperability and low network overhead,\
    \ 6LoWPAN is the prime\noption for the proposed CSFSA framework.\n3.1.3. Link\
    \ Layer Protocols Comparison\nThere are three main link layer protocols present\
    \ for IoT applications, IEEE 802.15.4\nfor 6LoWPAN and ZigBee, IEEE 802.11 for\
    \ Wi-Fi. and IEEE 802.15.1 for Bluetooth. A brief\nanalysis of the above mentioned\
    \ protocols is given below:\nIEEE 802.15.4 is a low-power wireless network standard\
    \ developed by the Institute\nof Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).\
    \ It has a communication range of at least\n10 metres and up to 100 metres. The\
    \ 802.15.4 category is the dominant standard for low\ndata-rate and security in\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN).\nIEEE standards for wireless communications\
    \ WLANs/Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) are\n802.11 networks with communication ranges\
    \ varying from 40 to 90 metres. Wi-Fi (IEEE\n802.11) is inefﬁcient in terms of\
    \ battery life, does not cover a vast area, and does not support\na large number\
    \ of end devices.\nBluetooth, i.e., 802.15.1, is another WPANs standard speciﬁed\
    \ by the 802.15 group,\nwith a communication range of 10 metres to 50 metres.\
    \ It is more power efﬁcient but less\nencrypted compared to Wi-Fi [37].\nFrom\
    \ the comparison it is determined that IEEE 802.15.4 is the best ﬁt for the proposed\n\
    CSFSA framework because it is compatible with 6LoWPAN, provides more security,\
    \ con-\nsumes less power and has a higher communication range compared to the\
    \ other protocols.\nBased on the comparison of several protocols at different\
    \ layers, the IoT protocol stack\nfor proposed CSFSA framework is presented in\
    \ Figure 2.\nFigure 2. IoT protocol stack for CSFSA.\n3.2. Coap Architecture\n\
    The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol,\n\
    specially designed for constrained applications. The CoAP’s interactive client/server\
    \ model\nis similar to HTTP model. It has similar features and principles as in\
    \ HTTP. Due to higher\ncommunication overhead of HTTP and HTTPS, such protocols\
    \ are not suitable for IoT\ncommunication. Therefore, CoAP is designed to interface\
    \ with HTTP, to easily integrate\nwith existing web-browsers, while ensuring constrained\
    \ networks and M2M [38,39] special-\nized requirements i.e., multicast support,\
    \ simplicity, and low message overhead. The IETF\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n\
    9 of 19\nConstrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) working group standardized CoAP\
    \ protocol.\nIt is designed according to the Representational State Transfer (REST)\
    \ architecture. CoAP\nsupported multicast requests, asynchronous communication,\
    \ content type and congestion\ncontrol, cashing and proxy abilities. The CoAP\
    \ packet format has a 4 bytes ﬁxed size header\nas shown in Figure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. CoAP packet format.\nThe CoAP architecture has message layer and request/response\
    \ layer as shown in\nFigure 4. The message layer handles the message exchange\
    \ over UDP between end points.\nIt deals with reliability and asynchronous mechanism.\
    \ While request/response layer deals\nwith request and response messages and their\
    \ mapping. CoAP has four types of messages\ni.e., Conﬁrmable (requires an acknowledgement),\
    \ Non-Conﬁrmable (needed no acknowl-\nedgement), Acknowledgement (receipt of conﬁrmable\
    \ message), Reset (conﬁrmable or\nnon-conﬁrmable message not processed properly),\
    \ Piggy-backed (sends Acknowledge-\nment with conﬁrmable message). The CoAP used\
    \ same methods i.e., GET, POST, PUT,\nDELETE for generating, restoring, creating\
    \ or updating and deleting processes as like HTTP.\nThe CoAP protocol lacks trusted\
    \ standards for secure architecture and its messages are\nencrypted by using DTLS,\
    \ which was not designed for resource constrained devices and\nhence is not suited\
    \ for CoAP [40].\nFigure 4. CoAP architecture.\n3.3. Proposed Robust and Tamper-Resistant\
    \ Authentication Framework\nIn most of the IoT applications, CoAP is utilized\
    \ as an application layer protocol.\nCoAP does not provide any security for data\
    \ transmission between two constrained nodes.\nThe CoAP server and client communication\
    \ can be secured with DTLS, however, as men-\ntioned in the preceding section,\
    \ DTLS is not suitable for IoT constrained devices and\nit causes computational\
    \ overhead and complexity on constrained nodes. Therefore, ro-\nElectronics 2022,\
    \ 11, 963\n10 of 19\nbust and tamper-resistant authentication framework between\
    \ CoAP server and client is\nproposed to ensure data integrity and authenticity.\
    \ The proposed CSFSA framework is\ncomputationally efﬁcient and is resilient against\
    \ various cyber security attacks i.e., replay\nattacks, DoS attacks and resource\
    \ exhaustion. It avoids the need to develop the additional\nsecurity protocol.\n\
    Like HTTP, CoAP is based on client/server model architecture to establish connection\n\
    when client sends request to server and server sends response to the client. For\
    \ observation\nof resources, all the server and clients used the CoAP protocol.\
    \ In order to observe resource,\nthe server ﬁrst authenticates the client identity.\
    \ If the client is authentic, the server will\nestablish session with that client\
    \ and will respond to the client. On the client side while\nreceiving response\
    \ message from server, the client checks the server authenticity. Once\nboth client\
    \ and server are authenticated, they proceed and exchange data between them.\n\
    The proposed CSFSA framework uses the AES encryption techniques and hash based\n\
    message authentication code algorithm HMAC-SHA-224 by ensuring message integrity\n\
    and authenticity. Before starting communication, the CoAP client and server ﬁrst\
    \ agree\non sequence ID and pre-shared secret key Kpre. The server stores each\
    \ device sequence\nID and Kpre in its own repository for device identiﬁcation\
    \ and to fetch associated Kpre for\nthat device. Now whenever client wants to\
    \ start communication with server, it will send\nrequest to server, after receiving\
    \ request from server, server will check client authenticity\nﬁrst. Figure 5 shows\
    \ the proposed CSFSA authentication architecture. On the client side,\nthe server\
    \ veriﬁes and authenticate the client identity. The client ﬁrst generates timestamp\n\
    T1 in order to prevent from replay attacks and calculates hash value of Kpre and\
    \ T1 using\nHMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm. This hash value is then concatenated\
    \ with the device\nsequence ID and T1 as follow:\nHC = HMAC (Kpre, T1)\n(1)\n\
    CMP = ID ||T1|| HC\n(2)\nwhere CMP is the client message payload. The client then\
    \ sends its ﬁnal message CMP to\nthe server.\nOn the server side, while receiving\
    \ message from client, the server checks client\nmessage authenticity. The server\
    \ ﬁrst checks the sequence ID in its repository, if it’s not\npresent in repository,\
    \ the connection will be then rejected, otherwise server will fetch\nassociated\
    \ Kpre for that device in its repository. The server then generates its own hash\n\
    value of Kpre and T1 as follow:\nHS = HMAC (Kpre, T1)\n(3)\nwhere HS is the server\
    \ hash value. The server compares its own generated hash value HS\nwith the received\
    \ hash value HC from the client. If both hash values are not same, the server\n\
    then rejects the client request. If both values are same, then the server authenticates\
    \ client\nfor services. Once client is authenticated by server, the server creates\
    \ reply message for the\nmessage received from authentic client. Therefore, the\
    \ server generates timestamp T2 and\nsession key KS. The server encrypts KS and\
    \ T2 using Kpre and AES encryption algorithm\nand calculate the hash value of\
    \ Kpre and T2 using HMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm as\nfollows:\nEM = EKpre (KS,\
    \ T2)\n(4)\nH′S = HMAC (Kpre, T2)\n(5)\nThe server sends H’S along with encrypted\
    \ message EM and T2 to the client. Upon\nreceiving message from server, the client\
    \ generates the hash value HMAC (Kpre, T2) and\ncompares both own generated hash\
    \ value and received hash value. If both hash values are\nnot same, the client\
    \ terminates the connection. If both are same, the server is authenticated\nElectronics\
    \ 2022, 11, 963\n11 of 19\nand the client then decrypts the received encrypted\
    \ message EM using Kpre and AES\nencryption algorithm to obtain session key KS.\n\
    H′C = HMAC (Kpre, T2)\n(6)\nDM = DKpre (EM)\n(7)\nIn this way, the sensitive agriculture\

    \ framework.\n4. Methodology\nThis research work aims to develop robust and tamper-resistant\
    \ authentication frame-\nwork for monitoring and controlling of IoT devices in\
    \ smart agriculture. The architecture of\nproposed CSFSA consists of three modules\
    \ such as internal network i.e., 6LoWPAN based\nIoT network, external network\
    \ and gateway which acts as bridge between internal and ex-\nternal network. The\
    \ complete proposed CSFSA is developed and emulated in Contiki-NG\noperating system\
    \ and Cooja simulator. Various steps of methodology are brieﬂy explained\nin the\
    \ following subsections.\n4.1. Description of Proposed CSFSA Framework\nThis is\
    \ the ﬁrst phase where we will deﬁne and explain the structure of proposed\nCSFSA.\
    \ The proposed CSFSA consists of personal computer where VMWare is installed.\n\
    On VMWare, Ubuntu is installed for Contiki-NG operating system where Cooja simulator\n\
    and Wireshark is used for framework development and analysis of result. Cooja\
    \ is a useful\nsimulator for Contiki-NG development, as it provides simulation\
    \ environment by allowing\ndevelopers to simulate and test code/system before\
    \ running it on the actual hardware.\nThe proposed framework has three modules\
    \ i.e., 6LoWPAN based internal network having\nIoT devices deployed in agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld for monitoring and controlling, a gateway which\nacts as bridge between\
    \ IoT and external network i.e., Internet and a web server.\n4.2. Design and Development\
    \ of Proposed CSFSA Framework\nThis is the second phase which is based on design\
    \ and development. The compre-\nhensive activity diagram for CSFSA is as shown\
    \ in Figure 6. First step is to open Cooja\nsimulation, then radio propagation\
    \ model is selected i.e., Unit Disk Graph Medium-distance\nloss (UDGM-Distance\
    \ Loss). The Unit Disk Graph Radio Medium abstracts radio transmis-\nsion range\
    \ as circles. Two different range parameters are used i.e., one for transmission\
    \ and\none for interfering with other radios and transmission.\nElectronics 2022,\
    \ 11, 963\n12 of 19\nFigure 6. Activity diagram for design and development.\n\
    The next step is the selection of mote i.e., sky mote is selected having 10 KB\
    \ of RAM.\nOn one sky mote, CoAP server is compiled for communication within agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld\n(internal network) and is secured by deploying proposed CSFSA. While Routing\
    \ Protocol\nfor Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) border router is compiled on\
    \ another sky mote\nfor connectivity with external network. The next step is to\
    \ create bridge between border\nrouter and external network. To enable that bridge,\
    \ need to open serial socket server on\nthe border router through “Listening on\
    \ port 60001”. In this way, RPL network is created.\nNow to connect this RPL network\
    \ to the external network, tunslip utility is used which is\nprovided in Contiki-NG.\
    \ Tunslip creates a bridge between RPL network and local machine\ni.e., 127.0.0.1\
    \ as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. Tunslip connectivity.\nTo initiate border router\
    \ connection, open a new terminal in Contiki and type the\nfollowing commands\
    \ (shown in Figure 8):\ncd Contiki/examples/ipv6/rpl-border-router/\nmake connect-router-cooja\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n13 of 19\nFigure 8. Border router connectivity with\
    \ external network.\nFinally, Copper (Cu) based CoAP user agent is installed for\
    \ communication with web\nserver which is then opened in browser for control and\
    \ monitoring of IoT devices in smart\nagriculture. The Copper CoAP user agent\
    \ is an add-on for the Firefox web browser, used\nfor browsing and direct interaction\
    \ with CoAP resources.\n4.3. Operation and Procedure of Proposed CSFSA framework\n\
    In this phase, the operation of proposed CSFSA is presented in 3 primary modules\
    \ such\nas the internal network i.e., IoT devices, border router and external\
    \ network i.e., internet as\nillustrated in Figure 9. The framework’s procedure\
    \ and operation ratify the proposed IoT\nprotocol stack which includes IoT devices\
    \ that use CoAP at the application layer, a border\nrouter that uses 6LoWPAN at\
    \ the network layer and IEEE 802.15.4 radio at the link layer and\na web server\
    \ that uses a Copper-based CoAP client. The RPL border router acts as bridge\n\
    that connects external network with 6LoWPAN based internal network. The proposed\n\
    framework connects CoAP based IoT devices to the internet via 6LoWPAN border router\n\
    Figure 9. Operation of proposed CSFSA.\n5. Results Evaluation and Discussion\n\
    To appraise the performance of proposed CSFSA, the CSFSA is emulated in Contiki\n\
    NG operating system and Cooja simulator. Contiki NG is an open source operating\
    \ system\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n14 of 19\nwhich is designed especially for\
    \ memory constrained systems. Cooja is an open source\nsimulator which is used\
    \ for the development of Contiki NG, as it provides simulation\nenvironment by\
    \ allowing developers to simulate and test code/system before running it\non the\
    \ actual hardware.\n5.1. Simulation Parameters\nThe simulation parameters used\
    \ for the implementation of CSFSA is shown in Table 3.\nThe mote chosen for simulation\
    \ is Wismote which is MSP430 microcontroller based board\nhaving 16 KB of RAM\
    \ and 256 KB of ﬂash memory and a radio chip CC2420 compatible with\nIEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard. The protocols used in the simulation are CoAP as an application\n\
    layer protocol, UDP as transport layer protocol, 6LoWPAN as network layer protocol\
    \ and\nIEEE 802.15.4 as link layer protocol.\nTable 3. Simulation parameters.\n\

    \ performance, it is divided into two simulation\nscenarios i.e., CoAP with proposed\
    \ CSFSA and CoAP-DTLS implementation scenarios.\nCoAP with proposed CSFSA scenario\
    \ comprised of 5 motes and 1 border router. Here\nmotes are CoAP servers which\
    \ are developed on proposed IoT protocol stack and deployed\nin agriculture ﬁeld\
    \ for control and monitoring of various agriculture parameters. The mote\n1 is\
    \ the border router while motes 2–6 running CoAP servers and all the motes are\
    \ placed\nin the transmission range of border router. The border router is used\
    \ for connectivity\nwith external network (internet) through tunslip utility.\
    \ The purpose of CoAP servers are\nmonitoring and controlling of environmental\
    \ conditions of agriculture ﬁeld and send it\nto remote server i.e., CoAP client\
    \ application. The CoAP client is Cupper based browser\nwhich is used for browsing\
    \ and direct interaction with CoAP resources. The CoAP with\nproposed CSFSA scenario\
    \ is emulated in Cooja as shown in Figure 10. While in CoAP-DTLS\nscenario, mote\
    \ 1 is border router and motes 2–6 are CoAP servers and all the motes are\nplaced\
    \ in the transmission range of border router as shown in Figure 11. The CoAP-DTLS\n\
    scenario is used for results comparison with proposed CSFSA framework based CoAP.\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n15 of 19\nFigure 10. Proposed CSFSA simulation scenario\
    \ consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes.\nFigure 11. CoAP-DTLS simulation\
    \ scenario consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes.\n5.3. Results\nThis\
    \ section describes the simulation results obtained. We appraised the results\
    \ of\nproposed CSFSA in terms of performance evaluation parameters i.e., packet\
    \ size, commu-\nnication overhead and power consumption.\nThe packet size is an\
    \ important evaluation parameter and have a signiﬁcant impact\non power consumption\
    \ particularly in constrained networks. For message transmission,\nthe standard\
    \ CoAP requires one round trip. In proposed CSFSA framework, the authen-\ntication\
    \ messages require two round trips as compared to CoAP-DTLS scheme, which\nprocesses\
    \ it in four round trips i.e., three round trips for DTLS and one round trip for\
    \ CoAP.\nProposed CSFSA is lightweight and power efﬁcient as compared to CoAP-DTLS\
    \ and has\nsigniﬁcantly smaller packet size than CoAP-DTLS. Figure 12 illustrates\
    \ the packet size and\nthe number of messages for both proposed CSFSA framework\
    \ and CoAP-DTLS scheme\nduring transmission.\nFrom the ﬁgure, it is clear that\
    \ the packet size for our proposed CSFSA is smaller than\nthat of packet size\
    \ of CoAP-DTLS. Also the round trip time of our proposed CSFSA is lower\nas compared\
    \ to round trip time of CoAP-DTLS.\nCommunication overhead is deﬁned as the number\
    \ of extra messages or packets that\nhas been transmitted over network. The Standard\
    \ CoAP communication overhead does\nnot include extra packets for data transfer.\
    \ The DTLS adds extra communication overhead\nto secure CoAP. To establish DTLS\
    \ secure session, it adds 29 bytes to each datagram\ni.e., 8 bytes nonce and 8\
    \ bytes authentication tag. In CoAP-DTLS, DTLS handshake adds\nextra 29 bytes\
    \ as overhead to standard CoAP. In our proposed CSFSA, it requires only two\n\
    extra bytes communication overhead to the total number of transmitted bytes to\
    \ secure the\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n16 of 19\ncommunication between client\
    \ and server. Figure 13 shows the communication overhead\nfor both proposed CSFSA\
    \ and CoAP-DTLS scheme. Based on comparison, communication\noverhead in our proposed\
    \ CSFSA is lower as compared to CoAP-DTLS. Its means that our\nproposed CSFSA\
    \ is efﬁcient and has lightweight communication overhead.\nFigure 12. Packet size.\n\
    Figure 13. Communication overhead comparison.\nPower consumption is another important\
    \ metric, as it directly impacts the lifetime of\nIoT devices since IoT devices\
    \ are powered by small sized batteries. Proposed CSFSA is\nlightweight and has\
    \ signiﬁcantly smaller packet size than CoAP-DTLS. Hence, it consumes\nless power\
    \ and bandwidth as compared to CoAP-DTLS. The power consumption of pro-\nposed\
    \ CSFSA is measured through software based energy estimation tool called Energest\n\
    which is built in Contiki NG OS. The function energest_type_time () outputs the\
    \ clock ticks\nobtained from the time when IoT device is booted. The formula for\
    \ measuring the power\nconsumption is as follows:\nPower Consumption =\nEnergestValue\
    \ × Current × Voltage\nRTIMER_ARCH_SECOND × RunTime\n(8)\nwhere current, voltage\
    \ and RTIMER_ARCH_SECOND are constant, taken from Wismote\ndatahseet. Figure 14\
    \ shows the power consumption measured for both proposed CSFSA\nand CoAP-DTLS\
    \ scheme.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n17 of 19\nFigure 14. Power consumption.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nAgriculture plays an important role in country’s economic growth.\
    \ In agriculture,\nthe yields or crops which are to be produced are sensitive\
    \ to changes in their environmental\nconditions and required controlled environment.\
    \ Conventional agriculture methods are not\nintegrated with IoT devices to provide\
    \ controlled environment, resulting in low crop and\nfruit yields. This necessitates\
    \ the integration of IoT technology in agriculture ﬁeld to boost\ncrop productivity.\
    \ However, the integration of IoT in agriculture ﬁeld introduces cyber\nsecurity\
    \ attacks and vulnerabilities. Such cyber attacks have the capability to adversely\n\
    affect the countries’ economies that are heavily reliant on agriculture. On the\
    \ other hand,\nthese IoT devices are resource constrained having limited memory\
    \ and power capabilities\nand cannot be secured using conventional cyber security\
    \ protocols. Therefore, designing\nrobust and efﬁcient secure framework for smart\
    \ agriculture are required and is main aim of\nthis paper.\nIn this paper, a Cyber\
    \ Secured Framework for Smart Agriculture (CSFSA) is proposed.\nThe proposed CSFSA\
    \ presented a robust and tamper resistant authentication scheme for\nIoT devices\
    \ using CoAP to ensure the data integrity and authenticity of smart agriculture\n\
    monitoring. The signiﬁcance of proposed CSFSA is to make resilient against various\
    \ cyber\nsecurity attacks i.e., replay attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,\
    \ resource exhaustion\nand is efﬁcient for constrained devices having limited\
    \ memory. Furthermore, the packet\nsize, communication overhead and energy consumption\
    \ are also computed to appraise\nefﬁciency of proposed CSFSA framework. As a result,\
    \ the proposed CSFSA can make a\nsigniﬁcant contribution to the problem of food\
    \ wastage and its security. Also the economic\nloss can be reduced greatly.\n\

    Abstract: Smart Farming (SF) is an emerging technology in the current agricultural
    landscape. The

    aim of Smart Farming is to provide tools for various agricultural and farming
    operations to improve

    yield by reducing cost, waste, and required manpower. SF is a data-driven approach
    that can

    mitigate losses that occur due to extreme weather conditions and calamities. The
    inﬂux of data from

    various sensors, and the introduction of information communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the ﬁeld

    of farming has accelerated the implementation of disruptive technologies (DTs)
    such as machine

    learning and big data. Application of these predictive and innovative tools in
    agriculture is crucial

    for handling unprecedented conditions such as climate change and the increasing
    global population.

    In this study, we review the recent advancements in the ﬁeld of Smart Farming,
    which include novel

    use cases and projects around the globe. An overview of the challenges associated
    with the adoption

    of such technologies in their respective regions is also provided. A brief analysis
    of the general

    sentiment towards Smart Farming technologies is also performed by manually annotating
    YouTube

    comments and making use of the pattern library. Preliminary ﬁndings of our study
    indicate that,

    though there are several barriers to the implementation of SF tools, further research
    and innovation

    can alleviate such risks and ensure sustainability of the food supply. The exploratory
    sentiment

    analysis also suggests that most digital users are not well-informed about such
    technologies.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture is an indispensable ﬁeld of study, as the continued survival of the
    human

    race depends on it. New and updated technology has been implemented throughout
    the

    ages in order to improve agricultural output and sustainability. The world’s population
    is

    expected to grow to approximately 9.7 billion by the year 2050 [1]. To keep up
    with this

    increase in population, food production needs to go up by 70%. However, the resources

    available to produce the required food output are steadily decreasing due to climate
    change

    and an increase in the number of settlements. Water levels are receding, arable
    lands are

    shrinking, and the environment is being rapidly degraded. The agricultural industry
    is

    also one the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases. The strain on the availability
    of

    food across the world is predicted to increase drastically with the increase in
    the world

    population over the next few decades [2,3]. Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth agricultural

    revolution, was discussed by the World Government Summit in 2018 in the report
    titled

    ‘Agriculture 4.0—The Future of Farming Technology’ [4]. The report highlights
    the need for

    more efﬁcient food production practices that can overcome the increasing food
    demand in

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4, 424–460. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering4020029

    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    coming years. It would be nearly impossible to keep up with this increase in demand
    with-

    out the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and disruptive

    technologies (DTs) such as remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning,
    big

    data, etc., into the agricultural industry. Smart Farming is of great interest
    to researchers

    and scientists as it has yielded great results in reducing the ecological footprint
    of farm-

    ing [5], improving production efﬁciency [6], reducing human labor through unmanned

    vehicles [7,8], detecting diseases through image processing [9,10], and more.

    Precision farming is an approach that utilizes ICTs to monitor resources such
    as

    crops, ﬁelds, and animals [11]. It aims to maximize resource usage and crop yield
    while

    minimizing associated costs. The agricultural sector consumes a signiﬁcant amount
    of

    resources in the form of water, land, fertilizer, and energy. Precision farming
    is concerned

    with calculating the exact amount of resources required to grow plants and sustain
    livestock.

    Smart Farming (SF), which could be considered an extension of precision farming,
    focuses

    on utilization of data obtained from precision farming in an intelligent way and
    making crop

    production more efﬁcient by predicting crop yield [12,13], reducing wastage of
    resources,

    automating tasks [14], and providing agricultural management support [15]. It
    can also

    be used to perform soil analysis [16], so that crops of optimal quality can be
    grown. There

    have been several calamities in recent years that occurred due to climate change
    [17]. In

    light of these calamities, there is great need for smart farming to help manage
    agricultural

    activities. Due to the various risks and external factors associated with farming,
    such as

    weather extremities and plant diseases, implementation of data-driven predictive
    tools,

    which can be used to provide insights into farming operations such as crop yield,
    feed

    intake, weather conditions, soil conditions, etc., is crucial for mitigation [18].
    Decisions can

    thereby be made based on real-time data rather than heuristic, thumb-rule data.

    The availability of huge amounts of data from Internet of things (IoT) devices
    has

    allowed for application of big-data tools. The development of Artiﬁcial Intelligence
    (AI)

    tools has impacted the efﬁciency of a number of tasks associated with farming,
    suggesting

    that data-driven agriculture is a good approach to ensure agricultural sustainability.
    Cli-

    mate change is predicted to disproportionately impact smallholder farmers [19].
    Even a

    temperature variation of a few degrees will drastically affect smallholder farmers
    who are

    not adequately prepared for the situation. A substantial amount of crop losses
    occur due to

    weather events, which can be greatly mitigated through predictive weather modeling.
    This

    approach can help farmers navigate the agricultural risks that arise from the
    unprecedented

    deterioration of the environment, social and economic changes in the industry,
    and the

    increase in demand for food production. The availability of big data has the potential
    to

    revamp the entire food supply chain [20]. A global connectivity chain in farming
    will allow

    for the use of correctly priced products, better market positioning, and improved
    means of

    production. The use of ICT in farming will provide greater insight and advice
    on agricul-

    tural practices to farmers. The increase in visibility that comes with inter-connectivity
    of

    the supply chain is also likely to improve the productivity and conﬁdence of farmers
    in

    such practices.

    Agricultural tasks such as fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,
    seed

    planting, etc., can be automated through the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

    and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) [21]. Robots can be trained to autonomously

    plant saplings and move heavy pots, thus complementing human effort in the agricultural

    industry and reducing the farmer’s workload [22]. Autonomous vehicles never tire
    and can

    work around the clock. They also provide better accuracy and speed to improve
    the size of

    yields. With computer vision, autonomous vehicles can identify if the crops are
    ripe, ready,

    and disease-free. Lightweight sensors can be deployed on aerial vehicles to collect
    detailed

    information about crops and soil parameters through hyper-spectral imaging [23].
    Sensors

    can also be used to map various parameters such as type of land, crop, vegetation
    index,

    chlorophyll index, and water index [24]. Drones can help to create a precision
    map of a ﬁeld

    so that each part can precisely receive the resources it needs [25]. IoT is a
    major enabling

    technology that allows communication between the various sensors installed on
    the farm.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    426

    IoT makes use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), which can collect a large amount
    of

    data about the environment, crop production, cattle monitoring, and more [26].
    Information

    generated by IoT devices allows farmers to track farm operations and performance,
    and

    make informed decisions to improve farm productivity and yield. The massive amounts
    of

    data collected from the WSNs can be analyzed through technologies such as big
    data and

    deep learning. These technologies provide the added advantages of predictive modeling,

    real-time decision making, and adaptability to external factors. With the number
    of smart

    devices increasing steadily, the implementation of IoT in farms will increase
    interoperability,

    decrease losses due to human errors, and provide seamless uniﬁcation of information.

    Vertical farming, which is the practice of growing crops in a vertically stacked
    layer within

    a controlled environment for maximum growth, is one way to grow crops independently

    of local soil and climate conditions [27].

    The widespread implementation of smart farming tools faces several limitations

    and challenges depending on the geographical location of the project. One prominent

    barrier is the lack of internet connectivity, especially in rural areas. Such
    technology is not

    affordable for everyone. Without a stable internet connection agricultural sensors
    cannot

    communicate with each other. The initial cost of installation is high for any
    SF project,

    making it especially difﬁcult for smallholder farms to accept the risks. Further,
    the farmers

    implementing smart farming technologies may not fully understand the operation,
    ﬁnd the

    system too complex to use, or may be skeptical about its beneﬁts. Older farmers
    usually

    prefer traditional farming and are unwilling to learn to operate new technology
    [28]. The

    security and privacy of the data generated by sensors is also a concern, as there
    has to be

    an accountable party in case of mishandling or misuse [6]. This review paper highlights

    the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs that are applicable to the agricultural
    sector. The

    practical implementation of these technologies in particular projects across the
    world has

    also been covered, along with the limitations of the approaches and their potential
    to

    alleviate signiﬁcant concerns faced by farmers. Exploratory sentiment analysis
    has also

    been performed on comments collected from YouTube videos relevant to smart farming

    in order to determine public opinion regarding the implementation of these tools.
    This

    work aims to serve as a reference and motivation for further research in the adoption
    of

    technological tools in the agricultural industry.

    2. Motivation

    In this study, an in-depth exploration of recent advancements in the ﬁeld of smart

    farming is performed. It has always been a human endeavor to revolutionize agriculture

    by domesticating animals, planting crops in rotations, using pesticides and fertilizers,
    etc.

    The advent of ICTs has brought about the fourth agricultural revolution, or Agriculture

    4.0, which focuses on the use of limited resources on targeted areas. As discussed
    in

    the previous section, this is achievable with the help of sophisticated technologies
    such

    as unmanned vehicles, satellite imagery, sensors, and more. DTs such as AI have
    also

    greatly impacted the agricultural sector by improving efﬁciency, providing predictive

    analysis of yield, and mitigating production and market risks. Studies have shown
    several

    beneﬁts of using smart solutions in farming practices, such as reduction of necessary

    manpower, increase in yield, effective management of livestock, monitoring of
    crops and

    weather conditions, predictive analysis, and cost reduction. Several initiatives
    have been

    undertaken across the world that support the use of precision farming and smart
    farming

    while also providing insight on the speciﬁc limitations that were encountered.
    It is crucial

    that the ever-increasing global food demand is met, as the survival of the human
    race

    depends on it. Smart farming is capable of providing essential assistance to farmers
    to

    ensure sustainable food production. It can help farmers manage risks by providing
    speciﬁc

    weather forecasts, yield projections, likelihood of diseases, and more. It can
    thereby also

    increase proﬁts for the farmer, as the availability of data on risk assessment
    and external

    conditions can allow for optimal cultivation of crops. The motivation for conducting
    this

    study is to streamline the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs applicable to
    the farming

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    427

    sector, analyze components of various smart farming projects, discuss potential
    uses of

    such components, and list the common challenges that face the large-scale adoption
    of such

    techniques. The considerations for using smart farming in different geographical
    regions

    also needs to be discussed. The general attitude of people towards the adoption
    of any

    new technology is a great indicator of its perceived beneﬁts. To determine the
    consensus of

    the opinion on smart farming, we have performed a surface-level sentiment analysis
    on

    comments collected from YouTube channels relevant to smart farming. Thus, this
    work can

    serve as a point of reference for future research in the area of smart farming
    and can help

    researchers explore diverse technologies that are relevant to the topic.

    During this exploratory study, we formed the following two hypotheses, each with

    their respective research questions for further investigation:

    Hypothesis 1. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications. The following research question was crafted
    to accept or

    reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Hypothesis 2. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.
    The following

    research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming
    tools?

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regards
    to smart

    farming?

    For this study, Google Scholar was used to perform exploratory analysis. Speciﬁc
    key-

    words, such as ‘plant disease detection’, ‘unmanned ground vehicles’, ‘precision
    livestock’,

    ‘big data’, etc., were selected. The searches were performed in the format [technology][smart

    farming]. For example, in order to search for articles that provided an overview
    of big-

    data applications in farming, the search phrase was ‘big data smart farming’.
    A total of

    30 keywords were grouped into six groups to analyze the number of citations for
    the top

    ﬁve results for each search. We attempted to exclude review papers that covered
    a few or

    all of the keywords. The number of citations for the top ﬁve results for each
    keyword is

    graphed in Figure 1 in six groups. The average number of citations for the top
    ﬁve results

    was calculated. The documents where the number of citations was greater than the
    average

    for that keyword were considered for the study.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 3 covers the various
    ICTs and

    DTs, such as big data, IoT, cloud computing, AI, unmanned vehicles, blockchain,
    and

    decision support systems, that enable smart farming initiatives. Research efforts
    and

    projects that utilize such technologies in the agricultural sector are also discussed.
    Section 4

    covers state-of-the-art smart farming projects that have been launched and completed
    in the

    European Union and across the world. A brief overview of user sentiment towards
    smart

    farming technologies is conducted through comments collected from YouTube videos
    about

    smart farming in Section 5, in order to better encapsulate user perception towards
    such

    tools. Section 6 highlights the various challenges present in the widespread adoption
    of

    precision and smart agricultural practices. In Section 7, we discuss the ﬁndings
    of our study

    with respect to the two hypotheses formulated, followed by the conclusion in Section
    8.

    The structure of the paper is displayed in Figure 2.

    3. Technologies

    This section provides a thorough discussion of the key technologies that assist
    in the

    evolution of smart farming. These technologies include sensing systems, wireless
    sensor

    networks, IoT, unmanned vehicles, decision support systems, blockchain, and more.
    One

    or more of these tools has been used in collaboration for smart farming projects
    worldwide.

    The development of new sensors with improved sensitivity has allowed for the collection

    of higher-quality spatial and temporal data, which can be be analyzed for more
    timely and

    efﬁcient decision making. The advancements in remote sensing translate to reducing
    human

    time and effort, as less human intervention is required. Over the past few years,
    UAVs

    and UGVs have drastically improved in precision and have become more lightweight
    and

    cheaper, allowing for their easy adaption on large-scale farms. Wireless sensor
    networks

    can help the seamless functioning of sensors, autonomous vehicles, and decision-support

    systems to impact production at all stages. IoT platforms can allow control of
    daily farm

    activities through remote devices. Figure 3 classiﬁes the technologies implemented
    in smart

    farming, along with their most common applications. Table 1 provides a brief description

    of each technology along with some related works and applications.

    3.1. Sensors

    The implementation of ICTs and DTs in farming is dependent on the availability
    of

    wireless connectivity. Remote sensing is crucial for IoT devices to function.
    Sensors serve

    as the basic building block in a wireless sensor network (WSN), which then handles
    the

    seamless communication between IoT devices. The advancements in sensing technology

    translate to the use of additional wavelengths in the light spectrum to remotely
    monitor

    crops, manage weeds, capture imagery, and more. Satellites and UAVs are equipped
    with

    thermal, visual light (RBG), and near infrared (NIR) cameras to capture multi
    or hyper-

    spectral images of the crop ﬁeld [24]. Hyper-spectral imaging divides light into
    thousands

    of smaller bands, which captures a lot of detail. Lightweight, hyper-spectral
    cameras can

    be used to monitor crop health, water and nutrient levels, and symptoms of a disease
    over

    large areas, which can be difﬁcult to access by other means. The availability
    of detailed and

    precise data also allows for spot application of resources and better decision
    making.

    The choice of technology to be used in a project relies heavily on the available
    band-

    width, transmission distance, and energy requirements. Wireless technologies that
    have

    been utilized in smart farming operations over the years include Bluetooth Low
    Energy

    (BLE), ZigBee, WiFi, 3G/4G/5G, LoRa, and more. Cellular networks (3G/4G/5G) serve

    the purpose of aggregating data from various sensors in a smart farming environment.

    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) provides coverage of 100 m and consumes less power
    than

    Bluetooth. It can be implemented in systems for livestock positioning [52], greenhouse

    monitoring [30], and more. BLE is not suitable for transferring large amounts
    of data [53].

    ZigBee is a WSN protocol that provides a smaller coverage area and low energy
    con-

    sumption. It can be used for scenarios such as solar power monitoring [54], greenhouse

    monitoring, etc. WiFi is beneﬁcial where high bandwidth and large amounts of data
    trans-

    fer is required. Cellular 3G/4G/5G networks offer wide coverage and low latency,
    but

    they drive up the cost and power consumption. LoRa can cover an area of 20 km
    and

    consumes less energy. Specialized sensors have been introduced for tasks such
    as pest

    identiﬁcation and control, plant health monitoring, resource level monitoring,
    etc. Bug

    detection and classiﬁcation can be performed using acoustic sensing devices and
    cameras,

    which capture factors such ﬂight behavior and humming sound [55]. Similarly, parasite

    detection was performed in study [56] using a spectral sensor that measures light
    waves.

    The difference in the reﬂected light pattern can be an indicator of infestation
    in the plant.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    431

    López et al. [57] propose an autonomous monitoring system that uses a low-cost
    image

    sensor for visually inspecting bug traps deployed across the ﬁeld. Bioacoustic
    sensors

    have also been deployed to detect red palm weevil infestation in palm trees [58].
    Wireless

    sensors can be installed on leaves to monitor parameters such as humidity, water
    content,

    temperature, etc., to estimate the plant’s health and required amount of resources
    [59]. The

    growth rate of the plant stem and trunk can also be used to determine its health.
    Various

    sensors, such as the stem micro variation sensors, sap ﬂow relative rate sensors,
    stem ﬂux

    relative rate sensors, auxanometers, and trunk dendrometer, are used for this
    purpose [60].

    Environmental factors such as atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed,
    rainfall,

    temperature, and humidity can also be measured by wind speed and direction sensors,

    ambient seismic energy sensors, precipitation sensors, etc. [61]. Global navigation
    satellite

    systems (GNSS) can help increase efﬁciency in smart dairy farming. Smart collars
    can be

    worn by cows and can be used to collect data on the health and well-being of livestock
    [29].

    Farmers can program GPS collar trackers to keep cattle in a certain area. The
    cattle can then

    be sent to autonomous milking robots when their udders are full. The amount and
    quality

    of milk is then analyzed by the robots. Virtual fences can also prevent cattle
    from getting

    hurt on electric fencing and allow for rotational grazing [62].

    3.2. IoT Platforms

    IoT can enable devices and sensors to collect data about physical parameters of
    a

    farm. The functionalities provided by IoT, such as smart processing of data and
    real-time

    communication between devices, enable it to optimize agricultural practices [63].
    IoT

    blends the usage of physical devices such as actuators and sensors with a WSN
    to allow for

    seamless communication [26]. Sensors can serve as the peripheral devices that
    can gather

    information over a WSN which can then be analyzed with an IoT platform. There
    are

    currently several commercially available IoT platforms that aim to greatly reduce
    manual

    labor. They are utilized in various functions of crop monitoring. Zhang et al.
    [31] propose

    a monitoring system for wheat diseases, pests, and weed. The system collects data
    from

    IoT terminals and attempts real-time monitoring and management of crops. Lee et
    al. [64]

    implement a predictive system for effective pest control and proper utilization
    of pesticides

    and fungicides. Correlation is calculated between the pests and weather data relevant
    to

    the control of pests. Chieochan et al. [32] implement IoT sensors to monitor the
    humidity

    of a mushroom farm. The system controls sprinklers and fog pumps and provides
    push

    notiﬁcations to the user. Benaissa et al. [33] implement Wireless Body Area Networks

    (WBANs) in conjunction with IoT to monitor the health of dairy cows. Timely detection
    of

    health issues in the cattle is a costly and challenging task that was automated
    in the study

    through the use of a Long-Range (LoRa) off-body wireless channel and IoT. Garcia
    et al. [65]

    implement WSNs to monitor the presence of pests such as snails. The system is
    also capable

    of predictive analysis based on environmental factors such as temperature and
    humidity.

    Giri et al. [34] introduce an automation framework called AgriTech for adequate
    uti-

    lization of water, fertilizer, and pesticides. AgriTech allows the farmer to monitor
    the ﬁeld

    and perform actions such as spraying through the use of a mobile device. Kodali
    et al. [66]

    present the model of an IoT-based smart greenhouse that automatically carries
    out irri-

    gation, temperature and air humidity control, and water management with the help
    of

    sensors. In the study done by Na et al. [35], an IoT-based remote monitoring system
    is

    implemented to monitor soil characteristics such as pH, temperature, and moisture
    content

    using a DS18B20 sensor. Accurate measurement of such parameters can enable better

    analysis and decisions regarding fertilizer usage and crops sown. Kamilaris et
    al. [36]

    introduce Agri-IoT, a framework for analyzing real-time data streams from heterogeneous

    sensors that also supports decision making. It supports integration for data streams
    from

    multiple domains, data analytics, and interoperability for smart farming applications.

    Akkas et al. [37] implement a prototype of a wireless sensor network made up of
    MicaZ

    motes that monitor environmental variables such as temperature, light, pressure,
    and

    humidity in a greenhouse. The study highlights the advantages of implementing
    a WSN

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    432

    over traditional cabling within an IoT platform, such as costs, vulnerability,
    and inability to

    relocate the wiring system. Nayyar and Puri [67] propose the use of an IoT-based
    agricul-

    tural stick integrated with Arduino technology and Solar technology to capture
    live data

    on physical factors such as temperature and soil moisture. The system provided
    accuracy

    of 98% in live feeds when tested on live agricultural ﬁelds.

    3.3. Decision Support Systems (DSS)

    Decision support systems (DSSs) add value to the smooth functioning of farming

    practices by providing support to farmers, guiding them to correct information,
    assist-

    ing in decision making, and laying out the best course of action for a given scenario.

    The farm-wide availability of production rules and expertise can drastically improve
    efﬁ-

    ciency. Canadas et al. [38] propose a real-time decision support system implemented
    for

    greenhouse tomatoes that facilitates better decision making by identifying sensor
    faults,

    maintaining climate variables, and performing disease identiﬁcation on crops.
    The study

    highlights the effectiveness of the DSS in climate control and minimizing crop
    wastage

    due to diseases. Taylor et al. [68] perform a case study on web of things that
    highlights

    other useful applications of support systems such as environmental and livestock
    moni-

    toring. Dos Santons et al. [39] present AgriPrediction, an IoT-based support system
    that

    utilizes LoRa wireless network range system and the ARIMA predictive model to
    better

    manage crop dysfunctions. The system presents promising results, and is also shown
    to

    be applicable in rural areas with sparse connectivity. Kukar et al. [40] present
    AgroDSS,

    a novel cloud-based decision support system that allows farmers to perform predictive

    analysis on their own farm data. The system was implemented to study pest population

    and provide a better understanding of interdependencies of various parameters
    in a sim-

    ulated environment. The study done by Antonopoulou et al. [41] provides an approach

    for continued sustainability by allowing farmers to select alternate crops for
    a region. The

    system can be accessed through mobile devices to increase adoptability amongst
    farmers,

    and supports the farmer throughout the cultivation process. Thakare et al. [69]
    provide

    a DSS for remote monitoring that integrates smart sensing and smart irrigation
    systems

    to monitor parameters such as temperature, moisture content, and efﬁcient water
    use.

    The study emphasizes the importance of smart farming with hydroponics, which allows

    farming in unsuitable soil and water conditions.

    3.4. Unmanned Vehicles

    The advancement in robotics has led to the development of autonomous vehicles,

    which are used extensively in farming for mechanical weeding, fertilizer spraying,
    and

    harvesting. Unmanned vehicles have shown to decrease human labor, improve productiv-

    ity, reduce costs, and increase accuracy of measurements. They could be further
    classiﬁed

    into UAVs and UGVs. UAVs are aircraft embedded with wireless sensors, transmitters,

    and/or cameras that can function autonomously or be controlled remotely. UGVs,
    on

    the other hand, are autonomous machines that operate while in contact with the
    ground.

    The use of lightweight cameras with autonomous aerial vehicles can allow for remote

    monitoring of crops, which can allow for better decision making. Bareth et al.
    [70] per-

    formed a study to examine the usability of UAV-based multi-temporal crop surface
    models

    for estimating plant height, estimating the biomass through height measurement,
    and

    combining vegetation indices for more accurate estimation. The results obtained
    from

    ﬁeld experiments imply that UAV-based RGB imaging can provide accurate modeling
    of

    physical parameters of the plant. The review study done by Roldan et al. [71]
    highlights

    the advancement of robots in smart farming for automation of labor-intensive tasks
    such as

    planting, harvesting, monitoring, inspection, and treating crops. Unmanned vehicles
    are

    able to collect information about the environment and navigate it by using machine
    vision

    systems. They implement Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies
    [72] to

    navigate precisely. UAVs provide an added advantage for remote sensing in the
    form of

    timely control and high spatial ground resolution. Remote imaging can capture
    several

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    433

    characteristics through different types of cameras, such as multispectral, thermal,
    and high

    spatial resolution RGB camera, as demonstrated in the study done by Matese et
    al. [73] to

    measure intra-vineyard variability and leaf temperature and to perform analysis
    of missing

    plants. UAVs possess the potential to obtain high spatial resolution imagery without
    being

    too affected by weather conditions.

    Lu et al. [74] perform species classiﬁcation in tall grassland with the use of
    high spatial

    resolution imagery obtained from a UAV, and show that the method obtains higher
    accuracy

    than other data from satellites. Tripicchio et al. [75] present a novel implementation
    of an

    RGB-D sensor integrated with UAVs to differentiate between different plowing techniques

    used on a ﬁeld. The system provides the functionality of computer vision, navigation,

    and data analysis and was shown to be a feasible technique for determination of
    soil

    characteristics. Moribe et al. [76] provide an effective and synchronized technique
    for

    measuring leaf temperature. Infrared thermometers attached to drones and sensor
    nodes

    integrate seamlessly with the WSN. Lottes et al. [77] propose a system that utilizes
    a UAV

    to detect vegetation, such as sugar beets, and performs feature extraction and
    maps the

    distribution of weeds and crops. UAVs provide an autonomous solution for monitoring

    large areas of agricultural land covering crops, livestock, and more. Unmanned
    vehicles

    function through the use of technologies such as robotics, IoT, remote sensing,
    and big

    data, and can automate labor-intensive tasks such as spraying, data collection,
    water

    management, weed mapping, irrigation, fertilization, crop monitoring and management,

    and ﬁeld-level phenotyping.

    3.5. Cloud/Edge Computing

    Given the vast amount of incoming data from various sources, a centralized approach

    to storing and managing large amounts of data is essential. A cloud-based architecture

    can allow for the necessary computation power to analyze the plethora of data
    obtained

    from the different types of sensors installed on a farm. Cloud computing facilitates
    ﬂexible

    storage and availability of data and resources, making them suitable for real-time
    implemen-

    tation. Rupanagudi et al. [42] propose a novel solution to pest control in tomatoes
    by crop

    monitoring using video processing, cloud computing, and robotics. Zhou et al.
    [43] present

    a cloud-computing-enabled spatio–temporal cyber–physical infrastructure (CESCI)
    to per-

    form comprehensive surface soil moisture monitoring, which can help reduce costs,
    increase

    agricultural productivity, and boost farmers’ net income. FIWARE is an open-sourced
    cloud

    platform that has shown potential in many smart farming applications. Kaloxylos
    et al. [44]

    present a cloud-based farm management system that utilizes the FIWARE architecture
    and

    was shown to be acceptable by farmers during evaluation. Corista et al. [45] introduce

    an IoT-based smart farming system built upon FIWARE that aims to control fruit
    quality

    during the entire fruit production chain. The system is developed using the vf-OS
    (virtual

    factory Operating System) platform, which integrates various applications and
    allows

    external producers and consumers to interact.

    Another IoT platform based on cloud and edge computing is proposed by

    Zamora et al. [46] and works in three tiers: the local plane collects data on
    crops, the

    edge plane monitors and manages the main precision agriculture (PA) tasks, and
    the cloud

    platform maintains records and performs data analytics. Fog computing, also called
    edge

    computing, is a decentralized computing architecture between the cloud and connected
    pe-

    ripheral devices and aims to enhance speed and performance [78]. Edge computing
    systems

    provide a decentralized approach to automation of tasks by using pre-loaded ﬁeld
    data

    from edge locations [79]. Thus, fog computing is a promising architecture for
    smart farming

    solutions, since it provides low latency and increased reliability for support
    systems [80].

    In case of real-time operational decision making, time is of the essence. Malik
    et al. [47]

    introduce a simulation platform that leverages fog computing to allow users to
    under-

    stand sensor deployment and data collection in a complete farming ecosystem. Thus,

    a cloud platform is essential if real-time analysis is to be performed. Use of
    additional

    data-driven approaches can be invaluable depending on the application. Cloud computing

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    434

    architecture can be used to manipulate large amounts of heterogeneous data arising
    from

    several sources. It can provide the necessary storage and computation resources,
    making it

    complementary to big data tools.

    3.6. Blockchain

    Blockchain technology provides new modes of interaction between parties in a supply

    chain. It is a distributed, immutable ledger that keeps a record of all transactions
    of digital

    assets over a network. It also has the capacity to improve food safety by providing
    traceabil-

    ity for purchased food products and monitoring for contamination. In order to
    avoid bias in

    the data collected from ICT and DT devices, it is important that data manipulation
    is made

    difﬁcult or impossible. The addition of a new record in a blockchain requires
    veriﬁcation

    from a peer-to-peer network, ensuring its legitimacy. Similarly, the majority
    should agree

    while making changes to records, making it difﬁcult for unauthorized individuals
    to alter

    the data. Thus, blockchain-based technologies for smart farming ensure that the
    data is

    correct, transparent, and traceable. In conjunction with smart contracts, which
    are protocols

    that are activated without human intervention when the terms of an agreement are
    met,

    blockchain technology can ensure timely payments [81]. Vangala et al. [48] propose
    an

    authenticated key agreement mechanism for smart farming that is based on smart
    contracts.

    The system is shown to provide more security and functionality than other authentication

    protocols. Patil et al. [50] present a security framework that combines blockchain
    technol-

    ogy with IoT devices and allows sharing of a digital ledger of transactions among
    the nodes

    on an IoT network. Lin et al. [51] introduce an ecological food traceability system
    that

    incorporates blockchain technology and IoT and aims to improve food safety while
    also

    establishing trust between the parties involved. The use of smart contracts is
    also consid-

    ered for the timely management of problems in the system. An ICT and DT e-agricultural

    system with blockchain technology that distributes water quality data over a network

    is proposed by Lin et al. [49]. They also present an evaluation tool that can
    be used to

    determine the speciﬁc requirements and suitability of this technology. A simulated
    model

    of blockchain technology is proposed by Widi Widayat et al. [82] and can be implemented

    in a smart farming environment. The parties in a smart farming system, namely
    farmers,

    food suppliers, and customers, are connected to a global blockchain network and
    appear

    as a node account in the smart contract. Another potential application of blockchain
    tech-

    nology is for providing agricultural insurance. Nguyen et al. [83] present a smart
    contract

    developed on NEO to provide drought-based crop insurance. This could be invaluable

    to farmers who work in extreme weather conditions, as it can reduce their damages
    and

    vulnerability while also avoiding excess evaluation costs.

    3.7. Big Data and Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    IoT devices and sensors capture various types of data from all over the ﬁeld that
    can

    then be analyzed through big data tools. Big data refers to larger and more complex
    datasets

    that consist of a greater variety of data from multiple data sources and can also
    be mined

    for opinions and information [84]. Data modeling techniques such as machine learning
    and

    deep learning can help enhance the entire food production cycle by performing
    predictive

    analysis, providing real-time decision making, and reﬁning the business model
    of the farm

    to cut loses. AI is a research sub-ﬁeld of computer science that utilizes robust
    datasets to

    solve problems by performing classiﬁcation or predictions based on the input data
    [85].

    Machine learning is a sub-ﬁeld of AI that allows models to learn from experience
    without

    being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a sub-ﬁeld of machine learning that
    further

    eliminates some of the human intervention required in training by automating feature

    extraction from larger datasets [86]. Currently, there are also several types
    of state-of-the-

    art conversational systems being used to assist farmers in agricultural operations
    [87].

    Table 2 summarizes some notable research works in smart farming that have performed

    image processing using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a class
    of

    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) that are used to perform classiﬁcation tasks
    on images

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    435

    by adjusting learnable weights and biases [88]. Table 3 provides a summary of
    various

    studies that have utilized other AI models in smart farming, along with their
    respective

    outcomes.

    AI can help reduce resource wastage through monitoring and predictive modeling.

    Varghese and Sharma [89] propose a hardware-based system that helps monitor factors

    such as moisture content in soil, humidity, and atmospheric conditions. The system
    also

    determines the appropriate crops for given soil and environmental conditions through
    the

    use of IoT and machine learning. Arvindan et al. [90] introduce an automated irrigation

    system that measures moisture content in the soil and provides remote control
    through

    an Android smart phone. This can help with the sustainable and automatic farming
    of

    certain crops that require different degrees of irrigation depending on their
    growth stage.

    Khaki et al. [91] introduce WheatNet, which is a CNN that collects ﬁeld observational
    data,

    such as wheat head counts. The system achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
    Root

    Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.85 and 5.19, respectively, in the wheat head counting
    task

    with fewer parameters, implying that the approach is robust and crucial for observation
    and

    decision making. Deep learning algorithms are used extensively to reduce crop
    wastage

    and optimize crop yield. The development of systems for accurate prediction of
    crop yield

    is essential, especially in developing countries, as it can secure food availability,
    prevent

    famine, and provide further assistance to the sustainable development of agriculture.
    Crop

    yield can depend on several factors, such as genotype, environment, etc. Wang
    et al. [12]

    present a deep-learning-based system for predicting soybean crop yields based
    on data

    collected from remote sensing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells were trained
    and

    tested on 4 years of Argentinian soybean harvest data. The model’s transferability
    was

    then tested by using soybean harvest results from Brazil. Khaki et al. [13] implemented

    Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for yield prediction of maize. The dataset consisted
    of

    the genotype and yield performance of 2267 maize hybrids. The best-performing
    model

    provided an RMSE of 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation
    for the

    validation dataset in imperfect weather conditions.

    Alfred et al. [92] provide a survey of the implementation of big data and machine
    learn-

    ing on paddy rice production in the Asia–Pacific region. The integration of sensors,
    satellites,

    and drones complements machine learning tools in improving productivity. Machine
    learn-

    ing tools utilize the big data collected from these devices for estimating rice
    yield [93,94],

    monitoring growth [94], and providing a smart irrigation system [95]. Kiruthika
    et al. [96]

    propose a system to detect paddy rice crop diseases such as leaf blast disease,
    brown spot

    disease, and bacterial blight disease. A Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
    is used to

    recognize disease from the input image; two classifiers are used for recognition:
    ANN and

    Support Vector Machine (SVM). ANN performs better than SVM, with a precision of
    90.60%

    and accuracy of an 93.33%. Dahane et al. [97] propose a novel EDGE–fog–IoT–cloud-based

    architecture that utilizes WSNs to support farming activities in three steps:
    data collection

    from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water level, etc.), data cleaning
    and

    storage, and predictive analysis through AI tools. Performance of Gated Recurrent
    Unit

    (GRU) and LSTMs on live data from three parameters is compared, with varying results.

    Jhuria et al. [9] propose a tool that utilizes ANNs to identify diseases in grapes
    and apples.

    Image processing is performed on an image dataset, and an accuracy of 90% is obtained
    based

    on color and texture. The study also provides a tool to determine the quality
    of fruit by

    weight. Bhange et al. [98] present a web-based tool for identification of fruit
    diseases trained

    on images of pomegranate fruit. The system processes an image uploaded by the
    user for

    parameters such as color and morphology, and classifies it as infected or non-infected
    using

    SVMs. Accuracy of 82% was recorded using the ‘morphology’ parameter in the experiment.

    Guo et al. [10] propose a system for identification of plant diseases through
    the use of deep

    learning. The model identifies black rot, bacterial plaque and rust diseases by
    implementing

    a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for leaf localization, the Chan–Vese algorithm
    for leaf

    segmentation, and VGG-13 [99] architecture for disease identification. This method
    provides

    an accuracy of 83.57%. In the study by Ferentinos [100], image classification
    through a VGG

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    436

    CNN is performed on a database of 87,848 photographs of leaves of healthy and
    infected

    plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, and a
    success rate of

    99.53% is achieved. Similarly, smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis is performed
    by

    Mohanty et al. [101] on the PlantVillage dataset consisting of 54,306 images of
    plant leaves.

    The GoogleNet architecture performed the best out of all models tested, resulting
    in an

    accuracy of 99.35% on 14 crop species and 26 diseases. The prevention of fruit
    tree diseases

    can also significantly impact overall agricultural production. Li et al. [102]
    conducted a study

    comparing the performance of three ensemble learning classifiers and two deep
    learning

    classifiers. The stacking ensemble learning classifier provides the highest validation
    accuracy

    of 98.05% and test accuracy of 97.34% on a dataset of 10,000 images of pear black
    spot, pear

    rust, apple mosaic, and apple rust. Figure 4 displays a generalized example of
    plant disease

    identification through the use of CNNs. The network takes input in the form of
    segmented

    images and classifies them as ‘Diseased’ and ‘Not Diseased’.

    Figure 4. Disease identiﬁcation through image processing.

    Due to the rapid increase in global meat consumption, technologies such as precision

    livestock farming [103] have become essential to ensure the quality of meat products
    and

    reduction of the environmental impact. AI tools can also prove beneﬁcial in livestock

    management by monitoring cattle health and behavior. Xu et al. [104] propose a
    system for

    individual identiﬁcation of cattle through face detection, performed using the
    RetinaNet

    object detection algorithm. Fine-tuning was performed on seven different CNN models,

    and transfer learning was used for this study. RetinaNet incorporating the ResNet
    50

    provided the highest average accuracy of 99.8% and an average processing time
    of 0.0438 s.

    Gjergji et al. [105] evaluated the following neural networks for the regression
    task of cattle

    weight prediction: CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)/CNN networks, recurrent

    attention models, and recurrent attention models with CNNs. CNNs were shown to

    provide the best performance with MAE of 23.19 kg, signiﬁcantly outperforming
    the top

    linear regression models, which reached an error of 38.46 kg. Jung et al. [106]
    present a

    deep learning-based system for classiﬁcation of cattle vocals and real-time monitoring
    of

    livestock. The voice parameter of cattle can signal valuable information such
    as gender

    of cattle, distress, and disorders in the cattle [107]. The voice was converted
    to Mel-

    frequency cepstral coefﬁcients (MFCCs) and given as input to a CNN for classiﬁcation

    with an accuracy of 91.36%. The accuracy increased to 94.18% when short-time Fourier

    transform-based noise ﬁltering was used to reduce background noise. In the context
    of

    smart farming practices, deep learning has also been shown to be widely beneﬁcial
    in

    the ﬁeld of aquaculture. Fish production contributes to a great portion of the
    food source

    in any area. Zhang et al. [108] propose the use of DNNs for ﬁsh identiﬁcation,
    species

    classiﬁcation, analysis of ﬁsh behavior, feeding decisions, and water quality
    prediction. The

    method provided an accuracy of 96% and recognition rate of 98% when trained on
    the Fish 4

    knowledge dataset, which contains 8487 images of ﬁsh with different conditions.
    The study

    done by Rohani et al. [109] proposes a model consisting of multi-layer perceptron
    (MLP)

    and SVM for classiﬁcation of rainbow trout as dead or alive. Both classiﬁers provided

    an average accuracy of 100% during the training phase and average of 99.45% during

    the testing phase. Zambrano et al. [110] propose the use of machine learning tools
    to

    forecast water quality variables such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and pond temperature.
    A

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    comparison is performed between Random Forests (RF), ANNs, and multivariate linear

    regression, out of which RFs performed the best.

    CNNs can also be used to perform object detection and pattern recognition on images

    collected by aerial vehicles to detect anomalies such as weed clusters, standing
    water, etc.

    Chiu et al. [111] introduce ‘Agriculture-Vision’, a large-scale dataset of aerial
    farmland

    images, designed for semantic segmentation of agricultural pattern recognition.
    The dataset

    consists of 94,986 high-quality aerial images consisting of RGB and near-infrared
    (NIR)

    channels. The study proposed a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)-based model with
    a

    ResNet encoder to classify 9 ﬁeld anomaly patterns. The mean intersection-over-union

    (mIoU) was 43.40% for the validation set and 43.66% for the test set. The ﬁrst
    Agriculture-

    Vision Challenge [112] encouraged further development of novel algorithms for
    pattern

    recognition in agriculture. The challenge dataset consists of 21,061 aerial and
    multi-spectral

    farmland images, and six anomaly patterns were to be recognized in the task. The
    best-

    performing model, Residual DenseNet with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, introduced

    by Team DSCC, achieved a modiﬁed mIoU of 63.9%. The study by Kussul et al. [113]

    performs classiﬁcation of crops using MLPs, RFs, and CNNs. The dataset consisted
    of

    19 multitemporal scenes acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A RS satellites, and
    the

    highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 94.6% was achieved by 2-D CNNs. Another crop
    vision

    dataset for species classiﬁcation and detection is the CropDeep [114] dataset,
    which consists

    of 31,147 images and at least 1500 samples for each of the 30 classes. A baseline
    study

    showed the best performing model was ResNet50, with an accuracy of 99.81%. The
    study

    further suggests the YOLOv3 network with modiﬁcation to achieve higher accuracy
    on

    the dataset. Anand et al. [115] present ‘AgriSegNet’, which is a multi-scale hierarchical

    attention network for semantic segmentation using UAV-acquired aerial images for
    IoT-

    assisted precision agriculture. The mIoU on the test set of the Agriculture-Vision
    dataset

    for the six anomaly classes are: Background: 78.10%; Double Plant: 46.40%; Planter
    Skip:

    8.60%; Standing Water: 61.20%; Waterway: 44.90%; Weed Cluster: 50.20%.

    In this subsection, we emphasize several points regarding the opportunities provided

    by AI in the ﬁeld of smart farming. Image processing is of great importance to
    the agricul-

    tural sector. Images captured by UAVs, UGVs, satellites, and sensors need to be
    analyzed so

    that relevant insight can be extracted from them to assist in farm operations.
    Depending on

    the requirements, different types of cameras, such as visible spectrum, NIR, hyperspectral,

    or multispectral may be used. In conjunction with several ICTs, AI can efﬁciently
    perform

    functions such as crop monitoring, livestock monitoring, disease detection, pest
    detection,

    etc. Predictive modeling can help farmers to prepare for extreme weather conditions
    and

    market ﬂuctuations, thereby lowering their vulnerability. Current state-of-the-art
    models

    have provided promising results, implying that further research in the area with
    more

    advanced AI tools can help to bridge the gap in food production.

    4. Initiatives Worldwide

    This section includes the various research initiatives that have been undertaken
    in

    smart farming in the European Union [119] and across the world. The initiatives
    usually

    employ several of the ICTs and DTs discussed in Section 3. The European Union
    has

    funded many projects to allow for the integration of ICTs and DTs into the agricultural

    sector. Crop monitoring is one of the major functions performed in farms that
    utilize

    smart farming tools. Table 4 provides an overview of the recent projects concerning
    the

    implementation of SF tools for crop monitoring that have been undertaken in the
    European

    Union. Table 5 lists the projects that perform other functions such as harvesting,
    water

    management, satellite imagery, and more. The corresponding technologies for each
    project

    have also been listed along with their application. The Echord++ [120] project,
    which

    lasted from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2018, involved various ﬁeld operations
    such as

    monitoring, harvesting, and grafting for crops such as tomatoes, asparagus, and
    peppers.

    Cloud computing is utilized by many projects that require monitoring operations.
    These

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    439

    include Vinbot [121] (crop monitoring and yield prediction in a vineyard), Ermes
    [122] (crop

    monitoring for rice), Fractals [123] (monitoring, disease detection, and fertilization
    of olive

    trees), and more. The importance of UAVs and UGVs is apparent, as they have been
    utilized

    in several projects. Implementations of UGVs include Vinerobot [124] for a vineyard,

    Sweeper [125] for harvesting peppers, Flourish [126] for monitoring and spraying
    sugar

    beets and sunﬂowers, PANtHEOn [127] for monitoring hazelnuts and water management,

    and Romi [128] for crop monitoring and weed management. UAVs are utilized for
    crop

    monitoring of rice in Ermes [122], potatoes and vineyard in Mistrale [129], and
    more.

    Seamless communication between different technologies has been executed through
    the use

    of WSNs, such as Water-Bee [130] and Figaro [131], for the purpose of water management.

    There have been several research projects on smart farming taken up all over the

    world, in part inspired by the positive outcomes of the EU projects. Table 6 provides
    a

    summary of government projects and start-ups that focus on the development of
    innovative

    solutions for smart farming. Some projects, such as the Villages of Excellence
    (VoE),

    have been launched in collaboration between two governments to ensure the sharing
    of

    technology and expertise and provide better outcomes for both. Smart irrigation
    plays

    an important role in ensuring crop sustainability in dry areas. Startups such
    as Madar

    Farms [141] and Responsive drip irrigation [142] aim to provide smart irrigation
    solutions

    to tackle water challenges and food security in the United Arab Emirates and the
    United

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    440

    States respectively. SunCulture [143] is a Kenyan AgriTech company that provides
    solar-

    powered irrigation systems for smallholder farms, and also provides the option
    of a drip

    irrigation system. In Morocco, the government introduced the Green Generation
    2020–2030

    strategy [144], which focuses on the digitization of agriculture through initiatives
    such as

    the installation of solar pumps for irrigation. Food security and sustainability
    are of great

    concern worldwide. Startups such as AbyFarm [145] in Singapore aim to implement
    urban

    farming by employing ICT and DT tools such as IoT and blockchain. Lack of resources

    in rural areas could be a hindering factor in crop yield. Ossian Agro Automation
    [146] is

    an Indian company working towards rural automation and the development of wireless

    automation systems. All year round production of crops can be achieved by vertical

    farming, which is the practice of growing crops in many layers in a controlled
    environment.

    Ground vertical farming [147] in Lebanon implements vertical farming and aims
    to reduce

    water wastage by re-circulation. Figure 5 displays the various smart farming projects
    taken

    up across the world, classiﬁed according to their primary function.

    Figure 5. Smart Farming initiatives worldwide

    In several developing countries, there is a lack of government-funded projects.
    The

    initiative is rather taken up by individual startups, with the goal to provide
    assistance to

    farmers, conduct further research, and educate farmers and learners about the
    potential

    of agricultural technology. There is an increased interest amongst consumers,
    who want

    to ensure that the end product they receive is unadulterated. Public opinion in
    Europe

    skews in favor of healthy products grown with minimum pesticides. Consideration
    of the

    socio–economic impact of smart farming projects is also necessary. Certain participating

    farms have reported average cost savings of over €5000 and reduction of climate
    impact by

    10% [148]. Thus, these initiatives have been greatly beneﬁcial to farming operations
    by de-

    creasing costs, reducing greenhouse emissions, and improving soil conditions.
    The projects

    contributed signiﬁcantly to their objectives of reducing resource wastage, environmental

    impact, and energy consumption, and demonstrated measures to mitigate issues resulting

    from climate change and the shortage of skilled labor.

    5. Sentiment Analysis

    In order to ensure successful integration of new tools and technologies available
    for

    smart farming, it is necessary to understand how knowledgeable the general public
    is

    about the topics and how the innovations are perceived. Public sentiment can be
    a strong

    determinant of whether or not a project is approved for implementation in an area
    [166].

    It can also be indicative of the various socio–economic, behavioral, and cultural
    issues

    that arise by the advancement and implementation of such technology [28,167].
    In light of

    this, we performed sentiment analysis on the comments of YouTube videos pertaining
    to

    smart farming technologies. This section provides details about the dataset, experimental

    methodology, and the results and analysis of the experiment.

    5.1. Dataset

    The dataset was constructed by scraping YouTube comments left by users on 16 YouTube

    videos that were relevant to our study [168–172]. The videos were selected by
    searching

    the relevant keywords, such as ‘smart farming IoT’, and then ﬁltering the ones
    with most

    views and comments. Table 7 provides a list of the video titles, the channels,
    upload date,

    and the total number of likes and views on each video. For this study, only comments

    in English were considered. A total of 7311 comments were included in the dataset
    from

    videos about smart farming.

    5.2. Experiment

    Two approaches were used for performing sentiment analysis. In the first approach,
    two

    annotators assigned one of the following six labels to the comments: ‘Praising’,
    ‘Queries’,

    ‘Suggestions’, ‘Undefined’, ‘Hybrid’, and ‘Opinion’. Cohen’s kappa coefficient,
    which is a

    measure of inter-rater agreement, was calculated on the ratings of the two annotators.
    The

    value of the kappa statistic ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 implying only a chance
    agreement and 1

    implying perfect agreement between the two annotators. The formula to calculate
    Cohen’s

    kappa for two raters is:

    κ = po − pe

    1 − pe

    = 1 − 1 − po

    1 − pe

    (1)

    where: po = the relative observed agreement among raters, and pe = the hypothetical

    probability of chance agreement.

    A brief description of these labels is given in Table 8, along with the total
    number of

    comments for each label, and an example of the label from the dataset. Table 9
    gives the total

    counts of each of the six labels that were assigned to the comments collected
    from the videos.

    The second approach was to apply transfer learning to perform surface level sentiment

    analysis using the pre-trained Pattern library for Python. Pattern library can
    be used to

    perform various natural language processing tasks such as parsing, N-gram generation,

    and more. Polarity of a given text ranges from 1 to −1, with 1 representing a
    highly positive

    sentiment and −1 representing a highly negative sentiment. The subjectivity ranges
    from

    0 (Objective) to 1 (Subjective). It provides a measure of factual information
    or personal

    opinion in the comments, with 1 being subjective and 0 being objective. For example,
    for

    the following comment in our dataset: ’Fantastic. We need a lot of that here in
    Australia;

    suffering from drought; really bad water management by those in authority etc.’
    , the

    polarity was calculated as −0.1499 and subjectivity was 0.7833. The negative value
    of

    polarity indicates that the sentiment expressed by the comment was negative, whereas
    the

    value of subjectivity is closer to 1 suggesting that the comment was mostly subjective.

    5.3. Results and Analysis

    In this section, we detail the results of our experiment and analyze our ﬁndings.

    Evaluation has been conducted separately for the two approaches through user-based

    analysis and transfer-learning-based analysis. Table 10 records the number of
    comments

    under a video and the results obtained from sentiment analysis. The value of mean
    polarity,

    mean subjectivity, and Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient is listed for each corresponding
    video

    serial number.

    5.3.1. User-Based Analysis

    In user-based analysis, the mean Cohen’s kappa was calculated to be 0.9617, which

    shows high inter-rater reliability. Figure 6 displays the Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    for each

    video with respect to the mean value. The value is highest at 1 for videos no.
    5, 9, and 12,

    indicating perfect agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The
    value

    is lowest at 0.8141 for video no. 2 titled ‘Europe has the best regenerative farmers
    in the

    world’, implying a slight disagreement between the assigned labels. The high value
    of

    kappa coefﬁcient implies that the categories assigned by the annotators are correct.

    Figure 7 plots the correlation matrix between the frequency of the six labels.
    We can

    see the highest degree of correlation is 0.96 between the following labels: ‘Opinion’
    and

    ‘Suggestion’, and ‘Queries’ and ‘Hybrid’, indicating that the frequency of one
    increases

    with the other. The lowest degree of correlation is 0.81 between ‘Hybrid’ and
    ‘Undeﬁned’,

    suggesting that all labels show a relatively positive correlation amongst each
    other.

    A word cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data
    where

    the frequency or importance of each word is indicated by its size. It can help
    us highlight

    and analyze signiﬁcant textual data points. Pre-processing of the comments was
    performed

    to remove stop words and punctuation from the text. Figure 8 displays the word
    clouds

    for the comments collected from videos of serial number 1–8. We can see that on
    the word

    cloud in Figure 8a, which is for the video titled ‘How Japan Is Reshaping Its
    Agriculture By

    Harnessing Smart- Farming Technology’, ‘Japan’ is one of the most frequent and
    important

    words in the text. Similarly, for Figure 8g for video no. 7 on the bottom left
    titled ‘7 Israeli

    Agriculture Technologies’, the most signiﬁcant word is ‘Israel’. Figure 9 displays
    the word

    clouds for the comments collected from videos of serial number 9–16. The word
    9b on the

    top left for the video titled ‘Singapore’s Bold Plan to Build the Farms of the
    Future’ has

    ‘Singapore’ as the most prominent word. This indicates that several comments for
    these

    videos included some text about the country in which the technology was implemented.
    For

    videos demonstrating a particular technology, such as No. 7: ‘Solar Panels Plus
    Farming?

    Agrivoltaics Explained’; No. 8: ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept
    (Full

    Version)’; and No. 14: ‘RIPPA The Farm Robot Exterminates Pests And Weeds’, the
    name of

    the technology (solar, tractor, robot, respectively) is of great prominence. Table
    11 provides

    a list of the top ﬁve most-relevant words in the comments dataset for each video,
    along

    with their respective frequencies.

    5.3.2. Transfer-Learning-Based Analysis

    The results of sentiment analysis using the Pattern library are discussed in this
    sub-

    section. Mean polarity and mean subjectivity are plotted opposite each other in
    Figure 10.

    The overall polarity for all 7311 comments is 0.2092, suggesting that the overall
    sentiment

    is slightly positive. The overall subjectivity of all comments is 0.4352, implying
    that the

    comments were close to being neutral. Subjective statements generally contain
    personal

    opinion, emotion, or judgment, whereas objective comments are factual information.
    Po-

    larity determines the degree of positive or negative sentiment in the text. The
    highest

    mean subjectivity score was 0.5480 for video no. 13 titled ‘Simply Fresh—India’s
    Largest

    State Of The Art Precision Farm’, followed by 0.5369 for video no. 11 titled ‘Smart
    Vertical

    Farms in Sharjah’. This shows that the comments were of a more opinionated nature,
    rather

    than being factual. The lowest mean subjectivity score was 0.2915 for video no.
    9 titled

    ‘IOT Smart Plant Monitoring System’, indicating that mostly facts were discussed
    in the

    comments for this video. The score suggesting higher objectivity could be because
    the video

    is discussing technical details about an IoT platform rather than explaining widespread

    innovative concepts such as precision farms and vertical farms. The comments collected

    from video no. 8 titled ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept (Full Version)’

    resulted in the lowest mean polarity of 0.0919, indicating that the user sentiment
    was

    generally neutral. The highest mean polarity of 0.4460 was achieved for video
    no. 13 titled

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    447

    ‘Simply Fresh—India’s Largest State Of The Art Precision Farm’, showing that user
    attitude

    was generally positive towards the state-of-the-art precision farm highlighted
    in the video.

    Figure 8. Word clouds for videos serial no. 1–8 corresponding (a–h) respectively.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    448

    Figure 9. Word clouds for videos no. 9–16 corresponding (a–h) respectively.

    In the investigation of user sentiment towards smart farming and precision agriculture,

    the main objective was to analyze user opinion, which is the voice of masses.
    During

    compilation of the dataset, it was observed that videos providing more in-depth
    and

    case-study-based information about smart farming tools did not receive many views
    and

    comments. This could be because the general public is not well-informed about
    novel

    technology in the farming sector, as asserted in Section 6. The majority of the
    comments

    were collected from videos about broader topics. The Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    indicated

    that the labels assigned by the two annotators were mostly in agreement and valid.
    The

    mean values of polarity and subjectivity in the comments was calculated through
    the

    Pattern library, and the results suggest that there is a varying degree of subjectivity
    amongst

    the comments. The polarity suggests that user opinion was mostly positive in the
    comments

    analyzed. Thus, it can be safely inferred that training and education programs
    can increase

    the visibility of innovations in smart farming, allowing the general population
    to form a

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    449

    well-informed opinion on the risks and beneﬁts. Positive user sentiment can then
    serve as

    a catalyst towards faster adoption of such tools.

    6. Challenges

    There has been a signiﬁcant increase in the number of smart farming initiatives
    being

    taken up around the world, with promising results. However, with the advent of
    new,

    innovative technologies there are always some unseen risks and associated challenges.

    The agricultural sector has greatly impacted the environment by taking up about
    40% of

    the world’s available land [173] and consuming approximately 70% of the water
    [174].

    Climate change and the growing population further exacerbate food and water scarcity,

    making sustainable food production a challenging task. Thus, it is critical that
    current

    agricultural practices need to evolve to ensure the efﬁcient use of land and water
    resources.

    To elaborate further on Research Question 2, we discuss the various challenges
    that hamper

    the adoption of smart farming in the following bullet points:

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    450

    1.

    Training and awareness: Lack of technical expertise by the farmers implementing

    new technology is a major setback to smart farming. Das et al. [28] conducted
    a

    study to understand the views of Irish farmers towards adoption of cloud computing

    and smart farming technologies. Surveys and interviews conducted with 32 farmers

    revealed that the rate of adoption was higher among younger farmers and lower

    amongst older farmers, who were hesitant to use new technology and preferred

    traditional farming. The digital divide has to be reduced by providing guidance

    and training to the farmers [175]. Lack of knowledge about the technology results

    in greater skepticism towards its adoption amongst farmers, who may not realize

    the value of the tool or consider it an unsuitable ﬁt for their farm. In this
    current

    study, we formed a dataset of YouTube comments related to smart farming operations

    and performed surface level sentiment analysis of them. During the data collection

    process, it was observed that very few comments were left under videos that provided

    a technical and detailed framework for a smart farming project. Comments were

    mostly collected from videos explaining broader topics, such as ‘Vertical Farming’.

    This indicates that there is a general lack of awareness about these technologies
    and

    their applicability to farming.

    2.

    Technical considerations: Fixed and moving sensing technologies require further

    improvements to be able to withstand extreme weather conditions in order to remain

    fully functional [176,177]. Edge node devices may be battery dependent and run
    out

    of power during operation [178,179]. Data is collected from various sensors and
    can be

    analyzed through IoT platforms. There is a requirement for data storage, as there
    is a

    huge amount of data being generated from IoT devices. IoT has improved connectivity

    of all operations by leaps and bounds, but it does come with the added concern
    of

    data privacy and security [180]. It also exposes the smart farming environment
    to

    cybersecurity threats, which could result in signiﬁcant loses [181]. Data encrypting

    in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) also presents a signiﬁcant challenge
    for

    farmers [182].

    3.

    Costs: The costs associated with sensors needs to reduced so that they can be
    imple-

    mented in small-scale farms as well. The solution needs to be designed speciﬁcally

    for the project in question, and also needs regular updates and management. Farmers

    may hesitate in implementing such technologies as they could create issues and
    cause

    further losses instead of providing beneﬁts. Research and development costs for
    the

    implementation of such tools are also steep. There is also a signiﬁcant amount
    of cost

    associated with data transmission within a smart farm [183]. Market uncertainty
    adds

    substantial risk to ensuring a sustainable income for farmers, as proﬁt margins
    are

    getting increasingly smaller. Farmers in small-scale agricultural ﬁelds are hesitant

    to use upgraded technology because of the high initial costs, perceived risks,
    and

    complexity of the system.

    4.

    Government support: The laws and regulations in the area where smart farming is

    being considered for implementation play a huge role in its eventual success or
    failure.

    The local governments are responsible for taking initiatives and providing funding

    and support training programs for the adoption of such tools [184]. Several successful

    initiatives taken up in the European Union [119] and across the world [144] have

    highlighted the importance of the effort taken up by regulatory bodies.

    5.

    Ethical considerations: Human safety is also a concern in the operation of unmanned

    vehicles [185]. Collisions with the ground or other objects may also cause damage

    to the vehicle. It is also essential that the UAVs be ﬂown in unrestricted areas.
    Cur-

    rently, it is not clear where the accountability for the actions taken by autonomous

    vehicles lies. Data need to be uploaded to cloud systems in a secure manner, keeping

    regulations in mind. It is necessary for smart farming operations to be transparent
    so

    that they are more trusted and accepted. The ownership of agricultural data is
    a huge

    liability that needs to be kept in mind. There are also legal and ethical considerations

    with the potential mishandling and misuse of these data [186]. Animal welfare
    is

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    451

    also a concern while making use of autonomous robots to perform functions such
    as

    milking [187].

    6.

    Regional considerations: Lack of proper infrastructure, such as roads, can be
    a major

    hurdle towards the advancement of smart farms, as the necessary resources and

    technology will not be successfully transported. There is limited availability
    of inter-

    net in rural areas, where smart farming could be of greater signiﬁcance. Standard

    protocols and frameworks for wireless communication cannot be deﬁned, as the

    requirements rely heavily on the speciﬁc use case [188]. Further, communication

    protocols implemented within the smart farm may only provide coverage over small

    areas [189].

    7. Discussion

    This review study was conducted to assess the challenges and opportunities in
    smart

    farming by exploring current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs, analyzing global projects,
    and

    understanding the perception of the general public towards such innovative practices.
    The

    two hypothesis stated at the beginning of the study have been supported by the
    ﬁndings of

    the research questions, which have been answered as follows:

    Hypothesis 3. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications.

    The following research question were crafted to accept or reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Over the last decade, several smart farming projects have been launched across
    the

    world that were powered by technologies such as IoT, wireless sensor networks,

    unmanned vehicles, etc., as detailed in Section 3. The potential use cases for
    each

    technology are discussed in Section 4, although several projects utilize more
    than one.

    Several research projects in the European Union [18] and worldwide have also been

    discussed. The development of precise sensors enables the capture of data with
    higher

    accuracy, thus enabling better quality analysis and decision making [14]. Decision

    support systems can guide the farmer with operational decisions about choice of
    crop,

    frequency of fertilizer use, better utilization of resources, and more [69]. Autonomous

    vehicles take care of labor-intensive tasks, thus freeing up farmers for other
    important

    tasks [77]. Communication between various IoT devices through a WSN can allow

    for effective monitoring of the farm throughout the day, making it easier for
    the

    farmer to make operational decisions [36]. Blockchain technology can ensure that
    the

    supply and raw materials purchased are of good quality and there is no adulteration

    taking place [48]. DTs such as artiﬁcial intelligence also have an array of potential

    applications in smart farming, building upon the availability of massive amounts

    of heterogeneous data from sensors [20]. We have discussed the use of machine

    learning and deep learning for disease identiﬁcation in crops, fruits, and cattle
    in

    Section 3.7. AI has also shown great potential in optimizing resource utilization
    by

    automating timely irrigation, performing preemptive actions if a certain parameter

    crosses a threshold, and predictive analysis of weather and crop conditions [188].
    AI

    can also be used to identify optimal conditions for growing crops and preventing
    crop

    wastage. Image processing is of great relevance in smart farming, as there have
    been

    several studies that implement CNNs [98]. Image processing can be used for livestock

    management, guiding the decision-making processes of harvesting robots and pest

    and weed elimination drones. It can also enable precision farming by collecting
    data

    from sensors and deploying resources accordingly [9].

    Hypothesis 4. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.

    The following research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming

    tools?

    Despite the increasing number of smart farming projects being launched all over

    the world, there still exist many factors that hinder the widespread implementa-

    tion of such tools [6,188]. As we have discussed in Section 6, the limitations
    can be

    broadly categorized as lack of training and awareness, technical considerations,
    costs,

    government support, ethical considerations, and regional considerations. Technical

    difﬁculties arise due to the inability of current systems to withstand extreme
    weather

    and atmospheric conditions, being too bulky and costly to implement, and not provid-

    ing up-to-the-mark accurate data [176]. Another challenge is the proper infrastructure

    required for storing and processing large amounts of data collected from sensors
    [181].

    The privacy and security of this data is of great importance. Regional limitations

    could be the lack of infrastructure and connectivity. Smaller farms in rural areas
    could

    beneﬁt greatly from the use of smart farming tools. However, most smart farming

    practices require the use of internet connectivity, which is sparse in rural areas.
    Other

    factors that hamper the development of smart farming may include lack of techni-

    cal expertise by farmers, insufﬁcient incentives provided by the government for
    the

    implementation of such practices, and skepticism of farmers towards the beneﬁts
    of

    smart farming [28]. General awareness amongst farmers is generally low and can
    be

    increased through training programs. Although smart farming tools are generally

    black-box techniques, farmers making use of them still need to understand their

    operations so that they can consider the process reliable. Cost considerations
    could

    also make farmers skeptical towards installing new tools, as the upfront expenditure

    may be too much [183].

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regard
    to

    smart farming?

    In order to better understand user perception of smart farming technologies [166],

    we performed sentiment analysis on relevant English comments collected from

    YouTube [168], as detailed in Section 5. The comments were collected from 16 different

    videos that detailed innovative farming solutions. Then, two different approaches

    to observe user sentiment were utilized. In the ﬁrst approach, comments were man-

    ually labeled by two annotators into one of the following six categories: Praising,

    Queries, Suggestions, Undeﬁned, Hybrid and Opinion. Cohen’s Kappa coefﬁcient,

    which is the measure of inter-rater reliability, was calculated as 0.9617. This
    shows a

    high rate of agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The labels

    also show high positive correlation with each other, as depicted in Figure 10.
    Word

    clouds created for each video in Figures 8 and 9 highlight signiﬁcant words, such
    as

    ‘technology’, ‘farming’, ‘solar’, etc. In the second approach, polarity and subjectivity

    were calculated for each comment using Pattern library for Python. The polarity

    score ranges from −1 (negative) to 1 (positive) and indicates whether the sentiment

    is positive or negative. The overall polarity was calculated as 0.2092, indicating
    a

    slightly positive sentiment. The subjectivity score ranges from 0 (objective)
    to 1 (sub-

    jective) and indicates the degree of factual information or opinion in the statement.

    The overall subjectivity was calculated as 0.4352, suggesting that the comments
    were

    slightly objective. This implies that the comments discussed were fact-based rather

    than opinionated. However, only a rudimentary study was performed to determine

    user sentiment, and better results can be achieved using state-of-the-art models
    for

    sentiment analysis. In the brief overview of user sentiment conducted in the study,

    we noticed lack of user comments on informative and technical videos about smart

    farming platforms, indicating that a knowledge gap and a digital divide exists
    for

    such technologies [175], which can be detrimental to their widespread adoption.
    The

    general attitude of users towards smart farming technologies is superﬁcial, as
    the

    public is not well-informed about these topics.

    8. Conclusions

    Ensuring a sustainable food supply for the ever-increasing global population has

    become a necessity due to the unprecedented changes in the environment. The agricultural

    sector must update its practices in light of the worsening strain on land and
    water resources,

    and data-driven approaches provide such an opportunity to ensure sustainability.
    This

    study provided an overview of ICTs and DTs in automating and streamlining farming

    operations, and demonstrated how smart farming can improve crop yields by monitoring,

    disease prevention, automation of sowing and harvesting, etc. Examples of primary

    technological tools available for smart farming are IoT, unmanned vehicles, remote
    sensing,

    predictive analysis through big data, and so on. This shift towards data-driven
    approaches

    enables farming facilities to utilize available resources for maximum yield. The
    study also

    presents various challenges that are associated with large-scale implementation
    of smart

    farming practices, such as poor connectivity in rural areas, insufﬁcient funds
    and skilled

    labor, skepticism from farmers, concerns with data privacy, and more. To analyze
    the

    attitude of the public towards implementation of smart farming, we performed sentiment

    analysis on comments from YouTube channels related to smart farming. Preliminary

    ﬁndings in both user-based and transfer-learning based opinion mining suggest
    that a

    better understanding of smart farming tools would help the public in forming an
    informed

    opinion. Further advances are required to improve precision, cost, and efﬁciency
    of robots,

    sensors, and unmanned vehicles before they are readily adopted. Keeping the barriers

    to adoption for smart farming techniques in mind, the future scope of research
    would

    be to develop techniques that provide greater adaptability, ensure food sustainability,

    reduce cost, and counter the harmful affects of climate change on agriculture.
    Greater

    connectivity in rural areas could accelerate the integration of ICTs in smallholder
    farms,

    allowing them to prepare for unprecedented changes in farming conditions. Further

    research and investigation of the possible uses of DTs and ICTs is necessary to
    understand

    the challenges and opportunities in smart farming. A detailed sentiment analysis
    using

    advanced language models and inclusion of non-English comments can also provide
    greater

    insight into the expectations and opinions of digital users towards innovative
    farming

    solutions. Multidisciplinary research also needs to be conducted to elucidate
    other socio–

    economic, environmental, and technical factors that impede development and adoption
    of

    such innovations.

    \ \n  \nAbstract: The agricultural sector is of great importance to fulfill food\
    \ resources need of the country. Precision Agriculture \n(PA) with Internet of\
    \ Things and Wireless Sensor Network is a transformation from traditional farming\
    \ to smart farming. \nWireless sensor networks and Internet of Things are considered\
    \ as drivers to develop system which can change agriculture \nsector from manual\
    \ to automatic. Advancement in the technology have pushed the growth of precision\
    \ agriculture to very large \nextent despite of several challenges faced in this\
    \ area. System for precision agriculture relies on hardware components mainly\
    \ \nwireless sensors which act as a source for gathering of real time data. Depending\
    \ upon the real time date retrieved by sensors \nautomation in agriculture is\
    \ done by adopting decision-based system. With Precision agriculture productivity\
    \ is optimized by \nmaintaining sustaniability as crop receives what is acutual\
    \ requirement on the basis of new techniques and software platforms. \nThis review\
    \ article includes Inernet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensors, Wireless communication\
    \ and challenges faced in this \narea. \n \nKeywords: Precision Agriculture, Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks, Internet of Things \n___________________________________________________________________________\
    \ \n  \n1. Introduction  \nIndia has 16% of world papulation but have 4% of world’s\
    \ fresh water resources out of which 80% is used \nfor agriculture [1]. India\
    \ is known as agricultural country as 80% of its rural papulation have agriculture\
    \ as their \nsource of livelihood [2]. Many states of India have their agriculture\
    \ totally dependent on rainfall due to very less \navailability of freshwater.\
    \ This shortage of freshwater supply demands paradigm shift to productivity per\
    \ unit of \nwater. In various economic surveys done in past five years it is indicated\
    \ that adoption of advancement in \ntechnologies is required to make agriculture\
    \ sector sustainable for small and marginal farmers. Climatic changes \nthat are\
    \ affecting country in various ways, are going to lower farmer’s income further\
    \ by 25%. Three factors \nunder climate change pointed are decline in average\
    \ rainfall, rise in temperature and more dry days. India’s 73.2 \nmillion hectares\
    \ area is still unirrigated area and only rainfall dependent out of 141.4 million\
    \ hectares net sown \narea. Economic Survey alerted and recommended the requirement\
    \ for “dramatic” improvement in irrigation by \ninvolving new technologies [3].\
    \ In traditional farming irrigation is either done by manual observation of farmer\
    \ \nor it is scheduled irrigation. Additionally, water overuse can cause water\
    \ shortage, often occurs in areas of \nirrigation agriculture, and harms the environment.\
    \ Present scenario demands novel technology for increasing the \ncrop productivity,\
    \ and a technology to reduce the water consumption for irrigation. This is clearly\
    \ indicating a \ntransformation of traditional farming to Precision agriculture.\
    \ Precision Agriculture (PA) not only increases crop \nyield and revenues but\
    \ also involves methods which are very environment friendly. Precision agriculture\
    \ is a way \nof farming which is done by considering all the elements related\
    \ to soil moisture and temperature, environment \ndetails like temperature, humidity\
    \ and rate of evaporation measured by technology-based devices. Precision \nagriculture\
    \ is done more precisely on the basis of what is required, when is required and\
    \ where is required in the \nfarm. Precision farming is a technique of farming\
    \ that changes the use of pesticides and fertilizers to evaluate the \nvariation\
    \ in the growth conditions within the agriculture field. This way of practice\
    \ is termed as Site Specific \nManagement (SSM) [4]. This way it reduces the amount\
    \ of chemicals released into the environment. Precision \nagriculture also helps\
    \ in reducing the requirement of man power which further helps farmers to have\
    \ more \neconomic benefits. Advancement in Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Artificial Intelligence and Internet of \nthings are very helpful to attain\
    \ Precision agriculture. This review paper is focused on Internet of things and\
    \ \nvarious techniques used in this field to agriculture technology based. \n\
    \  2. Precision Agriculture \nPrecision agriculture is management of farming on\
    \ basis of observation, measurement and decision-based \nsystem. First revolution\
    \ of precision agriculture started with use machinery in place of manpower and\
    \ farming \nwith help of animals. This revolution happened in early 19s (1900-1930).\
    \ Second wave started with green \nrevolution which enhanced agriculture on the\
    \ basis genetics which led to precise plantation. Presently, third wave \nof revolution\
    \ is going on which came into implementation in 1980 with the advanced technologies\
    \ in agriculture \n[5]. The main focus of the review article is to study various\
    \ methods opted by different researchers in past five \nyears for smart farming.\
    \ Various technologies that are helping different researchers are Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Cloud \nComputing, Internet of Things, Wireless sensor network, Artificial intelligence,\
    \ Image processing using \nRana Gill  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n132  \nComputer\
    \ vision and many more. These technologies are helping to transform traditional\
    \ farming to precision \nagriculture at very fast pace. Various technologies used\
    \ in precision agriculture are shown below in figure1 [6]. \n \nFig. 1.  Overview\
    \ of Precision Agriculture Technologies \nThis article is framed to cover only\
    \ those research article which Internet of things based. The survey presents \n\
    the idea of Precision agriculture with various innovations from its cause, various\
    \ technologies and their up-\ngradations ideas. Precision Agriculture utilizes\
    \ Internet of things (IoT) arrangements to increase productivity \nwhile reducing\
    \ water consumption, manpower required and saving environment. In the early stages,\
    \ Precision \nagriculture consisted mostly of map-based technologies using geo\
    \ statistical methods such as GIS and satellite \nbased remote sensing. And main\
    \ focus was to apply to control fertilizer use. Earlier sensors were not commonly\
    \ \nused because of high cost, unreliable or unavailable for necessary applications.\
    \ Precision agriculture got started \nin its third wave during 1980s but till\
    \ early 2000s not adopted by many farmers. The key obstacles to the adoption \n\
    of such approaches were the lack of technology, lack of scientific evidence, no\
    \ training and high cost [7]. \nDecreased sensors cost and rapid Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and Big data growth lead to development and testing \nof more PA system.\
    \ IoT works in form of cycle that firstly do monitoring with the help of sensor,\
    \ analysis of \ninformation gathered and then control [8]. Further by involving\
    \ Big data Analytics and machine learning decision \nmaking system can be designed\
    \ [9].  \n2.1 Internet of Things \nIn agriculture the Internet of Things is about\
    \ cameras, sensors and other smart devices to get data from every \naction in\
    \ farm. Internet of things helps to build smart farming in various forms like\
    \ sensing, watermanagement to \nincrease crop yield, determine fertizer requirement,\
    \ finding optimal time for planatation and harveting and \nweather conditions.\
    \ IoT is a type of enviornment in which objects can transmit data over internet\
    \ without or with \nminimal human interventation [10]. The IoT is designed around\
    \ various wireless radio standards which are \nresponsible for interaction of\
    \ different devices with each other through the Internet. It comprises many standards\
    \ \nlike Zigbee, Bluetooth, LoWPAN, Wi-Fi ,NFC, Z WAVE, RFID, and so on. Physical\
    \ object which collects and \nprocesses data that it receives about the enviornment\
    \ [11]. These objects are built with sensors, actuators, \nmicrocontrollers and\
    \ transceivers. The irrigation requirements can easily be automated by the IoT-\
    \ driven decision \nsupport system (DSS). In [22] authors proposed system to transmit\
    \ information through the internet with the help \nof internet of things The IoT\
    \ allows devices to control remotely or sense physical environmental factors using\
    \ \nsensor nodes. The user interface is generated with the help of an Android\
    \ app. The data gathered by the sensor \nnodes propagates following tree topology\
    \ to reach the base station. Arduino UNO and nodeMCU are used for \ntransmission\
    \ and soring the data collected to the cloud. Developed Android app enables the\
    \ access of an \ninformation uploaded to the cloud.  \nVarious technologies are\
    \ growing under internet of things and many methods are proposed and implemented\
    \ \nby various researchers in recent years. \n 2.1.1 Wireless Sensor Network \
    \ \nWireless sensor Networks help in shift from traditional farming to smart farming.\
    \ Research on Precision \nagriculture from basic climate information, soil information\
    \ to decision support system for irrigation are \ndependent on collection of data\
    \ by wireless sensors. The wireless sensor system not only improves crop \nproductivity\
    \ but also helps in saving environment in various forms [12].  A WSN usually consists\

    \ \n133  \nof communication. Wireless communication standards plays an important\
    \ role for normal functioning of wireless \nsensor network. Various techniques\
    \ are designed at physical layer and protocols are followed at higher layers for\
    \ \neffective working of wireless sensor network. Nodes are generally categorises\
    \ as a source node and  a sink or \ngateway node. The collection of data is done\
    \ by source node and receiving of data is by sink or gateway node. In \nterms\
    \ of computational power sink nodes have higher power in comparison to a source\
    \ node. While choosing \nwireless nodes constraints faced are size, data rate,\
    \ memory and power consumption. In [13] comparison of sensor \nnodes used in precision\
    \ agriculture is done with their specification and it is considered that MICA2\
    \ is more \nsuitable due to its capability to connect with many sensors  with\
    \ help of its large expansion connectors. In recent \nmany ways are opted by different\
    \ researchers to apply wireless sensor network to agriculture. In [14] method\
    \ \nproposed to monitor agriculture environment was based on smart wireless sensor\
    \ network. They design an \narchitecture by deploying various nodes in the agriculture\
    \ area. Then collected data was analysed and displaying \nit to end user. Similarly,\
    \ In [15] authors  proposed a technique which applies on top surface of the soil\
    \ in two \ndomains namely time and space to monitor variation in soil moisture\
    \ content. This experiment has conducted by \nconsidering twenty seven different\
    \ locations where wireless sensor nodes have deployed. To collect real-time \n\
    data multi hope configuration has been used. In [16] paper has wireless sensor\
    \ network based smart system used \nin a red bayberry greenhouse. A smart system\
    \ is designed using temperature sensors and soil moisture. This \nsystem monitor\
    \ the humidity ,temperature and illumination in the greenhouse. In [17] authors\
    \ proposed wireless \nsensor networks based system in potato farm which monitors\
    \ individual crop requirements. The farmers can easily \nrecognise the different\
    \ requirements of crop ,fertilizers use and need of irrigation. The article presented\
    \ a model \nfor irrigation management to figure out agricultural parameters using\
    \ intelligent humidity sensors and \nmathematical calculations on the basis of\
    \ received input. In [18] authors  presented smart precision agriculture \nsystem\
    \ using IoT technology and wireless sensor network . This system has designed\
    \ automated irrigation system. \nComparison of scheduled irrigation in which irrigation\
    \ is done at specific times with automatic irrigation system \nbased on  moisture\
    \ sensors, temperature, and humidity. Two irrigation methods are compared and\
    \ it is found that \nautomatic irrigation has better efficiency in terms of water\
    \ consumption. In [19] proposed method is implemented \nby dividing the agricultural\
    \ land in for regions and three different sensors namely temperature, humidity\
    \ and soil \nmoisture sensor. Data collection is done by these sensor nodes and\
    \ transmitted through other nodes and gateways \nto server. Data received at server\
    \ is analysed and displayed in an application in GUI that can be made available\
    \ \nin mobile application and on the related website. In [20] authors developed\
    \ IoT-enabled wireless sensor network \nenvironment to monitor soil and environmental\
    \ parameters which are used to schedule irrigation on the basis of \nwater requirements.\
    \ Developed robust mechanism using interpolation technique for making soil moisture\
    \ content \ndistribution map. Method  made distribution map  by measuring soil\
    \ moisture content at different nine positions \nof the agricultural land. Structural\
    \ similarity index (SSIM) mechanisms was adopted to control irrigation valves\
    \ \ndepending on zone-specific irrigation control commands. In [21] a wireless\
    \ drip irrigation system was presented \nby deploying soil moisture sensors. An\
    \ implementation of a WSN was realized for wireless managed irrigation \nsolution\
    \ and real time monitoring of soil water content. Data collection is done with\
    \ the help of solar powered \nbased wireless acquisition stations to automate\
    \ an irrigation. With this system design monitoring of water content \nwas done.\
    \ It is clear from above reviewed papers that proposed systems use multiple sensors\
    \ nodes to make \nagriculture more precise. The design of the system is selected\
    \ depending on various features that fulfil the \nrequirement for low cost , less\
    \ power consumption, less water consumption, reduced manpower and secure \nwireless\
    \ communication between these nodes [23].  \nIn the agriculture sector wireless\
    \ sensor networks are being used to develop smart irrigation systems, smart \n\
    fertilization systems, crop health monitoring, early crop disease detection and\
    \ smart pest control systems.  \n  2.1.2 IoT Connectivity \nIn IoT objects can\
    \ talk and this is possible only through their connectivity to each other and\
    \ to the outside \nworld. Due to the rapid growth in WSN technologies and IoT\
    \ devices several wireless communication protocols \nare brought in use. These\
    \ protocols have their own specifications depending on various factors like data\
    \ rate, \nbandwidth, free channels, , battery life and cost [24]. Commonly used\
    \ protocol for IoT connectivity in agriculture \nsector are Zigbee, Bluetooth,\
    \ 6LoWPAN, RFID, Wi-Fi and Lora WAN.  ZigBee is a wireless protocol commonly \n\
    used in precision agriculture applications like smart irrigation systems and smart\
    \ greenhouses [25]. In [26], \nauthors presented a smart irrigation system in\
    \ which communication is handled by the ZigBee module. This \nsystem used two\
    \ nodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node where sensor node was comprised\
    \ of soil moisture \nsensors, which were used to monitor the water level in the\
    \ soil and the actuator module used to take required \nactions on basis of the\
    \ water content of the soil. ZigBee protocol handled the whole communication part\
    \ of the \nsystem. In [27] wireless greenhouse sensors based on CC2420 and Zigbee.\
    \ In [28] greenhouse environment \nmonitoring system using three sensors namely\
    \ light intensity sensor, air temperature sensor and humidity sensor \nwas designed.\
    \ The system monitoring is Wi-Fi based which converts TTL signal from the sensor\
    \ to the Wi-Fi \nsignal to be transmitted to the server. In this framework physical\
    \ devices are connected to Wi-Fi network to \nmonitor and control greenhouse environment.\
    \ Similarly, In another smart agriculture system proposed in [29] \nWi-Fi protocols\
    \ were used. In this paper system is designed using Raspberry Pi   and multiple\
    \ sensors used for \ndata collection. The transmission of this data to the cloud\
    \ is done using Wi-Fi protocols.  Indu and S.R.N. [30] \nproposed a GSM(Global\
    \ system for mobile communication) based system to control irrigation. The system\
    \ \ndesigned is used to set the irrigation time depending on the data collected\
    \ by temperature and humidity sensors \nwhich helps to irrigate automatically\
    \ when unattended. Communication between the end user and system is \nRana Gill\
    \  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n134  \nestablished via short messaging service\
    \ (SMS) on GSM network. In [31], a proposed system used smart phone \nusing Bluetooth\
    \ to collect the data from sensors deployed in the farm. Sensors used in the system\
    \ are soil \ntemperature sensor and soil moisture sensor. In [32] a smartphone\
    \ App is designed which enables the Wi-Fi \nconnection of the smartphone creating\
    \ an access point to a router node. This node is connected through the Zigbee\
    \ \nprotocol to a gateway that controls the irrigation pump. In [33], authors\
    \ presented wireless sensor network to \nmonitor the soil properties of the farm\
    \ by using a 6LoWPAN. 4G cellular technology is also considered as a good \nchoice\
    \ in underground wireless sensor networks [34]. Common IoT applications which\
    \ use RFID are security, \nmedical, smart shopping and smart agriculture. RFID\
    \ based smart irrigation system was presented in [35] which \nused soil moisture\
    \ and soil temperature sensors for controlling valve of irrigation pump. An information\
    \ collected \nby these sensors is transmitted to the cloud based on RFID wireless\
    \ communication protocols, with the help of \nwhich user can control a water pump.\
    \  \n  3. Precision Agriculture Challenges \nPrecision agriculture is in use from\
    \ last few decades to increase crop productivity by keeping low cost and \nless\
    \ human intervention. But still very limited farmers have adopted these techniques\
    \ due to several challenges. \nAs Precision agriculture relies on different sensors\
    \ which have certain limitations like deployment, development \ncost and maintenance\
    \ cost. So this hardware cost is main challenge in precision agriculture. Atmospheric\
    \ \ndisturbances also cause interference in wireless communication channels which\
    \ can further interrupt \ncommunication between wireless nodes and cloud. In Precision\
    \ agriculture systems large amounts of data get \ngenerated which need storage\
    \ and data analysis. New facilities and software platforms are in demand for \n\
    management of data. Literacy and connectivity are another important factors that\
    \ affects the adoption of smart \nfarming. The main challenge that is acting as\
    \ an obstruction in growth of precision agriculture is interoperability. \n 4.\
    \ Conclusion and Future scope \nPrecision agriculture with involvement of technologies\
    \ like IoT and wireless sensor networks helps to increase \nyield and productivity\
    \ with resource optimization. Most of the research articles in this field indicates\
    \ that precision \nagriculture is about sustainability and decision support systems.\
    \ Precision agriculture includes multiple \nparameters like temperature, soil\
    \ moisture, light intensity, humidity, soil nutrients, etc. Many challenges are\
    \ also \ninvolved in the system developed for precision agriculture. New software\
    \ platforms and advanced technologies \ncan further help in development of smart\
    \ agriculture. \nReferences \nA. C. Jose, “Improving home automation security;\

    Abstract: Agriculture 5.0 refers to the next phase of agricultural development,
    building upon the

    previous digital revolution in the agrarian sector and aiming to transform the
    agricultural industry

    to be smarter, more effective, and ecologically conscious. Farming processes have
    already started

    becoming more efﬁcient due to the development of digital technologies, including
    big data, artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented
    reality. Farmers

    can make the most of the resources at their disposal thanks to this data-driven
    approach, allowing

    them to effectively cultivate and sustain crops on arable land. The European Union
    (EU) aims to

    make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable through the Green
    Deal and its

    farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, zero pollution action plan, and
    upcoming sustainable

    use of pesticides regulation. Many of the historical synthetic pesticides are
    not currently registered

    in the EU market. In addition, the continuous use of a limited number of active
    ingredients with

    the same mode of action scales up pests/pathogens/weed resistance potential. Increasing
    plant

    protection challenges as well as having fewer chemical pesticides to apply require
    innovation and

    smart solutions for crop production. Biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks to
    human health and the

    environment, their efﬁcacy depends on various factors that cannot be controlled
    through traditional

    application strategies. This paper aims to disclose the contribution of robotic
    systems in Agriculture

    5.0 ecosystems, highlighting both the challenges and limitations of this technology.
    Speciﬁcally, this

    work documents current threats to agriculture (climate change, invasive pests,
    diseases, and costs)

    and how robotics and AI can act as countermeasures to deal with such threats.
    Finally, speciﬁc case

    studies and the application of intelligent robotic systems to them are analyzed,
    and the architecture

    for our intelligent decision system is proposed.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture 5.0 constitutes an entire ecosystem; it aims to integrate emerging
    technolo-

    gies, such as AI, IoT, and ML in agriculture, to improve productivity while promoting
    sus-

    tainability and decision-making processes. Enhancing traditional farming practices
    through

    automation and scalable technology solutions is meant to reduce risks, enhance
    sustain-

    ability, and provide predictive decision-making for growers [1,2]. Moreover, data-driven

    agriculture and advanced farm management systems are becoming increasingly important

    in the contemporary agrarian sector. Smart agriculture relies on objective information

    acquired through sensors to make optimal decisions and maximize productivity while

    ensuring resource efﬁciency and environmental sustainability. By incorporating
    robotic

    solutions and AI techniques, data-driven agriculture lays the groundwork for sustainable

    agriculture in the future. In relation to Industry 5.0 (which emphasizes collaboration
    be-

    tween humans and intelligent machines, with a focus on resilience and sustainability),

    Agriculture 5.0 seeks to reconcile the need for sufﬁcient and affordable food
    production

    with the preservation of ecosystems. While Industry and Agriculture 4.0 focus
    mainly on

    technologies, like IoT and Big Data, Industry and Agriculture 5.0 add human, environmen-

    tal, and social aspects to the equation. The transition from the digital farming
    revolution to

    Agriculture 5.0 is considered critical for the future well-being of farmers and
    the gradual

    shift to efﬁcient, intelligent, and autonomous farms in terms of energy consumption.

    tegrating emerging technologies and alternative energy sources into Agriculture
    5.0 can

    provide cost-effective access to ﬁnance, weather updates, remote monitoring, and
    future

    energy solutions for smart farm installations.

    According to the European Agricultural Industry (EU-27), the growing demands on

    agricultural products as well as the growing world population have raised the
    demand

    for an increased production yield. Note that agriculture possesses strong links
    with food

    processing and farm machinery sectors. The latter is directly affected by the
    performance

    of the agrarian sector; thus, the total economic impact of agriculture is multiplied
    [3].

    More speciﬁcally, the global population increase and the consecutive exponential
    one in

    food demand have led to a search for more efﬁcient ways of production, both in
    terms

    of production size and quality of products. Speciﬁcally, the above reasons caused
    the

    Third Agricultural Revolution to ﬂourish by introducing vital technological pillars
    in the

    agricultural ﬁeld. The mentioned stations are: (i) the selective breeding to improve
    the

    quality of food in products for humans and animals as well as (ii) the use of
    chemical fertil-

    izers and synthetic pesticides for increased quality production with a low environmental

    footprint. Chemical pesticides used to protect crops from pests, pathogens, and
    weeds pose

    acute and long-term risks to humans and other non-target organisms [4]. Moreover,
    many

    pesticides and their degradation products persist in the environment for many
    years [5].

    The farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, as well as the zero pollution
    action

    plan, include ambitious and speciﬁc targets on pesticides, fertilizers, biological
    agriculture,

    and resistance development against pesticides (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/sustainability/environmental-sustainability/cap-andenvironment_en (accessed

    on 1 April 2023)) [6]. Some clear targets to be achieved by 2030 are to reduce
    chemicals

    and more hazardous pesticides by 50%, reduce fertilizer use by 20%, and enhance
    the

    organic farming sector by 25% of total farmland (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/farming/organic-farming/organic-production-and-products_en (accessed
    on

    1 April 2023)). New technological advances must be introduced in traditional agricultural

    systems to support those EU targets. Hence, process automation can be a modern
    way

    of handling this situation. The high-tech precision agriculture systems result
    from the

    research and development of interdisciplinary teams in mechatronics and agronomy
    [7].

    In this context, various vehicles have been developed, which are capable of moving
    in

    difﬁcult rural terrains, while the development of drones has given new impetus
    to several

    applications, such as crop health assessment, plant monitoring, etc. These developments

    allow modern mechatronic systems to collect data, communicate wirelessly, and
    share

    large sizes of data between them [8,9]. The above data constitute a cornerstone
    of precision

    farming since they can be used for timely and accurate spraying of fungicides,
    insecticides

    and herbicides, fruit harvesting when appropriate for ripening, etc. This enables
    intelligent

    cultivation, production automation, and production automation, saving farmers’
    time in

    various stages of production, such as sowing, spraying, harvesting, etc. At the
    same time,

    farmers have the ability to control their processes and results through communication

    technology [10]. The evolution of modern robots has an impact on improving the
    quality of

    crops by increasing both the proﬁtability of producers as well as the choice-consumption

    of quality food [11]. Therefore, the implementation of new technologies helps
    to restrict

    dosing and dispersal, thereby reducing the environmental consequences. However,
    inde-

    pendent of their targeted operational environment, contemporary robots should
    be smart

    and, thus, retain advanced perception abilities [12,13]. These capabilities are
    highly related

    to how the robots understand, interpret, and represent their environment and its
    elements

    (such as crops, leaves, etc.), and each individual productive entity (e.g., plants,
    trees, pests,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    3 of 15

    pathogens, etc.). Semantic mapping is salutary and can provide viable solutions
    to related

    problems [14]. Also, the heterogeneous data extracted from an integrated system
    are neces-

    sary to be understandable and useful for the direct actions of the producers/farmers
    or for

    the direct supply to another robot system that implements the next action (for
    example,

    spraying, collecting fruit, etc.). The above challenges involve system advancements
    in

    terms of dependability and semantic perception abilities with the ultimate requirement
    of

    being operable in different environments.

    Crop protection constitutes a major food production component. Using cutting-edge

    technologies such as the introduction of low-risk pesticides, precision farming,
    and genome

    editing will help to keep modern agriculture sustainable. Timely monitoring of
    crop

    protection problems and targeted application of the ﬁt-for-purpose pesticide would
    reduce

    the overall risk and increase the efﬁcacy of each application. Speciﬁcally, our
    proposed

    system will contribute to improving crop protection by making it more efﬁcient
    and robust.

    The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:

    •

    To summarize the most recent and relevant literature in the domain of smart farming

    through robots.

    •

    To highlight and stress the beneﬁts of introducing an autonomous robotic ecosystem
    in

    the agricultural ﬁeld.

    •

    To reveal the technological challenges and barriers to introducing such solutions
    in

    this domain.

    •

    To propose a conceptual framework for the realization of robotized systems in
    agricul-

    tural environments to help with their protection.

    •

    To explore potential improvements in pesticide efﬁcacy by providing timely pesticide

    delivery to targets.

    •

    To investigate strategies for reducing the risk posed by pesticide applications
    to non-

    target organisms.

    •

    To discuss the development of a decision support system for selecting low-risk
    pesticides

    among the available options.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Firstly, the crop justiﬁcation
    is analyzed

    in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss related works in the ﬁeld of precision
    agriculture.

    In the same section, the problem formulation is also presented. Section 4 describes
    the

    agriculture ﬁeld requirements, and the next section highlights the beneﬁts of
    utilizing AI

    methods. In Section 5, we analyze the proposed system and its architecture. In
    Section 6, a

    discussion of our ﬁndings is provided, while in Section 7, our conclusions are
    drawn and

    plans for future work are presented.

    2. Crop Justiﬁcation

    Two important crops for the EU economy were selected as case studies. A ﬁeld crop

    (wheat) and a perennial crop (olive) constitute our models, covering different
    (i) crop-

    ping systems, (ii) pest/weed/pathogen severity, and (iii) registered pesticides.
    The olive

    tree (Olea europea L.) is a universal tree that has accompanied Mediterranean
    agriculture

    for thousands of years. Nowadays, over 750 million olive trees are cultivated
    world-

    wide, 95% of which are in the Mediterranean region. The fruit, oil, and branches
    of

    olive trees have been culturally and economically tightly linked with Mediterranean
    his-

    tory (https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/news/producing-69-worlds-production-eu-largest-

    producer-olive-oil-2020-02-04_en (accessed on 20 April 2023)). About 98% of olive
    oil

    and 80% of table olive production are from Mediterranean countries. Approximately

    70% of the world’s olive oil production is concentrated in Europe. In the EU,
    olive tree

    plantations are found in nine EU Member States: Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal,
    Cyprus,

    France, Croatia, Slovenia, and Malta. EU olive production reached 10,908,000 tonnes

    and EUR 2255 million in 2016 [15]. The average annual olive yield and product
    qual-

    ity varied between years, reﬂecting the effect of plant protection problems. The
    olive

    tree is a long-living drought-tolerant species that is limited by many biotic
    stressors (e.g.,

    pests, diseases, and weeds). Bactrocera oleae, Prays oleae, Euphyllura spp., Saissetia
    oleae,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    4 of 15

    Parlatoria oleae, and Eriophyidae mites are the most important pests and Cycloconium
    oleag-

    inum, Glomerella cingulata, Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi are among the
    diseases receiv-

    ing chemical control by various pesticides. In the EU, olive cultivation tends
    to move from

    traditional low-density systems to new, high-density, super-intensive cropping
    systems.

    All of these changes have affected the incidence and severity of pests and diseases.
    In olive

    trees, at least ten of the currently registered pesticides, one insecticide (lambda-Cyhalothrin),

    seven fungicides (Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper oxide, copper oxychloride,

    Difenoconazole, Tebuconazole, Tribasic copper sulfate), and two herbicides (Diﬂufenican,

    Metribuzin) are listed as candidates for substitution. Copper products are used
    in high

    quantities and most alternatives lack copper efﬁcacy. Moreover, the limited number
    of

    pesticides registered for use in olives has resulted in resistance development
    to most pests,

    diseases, and weeds against insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, respectively.
    Table 1

    summarizes the currently registered pesticides in olive trees. Cereal grains have
    numerous

    uses, such as bread, semolina, and pasta; they are also important components of
    animal

    feed and serve as raw material in the production of products such as alcohol,
    beer, starch,

    and dextrin, and are used in the glucose industry. In the EU, the cereal sector
    accounted

    for approximately 11% of the total output value of agricultural production in
    2016 and it

    is an important sector in the northern member states (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/

    RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/640143/EPRS_BRI(2019)640143_EN.pdf (accessed on 1 April

    2023)). The EU cereal sector is facing structural, ﬁnancial, and climatic challenges.
    Russia’s

    war against Ukraine has put global food security at risk and has contributed signiﬁcantly

    to the growing wheat and wheat ﬂour prices. Around one-third of the EU’s cereal
    imports

    in 2021 came from Ukraine and Russia; following the war, the EU had to undertake
    all

    measures to certify EU cereal production. Wheat, the most important cereal crop
    cultivated

    worldwide, is used to prepare bread for approximately 40% of the global population
    [16].

    Wheat is an important commodity in Europe, with a production of 133 million tonnes
    per

    year. Wheat production depends on numerous production factors, and the use of
    pesti-

    cides is important for increasing the quantity and quality of wheat production.
    Pesticides

    help to control pests and diseases or their vectors, as well as reduce spoilage
    during stor-

    age. Broadleaf and grassy weeds, diseases (Puccinia striiformis/graminis/recondita,
    Erysiphe

    graminis, Septoria tritici/nodorum, Fusarium spp. Tilletia caries, Ustilago nuda,
    Ustilago spp.,

    Rhizoctonia spp.), insects (Agrotis spp., Rhopalosiphum padi, Sitobion avenae,
    Limothrips cere-

    alium), and other pests can reduce wheat crop yields, and the use of pesticides
    helps to

    minimize these losses. In the early stages of crop development, using herbicides
    to con-

    trol weed infestations is essential for achieving optimal grain yield and desired
    economic

    beneﬁts. With wheat, at least two insecticides (Cypermethrin, lambda-Cyhalothrin),
    one

    fungicide (Tebuconazole), and two herbicides (Pendimethalin, Metsulfuron-methyl)
    from

    the current authorized products are listed as candidates for substitution. Wheat
    production

    is also threatened by the development of weed resistance against most registered
    herbicides,

    and there are numerous instances of insects and fungi developing resistance against
    insecti-

    cides and fungicides, respectively. While the investigation into less harmful
    compounds

    to substitute undesirable pesticides is an important strategy, other promising
    smart farm-

    ing technologies (innovative formulations), tools (innovative spraying equipment),
    and

    methodologies (lower dosages) can contribute to increased pesticide efﬁcacy and
    reduced

    impact on the environment and human health. Table 2 summarizes the currently registered

    pesticides in wheat. AI can help in the selection of the most appropriate pesticides
    in order

    to achieve the highest efﬁciency against targeted crop protection problems and
    the lowest

    risks for resistance development and hazards related to non-target organisms.
    The mode of

    action of pesticides, the life cycle and susceptibility of pests/pathogens/weeds,
    stability,

    leaching and runoff potential, environmental conditions, and availability of application

    technologies are among the major factors that an AI system can be trained to handle.

    3. Related Works

    This section presents the existing knowledge related to the research topic and
    provides

    an overview of the relevant literature. The purpose of this section is to contextualize
    the

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    6 of 15

    research of the ﬁeld’s current state. Through a comprehensive review of related
    works,

    gaps in the research can be identiﬁed, providing a rationale for our study. This
    section also

    allows readers to situate the research within a broader scholarly conversation
    and provides

    a foundation for the argument presented in the paper.

    The importance of crop area (CA) protection can be attributed to the growing pop-

    ulation. Automatic mapping using information extracted from high-spatial resolution

    remote sensing (RS) images is powerful for acquiring accurate and up-to-date CA
    maps.

    RS image information extraction includes feature classiﬁcation, which is a long-standing

    research issue in the RS community [13]. Emerging deep learning techniques, such
    as the

    deep semantic segmentation network technique, are effective methods to automatically

    discover relevant contextual features and obtain better image classiﬁcation results
    [17].

    More speciﬁcally, several studies have dealt with agricultural precision sectors,
    contributing

    to increased agricultural yields. Note that the authors of [18] applied transfer
    learning

    to domain adaptation—from the source domain to the plant domain—by using a major

    category in the plant domain. Category adaptation was performed from the major
    to minor

    categories within the plant domain. UAVs are immediately accessible tools for
    remote sens-

    ing scientists and farmers. In recent years, small commercial UAVs (<50 kg) [19]
    have been

    available for environmental and agricultural applications. Much of the research
    on preci-

    sion agriculture for conservation has focused on strategically placing conservation
    areas to

    minimize runoff contaminants (e.g., sediment, nutrients, and pesticides) and,
    subsequently,

    increasing water quality [20]. The approach in [21] stated that spatial variability
    in soil,

    crops, and topographic characteristics, combined with temporal variability between
    sea-

    sons, could lead to variable annual yield patterns. The complexity of interactions
    between

    yield-limiting factors, such as soil nutrients and soil water, requires specialized
    statistical

    processing to quantify convenience and, thus, inform crop management practices.
    This

    study used multiple linear regression models, cubic regression, and neural propagation

    networks to predict performance.

    Generally, the advent of AI and robotized solutions have revolutionized crop protection

    by offering advanced capabilities and precision in addressing agricultural challenges.
    These

    technologies enable automated monitoring, early detection of pests and diseases,
    targeted

    application of treatments, and efficient resource management, leading to increased
    crop

    yields and sustainable farming practices. Semantic recognition plays a crucial
    role in crop

    protection by enabling the identification and classification of pests, diseases,
    and other threats

    to agricultural crops [13,14]. Through advanced algorithms and machine learning
    techniques,

    semantic recognition systems can accurately analyze images, sensor data, and other
    inputs to

    provide timely and targeted interventions, leading to improved crop health and
    yield [22,23].

    In recent years, different machine learning techniques have been implemented to
    achieve

    accurate yield prediction for different crops. The most successful techniques
    used support

    vector regression [24], M5-Prime regression trees [25], and k-nearest neighbor
    [26]. The authors

    created the spiking neural network (SNN) model for timely crop yield prediction.
    The above

    approach [27] introduces SNN as a promising technique for spatiotemporal data
    modeling

    and crop analysis prediction. Because deep learning techniques have the capability
    to extract

    feature maps from data for estimation, they can be expected to have less dependency
    on

    the input data. Even in rural areas where data acquisition is limited, deep learning
    can be

    expected to provide good crop yield estimation [28].

    In [29], the obstacles faced in implementing smart agri-robotic solutions for
    global

    broadacre crop production were analyzed. The authors argued that the current strategies

    and technologies used in agri-robotics are insufﬁcient to address the unique complexities

    associated with large-scale crop farming. They identify several key challenges,
    including

    the unpredictable nature of diverse broadacre crops, the necessity for adaptable
    robotic

    systems, and the intricate decision-making processes involved in crop management.
    To

    overcome these challenges effectively, the authors proposed fundamentally rethinking

    existing approaches and technologies, like machine learning, computer vision,
    and sensor

    networks, as essential components of smart agri-robotic solutions. Furthermore,
    the authors

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    7 of 15

    of [30] presented an in-depth analysis of the use of intelligent robot systems
    in the ﬁeld

    of ecological agriculture. The paper emphasized the signiﬁcance of adopting advanced

    technologies to address challenges related to pest control and promote sustainable
    farming

    practices. By integrating robotic platforms, sensors, imaging techniques, and
    artiﬁcial

    intelligence algorithms, the paper discussed how these technologies enable precise
    and

    targeted pest management strategies, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and
    minimize

    environmental impacts. The beneﬁts of intelligent robot plant protection systems,
    such

    as improved efﬁciency, reduced labor requirements, and enhanced crop yield, are
    high-

    lighted. The authors also acknowledge potential challenges in implementing these
    systems,

    including cost, scalability, and compatibility with existing agricultural practices.

    Subsequently, the approach in [31] provides a comprehensive summary of the role
    and

    impact of robotics, IoT, and AI in automating the agricultural sector. The review
    explores

    various applications of these advanced technologies, including automated harvesting,

    precision agriculture, crop monitoring, livestock management, and smart irrigation
    systems.

    It highlights how the integration of robotics, IoT, and AI can enhance efﬁciency,
    productivity,

    and sustainability in farming practices. The paper also emphasizes the importance
    of

    incorporating data analytics and machine learning algorithms for intelligent decision-

    making in agriculture. Finally, it addresses the challenges associated with implementing

    these technologies, such as cost, scalability, interoperability, and data privacy.

    Moreover, in [32], the authors presented a comprehensive overview of the integration
    of

    machine learning and emerging technologies in precision crop protection, specifically
    focusing

    on the transition towards Agriculture 5.0. Specifically, the paper explored the
    immense

    potential of these technologies to revolutionize farming practices, improve sustainability,

    and optimize crop protection strategies. By delving into various areas, such as
    machine

    learning algorithms, sensor technologies, remote sensing, IoT, and data analytics,
    the review

    examined how these technologies could be utilized to enhance crucial aspects of
    agriculture,

    including crop monitoring, pest detection, disease diagnosis, and targeted application
    of

    agrochemicals. The authors emphasized the significance of context-aware and data-driven

    decision-making to achieve precision crop protection in the evolving agricultural
    landscape.

    Then, it addressed pertinent issues, such as data quality, scalability, privacy
    concerns, and the

    need for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, farmers, and policymakers.
    By

    highlighting these challenges, this approach provides a holistic view of the potential
    barriers

    and considerations that need to be addressed for successful implementation.

    4. Analysis of Agriculture Field Requirements

    As the global population is projected to surpass 9 billion by 2050, the agricultural

    industry will have to satisfy the increasing demand for food. Pesticides will
    play a cru-

    cial role in ensuring high crop yields. Pesticides, according to the Food and
    Agriculture

    Organization (FAO), include substances of natural or synthetic chemicals or biological

    ingredients used to repel, destroy, or regulate pests and regulate plant growth.
    They help

    to protect seeds and crops from unwanted plants, insects, bacteria, fungi, and
    rodents, and

    come in various types, such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides,
    and ne-

    maticides [33]. However, pesticides, herbicides, and chemicals have increased
    signiﬁcantly

    in recent years to manage plant diseases and increase crop productivity. This
    increases

    crop quantity, but it often lowers the quality, pollutes the land and groundwater,
    and

    poses several health risks, causing nearly 300,000 deaths worldwide each year.
    Early-stage

    disease detection using IoT-based solutions that deploy various sensors can help
    reduce

    the use of harmful chemicals. AI techniques, such as vision-based techniques using
    image

    processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, have also been proposed
    for

    disease detection automation [34].

    In recent years, signiﬁcant advances have been made in the use of deep learning

    (DL) approaches to build high-performance AI models for plant disease detection.
    Some

    lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods show promise for
    use

    in IoT applications. Despite advancements in these vision-based methods, real-world

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    8 of 15

    detection of plant diseases remains challenging due to complex backgrounds and
    varying

    environmental conditions. Crop monitoring through aerial/drone-based surveillance
    can

    be an alternative solution, but robust and reliable vision-based techniques are
    required to

    work for various crops. Expert knowledge and thorough training are required to
    recognize

    early symptoms of plant diseases and take timely action to prevent further spread
    [35].

    Plant diseases are classiﬁed into different categories, and visible symptoms are
    important

    in identifying diseases. Smart agriculture systems using AI methods for plant
    disease

    detection can be effective solutions to combat the problem of crop loss. There
    have been

    successful case studies in developing countries, but ﬁeld disease diagnosis in
    real time is

    still difﬁcult. Several models have been proposed to detect healthy and diseased
    leaves

    from various crops using CNN classiﬁcation techniques, achieving high accuracy
    [36].

    AI techniques for crop protection in agriculture have become increasingly prevalent

    in recent years, allowing for more efﬁcient and accurate identiﬁcation of pests,
    diseases,

    and soil deﬁciencies. AI sensors are now being utilized to identify and target
    weeds, with

    the appropriate herbicides then being applied to the speciﬁc area. In addition,
    integrating

    IoT sensors and supporting technologies, such as drones, geographic information
    systems

    (GISs), and other tools allow for real-time data monitoring, measurement, and
    storage.

    The aforementioned data can empower farmers by providing valuable insights into
    areas

    needing irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatment. This enables them to
    make well-

    informed decisions, effectively allocating resources and minimizing unnecessary
    expenses.

    Overall, incorporating AI techniques into agriculture use cases can lead to improved

    harvest quality, reduced herbicide usage, increased proﬁts, and signiﬁcant cost
    savings [35].

    Precision weed management is an efﬁcient tool to meet the EU targets for pesticide
    use

    reduction. In ﬁeld crops, like wheat, weed control is crucial to any plant protection

    scheme. Most of the proposed commercial technologies and prototypes for precision
    weed

    control consist of three essential elements (i) sensors for weed/crop detection,
    (ii) decision

    algorithms regarding the type of herbicides that would be the most efﬁcient, and
    (iii) a

    precise sprayer to deliver the appropriate dose of each herbicide to the targeted
    weed. Of

    the above-mentioned parts, inputs and validation of the decision algorithm are
    the most

    crucial for increasing the efﬁciency and reducing the risk of the applied herbicide
    [37].

    Saving herbicides by applying AI techniques in wheat depends on the location,
    stage, and

    distribution of the weeds [38]. The accuracy of the detected weeds could reach
    up to about

    99% [39]. Apart from weed management, scientiﬁc modeling has also been employed
    for

    forecasting in an IoT context involving fungal diseases in winter wheat [40].
    The recent

    progress in AI and automation have been applied to a machine-learning-based classiﬁcation

    approach to distinguish pests of tree crops, including the olive fruit ﬂy (Bactrocera
    oleae [41].

    In addition, online analytical processing models have been used to combine inputs
    in an

    integrated pest management scheme of olive tree crop protection [42].

    5. Beneﬁts of Utilizing AI Methods in Crop Protection

    The integration of robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) into agriculture has
    rev-

    olutionized the way crops are grown and protected. While the title “Sustainable
    Crop

    Protection via Robotics and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Solutions” suggests a focus
    on pest

    control, it is crucial to recognize that AI and robotics can contribute to comprehensive

    crop protection strategies. By leveraging these technologies, we can enhance agricultural

    practices and ensure a sustainable future for food production. While our primary
    focus

    lies in crop protection, speciﬁcally in the realms of weed and disease management,
    it is

    essential to acknowledge the broader scope of whole crop protection and monitoring.
    In

    this section, we aim to provide a concise overview of these additional components
    and

    highlight the invaluable contribution of AI solutions to these areas.

    Crop protection encompasses various factors beyond weeds and diseases that sig-

    niﬁcantly impact crop health and yield. Elements such as climate conditions, nutrition

    optimization, cultural activities, and plant physiology play crucial roles in
    ensuring com-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    9 of 15

    prehensive crop protection strategies. By leveraging AI solutions, we can unlock
    new

    possibilities and advancements in each of these areas.

    Climate adaptation and resilience: Climate change poses signiﬁcant challenges
    to

    agricultural productivity. AI and robotics can play pivotal roles in adapting
    and mitigating

    climate-related risks. Advanced algorithms can process vast amounts of climatic
    data,

    helping farmers make informed decisions about planting times, water usage, and
    crop

    selection. Robotics equipped with environmental sensors can monitor weather conditions,

    soil moisture levels, and pest outbreaks, providing real-time data to optimize
    crop manage-

    ment. With AI-driven climate modeling, farmers can anticipate weather patterns,
    allowing

    for timely adjustments and minimizing crop losses [32].

    Nutrition optimization: Achieving optimal crop nutrition is crucial for both yield
    and

    quality. AI and robotics can optimize nutrient management by analyzing soil composition,

    plant nutrient requirements, and growth patterns. Intelligent systems can monitor
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies or excesses, enabling precise application of fertilizers or other
    supplements.

    Additionally, robotics can automate tasks such as precision seeding, weeding,
    and nutrient

    delivery, minimizing waste and maximizing resource efﬁciency. By tailoring nutrition

    strategies to speciﬁc crop needs, AI and robotics contribute to sustainable agriculture
    while

    reducing environmental impacts [43].

    Cultural Activities and Labor Optimization: Agriculture encompasses a range of

    cultural activities that are essential for successful crop production. AI and
    robotics can

    automate and streamline various tasks, reducing labor-intensive efforts and optimizing

    resource allocation. For example, robotic systems can perform time-consuming activities

    such as harvesting, pruning, and sorting with greater accuracy and efﬁciency.
    By automat-

    ing repetitive tasks, farmers can focus on higher-value activities, such as crop
    planning,

    disease management, and market analysis. The integration of AI and robotics not
    only

    enhances productivity but also improves the quality of life for farmers, making
    agriculture

    a more attractive profession [44].

    Enhancing plant physiology and health: Understanding plant physiology is vital

    for effective crop protection. AI can analyze large datasets on plant physiology,
    growth

    patterns, and disease symptoms, enabling early detection and intervention. By
    analyzing

    the relationships between plant traits and environmental conditions, AI can develop
    models

    to predict plant stress and disease susceptibility. Robots equipped with cameras
    and sensors

    can precisely monitor plant health, detecting signs of nutrient deﬁciencies, water
    stress,

    or pest damage. This data-driven approach allows for proactive management strategies,

    reducing the reliance on reactive measures and promoting sustainable plant health
    [32].

    Furthermore, we outline some additional advantages of utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence

    (AI) methods in crop protection and agriculture as a whole. By enhancing precision
    agricul-

    ture, AI systems are improving the overall accuracy and quality of crop yields.
    Primarily,

    AI technology plays a role in detecting plant diseases, pests, and poor soil nutrition.
    Using

    AI-based sensors, weeds can be identiﬁed and targeted, and the appropriate herbicide

    can be applied in the area. Additionally, AI techniques allow for the collection
    of soil

    health data, fertilizer recommendations, weather monitoring, and tracking of the
    product’s

    readiness [45]. Hence, farmers are empowered to make informed decisions throughout
    the

    crop-growing process. Precision agriculture is a technique that incorporates the
    most efﬁ-

    cient soil management practices, variable rate technology, and optimal data management

    methods to help farmers enhance crop yields and minimize expenses. AI can offer
    real-time

    insights to farmers, allowing them to identify which areas require irrigation,
    fertilization,

    or pesticide treatment [46]. Additionally, innovative farming methods such as
    vertical

    agriculture can boost food production while minimizing resource usage. This approach

    reduces herbicide use, improves harvest quality, increases proﬁts, and has signiﬁcant
    cost

    savings. By employing IoT sensors and other supporting technologies, farmers can
    monitor,

    measure, and store ﬁeld data on various metrics in real time. Combining AI-based
    farming

    tools with IoT devices and software quickly provides farmers with more accurate
    informa-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    10 of 15

    tion. Having better data enables farmers to make more informed decisions, reducing
    the

    time and money spent on trial and error [47].

    6. Proposed Framework

    6.1. Background and Use Case Scenario

    Crop protection is an essential aspect of modern agriculture, and the use of fungicides,

    insecticides, and herbicides is common. However, the indiscriminate use of chemicals
    can

    lead to environmental damage and harmful effects on human health. An AI- and robotics-

    based crop protection system can provide a sustainable and efﬁcient solution to
    this prob-

    lem. The objective of this conceptual scenario is to develop an AI- and robotics-based
    crop

    protection system that minimizes the use of chemicals, chooses the most appropriate
    pesti-

    cide, and improves crop yield. The proposed methodology—as an example case—is
    applied

    to the agricultural crops colorof wheat and olive trees based on the following
    assumptions:

    (i) Major plant protection problems (pests/weeds/pathogens) of the selected crops
    (wheat

    and olive tree) have been identiﬁed (Tables 1 and 2). (ii) Registered insecticides,
    fungicides,

    and herbicides have been categorized as conventional, low-risk, and candidates
    for sub-

    stitution. It is also necessary to integrate the following: (iii) A decision support
    system

    regarding the selection of the most appropriate pesticide on an integrated pest
    management

    (IPM) system. (iv) Environmental factors affecting efﬁcacy and the environmental
    fate of

    pesticides. (v) Legislation and other policy information. The proposed crop protection

    scheme can be applied to environmentally sensitive cases (e.g., near protected
    surface- and

    ground-water bodies, sensitive non-target organisms, like bees, earthworms, and
    beneﬁcial

    microbes) or in cases of resistance to pesticides pests/pathogens/weeds.

    6.2. Concept

    The proposed concept incorporates a comprehensive and research-driven approach

    to revolutionize crop protection and enhance agricultural practices. A preliminary
    phase

    involves the creation of an extensive database that encompasses detailed information
    about

    various plant diseases, their corresponding pesticides, and the overall health
    status of plants.

    This database forms the foundation for accurately identifying the specific disease
    based

    on the symptoms exhibited by candidate plants. To ensure practical implementation,
    the

    system utilizes portable devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to provide farmers
    with

    images of diseased plants for disease recognition. In larger crop areas, a UAV
    equipped

    with visual sensors, capable of high or low-resolution imaging, can perform the
    disease- and

    pest-recognition process. Additionally, the system obtains georeferenced data
    on the examined

    plants, enabling the determination of potential disease spread to nearby crops
    within the area.

    Moreover, the system goes beyond disease identiﬁcation and extends its capabilities

    to identify weed species and distribute grassy and broadleaf weeds automatically.
    This

    information empowers the system to automatically employ AI to select the most
    appro-

    priate herbicide. In the future, selective spraying techniques utilizing UAVs
    could be

    implemented, provided that technological feasibility is achieved. This exciting
    prospect

    has the potential to revolutionize crop protection practices. The system also
    incorporates

    information on insect populations obtained from digital traps or other monitoring
    sys-

    tems. In the pesticide prioritization process, considerations regarding the pesticide
    risk to

    non-target organisms in wheat and olive agroecosystems can be considered. The
    system

    adapts to speciﬁc crop/pesticide combinations by incorporating pesticide cutoff
    criteria or

    dedicated authorization schemes aligned with national or regional legislation.

    Furthermore, the proposed system is designed to seamlessly communicate with other

    components of Agriculture 5.0. These include automatic watering functions, autonomous

    spraying robots, weather sensors, and software for optimizing spraying schedules,
    har-

    vesting, and other farming operations. By leveraging these interconnected components,

    the system aims to optimize farm protection, create a sustainable ecosystem, and
    foster a

    holistic approach to agriculture. The proposed framework is depicted in Figure
    1, highlight-

    ing the systematic ﬂowchart of the entire process. Its primary focus revolves
    around crop

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    11 of 15

    protection, which is continuously threatened by weeds, pests, and diseases. Building
    upon

    this pipeline, the aim is to establish a digital ecosystem, termed the industrial
    metaverse

    (IM) digital world, which is capable of recording the complete life cycles of
    agricultural

    crops. This digital ecosystem will gather extensive information about the rural
    environment

    by leveraging IoT, virtual reality (including augmented reality capabilities),
    cloud and edge

    computing, and other features of Industry 5.0 (Agriculture 5.0), as depicted in
    Figure 2.

    Figure 1. A ﬂowchart of the crop protection system with AI and robotics techniques.

    Figure 2. High-level architecture of a crop protection system with AI and robotics
    techniques.

    Ultimately, the industrial metaverse comprises an explainable AI system that derives

    actionable results to improve production, environmental sustainability, and economic

    status. This comprehensive approach fosters communication across the supply-value
    chain,

    enhances responsiveness to potential issues, and improves safety, production efﬁciency,

    and environmental monitoring in real time. By leveraging the power of technology
    and

    research-driven methodologies, the proposed system aims to revolutionize agriculture
    and

    pave the way for a more sustainable and efﬁcient future.

    6.3. Architecture

    The methodology of the above-described system for improving crop protection is

    based on extensive research and aims to provide a convincing and actionable solution.

    The proposed architecture encompasses various data collection techniques and advanced

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    12 of 15

    technologies, as illustrated in Figure 2. The agriculture ﬁeld’s digital transformation
    begins

    with IoT sensors for irrigation and weather monitoring. These sensors gather real-time
    data

    on soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and other relevant factors. Additionally,

    AI techniques are employed to recognize plant diseases based on visual cues and
    patterns,

    allowing for early detection and timely intervention. The production evolution
    aspect

    involves monitoring and analyzing crop growth and development over time.

    The AI- and robotics-based crop protection system comprises several modules that

    work in tandem to enhance agricultural practices:

    Data collection module: To generate valuable insights, the system collects data
    from

    diverse sources, including weather reports, soil sensors, satellite imagery, and
    digital insect

    traps. This comprehensive dataset enables accurate predictions of pest infestations,
    disease

    outbreaks, weed growth, and weather conditions.

    Machine learning model development and interpretation module: This module

    involves the creation of automated systems that process data and derive meaningful

    conclusions. The system provides clear and actionable insights to guide decision-making

    by interpreting results from machine learning models.

    Decision-making module: AI algorithms analyze the collected data and determine

    appropriate crop protection strategies. Factors considered include crop type,
    growth stage,

    severity of pests, weeds, or diseases, as well as environmental and risk assessment
    aspects

    related to pesticide use. Legislative limitations and the potential development
    of pesticide

    resistance are also taken into account.

    Robot module: The system can be integrated into autonomous robots equipped

    with sensors, cameras, and spraying equipment. Through the use of machine learning

    algorithms, these robots are trained to accurately identify and target pests,
    weeds, and

    diseases, optimizing the effectiveness of crop protection strategies.

    Monitoring module: AI is leveraged to monitor the effectiveness of crop protection

    strategies and make necessary adjustments in real time. This continuous monitoring

    ensures optimal performance and enables timely intervention when needed.

    User interface module: To facilitate communication between farmers, agricultural

    scientists, and other stakeholders, a user interface is provided. This interface
    presents the

    system’s ﬁndings and suggestions, allowing users to provide input and customize
    results

    according to their speciﬁc needs.

    The above system will have the modularity and agility to integrate other modules,
    for

    example, blockchain and NFT development platforms, with the aim of achieving the
    traceability

    of foods. The AI- and robotics-based crop protection systems hold immense potential
    to

    revolutionize crop protection practices while minimizing the detrimental impact
    of chemical

    use on the environment and human health. The system maximizes crop yields and
    promotes

    sustainable agricultural practices by enabling farmers to make informed decisions
    about

    their crop protection strategies. However, implementing this system requires extensive

    research and development to continually improve its efﬁciency and effectiveness.

    7. Discussion

    Crop protection is a critical aspect of agriculture that involves safeguarding
    crops

    against various threats, including pests, diseases, and weeds. Traditional crop
    protection

    methods involve using fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, which can adversely
    affect

    the environment and human health. However, with the advent of robotics and artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), farmers now have new tools at their disposal to improve crop
    protection

    and increase yields. Robotic- and AI-based crop protection solutions involve using
    sensors,

    cameras, and machine learning algorithms to monitor crops and detect potential
    threats.

    These solutions offer several advantages over traditional methods, such as increased

    accuracy, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness. For example, robots equipped with
    sensors

    can detect pest infestations and apply targeted treatments only where necessary,
    reducing

    the number of chemicals used and minimizing the environmental impact. Furthermore,

    AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data on weather patterns, soil conditions,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    13 of 15

    and crop growth to predict potential threats and recommend preventive measures.
    This

    comprehensive approach enables farmers to make well-informed decisions regarding

    crop protection. It empowers them to effectively identify issues, choose the most
    suitable

    pesticide and application technology, and implement a reduced-risk crop protection
    scheme.

    Robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection also offer the potential for
    in-

    creased precision and automation, reducing the labor costs and time required for
    manual

    inspection and treatment. For example, drones equipped with cameras and sensors
    can

    survey large areas of crops quickly and efﬁciently, providing real-time data on
    crop health

    and potential threats. In addition, robotic- and AI-based solutions can provide
    farmers

    with real-time insights into the health and growth of their crops, enabling them
    to make

    more informed decisions and optimize crop management practices. For example, machine

    learning algorithms can analyze data on crop growth and identify patterns and
    trends

    that may not be immediately apparent to human observers. Despite the many advantages

    of robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection, some challenges still
    need to be

    addressed. For example, these solutions may require signiﬁcant investments in
    terms of

    hardware, software, and training. Additionally, there may be concerns about data
    privacy

    and security, particularly regarding sensitive information about crop yield and
    growth.

    In conclusion, robotic- and AI-based solutions have the potential to revolutionize
    crop

    protection and management, offering increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness.

    However, it will be essential to continue to develop these technologies and address
    any

    challenges to ensure that they are widely accessible to farmers and that they
    contribute to

    sustainable and ethical agriculture practices.

    8. Conclusions

    In conclusion, integrating robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions into crop
    protec-

    tion is a promising avenue for addressing modern agriculture’s challenges. The
    potential ad-

    vantages of these technologies include increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness,

    as well as better monitoring and management of crop health. Looking to the future,
    several

    research areas could further enhance the effectiveness of these solutions. For
    example, the

    development of more advanced sensors and cameras, as well as improvements in machine

    learning algorithms, could enable more precise and accurate monitoring of crop
    health

    and growth. Additionally, advances in robotics could allow for more sophisticated
    and

    automated treatment of crops, reducing the need for manual labor. Another important
    area

    of future work is the integration of these technologies with existing agricultural
    practices

    and infrastructure, including relevant legislation, risk assessment, and environmental
    as-

    pects of AI modules. The availability of pesticide databases and alternative crop
    protection

    measures will help establish a robust machine learning model. This will require
    collabora-

    tion between farmers, agronomists, technology developers, and policymakers to
    ensure

    that the beneﬁts of these solutions are accessible to all and contribute to sustainable
    and

    ethical agriculture practices. Finally, addressing data privacy and security concerns
    will

    be essential, particularly regarding sensitive crop yield and growth information.
    This will

    require the development of robust data protection and governance frameworks and
    greater

    awareness among farmers and other stakeholders about the risks and beneﬁts of
    these

    technologies. Hence, the use of robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions in
    crop protection

    has the potential to transform modern agriculture and ensure food security in
    the face of

    global challenges, such as climate change and population growth. Continued research

    and development in this area and integrating these technologies into existing
    agricultural

    practices will be crucial to realizing this potential and creating a more sustainable
    and

    resilient agricultural system for the future.

    \ all areas \nof human life more comfortable. The development of farms \nthrough\
    \ the use of IoT positively influences agricultural \nproduction not only by strengthening\
    \ it, but also by making it \nmore profitable and reducing the cost of production.\
    \ The goal of \nthis paper is to offer a new IoT-based smart agriculture system\
    \ \nthat helps farmers get real-time data such as (temperature, \nhumidity, soil\
    \ moisture) for effective environmental monitoring \nthat will allow them to increase\
    \ overall yield and product quality. \nThe farm monitoring system proposed in\
    \ this paper is based on \nthe ESP32 microcontroller with a set of sensors. This\
    \ new model \nproduces a real-time data feed that can be viewed online via a \n\
    mobile app. The proposed new system uses solar energy with \nbattery as an energy\
    \ source. \nKeywords—IoT; smart agriculture; new model; solar panel; \nesp32;\
    \ mobile app \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture has always played a very important\
    \ role for the \nhuman being and for the economies of countries, indeed \ncountries\
    \ that have experienced significant economic growth \nhave experienced a significant\
    \ increase in the agricultural \nsector, agriculture is not only an important\
    \ factor of economic \ngrowth but also a heritage, a way of life, a cultural identity\
    \ of a \ncountry. The use of the Internet of Things in agriculture makes \nit\
    \ possible to put technology at the service of the development \nof agriculture\
    \ and also to help the farmer to: \n Make very important decisions at the right\
    \ times. \n Save energy and time. \n Deal with the lack of information. \n\
    \ Increase agricultural production. \n Allow the farmer to develop and develop\
    \ his \nagricultural production. \n Increase the participation of agriculture\
    \ in job creation. \n Ensure our country's needs for agricultural products. \n\
    The organization of the article is as follows, in Section II \n(Literature Survey):\
    \ we collected the work carried out in the \nfield of smart agriculture, Section\
    \ III (discussions and results): \nwe treated and analyzed the work done and proposed\
    \ \nimprovements in this area, Section IV (the new model): we \nproposed our new\
    \ intelligent farm system, and Section V \n(Conclusion and outlook). \nII. LITERATURE\
    \ SURVEY \nTo study the use of IOT in the agricultural field, it is \nessential\
    \ to make a literary study on the current state, projects \nand studies that have\
    \ been carried out in this field, this step is \nimportant to be able to have\
    \ visibility on the current state and \non the difficulties encountered, it will\
    \ allow us to make \nproposals for improvement in this area. \nA. Data Collection\
    \ \nTo carry out our literary study we focused our research \nwork on three databases\
    \ ACM Library, Science Direct and \nIEEE. The Pattern used is IOT and agriculture\
    \ during the last \nfour years (2018-2022) this has allowed us to have 29 \npublications\
    \ on the different methods and procedures of use of \nthe IOT in the agricultural\
    \ field as well as the advantages, \ndisadvantages, and prospects for improvement\
    \ in this field, \nTable I below summarizes the research approach. \nTABLE I.\

    \ \nE. Results \nIn this paper, we were able to study the use of IOT in the \n\
    agricultural field, this allowed us to identify important \nattributes to analyze\
    \ it, for this we gathered and analyzed \nrecent scientific data, this survey\
    \ was a way to have the list of \nthe most studied sub-areas: Smart irrigation,\
    \ Agriculture \nMonitoring, Smart farming, Greenhouse Agriculture. \n Smart irrigation\
    \ is the most studied agricultural sub-field in \nrecent years, as most countries\
    \ focus mainly on the use of \nwater resources due to its lack. Smart irrigation\
    \ has become an \nessential means that positively influence the agricultural field\
    \ \nand its production, current efforts focus on the management of \nwater resources\
    \ this has given great value to irrigation \nmanagement to increase the quality\
    \ and quantity of agricultural \nproducts. \nThe second sub-area is forecast agriculture\
    \ because the \ndemand for products is constantly increasing so it is essential\
    \ to \nopt for a forward-looking management of agricultural \nproduction. This\
    \ makes it possible to review any risk that can \nblock the objectives of farmers\
    \ and makes it possible to ensure \na quality and increase in agricultural production\
    \ and also saves \nresources. Based on our analysis, it was found that ambient\
    \ \ntemperature followed by soil moisture and moisture are among \nthe most commonly\
    \ measured data. According to the results of \nour study, it was found that the\
    \ use of the Internet of Things in \nagriculture can be used effectively to increase\
    \ agricultural \nproduction to meet the growing needs of the population. \nThe\
    \ majority of research focuses on water management by \nmonitoring environmental\
    \ parameters such as temperature, \nhumidity and soil moisture. Many results have\
    \ emphasized the \nimportance of the proper management of water resources, \n\
    saving human and material resources. \nInnovation in the IT field makes it possible\
    \ to cover all \nagricultural areas to allow an important development. IoT has\
    \ \nsolved many problems related to agriculture and farming, but \nseveral limitations\
    \ are to be taken into consideration such as \nthe lack of interoperability and\
    \ compatibility of devices, the \nproblems of network flexibility when several\
    \ devices connect, \nand the lifetime of the sensor are some of the limitations\
    \ to be \nsolved in future research. \nFood production is a great challenge for\
    \ all economies \naround the world due to the rapid and constant evolution of\
    \ the \nworld's population, especially with climate change and labour \nshortages.\
    \ Currently, current research focuses on robotics to \nsolve these problems. Many\
    \ researchers and companies have \nfocused on robotics and artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) to reduce the \namount of herbicide used by farmers. \nFollowing the analysis\
    \ of the data collected, it was found \nthat the IOT is in great demand to develop\
    \ the agricultural \nfield, several researches have been carried out in relation\
    \ to this \nsubject, the articles that we studied in this report have not taken\
    \ \ninto consideration the sources of energy to power the IOT \nequipment and\
    \ the security of agricultural fields against \nintrusions, thus the majority\
    \ of articles use Arduino technology \nfor the interconnection of IOT equipment,\
    \ which is why we \nwill propose a new model that will take into account the energy\
    \ \nsource, uses an interconnection technology with low energy \nconsumption and\
    \ secures agricultural fields against intrusions. \nIV. NEW MODEL \nA. Solution\
    \ \nAfter the in-depth study of the work done in this area, we \nfound that agriculture\
    \ is one of the main areas that use IoT. \nSeveral IoT components have already\
    \ been put in place to \nserve the agricultural field to monitor soil conditions\
    \ such as \ntemperature, moisture, soil moisture and soil ph. \nWe also found\
    \ that most authors propose solutions \nprovided by wires or batteries such as\
    \ power sources, the \nthings that make powering objects a real challenge for\
    \ several \nreasons, the most important of which are: \n The area of agricultural\
    \ land is large, which increases \nthe cost of installing electrical cables. The\
    \ installed \ncables remain subject to damage that can be caused by \nagricultural\
    \ vehicles, insects, and water, as the cables \nare underground. \n The difficulties\
    \ of maintenance and repair in case of \nfailure because the cables are underground\
    \ it is \nnecessary at each failure to remove them to repair them. \n Battery\
    \ life remains limited and varies from a few hours \nto several years. \n The\
    \ power of objects by alkaline batteries has major \ndisadvantages. These batteries\
    \ have a limited amount of \nenergy. \n The cost of purchasing and replacing\
    \ the batteries of the \nobjects. \nWe offer a solution that offers an improvement\
    \ of existing \nsolutions. Our model is highly customizable and provides a \n\
    data analysis solution that enables large-scale data processing \non real-time\
    \ observation streams. Our new model uses solar \nenergy with battery as a power\
    \ source, the ESP32 \nmicrocontroller as a low-energy interconnection technology\
    \ \n[30] and a motion detector to protect our agricultural field from \nintrusions.\
    \ \nB. Components \n1) Ph: Sensor: The PH sensor is a sensor that allows \ndetermining\
    \ the acidity of the soil between 0 and 14 at a \ntemperature between 0 and 60\
    \ ° C, this acidity varies \ndepending on the availability of nutrients in water\
    \ / soil. The \ndetection of PH is therefore essential to understand how to \n\
    fertilize it properly in order to prepare a good environment for \nagricultural\
    \ production. Fig. 1 shows the ph sensor. \n2) Temperature and humidity sensor:\
    \ The DHT11 sensor \nis a low-cost basic digital temperature and humidity sensor.\
    \ \nCapable of measuring temperatures from 0 to 50°C with an \naccuracy of 2°C\
    \ and relative humidity levels from 20 to 80% \nwith an accuracy of 5%. A measurement\
    \ can be made every \nsecond. Fig. 2 shows the DHT11 sensor. \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 13, No. 5, 2022\
    \ \n374 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n \nFig. 1. Ph Sensor. \n \nFig. 2.\
    \ Temperature and Humidity Sensor. \n3) PIR Sensor: The passive infrared sensor\
    \ is used for \nintrusion detection in agricultural fields and helps farmers \n\
    detect movements (of animals and humans) in their agricultural \nfields. Fig.\
    \ 3 shows the PIR sensor. \n \nFig. 3. PIR Sensor. \n4) Soil Moisture Sensor:\
    \ This sensor, as shown in Fig. 4, \nmeasures soil moisture due to changes in\
    \ the electrical \nconductivity of the earth (soil resistance increases with \n\
    drought). A digital output with an adjustable threshold is used \nto trigger an\
    \ alarm or sprinkler pump. A second analog output \naccurately tracks fluctuations\
    \ in soil moisture. When the sensor \nfork is planted vertically in the ground\
    \ (agricultural fields, \ngarden, etc.). The electrical resistance between the\
    \ two \nelectrodes is measured. \n \nFig. 4. Soil Moisture Sensor. \n5) ESP32\
    \ Microcontroller: The ESP32, illustrated in \nFig. 5 designed and produced by\
    \ the company Espressif, it \nintegrates functions dedicated to the Internet of\
    \ Things and \nmore particularly wireless communications and Bluetooth and \n\
    lora for a reduced cost. It is the best choice for smart cities, \nsmart farms,\
    \ and smart homes. \n \nFig. 5. Esp32. \n6) Solar panel: Solar panels, shown in\
    \ Fig. 6, are the \ndevices used to absorb the sun's rays and convert them into\
    \ \nelectricity. In our case we will use solar panels to power our \nIoT devices.\
    \ \n \nFig. 6. Solar Panel. \n7) Lithium Batteries: In our case we will use the\
    \ lithium \nbattery illustrated in Fig. 7, to have the possibility of setting\
    \ up \nan autonomous network equipped with a battery capable of \nstoring energy\
    \ during the day and provides electricity during \nthe night. \n \nFig. 7. Batteries.\
    \ \n8) Top-up card for power bank: In our case we will use the \ncharge card,\
    \ illustrated in Fig. 8, to build a power bank from \nlithium battery cells to\
    \ charge all IOT devices compatible \nwith 5V. \n \nFig. 8. Power Bank. \nC. System\
    \ Description \nTo achieve a high-quality yield, we will build a new smart \n\
    farm monitoring system powered by solar energy. The \nproposed solution consists\
    \ of two parts, a hardware part and a \nlogicielle.la hardware part consists of\
    \ a transmitter node that \ncontains the pH, soil moisture, temperature, humidity,\
    \ and \nmotion sensor connected to ESP32 and a solar panel and \nbattery to supply\
    \ our system with electrical energy. The \nsoftware part consists of a mobile\
    \ application that allows \nfarmers to monitor their agricultural environment\
    \ as long as it \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 13, No. 5, 2022 \n375 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \nis connected to the internet. The method of data acquisition is \nillustrated\
    \ in Fig. 9. The pH, soil moisture, temperature, \nhumidity, and motion sensors\
    \ send digital data to the ESP32. \nThis data will be transmitted to the cloud\
    \ server via WIFI \ncommunication. When there is incoming data on the cloud \n\
    server, farmers can monitor their farming environment via a \nmobile app. \n \n\
    Fig. 9. New System. \nD. Tools and Libraries used \nIn this paper we used several\
    \ software and libraries to \nimplement our new farm monitoring system: \n1) Arduino:\
    \ \nThe \nArduino \nintegrated \ndevelopment \nenvironment is a cross-platform\
    \ application for Windows, \nMacos, and Linux that is written in C and C++ functions.\
    \ It is \nused to write and download programs to Arduino-compatible \nboards.\
    \ The EDI source code is released under the GNU \nGeneral Public License, version\
    \ 2. The IDE environment \ncontains mainly two basic parts: the editor and the\
    \ compiler \nwhere the old one is used to write the required code and later is\
    \ \nused to compile and download the code in the given Arduino \nmodule. \n2)\
    \ Libraries: The Arduino IDE can be extended using \nlibraries, just like most\
    \ programming platforms. Libraries offer \nadditional features, such as working\
    \ with hardware or \nmanipulating data. The standard libraries used are described\
    \ \nbelow. \na) DHT.h: To read the data from the DHT sensor, we \nwill use Adafruit's\
    \ DHT.h library. To use this library, we must \nalso install the Adafruit Unified\
    \ Sensor library. \nb) WiFi.h: This library allows our esp32 card to connect \n\
    to the Wi-Fi network to start sending and receiving data. \n3) Algorithms and\
    \ flowchart: This section presents the \nalgorithms and flowchart of the overall\
    \ process of our new \nSmart Farm System: \na) Algorithms: \nGeneric \nprocess\
    \ \nalgorithm \nfor \ntemperature, humidity, soil moisture and pH sensors. \n\
    STEP 1: start the process; \nSTEP 2: connected to wifi; \nSTEP 3: read temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil and ph; \nSTEP 4: get temperature, humidity, soil and ph values\
    \ from \nanalog pins; \nSTEP 5: send data to cloud; \nSTEP 6: delay to 10 seconds;\
    \ \nSTEP 7: repeat step 4, 5 & 6 until the process end; \nSTEP 8: end; \nb) Flowchart:\
    \ Generic process flowchart for pir sensor \nmotion sensor (Fig. 10). \n \nFig.\
    \ 10. Flowchart (Pir Sensor). \nE. Mobile Application \nIn creating our app, we\
    \ used the blynk platform that \nsupports \nAndroid. \nIt \nworks \nwith \nseveral\
    \ \ntypes \nof \nmicrocontrollers such as Arduino, Raspberry and ESP32. It \n\
    consists of three main components: \n The blynk app that allows you to control\
    \ a device and \nview data. \n The blynk server, which is a cloud service responsible\
    \ \nfor all communications between objects and the \nsmartphone. \n Blynk libraries,\
    \ which include various widgets such as \ncontrol buttons, display formats, and\
    \ notifications. \nWhen creating our application, as shown in Fig. 11, we \ntried\
    \ to make it very simple, with a single interface that shows \nthe main information\
    \ collected by our ESP32. This application \nimmediately requests real-time information\
    \ from the cloud to \ndisplay it. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    \ consumption of the solar power of our new \nmodel for seven days. Using the\
    \ display screen of our new \nmodel shown in Fig. 12, we noticed that with the\
    \ equipment \nused for four days, the consumption of our battery does not \nexceed\
    \ 26%. \n \nFig. 12. Test. \nV. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES \nIn this article,\
    \ a new smart farm monitoring model was \nrealized. To propose this model, we\
    \ started by studying the \nwork already done in the field of smart agriculture,\
    \ the analysis \nof the data allowed us to raise three major questions: The \n\
    energy sources to power the equipment, the technologies used \nto interconnect\
    \ these objects and the security of agricultural \nfields against intrusions.\
    \ The tests we carried out for our new \nagricultural field monitoring system\
    \ were positive, using new \ndevices and sensors for example (PIR sensor). \n\
    The prospects of our project are to test our new model in a \nlarge agricultural\
    \ field to study the autonomy of the batteries \nconnected to the solar panels\
    \ and propose improvements to our \nnew system. \nREFERENCES \n[1] H.-T. Hsu,\

    \ Te results indicate the system is highly efcient and reliable in performing\

    \ boost agricultural productivity.\n1. Introduction\nAccording to the United States\
    \ Census Bureau, the current\nuniversal population is estimated to be around 7.6\
    \ billion\npeople, up from 7.2 billion people in 2015 [1, 2]. Te world’s\npopulation\
    \ is anticipated to reach about 10 billion persons\nby 2050 [3, 4]. To keep up\
    \ with the exponential population\ngrowth, the “United Nations Food and Agriculture\
    \ Orga-\nnization (FAO)” report predicted that global food pro-\nduction would\
    \ need to increase by virtually 70% in 2050\ncompared to that of 2006 [3, 4].\
    \ Africa’s population will\ngeometrically raise to about 2.5 billion by 2050,\
    \ from its\ncurrent 1.2 billion in 2015 [1, 2]. Undoubtedly, there is going\n\
    to be a shortage of food owing to the enormously increasing\npopulation. Terefore,\
    \ it is crucial to continuously develop\nand explore innovative agricultural techniques\
    \ [3–12].\nTe importance of a smart irrigation system (SIS) as well\nas the issue\
    \ dealing with water efciency in agriculture\nproductivity comes into focus here\
    \ because of the pressing\nneed to consistently increase agricultural productivity\
    \ levels\n[13–17]. Irrigation can be described as the process of sup-\nplying\
    \ water to land to enable plants to grow. Water bodies\nHindawi\nApplied and Environmental\
    \ Soil Science\nVolume 2022, Article ID 7678570, 13 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7678570\n\
    are channelled through canals, ditches, pipes, or natural\nstreams. According\
    \ to Bjorneberg [18], over the years, dif-\nferent irrigation techniques have\
    \ been in practice to satisfy\nthe irrigation requirements for positive crop growth\
    \ in\ncertain areas. Te three foremost techniques of irrigation are,\nnamely,\
    \ drip/micro, surface, and sprinkler [19, 20]. Water\nﬂows over the soil (land)\
    \ for surface irrigation. Sprinkler\nirrigation supplies water to crops by sprinkling\
    \ or spraying\nwater from moving or ﬁxed systems. Micro-irrigation\nsupplies water\
    \ with frequent, small applications, usually\nwetting a portion of the ﬁeld. Another\
    \ minor irrigation\ntechnique is the subirrigation method. Here, the water level\n\
    is raised to or held near the crop root zone employing ditches\nor subsurface\
    \ drains to supply the water.\nNigeria’s irrigation capacity ranges from 1.5 to\
    \ 3.2\nmillion hectares. According to recent estimates, there are\napproximately\
    \ 2.3 million hectares in total, with over 1\nmillion hectares in the north [21].\
    \ Only about 40% of the\n142–106 hectares irrigated by public schemes are actually\n\
    accurately irrigated [21]; 32% for irrigated areas managed or\ncontrolled by the\
    \ River Basin Development Authorities\n(RBDAs) and 55% for those managed or controlled\
    \ by states\n[21]. Tis low rate can be attributed to the need for reha-\nbilitation\
    \ in most schemes—which accounts for 80% of the\nequipped area; high operation,\
    \ upkeep, and maintenance\ncosts; fuel shortages; or technical weakening of infrastruc-\n\
    ture and pumps. On the other hand, some known irrigation\nmethods have the disadvantages\
    \ of high labour costs, the\ncost of setting up an irrigation project and system,\
    \ poor\nwater management and control, erosion, water runoﬀ and\npercolation losses,\
    \ spot top and ﬁxture costs, not appropriate\nfor odd-shaped comedians, potential\
    \ wander and evapora-\ntion losses, and waterlogging, which can lead to mosquito\n\
    breeding and other parasites [22].\nAccording to Penchalaiah et al. [23], farmers\
    \ estimated\nthe maturity of the land and reserves to create revenue in\nancient\
    \ times. A farmer’s life is becoming increasingly\nchallenging due to reduced\
    \ humidity levels, water levels, and\nspeciﬁc climatic circumstances. Te wireless\
    \ sensor network\n(WSN) is made up of sensor nodes that can detect, com-\nmunicate\
    \ with computers, and communicate wirelessly [24].\nTe ﬁeld uses WSN technology\
    \ to manage and monitor the\nenvironment and soil conditions. WSNs are employed\
    \ in\nagriculture for a variety of reasons, including high inter-\npretation,\
    \ increased harvest yield, minimal energy usage,\nand data distribution. Agriculture\
    \ relies heavily on eﬀective\nwater management [25]. Water scarcity and high pumping\n\
    costs make good water management even more important.\nTo improve the use of water\
    \ resources and increase pro-\nductivity, one automatic irrigation system (AIS)\
    \ is now\ndeployed [25]. Tis one component of the irrigation system\nenables development\
    \ in areas where water is scarce. In this\nmethod, eﬃcient watering system planning\
    \ yields the best\neﬃciency while using the least quantity of water [23, 25].\n\
    In areas where water is scarce, water management is\ncritical. Agriculture is\
    \ also aﬀected, as a substantial volume\nof water is dedicated to that purpose\
    \ [25, 26]. As a result of\nthe potential impacts of global warming, water adaptation\n\
    methods are being considered to assure the availability of\nwater for food production\
    \ and consumption. As a result, the\nneed for studies that aimed at reducing water\
    \ usage in the\nirrigation process has increased over time. Commercial\nsensors\
    \ for agricultural irrigation systems are quite expen-\nsive, making this type\
    \ of device unaﬀordable for smaller\nfarmers. Manufacturers as well as the users\
    \ are now inter-\nested in low-cost sensors that may be connected to nodes to\n\
    create cost-eﬀective irrigation control and agricultural\nmonitoring systems [25,\
    \ 26].\nHence, this study focused on designing and imple-\nmenting a SIS controller\
    \ for use with drip irrigation owing to\nits cost-eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency. Drip\
    \ irrigation entails\nlaying emitter-equipped tubing alongside plants on the\n\
    ground. Water drips softly into the root zone from the\ndrippers. Because moisture\
    \ levels are regulated at an ideal\nrange, plant production and quality improve.\
    \ Drip irrigation\nalso prevents disease by minimizing water contact with the\n\
    leaves, stems, and fruit of plants; allows the rows between\nplants to remain\
    \ dry, improving access and reducing weed\ngrowth; saves time, money, and water\
    \ due to the system’s\neﬃciency; reduces labour; increases eﬀectiveness on uneven\n\
    ground; and reduces water and nutrient leaching below the\nroot zone. Te design\
    \ focused on using a microcontroller\nESP8266 system on a chip acting as the coordinator\
    \ module\nand moisture and temperature sensors acting as the trans-\nmitter module.\
    \ Te system uses a cloud computing (CC)\nplatform and an open-source Internet\
    \ of Tings (IoT)\nMATLAB platform called “TingSpeak” for collecting,\nstoring,\
    \ and transmitting data. Te sensor values are re-\nceived and compiled by the\
    \ microcontroller, which then\nsends them to the “TingSpeak cloud” via the HTTP\
    \ pro-\ntocol. When the soil threshold moisture value is low in the\nmorning or\
    \ evening, the system automatically waters the\nplants, unless it is raining.\
    \ It is programmed to collect, store,\nand analyze environmental parameters such\
    \ as rain, tem-\nperature, and humidity in order to actuate autonomous\nresponses\
    \ (i.e., start and stop the pump). When the antic-\nipated, desired or required\
    \ soil moisture content is reached,\nthe system automatically stops the irrigation\
    \ process, saving\nwater and energy. We can monitor and control the system\nusing\
    \ a web application.\nTe rest of the section of the study is structured into the\n\
    following four main sections: Section 2 will focus on existing\nsystems, the concept\
    \ of IoT, wireless sensor network (WSN),\ndata analytics, and “TingSpeak,” their\
    \ overall functionality\nand history, and future prospects of such systems. Section\
    \ 3\nwill focus on the development methodologies used to\nconduct the research.\
    \ Data collection and system analysis\nprocesses are discussed. Section 4 will\
    \ place much emphasis\non the implementation of the research, which is analyzed\n\
    and discussed. Section 5 will emphasize the discussion of\nﬁndings and a summary\
    \ of the study.\n2. Literature Review\nTe need to automate irrigation and agricultural\
    \ activities\nand use the limited or inadequate battery power of a node\ncompetently\
    \ has led to several hardware and software ad-\nvances in the sensor network area\
    \ [27]. Tis study by\n2\nApplied and Environmental Soil Science\nKagalkar [28]\
    \ found that SIS was designed to fulﬁl the water\nsupplies or necessities of the\
    \ plants by monitoring the soil\nmoisture as well as other ecological parameters.\
    \ Te system\nwas tested with potatoes to see how well it worked. Te\npotato plant’s\
    \ water requirements were 500 mm to 700 mm\nper area a day. Te soil moisture was\
    \ set to 300–600, which\nwas predicated on IoT. Every 30 seconds, it logs the\
    \ sensor\ndata to the CC platform “TingSpeak.com.” Te analysis was\nshown in graph\
    \ form, and the farmer could remotely\nmonitor and control the water pump over\
    \ the Internet using a\nWi-Fi module to access the web interface on an Android\n\
    application. As mentioned by Santhiya et al. [29], in the\ndesign of SIS, the\
    \ Arduino UNO microcontroller and An-\ndroid are connected with a personal computer,\
    \ data mining,\nand CC to store the data that are read by temperature and\nhumidity\
    \ sensors. Te graph generated in the web application\nmakes easy analysis and\
    \ the drip is managed. Te proposed or\nplanned system turns “ON/OFF” the drip\
    \ utilizing Bluetooth.\nTe project developed by Kashif and Poonguzhali [30]\n\
    was an automatic irrigation system (AIS), which waters the\ncrops based on sensing\
    \ the dryness of the land or soil. It uses\nwireless transmission techniques,\
    \ that is, RF transmission\ntechnique, mobile phones to receive SMS and to update\n\
    users about the condition of the plant. Web technology is\nused to view sensor\
    \ values, which aid monitoring and\ncontrol to curtail the wastage of water utilized\
    \ in the irri-\ngation progression. Tis process also helped to improve the\nagricultural\
    \ production.\nTis study “IoT-based Smart Agriculture” developed by\nGondchawar\
    \ and Kawitkar [31] shows all observations and\nexperimentaltestsdemonstratethatthedevelopmentisabroad\n\
    solution to ﬁeld actions, irrigation issues, and storage issues, by\nemploying\
    \ remote-controlled robots, SIS, and a smart ware-\nhouse management system, respectively.\
    \ Tese processes will\nbe done by means of any remote smart device or computer\n\
    connected to the Internet, and the processes will be carried out\nby interfacing\
    \ sensors, Wi-Fi or ZigBee modules, cameras, and\nactuators with microcontrollers\
    \ and Raspberry Pi.\nTe research environment is more persuaded towards\nresearch\
    \ at the software level as it has several possibilities,\nopportunities, and great\
    \ potential to yield momentous re-\nsults. Data collected by sensors are removed\
    \ by several\napplications, which set up data ﬂow or communication of\ndata in\
    \ the network. As mentioned by Sarkar et al. [32] in\ntheir work, they developed\
    \ smart agriculture using IoT and\ndiﬀerent sensors for implementing or executing\
    \ the smart\nagricultural and monitoring systems by utilizing various\nsensors\
    \ within the agricultural ﬁeld, pH sensor, moisture\nsensor, humidity sensor,\
    \ and proximity sensor for analyzing\nand sending data to the Raspberry Pi remotely,\
    \ which is then\nsent to Krishi Helpline for plant or crop monitoring for\nmaximum\
    \ or optimal production of crops or plants.\n2.1. Overview and Use of IoT. Ashton\
    \ [33] coined the term\n“IoT,” and RFID-based item identiﬁcation systems were\
    \ also\ninvented in the same year. According to Kashif and\nPoonguzhali [30],\
    \ IoTresearch is still early. As a result, there\nis no universally accepted deﬁnition\
    \ for IoT. Cabine [34]\ndescribed “IOT as the ever-growing network of physical\n\
    objects that feature an IP address for Internet connectivity\nand the communication\
    \ that occurs between these objects\nand other internet-enabled devices and systems.”\
    \ It is also\nreferred to as machine-to-machine (M2M), sky net, or In-\nternet\
    \ of everything, things having identities and virtual\npersonalities operating\
    \ in smart spaces using intelligent\ninterfaces to connect and communicate within\
    \ social, en-\nvironmental, and user contexts. A variety of scholars pro-\nvided\
    \ the deﬁnitions below as adopted and modiﬁed from\nSilverio-Fern´andez et al.\
    \ [35] and Sethi and Sarangi [36]:\n(i) “Tings have virtual personalities that\
    \ operate in\nsmart spaces using intelligent interfaces to connect\nand communicate\
    \ within social, environmental, and\nuser contexts.”\n(ii) “Te semantic origin\
    \ of the expression is composed\nof two words and concepts: IoT, where the Internet\n\
    can be deﬁned as a global network of interconnected\ncomputer networks based on\
    \ a standard commu-\nnication protocol, the Internet suite (TCP/IP),” and\n“thing”\
    \ is an unidentiﬁed object. As a result, the\nterm “IoT” refers to a “global network\
    \ of inter-\nconnected, uniquely addressable objects based on\nstandard communication\
    \ protocols.”\n(iii) “IoT enables people and things to connect anytime,\nanywhere,\
    \ with anything and anyone, ideally over\nany path or network and using any service.”\n\
    Other deﬁnitions are as follows:\n(i) “A dynamic global network infrastructure\
    \ with self-\nconﬁguring capabilities based on standard and in-\nteroperable communication\
    \ protocols where phys-\nical and virtual ‘Tings’ have identities, physical\n\
    attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelli-\ngent interfaces, and are\
    \ seamlessly integrated into\nthe information network [37].”\n(ii) “Tings having\
    \ identities and virtual personalities\noperating in smart spaces using intelligent\
    \ interfaces\nto connect and communicate within social, envi-\nronmental, and\
    \ user contexts [38].”\nAccording to Cabine [34], “things in the IoTcan refer\
    \ to\na wide variety of devices such as heart monitoring implants,\nbiochip transponders\
    \ on farm animals, automobiles with\nbuilt-in sensors, or ﬁeld operation devices\
    \ that assist ﬁre-\nﬁghters in search and rescue. Current market examples\ninclude\
    \ smart thermostat systems and washer/dryers that\nutilize Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.”\
    \ Te US National\nIntelligence Council (NIC), in their description of IoT in\n\
    April 2008, considers IoT as one of the 6 Disruptive Civil\nTechnologies. Te IEEE\
    \ ranks IoT number 1 in the list of\n“Top Trends for 2013.” Te IoT promises to\
    \ be the most\ndisruptive technological revolution since the advent of the\nWorld\
    \ Wide Web. According to Cabine [34], “projections\nindicate that up to 100 billion\
    \ uniquely identiﬁable objects\nwill be connected to the Internet by 2020.”\n\
    Te implementation of a SIS made it possible to monitor,\nmanage, and control various\
    \ variables in agriculture, thanks\nApplied and Environmental Soil Science\n3\n\
    to technological advancements in sensor networks (SNs).\nRecent advances in sensor\
    \ and wireless radio frequency (RF)\nmachineries, as well as their merging with\
    \ the Internet, have\nopened up a slew of new possibilities for agricultural sensor\n\
    systems. Te IoT and SN are two of the most important\ntechnologies driving the\
    \ development of SIS. Te technology\nissues with SIS revolve around improving\
    \ the SN’s efciency\nand the system’s ability to function and perform efciently.\n\
    NS to explicate important environmental patterns and in-\ntegrate their data streams\
    \ not only to display or record\ninformation, but also to stimulate human and\
    \ self-sufcient\n(autonomous) responses, will result in increased agricultural\n\
    efciency. Te IoT architecture adopted and designed for\nthis study is shown in\
    \ Figure 1.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. Specifcation of Adopted and Designed\
    \ IoT Components.\nSeveral microcontrollers that can be used, but the ESP8266\n\
    NodeMCU development board has been adopted in this\nstudy (Figure 2). Te ESP8266EX\
    \ includes a Tensilica L106\n32-bit RISC processor that consumes very little power\
    \ and\nruns at a maximum clock speed of 160 MHz. Tanks to the\nreal-time operating\
    \ system (RTOS) and Wi-Fi stack, 80% of\nthe processing power is available for\
    \ user application pro-\ngramming and development, which combines elements of\n\
    easy programming with the Arduino IDE (C++). It includes\nan 802.11 b/g/n HT40\
    \ Wi-Fi transceiver, allowing it to\nconnect to a Wi-Fi network and interact with\
    \ the Internet, as\nwell as create its own network for other devices to connect\n\
    to. Tere is also 128 Kb of RAM and 4 Mb of Flash memory\n(for program and data\
    \ storage), which is more than enough\nto handle the large strings that make up\
    \ web pages, JSON/\nXML data, and anything else we throw at IoT devices.\nA resistance\
    \ temperature device (RTD) DS18B20 wa-\nterproof temperature sensor was used in\
    \ this study (Fig-\nure 3). Tis sealed digital temperature probe lets one\nprecisely\
    \ measure temperature in wet environments with a\nsample 1-wire interface. Te\
    \ DS18B20 provides 9- to 12-bit\n(confgurable) temperature readings over a 1-wire\
    \ interface,\nso that only one wire (and ground) needs to be connected to\na central\
    \ microprocessor.\nIOT\nModem for\nInternet\nAccess\nPump\nsensor\nsensor\nSmart\n\

    \ Soil Science\nA corrosion-resistant soil moisture sensor was incorpo-\nrated\
    \ to measure the moisture content of the soil (Figure 4). It\ncontains two probes:\
    \ the positive (+) end is connected to the\npositivepowersupply,andthenegative(−)endisconnectedto\n\
    the negative pole of the power supply. Te blue potentiometer\nadjusts clockwise/counter-clockwise\
    \ to decrease the probe\ndetectionsensitivity.Itwillshowthattheadjustmentrangehas\n\
    been tested, and at the time, the indicator is on. AO is an\nanalogue (voltage)\
    \ output, which can be directly detected by\nthe AD port of the microcontroller.\n\
    A real-time clock (RTC) DS3231 RTC was adopted in\nthis study (Figure 5). It is\
    \ an I2C RTC with an integrated\ntemperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO)\
    \ and\ncrystal that is low cost and extremely accurate. Te device\nhas a battery\
    \ input and maintains accurate timekeeping even\nwhen the device’s main power\
    \ is lost. Te RTC keeps track of\nseconds, minutes, hours, days, dates, months,\
    \ and years. For\nmonths with fewer than 31 days, the date at the end of the\n\
    month is automatically adjusted, including leap year cor-\nrections. Te clock\
    \ has a 24-hour or 12-hour format, as well\nas an active-low AM/PM indicator.\n\
    Te Sim800L GSM module was used in this study. It is easy\nto connect to Arduino\
    \ and other microcontroller units. It has a\n100% high quality, 3.75% work voltage,\
    \ Quad-Band 850/900/\n1800/1900MHz network support that would work on GSM\nnetworks\
    \ in all countries around the world, and a transistor-\ntransistor logic serial\
    \ interface that is compatible with 3.3V and\n5V. Pinout for the Sim800L GSM module\
    \ is shown in Figure 6.\nTe Nokia 5110 LCD display was incorporated in this\n\
    research. Te module was designed to work with the long-\nlasting Nokia 5110 mobile\
    \ phone, as the name suggests. Te\nPCD8544 is a low-power CMOS LCD controller/driver\
    \ that\nis designed to drive a graphic display with 48 rows and 84\ncolumns. It\
    \ includes on-chip generation of LCD supply and\nbias voltages, resulting in low-power\
    \ consumption, making\nit suitable for power-constrained applications. Te LCD\
    \ only\nuses 6 to 7 milliamps in its normal state. All the components\nwere interfaced\
    \ on a PCB board. Components are typically\nsoldered to the PCB in order to connect\
    \ them electrically and\nmechanically. Te number of pinouts on the LCD and a\n\
    description of each pinout are shown in Figure 7.\n3.2. Data Collection. Te SIS\
    \ was designed and implemented\nas an IoTdevice used for automated modelling and\
    \ sequential\ndata collection of real-time measurements of environmental\nparameters\
    \ such as soil moisture values, soil temperature\nvalues, sunlight, rainfall,\
    \ temperature, humidity, and pump\naction using an adaptive sampling technique\
    \ [25, 26]. Tis\ntechnique enabled the collection of samples from a small\nvegetable\
    \ garden in Abuja, Nigeria. Te workﬂow followed in\nthe development of SIS is\
    \ as follows:\n(1) Boot the system.\n(2) Get soil temperature and soil moisture\
    \ data from\nsensors.\n(3) Search and connect to Wi-Fi and create a hotspot\n\
    (smart farm).\n(4) Restart the system if the Wi-Fi connection fails.\n(5) Download\
    \ the weather forecast for your current\nlocation (Abuja); this includes the amount\
    \ of\nsunshine,\nhumidity,\nrainfall,\nand\natmospheric\ntemperature.\n(6) If\
    \ any download fails, restart the system (jump to 1).\n(7) Upload soil data as\
    \ well as a weather forecast to the\nTingSpeak channel.\n(8) Restart the system\
    \ if the upload fails.\n(9) Refresh all of the data on the LCD.\n(10) If the system\
    \ boot time is less than one minute, send\na start-up SMS and make a phone call.\n\
    (11) If there is an incoming GSM call, then send SMS\nand call.\nFigure 4: Corrosion-resistant\

    \ model was designed to manage real-\nworld data and logical levels are used to\
    \ classify data, cat-\negorizing the various parameters and evaluating and\nmeeting\
    \ the water requirements for a crop. Te data values\ncollected every 15 minutes\
    \ were sent to the IoT CC platform\n“TingSpeak” to predict the threshold status\
    \ of water re-\nquirements. Te data-driven approximation model, known\nas the\
    \ data model, approach was used. Te model uses a\nresponse from the emulator for\
    \ design optimization, anal-\nysis, exploration, and performance evaluation. Improving\n\
    the workﬂow involved following the iterative process in the\nsequential design,\
    \ with an adaptive sampling algorithm\nselecting data points in each iteration,\
    \ guided by a dataset\nthat has already been retrieved and stored in the cloud\
    \ (see\nFigures 8 and 9). From Figure 8, we can view the information\ncollected\
    \ by the SIS downloaded from the CC platform\n“TingSpeak.com” using Microsoft\
    \ Excel and processed\nusing Jupyter Notebook and Python to extract information.\n\
    3.3. Implementation of Software and Hardware. Te imple-\nmentation of the SIS\
    \ involves the integration of both\nhardware and software components, which was\
    \ required as\none of the methodologies to be followed. For hardware\ndesign,\
    \ we used physical components, which are necessary to\nimplement the new system.\
    \ Tis system was broken down\ninto diﬀerent units as listed below: power control\
    \ unit, GSM\nmodule unit, moisture and temperature sensor unit, RTC\nunit, microcontroller\
    \ unit, LCD display unit, and the printed\ncircuit board (PCB). Te software design\
    \ approach involves\nsets of tools that are required to run the system eﬀectively.\n\
    Tey include the following:\n(i) Arduino IDE for Firmware design using C/C++\n\
    (ii) An application browser such as Internet Explorer\nor Netscape Navigator.\n\
    (iii) Use Notepad++ for web interface design using\nHTML, CSS, and JavaScript\
    \ programs to run it.\n(iv) An Internet service provider (ISP) or a Wi-Fi\nmodem\
    \ to facilitate logging into the system.\n(v) Python for over-the-air (OTA) upload\

    (viii) Using the ES8266 (SOC) system on chip as the\nsystem web server\nTe approach\
    \ involves breaking down a system into\nsmaller units to get more insight into\
    \ its compositional\nsubsystems in a reverse engineering way. Figure 10 shows\n\
    the block and circuit diagram of the SIS.\n3.4. Working Mechanism of the SIS.\
    \ Te proposed SIS was\ndesigned and implemented with the capability to make smart\n\
    decisions when water is required by plants considering en-\nvironmental factors\
    \ such as rain, sunlight, temperature,\nhumidity, soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ and weather\nforecast. Tere is an apparent relationship between these\nenvironmental\
    \ factors, and all of the logical relationships\nbetween these environmental factors\
    \ will be determined by\nthe SIS design, and it is crucial for the implementation\
    \ of the\nSIS system. Te data values collected every 15 minutes to\npredict the\
    \ threshold status of water requirement are sent to\nthe IoT CC platform “TingSpeak,”\
    \ a platform for data\ncollection, storage, analytics, and visualization. Te data\n\
    model is designed to manage real-world data and logical\nlevels are used to classify\
    \ data, categorizing the various pa-\nrameters and evaluating and meeting the\
    \ water requirements\nfor a particular plant. Sensor data and weather forecast\
    \ data\nare used to make smart decisions for watering plants based\non the ontology,\
    \ and a machine learning model is used to\nevaluate the performance of the system\
    \ and can be deployed\nwith the ontology to make smarter decisions to actuate\n\

    \ stop the pump). A web\napplication can be used to monitor and control system\
    \ re-\nsponse. Figure 11 shows the working prototype of the SIS.\n3.5. System\
    \ Coding and Implementation. Diferent hardware\nand software tools were used in\
    \ the design and imple-\nmentation of the SIS, but the central focus here is using\
    \ the\nIoT to produce autonomous responses using data analytics.\nHowever, in\
    \ this project, we focus on the utilization of\n“TingSpeak,” a MATLAB platform\
    \ for data collection, data\nvisualization, data processing, and analysis (MATLAB\
    \ tool,\nadopted from https://www.mathworks.com). Te system\nwas programmed so\
    \ that it uses data retrieved from the\nsystem to perform irrigation.\n4. Results\
    \ and Discussions\nTe SIS master node controller controls the processes using\n\
    the workfow. Te sensor devices and web logs or data fles are\nsubmitted (using\
    \ the native Python library). To track results,\nan integrated web service built\
    \ with TingSpeak was created\nFigure 10: Te block and circuit diagram of the SIS.\n\

    processes and the model data, including channel information,\nmodel graphs or\
    \ plots, and conﬁguration used over the HTTP\nprotocol, which was aggregated into\
    \ a web page. TingSpeak\nsets up a WebSocket to collect and process the log messages\
    \ of\nevents. It also uses the Java Logging API, which sends the\nmessage to the\
    \ WebSocket. Te GSM module aids in sending\nSMS to a mobile, which is also used\
    \ to monitor system status.\nForeach ﬁeld, thechannel isupdated andthe visualizationcan\n\
    be viewed in Figures 12–14 for the soil temperature, soil\nmoisture, and rainfall,\
    \ respectively.\nFrom Figure 12, the soil temperature drops with time as\nthe\
    \ day light/sunshine goes down. From the ﬁgure, the\ntemperature dropped from\
    \ 23° to 21° after 4:00 pm.\nFrom Figure 13, the graph shows the variations in\
    \ the\nwater content in the soil as it ﬂows down with time. Te\nhighest value\
    \ of soil moisture was reached.\nFrom Figure 14, it is evident from the graph\
    \ that no\nrainfall was recorded between these times. As this research\ndepends\
    \ on using rain information to predict irrigation\nschedules, the system will\
    \ wait for rain to water the plant if\nthere is a possibility of rain.\nTe data\
    \ from sensors (i.e., moisture and temperature,\nhumidity reading), sprinkler/pump\
    \ state, and web (i.e., rain,\nsunshine, temp) are loaded from the SIS and displayed\
    \ on\nthe LCD. Te data (system status) are output on the LCD.\nTe LCD display\

    \ the result as a set of tables showing the output for\neach event, as shown in\
    \ Figure 16.\nHowever, the “A6 GSM Module” provides a serial port to\ncommunicate\
    \ through GPRS, sending information in phone\ncalls and text messages. Te void\
    \ A6_sms_send() function\nenables sending SMS to my phone number. It can also\
    \ make\ncalls using the void ctrl_call() function to alert you that the\nsystem\
    \ is now active or activated for irrigation, monitoring,\nand control, as shown\
    \ in Figures 17 and 18.\n4.1. Techniques for Model Evaluation and Analysis. Data\n\
    analysis was developed for eﬀective system performance. A\nweb application is\
    \ employed to monitor and control the\nstatus of the system. A supervised machine\
    \ learning ap-\nproach was used according to Mohammad and Sulaiman\n[39]. Tere\
    \ are threshold metrics for classiﬁcation evalua-\ntions using the confusion matrix\
    \ as our model evaluation\nmatrix. Tere is a list of rates that are computed from\
    \ the\nconfusion matrix for a binary classiﬁer and multiclass\nclassiﬁcation as\
    \ shown in Table 1.\n4.2. Summary of Evaluation Results. Based on the data\nanalysis,\
    \ the following major ﬁnding was discovered: the ﬁrst\nfeature could be summarized\
    \ by the “confusion matrix” in\nTable 2.\nRepresented as “true positive (TP) \x88\
    \ 2386, true negative\n(TN) \x88 188, false positive (FP \x88 191), and false\
    \ negative\n(TN) \x88 188.” Te results from the confusion matrix are\nshown in\
    \ the classiﬁcation summary results, which shows\nthe accuracy to be 0.89, which\
    \ is high, the misclassiﬁcation\nrate (error rate) is equal to 0.1, the sensitivity\
    \ is high and is\nequal to 0.79, the speciﬁcity is equal to 0.93, and the pre-\n\
    cision of the model is 0.81.\nTe evaluation is compared with another machine\n\
    learning algorithm like K-NN using K \x88 6 and K \x88 1. Te\nprediction accuracy\
    \ was evaluated, and it shows that KNN is\n0.97 and 0.98. k \x88 6 and k \x88\
    \ 1 have a higher score for pre-\ndiction accuracy. Tis implies that the smart\
    \ system irri-\ngation system has a high accuracy capable of predicting the\n\
    water needs of plants up to 98%.\nTeadvantagesoftheSIScontrollerdesignusedinthisstudy\n\
    when compared to other previous designs are evident owing to\nits cost-eﬀectiveness\
    \ and eﬃciency. It is, however, suggested\nthat more advancement of this SIS controller\
    \ design should be\nprospectively given appropriate attention subsequently.\n\
    5. Conclusion\nAlthough the study’s goals and objectives were met to a\nsatisfactory\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges

    1. Introduction

    The Internet of Things technology revolves around the core concept of integrating
    sen-

    sors into everyday objects and using connectivity to facilitate the exchange of
    information

    that is used in a variety of applications [1]. There are more everyday objects
    available than

    people, so the amount of connectivity that IoT devices hold is enormous [2]. In
    order to

    better understand the future of IoT technology, it is important to understand
    the unique

    circumstances that brought IoT to this point. A key distinction to make between
    the in-

    ternet and the IoT is that the internet is a mesh of networks, whereas the IoT
    network is

    an interconnected network of devices [3,4]. An early example of the ﬁrst IoT device
    was

    John Romkey’s creation, which enabled a toaster to be turned on or off over the
    internet

    in 1990 [5]. It is clear that Internet of Things devices have come a long way
    from their

    humble beginnings, and there are many factors that inﬂuenced this rise. These
    devices

    play an important role in people’s daily lives and involve the handling of massive
    amounts

    of data [6]. IoT devices can be seen as a network of interconnected devices that
    involves

    sending and actuating devices that provide the ability to share information across
    different

    platforms [7–21].

    The rapid rise in technology and computer system capabilities has had a major
    impact

    on the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The impact of IoT
    systems will

    impact many different ﬁelds and will change the way society operates and moves
    toward

    the future, as shown in Figure 1. This paper discusses the use of IoT in four
    domains. As

    IoT devices become increasingly integrated into society, there are still numerous
    security

    challenges that pose a threat to their spread. Numerous technologies are being
    developed

    in order to help protect the safe use of IoT devices, and it is clear that advances
    in security

    will be critical moving forward into the future [22–27].

    Figure 1. IoT technology and diverse application domains.

    Numerous research works have been conducted to address various aspects of the

    Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing energy harvesting, device-to-device communication,

    energy efﬁciency, resource allocation, edge computing, security, privacy, and
    applications

    across different domains. Scholars have explored stochastic geometry analysis
    to optimize

    energy harvesting, proposed energy-efﬁcient systems, investigated untapped potential
    in

    spectrum utilization, developed reinforcement learning-based frameworks, and explored

    the integration of edge computing and artiﬁcial intelligence [28–42]. Additionally,
    studies

    have focused on addressing security concerns in these areas, including privacy-preserving

    data sharing, explainable AI, and motion tracking. Collectively, these research
    efforts

    contribute to a comprehensive understanding of IoT technologies and their applications
    in

    diverse ﬁelds [43–51].

    Many different strategies are being utilized by computing professionals in order
    to

    advance the ﬁeld of research in IoT technology [52–56]. In particular, machine
    learning and

    artiﬁcial intelligence have played key roles in advancing this emerging ﬁeld of
    computer

    science and will continue to do so in new and exciting ways [57]. It is critical
    for computer

    scientists to understand common machine learning and AI algorithms that are being

    used, as well as consider what research is currently being conducted to advance
    IoT

    technologies [58–73].

    The methodology followed for conducting the review involves a systematic literature

    search, a study selection based on predeﬁned criteria, data studies, a critical
    evaluation

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    3 of 19

    of the selected studies, and a comprehensive discussion of the ﬁndings. This review
    aims

    to provide an overview of IoT applications and future directions in the selected
    domains,

    ensuring the inclusion of relevant research and a rigorous evaluation process.

    2. Applications of IoT Devices

    Since Internet of Things technology can be understood as devices/objects that
    are

    connected to a network, the applications of IoT devices are endless [74–80]. Leaders
    of

    different companies/organizations are recognizing the potential of IoT technology
    to make

    an impact and are investing more in these key pieces of technology in order to
    reap the

    beneﬁts [81]. Nearly any object can be outﬁtted with the appropriate technology
    that will be

    involved in the data transmission from IoT devices and their connected networks.
    Writing

    about the different applications would be a long and arduous process and it would
    be more

    beneﬁcial to ﬁrst understand the most common applications of IoT devices before
    exploring

    what the future holds. Figures 2 and 3 shows growth in IoT globally. The connectivity
    in

    different medical IoT devices is shown in Figure 4.

    Figure 2. The number of IoT devices is greater than the number of people [82].

    Figure 3. Number of IoT devices globally [83].

    Figure 4. Connectivity in different medical IoT devices.

    2.1. Healthcare Applications

    The Internet of Medical Things (IoTM) is an emerging subﬁeld that is changing
    the

    way healthcare is being delivered through the use of IoT technology (Joyia). The
    use of

    IoT technology in healthcare has come a long way and continues to be a promising
    area

    for growth. Essential innovations, such as the AliveCor heart monitor, which relies
    on IoT

    sensors, show how useful technology can be when applied to healthcare in efforts
    to save

    lives [84]. Advances in technology have consistently played a major role in the
    healthcare

    industry, and IoT devices have found numerous applications in healthcare settings.
    One

    way that IoT devices are useful in healthcare is through the use of remote health
    monitoring

    in order to monitor patients at home rather than in hospitals [85]. The information
    that is

    collected from IoT devices is helpful in medical settings because it can be analyzed
    and used

    in ways such as early disease prediction [86]. IoT sensors even played a critical
    role during

    the COVID-19 pandemic in helping healthcare workers better monitor critical parameters

    that could save lives if changes were detected right away [87]. By examining these
    different

    IoT device applications in the healthcare industry, researchers can ﬁnd additional
    ways to

    advance this ﬁeld of research.

    The use of sensors is critical in the delivery of healthcare services [88]. Sensors
    in

    medical devices act as a bridge between the physical and information worlds by
    collecting

    a variety of data. Sensors are crucial in helping healthcare professionals monitor
    different

    vitals that are important to measure in order to understand a person’s health
    situation

    and act accordingly. Medical sensors can be used in a variety of ways in order
    to measure

    crucial information. Medical sensors are connected to IoT, and measure things
    such as

    temperature, respiration, heart rate, weight, skin conductance, galvanic response,
    blood

    ﬂow/SpO2, glucose testing, muscle contraction, and motion analysis [89]. The medical

    sensors are connected to wireless sensor networks, which relay useful information
    to

    different stakeholders involved in healthcare, such as patients, medical staff,
    insurers, and

    more [90]. The use of medical sensors is vast and can be used in crucial medical
    equipment,

    such as ECG monitors, glucose level sensing, and oxygen monitoring [91]. The goal
    of

    using any technology involved in healthcare is to promote better health outcomes,
    and IoT

    devices play a critical role in promoting this. Recent advances in IoT-related
    technology

    will continue to play a large role in creating stronger healthcare systems, and
    the future of

    healthcare will become increasingly reliant on technology [92].

    Medical sensors are important in collecting useful information about a patient’s
    health;

    however, this information is often very sensitive in nature, and this makes privacy
    a ma-

    jor concern moving forward. Security has always played a vital role in IoT technology;

    however, it matters even more in a situation such as healthcare, where IoT devices
    will be

    collecting sensitive information about patients that is private in nature [93].
    If a patient’s

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    5 of 19

    medical information was compromised, this could lead to consequences for hospital
    orga-

    nizations that did not employ the proper security measures to prevent it. The
    privacy and

    conﬁdentiality of a patient’s medical information are core concerns when addressing
    the

    security vulnerabilities of healthcare IoT devices [94].

    There are many issues that present challenges to the successful use of IoT devices
    in

    healthcare and it is important to address these issues thoroughly when handling
    mission-

    critical operations, such as that of healthcare. Some important limitations that
    inﬂuence the

    use of IoT technology in medical devices include the need for high power consumption,

    the availability of limited resources, and handling security issues from the large
    number of

    devices being used [95].

    The use of IoT technology in healthcare is promising and exciting. There are many

    useful applications where IoT devices can be used as sensors, and this helps healthcare

    providers in a variety of ways. Moving forward, IoT technology will continue to
    expand,

    and this will ultimately beneﬁt healthcare organizations.

    2.2. Agriculture Applications

    As the population of the world grows at an exponential rate, the need for efﬁcient

    food delivery systems is becoming a core issue that is a driver behind the advancements
    in

    smart agriculture [96]. In addition to the growing demand, factors such as climate
    change

    and water scarcity have also played roles in the increasing demand for more efﬁcient

    agriculture systems [97]. Much of the technology around IoT implementation aims
    to

    reduce agricultural resource waste [98] as shown on Figure 5. The use of IoT technology
    in

    agricultural settings is critical to maintaining efﬁcient operations and represents
    another

    common use case of IoT technology. Food supply chains that deliver quality and
    quantity

    are important to feed the world, and having efﬁcient systems built around these
    supply

    chains will beneﬁt people all over the world [99]. The need for more efﬁcient
    food-delivery

    systems has helped to promote IoT use in agriculture because stakeholders saw
    the beneﬁts

    that technology could provide [100].

    Figure 5. Different types of agriculture applications for IoT.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    6 of 19

    One way that IoT technology can be used in agriculture is automation. Automation

    involves having devices/objects respond automatically to different conditions
    without the

    need for human interaction. Wireless sensor networks are key proponents in helping
    IoT

    devices achieve their automation goals [101]. This can be useful in massive operations,

    such as agriculture, because of its sheer scale and need for efﬁcient processes
    to maximize

    crop yields. For example, many sensors can be used in the soil of farmland in
    order to

    measure soil moisture content, in order to build systems that make better use
    of water for

    irrigation purposes [102]. These IoT devices can be used to measure soil conditions,
    such

    as water content, give appropriate signals when it is low, and turn on sprinkler
    systems

    automatically. Real-time monitoring and responses are very common and useful when

    understanding how IoT devices contribute to agriculture [103].

    Data analytics is another area where IoT plays an important role in agriculture.
    Col-

    lecting and analyzing data are very useful because they can give important insight
    into

    how effective or ineffective an operation is. These data can be used to provide
    stakeholders

    with important insight that will ultimately impact their decision-making [104].
    IoT devices

    collect massive amounts of data, and these data are useful when analyzed over
    time to

    help aid in decisions about estimation and forecasting [105]. The gathered data
    can be

    analyzed using machine learning methods that impact prediction, storage management,

    decision-making, farm management, and precision farming [96]. These data can become

    useful when attempting to implement more sustainable farming methods through the
    use

    of data-driven decision-making [104].

    Although there is a large demand for efﬁcient agriculture, there are other factors
    in

    play that have affected the proliferation of IoT devices in this sector. One key
    component

    that affects how widespread IoT devices are in agricultural applications is how
    costly it

    is to implement them in farming operations around the world [106]. Massive farming

    operations would require a large number of wireless sensors to collect data about
    a farming

    operation, and this can drastically increase the costs associated with implementing
    IoT in

    agriculture [107]. There are also many technical challenges that exist with implementing

    IoT technology in farms. Farms are often in large areas that are isolated and
    usually have

    poorer signals that impact their networking capabilities [108]. In addition to
    this, many

    farmers in rural parts of the world have limited knowledge of how to use IoT devices
    [109].

    2.3. Smart Home Applications

    Smart home applications represent promising use cases in which people beneﬁt from

    IoT technology and there are numerous advantages/disadvantages to consider. Smart
    home

    devices date back to the 1970s when the X10 protocol was ﬁrst conceived; this
    technology

    allowed for smart home devices to communicate properly [110]. IoT devices in smart

    homes can be used in a variety of ways, such as measuring home conditions, managing

    home appliances, and controlling home access [111]. Home automation remains a
    core

    feature around which IoT technology is applied [112]. For example, there are numerous

    home appliances that can be turned on and equipped with IoT technology in order
    to

    become more efﬁcient and convenient [113]. There are many beneﬁts that extend
    beyond

    convenience. The use of IoT sensors in smart homes can be used to assist the elderly
    in

    turning hard-to-reach devices on/off and even detect falls through the use of
    ﬂoor or

    camera sensors [114]. The market is being driven by the rising popularity of smart
    devices,

    such as speakers offered by Amazon and Google. According to a recently released
    report

    by Strategy Analytics, the global smart home market has had a positive outcome
    in recent

    years [115]. The report further estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
    of 10%

    from 2018 to 2023, leading to a market value of USD 155 billion, as shown in Figure
    6.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    7 of 19

    Figure 6. Households with smart systems: global total [115].

    There are many techniques utilized in order to bring smart home technology to
    life.

    One important method relies on radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) systems in
    order to

    act as enabler technologies for IoT [116]. RFID is an important technology that
    helps in

    identifying objects, recording data, and even controlling individual targets through
    the use

    of radio waves [117]. RFID devices can be used in a variety of ways. For example,
    higher

    education institutions can utilize RFID technology in student identiﬁcation cards
    [118].

    RFID technology is also used to detect the indoor roaming activity of elderly
    individuals

    and the data collected are used to provide more insight into the health of elderly
    individuals

    who live alone [119].

    In an ideal future, IoT devices would be able to seamlessly communicate together
    [7].

    There are many challenges that exist in the use of smart home IoT technology.
    Interoperabil-

    ity is one issue because the cost of using smart home technology is important
    to consider,

    and the integration of devices is a concern moving forward [120]. Different technologies

    utilized by IoT devices in order to create this connectivity include Wi-Fi, ZigBee,
    Z-Wave,

    Bluetooth LE, and Thread [121].

    Security and privacy are also important to consider because smart grid technology

    can be a target for cyber attacks [120]. There are so many IoT objects that can
    be used in

    homes, and the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart home environments presents

    a challenge when it comes to addressing authentication and privacy issues [52].
    Cyber

    attackers could target items such as smart home routers, gateways, or any other
    IoT-

    enabled devices to access data [122]. Many strategies are currently being analyzed
    in order

    to address smart home security needs. Blockchain is becoming increasingly utilized
    because

    of its beneﬁts of having a decentralized database based on cryptographic techniques
    [55]).

    Although blockchain approaches have beneﬁted from decentralized security/privacy,
    there

    are drawbacks when it comes to the energy and computational overhead that make
    it not

    ideal for IoT devices that are resource-constrained [123].

    2.4. Smart Cities

    Internet of Things devices have many useful applications when it comes to smart
    cities.

    A smart city can be understood as a city that is equipped with technology, such
    as wireless

    sensor networks and actuators that collect data; it is used to make important
    decisions in

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    8 of 19

    city operations [124]. These systems are inherently complex due to the large number
    of

    devices, link layer technologies, and the different services involved in the operation
    of smart

    city technology [125]. The smart city concept consists of sensing networks, heterogeneous

    infrastructure, and information processing systems working together in order to
    improve

    a variety of areas within cities [126]. The use of IoT technology to enable smart
    cities is

    useful due to the quality of life it provides for the citizens within those cities
    [127]. The

    goal of smart cities is to use all of the information that is collected from IoT
    devices in

    order to improve the performances of urban services to citizens and also consider
    resource

    consumption at the same time [128].

    Trafﬁc monitoring is a very important application within the realm of smart cities.
    It is

    very common for metropolitan areas to be highly populated, and this causes congestion

    problems within these cities. Smart cities make use of information communication
    technolo-

    gies in order to use the information to make decisions on how to dynamically handle
    trafﬁc

    ﬂow [129]. A smart trafﬁc system (STS) involves real-time data collection and
    requires

    IoT devices to quickly obtain real-time public trafﬁc data and have it processed
    [130]. The

    sensors used in smart trafﬁc management systems can be embedded into roads in
    order

    to detect vehicles every 500 or 1000 meters [131]. Cameras are able to apply digital
    image

    processing techniques and, consequently, apply algorithms to aid in the prediction
    of trafﬁc

    density; this information is then used accordingly [132]. Aside from helping trafﬁc
    ﬂow,

    smart trafﬁc management systems also help with improving air quality and providing

    safety for the elderly [133].

    Research indicates that the amount of solid waste will reach around 3.4 billion
    tons

    by the year 2050, and that will put a tremendous strain on municipal waste management

    systems [134]. Smart waste management is another growing application of IoT technology

    in smart cities. Nowadays, waste management systems are overtaxed and burdened
    due

    to the large demands of highly-populated urban areas [135]. The goal of smart
    waste

    management is to use IoT devices in order to optimize waste collection and reduce
    the

    negative impact on the environment [136]. Major factors driving the need for smart
    waste

    management include the demand for energy-efﬁcient processes and the goal of creating

    healthier environments within cities [137]. A number of different objects can
    be repurposed

    into IoT devices, such as trash and recycling containers [138], and different
    technologies

    can be used to indicate when it is time to service a full container. In addition
    to detecting

    when waste bins are full, some sensors are capable of detecting unpleasant smells
    using gas

    sensors [139]. These smart containers essentially work by having sensors in the
    containers

    that read, collect, and communicate information about the amount of trash/recycle
    volume

    within them in order to better understand when it is time to empty the container
    [140].

    In environmental sector applications, IoT technology has emerged as a valuable
    tool in

    enhancing air quality prediction through edge-based computation. Leveraging edge-based

    computation, IoT devices equipped with sensors collect real-time air quality data
    at the

    source, enabling precise prediction models tailored to speciﬁc locations. This
    empowers

    environmental monitoring systems to deliver accurate and timely information for
    effective

    decision-making and pollution control measures.

    In the realm of anomaly detection and classiﬁcation, IoT devices continuously
    monitor

    and analyze data from diverse sources, swiftly identify deviations from normal
    patterns,

    and recognize potential threats or irregularities. Through advanced machine learning
    algo-

    rithms and localized data processing, IoT systems can rapidly detect anomalies,
    ensuring

    the robust security and integrity of IoT networks and the data they generate.

    Moreover, multisensory data fusion in multi-application wireless sensor data streams

    enables the integration of information from various sensors and applications,
    enabling

    a comprehensive understanding of intricate IoT environments. By combining data
    from

    disparate sources, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality sensors, IoT
    systems

    2.5. Industry 4.0

    The manufacturing sector is undergoing a revolutionary transformation with the

    advent of Industry 4.0, ushering in an era of intelligent and interconnected systems.
    A

    prominent trend in this domain is the rapid adoption of Industrial Internet of
    Things (IIoT)

    devices and sensors [141–145] as shown in Figure 7. These embedded devices empower

    machines, equipment, and products to gather and transmit real-time data. The data
    gener-

    ated by IIoT devices are invaluable for predictive maintenance, enabling manufacturers
    to

    proactively identify and address potential equipment failures, thereby reducing
    downtime

    and enhancing operational efﬁciency.

    Figure 7. Industry 4.0.

    Another signiﬁcant trend within Industry 4.0 is the heightened focus on cybersecurity.

    As factories and supply chains become increasingly interconnected and reliant
    on digital

    technologies, the need for robust cybersecurity measures has become paramount.
    Manu-

    facturers are making substantial investments in advanced security solutions to
    safeguard

    sensitive industrial data from cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and availability
    of their

    systems. This includes implementing encryption techniques, authentication protocols,
    and

    intrusion detection systems to fortify critical information.

    Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also playing crucial
    roles in

    driving Industry 4.0 forward. With the copious amounts of data generated by IIoT
    devices,

    AI and ML algorithms have the capacity to analyze and derive meaningful insights
    from

    vast datasets. Manufacturers are leveraging these technologies to optimize production

    processes, enhance quality control, and improve decision-making. By detecting
    patterns

    and anomalies in real-time data, AI-powered systems can optimize manufacturing
    opera-

    tions, identify defects, and propose process improvements, ultimately resulting
    in increased

    productivity and reduced costs.

    Furthermore, the adoption of cloud computing technologies has empowered manufac-

    turers to securely store and access vast quantities of data in a ﬂexible and scalable
    manner.

    Cloud-based platforms provide the agility required for data analysis, collaboration,
    and re-

    mote monitoring. Manufacturers can conveniently access real-time production information

    from anywhere, enabling remote troubleshooting, predictive maintenance, and streamlined

    supply chain management.

    Collaborative robots, also known as cobots, represent another noteworthy trend
    in

    Industry 4.0. These robots work alongside human operators, assisting them in various
    tasks

    and augmenting productivity. Cobots, which are designed to be safe, adaptable,
    and easily

    programmable, can adapt to changing production requirements. They are adept at
    handling

    repetitive and physically demanding tasks, freeing up human workers to concentrate
    on

    more intricate and creative aspects of the manufacturing process.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    10 of 19

    The integration of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies
    is also

    gaining momentum within Industry 4.0. These immersive technologies offer interactive

    and intuitive interfaces for training, simulation, and maintenance purposes. VR
    and AR

    enable workers to visualize and manipulate virtual representations of machinery,
    products,

    and processes, thereby enhancing training effectiveness and reducing errors.

    Industry 4.0 is driving a transformative shift in the manufacturing landscape.
    The

    widespread adoption of IIoT devices, AI and ML algorithms, cloud computing, cyberse-

    curity measures, cobots, and immersive technologies is reshaping traditional industrial

    processes into highly connected, intelligent, and efﬁcient operations. Manufacturers
    who

    embrace these trends are poised to reap numerous beneﬁts, including improved produc-

    tivity, cost reductions, enhanced product quality, and increased agility in an
    intensely

    competitive global marketplace.

    3. Challenges and Active Research Topics

    3.1. Security of IoT Devices

    The use of Internet of Things devices is progressively becoming more prevalent
    in

    the daily lives of people around the world; however, cyberattacks remain a large
    threat to

    the safe use of IoT [146]. Different examples of these devices are mobile phones,
    alarms,

    medical sensors, smartwatches, security systems, and more. The use of these devices

    continues to expand, and the need for strong security is vital to their success.
    Although

    these devices bring convenience, they come with many security issues and vulnerabilities.

    Since IoT devices often collect sensitive data, these data transmissions can be
    intercepted by

    third parties who intend to conduct harm or use these data for nefarious purposes.
    In one

    case, there were even attacks that could target IoT devices, such as the Mirai
    malware [147],

    which would hack/convert devices into its botnet and carry out DDoS attacks [148]
    as

    shown in Figure 8. Malware, such as the Mirai and others, take advantage of the
    vast

    amounts of poorly protected IoT devices, which commonly suffer from poor conﬁgurations

    and open designs, making them targets [149]. Detecting malware and IoT botnets
    remains

    an active research area, and many techniques are being applied. The use of a lightweight

    approach in the classiﬁcation of IoT malware through the use of image recognition
    is just

    one example [150]. Other ways include the use of machine learning algorithms that
    use

    supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in order to handle tasks
    such as

    authentication, access control, and malware detection [151].

    Figure 8. DDoS attacks worldwide.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    11 of 19

    There is an enormous amount of data being transmitted on a daily basis, which

    impacts critical operations across many applications. It could be possible for
    attackers

    to disrupt entire networks that rely on IoT technology, and the consequences would
    be

    devastating [152]. Hackers and criminals could seriously impact the expansion
    of IoT

    devices in the future, and it is crucial that security be thoroughly researched
    to mitigate

    these negative impacts.

    3.2. Authentication and Password Security

    One security issue is the lack of security in regard to authentication and passwords.

    Many IoT devices rely on password security in order to stay protected from cyber
    criminals

    who are attempting to gain access to them. These passwords can often be weak,
    and

    criminals can have easy access to IoT devices. There is a lack of standardization
    revolving

    around how complex passwords should be. Research shows that having more complex

    password combinations in IoT devices can prevent more cyber attacks [153]. Even
    with

    stronger passwords, there would need to be additional security measures to prevent

    cyber attackers.

    One example of an additional layer of security involves the use of multi-authentication

    in IoT devices. In order to authorize the correct users to access IoT devices,
    it is a prerequisite

    to ﬁrst have authentication [154]. Authentication is the process by which the
    identity of

    users is veriﬁed before allowing them to gain access to a system. Passwords represent

    just one level of authentication, and it is important to understand the other
    types of

    authentication mechanisms that IoT devices can take advantage of. Different methods,

    such as the utilization of elliptic curve cryptography, can be useful when performing

    authentications in IoT security systems [155].

    One-time passwords can sometimes be useful for authentication purposes related
    to

    IoT devices. These passwords work by having a private key generator (PKG) generate
    a

    one-time password, and this password is used as a private key that is needed in
    order to

    gain access. The last phase of using one-time passwords involves validation. In
    this phase,

    the application and IoT device exchange data via a one-time password, verifying
    that the

    password was sourced from a valid location [56].

    3.3. Interoperability Challenges

    Using IoT devices smoothly and without compatibility issues remains a challenge

    both now and in the future. Interoperability is important because it allows IoT
    devices

    to communicate with each other more efﬁciently. It is a challenge to have IoT
    devices

    work together seamlessly because many operate on different infrastructures, devices,

    APIs, and even data formats [156]. The need for the safe interoperability of IoT
    devices

    has even led to the creation of international organizations that develop standards
    that

    IoT devices can adopt with the intention of becoming more compatible [157]. The
    use

    of protocols and standards, such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, is critical to the rise
    of IoT

    technology because it essentially establishes the rules for use and communication,
    helping

    to address interoperability concerns [158]. International organizations, such
    as IEEE, the

    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), OneM2M, and others, have developed important

    standards and protocols and play integral roles in inﬂuencing the IoT [159]. One
    important

    contribution to addressing these challenges is the BiG IoT project, which is an
    initiative that

    seeks to create a common API that different IoT devices could communicate through
    [160].

    3.4. Cloud Computing Research

    Since IoT devices generate massive amounts of data, cloud computing solutions
    are

    continually being used and researched in order to better handle these data demands.

    Cloud IoT is a novel IT paradigm that represents the merging of the cloud with
    IoT,

    and research in this area will be crucial in moving this technology forward [161].
    Cloud

    computing is essentially an extension of distributed computing, parallel computing,
    and

    grid computing [126]. There are many IoT constraints that cloud computing addresses,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    12 of 19

    such as processing, storage, and communication [162]. For example, a major concern
    about

    IoT data involves the security risks that come from storing data locally on IoT
    devices [163],

    and cloud computing aims to address this concern by allowing data storage in cloud

    computing servers [164]. Since data collected from IoT devices are often unstructured,

    cloud computing research looks to improve the real-time data processing capabilities
    and

    allow for more dynamic resource management [165].

    3.5. Potential Future Directions and Developments

    The potential future directions and developments of IoT in healthcare, agriculture,

    smart homes, smart cities, and Industry 4.0 are poised to bring about transformative

    changes and advancements. In healthcare, the integration of IoT with telemedicine,
    wear-

    able health technology, and advanced data analytics holds promise for revolutionizing

    patient care. Real-time monitoring, personalized treatment plans, and early disease
    detec-

    tion can be facilitated through IoT-enabled devices, leading to improved health
    outcomes.

    In agriculture, IoT-driven precision farming techniques, such as smart irrigation
    and crop

    disease detection, have the potential to optimize resource utilization, conserve
    water, and

    enhance crop yield. By leveraging real-time data from IoT sensors, farmers can
    make

    informed decisions and implement timely interventions. In the realm of smart homes,

    the focus will be on seamless integration, energy efﬁciency, and personalized
    automation.

    IoT-enabled smart home solutions will allow for centralized control and management
    of

    various devices, optimizing energy consumption and providing tailored experiences
    for

    inhabitants. In smart cities, IoT applications will enhance transportation systems,
    envi-

    ronmental monitoring, and citizen engagement. Intelligent trafﬁc management, real-time

    tracking of air quality, and participatory governance will contribute to improved
    mobility,

    sustainability, and quality of life. Finally, Industry 4.0 will witness the integration
    of IoT in

    industrial automation, predictive maintenance, and supply chain optimization.
    IoT-driven

    technologies will enable the real-time monitoring of machines, predictive maintenance

    strategies, and streamlined logistics, leading to enhanced productivity and reduced
    down-

    time. Continued research and development in these areas will shape the future
    of IoT,

    paving the way for innovative solutions and transformative advancements across
    sectors.

    \ have rapidly grown over the past few decades to offer futuristic ap-\nplications,\
    \ such as autonomous vehicles, smart farming, and smart city. Such applications\
    \ require\nubiquitous, real-time, and secure communications to deliver services\
    \ quickly. Toward this aim,\nsixth-generation (6G) wireless technology offers\
    \ superior performance with high reliability, enhanced\ntransmission rate, and\
    \ low latency. However, managing the resources of the aforementioned applica-\n\
    tions is highly complex in the precarious network. An adversary can perform various\
    \ network-related\nattacks (i.e., data injection or modiﬁcation) to jeopardize\
    \ the regular operation of the smart applica-\ntions. Therefore, incorporating\
    \ blockchain technology in the smart application can be a prominent\nsolution\
    \ to tackle security, reliability, and data-sharing privacy concerns. Motivated\
    \ by the same,\nwe presented a case study on public safety applications that utilizes\
    \ the essential characteristics of\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and\
    \ a 6G network to handle data integrity attacks on the crime\ndata. The case study\
    \ is assessed using various performance parameters by considering blockchain\n\
    scalability, packet drop ratio, and training accuracy. Lastly, we explored different\
    \ research challenges\nof adopting blockchain in the 6G wireless network.\nKeywords:\
    \ blockchain; 6G network; applications; blockchain services; unmanned aerial vehicle;\
    \ AI\n1. Introduction\nIn the current scenario, humans interact with the physical\
    \ world using sixth-generation\n(6G)-based technologies, such as the Internet\
    \ of things (IoT), cloud computing, big data,\nand artiﬁcial intelligence (AI).\
    \ These technologies monitor the application’s resources and\ncontrol a colossal\
    \ amount of data, power, and storage resources. The advent of IoT technolo-\n\
    gies brings tremendous cognizant applications, such as smart healthcare, smart\
    \ cities, smart\ngrids, etc., to improve people’s standard of living. However,\
    \ the increasing number of\nusers and their network demands, such as high bandwidth\
    \ and low latency, make wireless\ncommunication networks more complex and vulnerable\
    \ to different security and privacy\nissues, such as user identity, authenticity,\
    \ data integrity, information security, and conﬁden-\ntiality [1]. For example,\
    \ in a smart healthcare system, the patient health record is private\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23020969\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n2 of 26\nand sensitive information that must be secured\
    \ from adversaries, which can misuse this\ninformation by tampering with it or\
    \ selling it to the black market. Another example is\nfor public safety applications\
    \ (e.g., IoT-based crime detection), where a criminal tries to\nmodify the central\
    \ repository that holds the criminal records. The adversary can modify or\ntamper\
    \ the criminal records, i.e., it can perform injection attacks to change the criminal’s\n\
    identity (e.g., remove the traces of criminal evidence). Therefore, superior technology\n\
    such as blockchain is required to overcome the aforementioned security issues\
    \ in 6G-based\nsmart applications [2]. It strengthens the security and privacy\
    \ of wireless communication\nnetworks by utilizing its essential characteristics,\
    \ i.e., immutability, scalability, security and\nprivacy, transparency, and decentralization\
    \ [3,4].\nBlockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that builds trust between\
    \ various\nnetwork services and applications such as smart grids, smart agriculture,\
    \ smart cities,\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, and vehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ (V2V) communica-\ntions. It also delivers improved services such as interoperability,\
    \ distribution, immutability,\nfaster settlement, unanimity, and many more. As\
    \ a result, blockchain is associated with a\n6G-based wireless communication network\
    \ and offers a secure and trusted environment for\ndata protection in an IoT-based\
    \ public safety environment. For example, Velliangiri et al. [5]\ndiscussed the\
    \ applicability of blockchain technology with the emerging 6G network for\nsecure\
    \ data sharing. They proposed a privacy-preserving architecture for industrial\
    \ services\nand applications. Then, Bindu et al. [6] discussed the signiﬁcance\
    \ of blockchain in 6G\nwireless communication networks. They studied various applications\
    \ of 6G with security\nand privacy threats and explored blockchain-based solutions\
    \ for smart and industrial IoT-\nbased applications. In [7], the authors used\
    \ blockchain secure storage to store crime images\nby applying watermarking and\
    \ cryptographic blockchain in forensic applications. There\nhas been a lot of\
    \ research work in the ﬁeld of the integration of blockchain in 6G-based\nreal-world\
    \ applications. A detailed explanation of each application is as follows.\n1.1.\
    \ Applications of Blockchain in 6G Network\nThis section presents the role of\
    \ blockchain in 6G-based smart applications such as\nsmart cities, smart manufacturing,\
    \ smart agriculture, V2V communication, UAV communi-\ncations, and smart grid\
    \ (Figure 1).\nSmart city\nSmart healthcare\nSmart manufacturing\nSmart grid\n\

    \ 2023, 23, 969\n3 of 26\n1.1.1. Smart Healthcare\nThe healthcare industry is\
    \ an essential sector in the nation’s economic system that\noffers medical services\
    \ to treat patients, promote patients’ health, and increase the quality\nof life\
    \ of individuals. The emerging 6G technology revolutionizes healthcare by changing\n\
    the perception of lifestyle [8]. A smart healthcare system offers better connectivity\
    \ between\npatients and healthcare providers, medical organizations, and IoT-based\
    \ medical devices. It\nprovides a health information platform by adopting 6G-based\
    \ services, such as augmented\nand virtual reality. In addition, healthcare systems\
    \ require the blockchain to securely store\nmedical records and update patient\
    \ data across different platforms in real-time [9,10].\nResearchers enabled blockchain\
    \ technology in 6G-based applications and proposed\nmany solutions for smart healthcare.\
    \ For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients\nsuffering from chronic\
    \ diseases are more at risk than ordinary people because patients with\ndiabetes\
    \ and asthma are more susceptible to coronavirus infection. Therefore, there is\
    \ a\nrequirement to treat these types of patients remotely and offer them emergency\
    \ facilities\nsuch as temperature checks, pulse, and respiratory and O2 monitoring.\
    \ However, remote\ndiagnosis and treatment can be lured by the attacker and cause\
    \ patient data security issues.\nThus, to overcome these issues, blockchain is\
    \ integrated with a healthcare system that\nremotely monitors the health data\
    \ of patients suffering from a chronic disease. In [11],\nthe authors facilitated\
    \ a private blockchain and a solidity-based smart contract that keeps\ntrack of\
    \ patients’ health information. The role of blockchain in their proposed work\
    \ is to\nsecurely analyze patients’ details and store patient health records from\
    \ and to the sensors.\nFurther, in [12], the authors investigated AI with healthcare\
    \ systems and proposed a\nparallel gout diagnosis and treatment system (PGDTS).\
    \ Their proposed system enhances\nthe diagnosis accuracy and the effectiveness\
    \ of medical treatment. After the diagnosis and\ntreatment process, their adopted\
    \ scheme was analyzed and evaluated based on diverse\ntherapeutic regimens, and\
    \ they established parallel execution for real-time optimization of\nhealthcare\
    \ processes. Their integrated blockchain-based PGDTS scheme offers integrity,\n\
    scalability, and security of patients’ data.\n1.1.2. Smart Manufacturing\nIn the\
    \ real-world scenario, massive amounts of data are exchanged between the\ndevices\
    \ for large-scale manufacturing. Therefore, machines have the interaction capability\n\
    to cooperate via the Industrial Internet in the manufacturing industry. In order\
    \ to improve\nthe performance of the entire manufacturing process, machines autonomously\
    \ make local\ndecisions [13]; however, there is a requirement for always-on connectivity,\
    \ a higher data\nrate, more reliability, and ultra-low latency in the manufacturing\
    \ industry. The 6G mobile\ncommunication techniques are developed to target the\
    \ aforementioned manufacturing\nindustrial services; however, there are security\
    \ issues in the manufacturing industry where\na malicious user could tamper with\
    \ the manufacturing data. Therefore, blockchain-based\nnetworks are integrated\
    \ into manufacturing systems that offer cybersecurity guarantees\nvia smart contracts,\
    \ hash functions, digital signatures, and immutable digital ledgers to\ntackle\
    \ security and privacy issues. Recently, Leng et al. [14] incorporated digital\
    \ twins with\ndecentralized permissioned blockchain networks to build better mutual\
    \ trust and data ﬂow\nin manufacturing processes. They proposed a ManuChain prototype\
    \ to realize lower- and\nupper-level intelligence for crowd self-organize and\
    \ holistic optimization. Their proposed\nscheme aided a new value for transforming\
    \ and upgrading manufacturing systems. It also\nenhanced the efﬁciency of the\
    \ manufacturing process.\nRecently, blockchain has been investigated and integrated\
    \ with mobile edge com-\nputing (MEC) to overcome the computational workload.\
    \ It reduces time complexity and\nsigniﬁcantly improves system performance. In\
    \ [15], the authors presented a smart man-\nufacturing system by integrating MEC\
    \ with blockchain technology. They also proposed\na swarm-intelligence-based optimization\
    \ model with numerous tasks that enhance the\nprocessing time. Blockchain offers\
    \ device-level information transmission and manufac-\nturing service transactions\
    \ in their proposed approach. Then, Teng et al. [16] proposed a\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n4 of 26\nsmart manufacturing scheme using distributed ledger technology\
    \ that supports on-demand\nproduction. They introduced a blockchain-embedded smart\
    \ manufacturing system that en-\nhances manufacturing efﬁciency. They investigated\
    \ latency and limited throughput issues\nin the blockchain network. Therefore,\
    \ they proposed a deep Q-network that maximizes\nthe user’s net proﬁt. Their results\
    \ show that their proposed framework is highly scalable.\nIt offers consistency,\
    \ availability, and privacy by incorporating off-chain storage, ledger\nisolation,\
    \ and encryption mechanism.\n1.1.3. Smart City\nSmart city architecture requires\
    \ conventional internet support for information collec-\ntion and transmission;\
    \ however, the transmitted data encounter latency and security issues\ndue to\
    \ the precarious communication link between nodes of the smart city. Therefore,\n\
    6G communication technology plays an essential role in connecting devices such\
    \ as the\nsensor in the IoT environment. However, these devices face authentication\
    \ issues that affect\ncomputational costs, communication overheads, and robustness\
    \ [17]. To mitigate these is-\nsues, blockchain technology offers conﬁdentiality,\
    \ integrity, and availability in IoT-enabled\nsmart devices.\nSeveral researchers\
    \ discussed the security challenges in a smart city context. In [18],\nthe author\
    \ aimed to enhance the data collection and processing in smart city governance.\n\
    Therefore, they introduced a hybrid consortium blockchain framework that encourages\n\
    public engagement in the decision-making process. The proposed approach can tackle\n\
    the collusion attacks from the public veriﬁer’s group. Further, they offered a\
    \ Stackelberg-\ngame-based approach to enable persistent public participation\
    \ in the transaction validation\nprocess. The work in [19] proposed an IoT–fog–cloud\
    \ integrated approach with the inter-\nplanetary ﬁle system (IPFS)-based blockchain\
    \ for IoT-driven smart cities. They presented a\nsecure framework based on two-level\
    \ privacy and an intrusion detection scheme. The ﬁrst\nscheme incorporated a blockchain\
    \ module to secure the IoT information and proposed a\ndimensionality reduction\
    \ technique that transits raw IoT data in a new shape. They applied\na gradient\
    \ boosting anomaly detector approach for intrusion detection. Their results show\n\
    that their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-score,\
    \ and precision\ncompared with the conventional intrusion detection scheme. Further,\
    \ Rahman et al. [20]\nincorporated blockchain with the IoT infrastructure and\
    \ proposed an MEC-enabled sharing\neconomy system for mega smart cities. They\
    \ utilized smart contracts for decentralized\nmessaging services and stored IoT\
    \ data in a decentralized repository via edge networks.\n1.1.4. Smart Vehicles\n\
    To establish V2V communication, vehicles must quickly send the vehicular informa-\n\
    tion, comprising number of pedestrians, road conditions, number of vehicles, and\
    \ their\nconditions, to reduce the number of road accidents and enhance road safety.\
    \ However,\nthe scalability of V2V communication increases the security, safety,\
    \ reliability, and trust\nissues of vehicular network users. Therefore, there\
    \ is a requirement for a prominent solu-\ntion to overcome these issues. Blockchain\
    \ is used to manage the ground truth of vehicle\ninformation and offers data authentication\
    \ among vehicles. Many researchers recently\nfocused on blockchain technology\
    \ for V2V communication. Chattaraj et al. [21] integrated\nblockchain with IoT-driven\
    \ smart devices that improve customer safety, ease congestion,\nand pollution\
    \ reduction. For that, they proposed a certiﬁcateless key agreement protocol for\n\
    Internet of vehicles in a smart transportation context (Block-CLAP). The proposed\
    \ scheme\noutperforms the precedent authentication schemes’ security, communication,\
    \ and computa-\ntional overheads.\nFurthermore, Xia et al. [22] integrated blockchain\
    \ with the Internet of vehicles (BIoV)\nand proposed a novel V2V electricity trading\
    \ approach using Bayesian game pricing. They\nutilized a Bayesian game that predicted\
    \ the price in the distributed BIoV with incomplete\ninformation-sharing. In the\
    \ pricing game approach, they applied smart contracts that\nprovide security,\
    \ trust, and reliability for electricity transactions. The results reveal that\
    \ the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n5 of 26\nproposed scheme reduces communication overhead\
    \ and time complexity in the decentral-\nized IoVs compared to the static game.\
    \ Then, in [23], the authors incorporated a blockchain\nnetwork with the vehicles\
    \ that stores real-time information about vehicles, such as relaying,\ntransmitting,\
    \ and receiving data. As a result, the adopted scheme is able to block malicious\n\
    or unauthorized vehicles from participation. Finally, they considered network\
    \ parameters,\nsuch as throughput and error rate analysis (i.e., bit error rate)\
    \ to evaluate their proposed\nscheme. They proved the proposed scheme’s efﬁciency\
    \ and effectiveness by enhancing\nthroughput by 3 bps and decreasing BER by 2\
    \ dB.\n1.1.5. Smart Grid\nA smart grid is introduced to meet people’s higher electricity\
    \ needs and optimize\nresource allocation. The smart grid makes better decisions\
    \ about power and energy-sharing\ndata. It supports management approaches for\
    \ peak energy demand and also reduces energy\nconsumption by exchanging the data\
    \ of energy feedback and power consumption [24].\nHowever, due to the possibility\
    \ of malicious access during information exchange over the\ninsecure communication\
    \ network, multiple entities are unwilling to convey their informa-\ntion to protect\
    \ their data privacy. Moreover, there are various types of cyberattacks in smart\n\
    grid systems, such as session hijacking, nonrepudiation, denial-of-service (DoS),\
    \ ﬂooding,\nspooﬁng, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack [25]. To overcome the\
    \ security and privacy\nissues, smart technology is required that provides trust,\
    \ reliability, and data-sharing secu-\nrity. Many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ as a solution to secure the smart grid. For instance,\nthe authors of [26] presented\
    \ a secure and reliable data exchange scheme by utilizing\nthe processing mode.\
    \ The proposed scheme provides transparency and auditability of\nenergy production,\
    \ pricing, and services in smart grids. They utilized smart contracts to\nauthenticate\
    \ and track the data ﬂow between different blockchain members. Additionally,\n\
    they incorporated a distributed ledger that provides an immutable and transparent\
    \ data\nusage record. As a result, their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of\
    \ payoffs compared\nwith baseline works. Further, Hao et al. [27] focused on the\
    \ efﬁciency and privacy issue in\nthe current electricity trading scheme. Therefore,\
    \ they analyzed a decentralized scheme of\npeer-to-peer electricity trading by\
    \ introducing smart meters. They utilized a blockchain\nwallet for transactions\
    \ and a smart contract to initiate the transmission switch instructions.\nThe\
    \ results revealed that the proposed scheme reduces the cost and latency. Furthermore,\n\
    they offered fast and privacy-aware roaming to prove the proposed scheme’s feasibility\n\
    and efﬁciency.\n1.1.6. Smart Agriculture\nIn the world, agriculture is the largest\
    \ sector of economic activity. With an increasing\nworld population, there is\
    \ a requirement to increase agricultural productivity by adopt-\ning smart technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, robotics, UAV communication, AI, etc., to enhance\nthe quality\
    \ and quantity of agricultural products with minimum human labor. Existing\nwireless\
    \ standards such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Narrowband IoT\n\
    (NB-IoT), and WiMAX are used for pesticide detection, soil sensing, smart irrigation,\
    \ crop\nrecommendations, and plant protection. They prevent forest ﬁres and offer\
    \ safety to crops\nfrom pests [28]. However, the aforementioned technologies face\
    \ an issue when a consid-\nerable amount of agricultural data is accumulated in\
    \ real-time. In addition, population\ngrowth and environmental effects such as\
    \ climate change, temperature, rainfall, etc., af-\nfect the agriculture system.\
    \ Therefore, emerging 6G wireless communication technology\nand its speciﬁc application\
    \ scenarios are introduced in agriculture, providing intelligent,\nunmanned, and\
    \ automatic agricultural production and cultivation by offering high-speed\nconnectivity\
    \ between smart devices.\nSmart agriculture systems require transparency and commercial\
    \ security for the food\ndata [29]. Therefore, many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ technology in the agricultural ﬁeld\nto provide security, reliability, transparency,\
    \ and privacy of agricultural data. For example,\nVangala et al. [30] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based smart contract that includes a key agree-\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n6 of 26\nment approach to mitigate the risk of data integrity attacks\
    \ in smart farming systems. Their\nproposed scheme utilizes a robust authentication\
    \ method between two IoT devices. Simi-\nlarly, another authentication phase is\
    \ utilized between an IoT device and the gateway node\nto offer endogenous security.\
    \ Furthermore, they proposed a hybrid blockchain to store the\ntrading transactions\
    \ between different components of the agriculture ecosystem, pesticide\nusage,\
    \ and quality and quantity of fertilizers. The results revealed that the adopted\
    \ scheme\noutperforms in terms of computational time compared to the existing\
    \ authentication proto-\ncols. Then, Yang et al. [31] focused on centralized,\
    \ opaque, and untrustworthy data storage\nissues for horticulture products. To\
    \ overcome the aforementioned issues, they introduced\na traceability system (e.g.,\
    \ on- and off-chain traceability) using a dual storage within the\nblockchain.\
    \ They utilized cryptography-based elliptic curves with blockchain for safe data\n\
    sharing. Moreover, they proposed a reputation-based smart contract to upload traceability\n\
    information from the node. Their simulation results enhance efﬁciency and guarantee\
    \ the\nagriculture data’s reliability, security, and authenticity.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the aforesaid applications require superlative care from criminal activi-\n\
    ties, natural calamities (e.g., ﬁre, earthquake, etc.), terrorist attacks, and\
    \ riots. For example,\nif a person driving a smart vehicle meets with a road accident,\
    \ it can use V2V communica-\ntion to share this information with the emergency\
    \ medical response team. Similarly, UAV\ncommunication can assist V2V communication\
    \ in sharing this information with nearby hos-\npitals to provide emergency medical\
    \ care. Another scenario is where smart manufacturing\nrequires on-site maintenance\
    \ to clean and repair various critical equipment of the manu-\nfacturing organization.\
    \ This is challenging for a person to perform on-site maintenance\nbecause the\
    \ manufacturing vessels and equipment are highly hazardous (i.e., radioactive)\n\
    to human health. Further, a criminal attempt to commit a crime (e.g., stealing,\
    \ murder,\nkidnapping, etc.) in the smart city must be captured under the jurisdiction.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe government and local organizations must offer an emergency response,\
    \ disaster risk\nmanagement, and criminal investigation teams under the umbrella\
    \ of public safety applica-\ntions to protect the wellbeing of the nation’s citizens\
    \ who are using the abovementioned\napplications. However, it is observed from\
    \ the literature review that public safety applica-\ntions are highly insecure\
    \ from the perspective of security and privacy. These applications\nstill use\
    \ legacy software and tools and utilize a centralized repository for data storage\
    \ that\nthe attackers can lure. Moreover, as these applications are mission-critical,\
    \ they require\nlow latency and high data rate communication to offer proactive\
    \ services; however, many\npublic safety applications still use traditional network\
    \ interfaces (e.g., 3G and 4G) that\ndegrade their performance.\n1.2. Motivation\n\
    The motivation behind this work is given as follows.\n•\nMost of the existing\
    \ literature focuses on the role of blockchain in 6G-based appli-\ncations; however,\
    \ there are a few research articles available in which the authors\nstudied the\
    \ drivers, enablers, security requirements, and applicability of blockchain in\n\
    6G-based smart applications.\n•\nFrom the literature review, we observed that\
    \ no comprehensive work exists that\nconsiders the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of IoT-based public safety applications\nusing blockchain technology.\n•\nThus,\
    \ there is a stringent requirement to provide exhaustive work on the applicability\n\
    of blockchain in IoT-based public safety applications underlying a 6G network.\n\
    1.3. Research Contributions\nThis article presents the role of the blockchain\
    \ in a 6G-based IoT-enabled public safety\napplication. We also emphasize how\
    \ blockchain provides security and privacy in 6G\nservices. Moreover, the paper\
    \ shows the amalgamation of blockchain in 6G communication\nnetworks to strengthen\
    \ the security and communication of public safety applications. Based\non that,\
    \ the following are the signiﬁcant contributions of this research article.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969\n7 of 26\n•\nThrough this article, we propose a detailed work\
    \ on the applicability of blockchain\nin a 6G network. We also analyze the 6G-based\
    \ smart applications and discuss how\nblockchain features provide trust, security,\
    \ authenticity, conﬁdentiality, and privacy.\n•\nWe explore different 6G-network-based\
    \ services and discuss the inﬂuence of blockchain\nin delivering 6G-based services\
    \ to various smart applications.\n•\nWe consider a blockchain- and 6G-based case\
    \ study for public safety applications to\nshowcase the adoption of blockchain\
    \ technology in the 6G network interface. Further,\nthe case study is assessed\
    \ by considering blockchain scalability, 6G latency, and AI\nstatistical measures\
    \ parameters.\n•\nLastly, we perform an in-depth analysis and identify the research\
    \ challenges of the\nadoption of blockchain in the 6G network to motivate the\
    \ researchers working on the\nsame domain.\n2. Related Works\nIn the previous\
    \ section, we discussed various blockchain-based 6G applications such\nas smart\
    \ healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, smart manufacturing, etc. After study-\n\
    ing these real-world applications in detail, we identiﬁed that public safety is\
    \ an essential\ndomain that requires more security attention. Various researchers\
    \ consider public safety\napplications and offered security and privacy approaches\
    \ for road safety, criminal activity\nmonitoring, on-site safety, etc. They deal\
    \ with data security, person authentication, infor-\nmation conﬁdentiality, and\
    \ integrity issues. For example, Ihinosen et al. [32] addressed the\ndynamic ridesharing\
    \ issue in public transport systems. They proposed GPS tracking and a\ntwo-way\
    \ rating system using the mobile application’s facial recognition module.\nIn\
    \ the aforementioned work, the researchers incorporated different security mech-\n\
    anisms using mobile applications and cryptographic primitives. However, they are\
    \ yet\nto consider data consistency, traceability, and scalability. Therefore,\
    \ Xu et al. [33] uti-\nlized various technologies such as blockchain, IoT, edge,\
    \ fog, and cloud computing for\nsmart public safety. They proposed the BLockchain-ENabled\
    \ Decentralized Microservices\nArchitecture for Smart public safety, named BlendMAS,\
    \ scheme that offers security and\ndata access control for the public safety system.\
    \ Then, in [34], Fitwi et al. worked on the\nsafety and security of video surveillance\
    \ systems. They proposed edge computing and a\nsmart-contract-based lightweight\
    \ privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme that identiﬁes the\nfugitives using their\
    \ facial features. Makhdoom et al. [35] proposed a smart-contract-based\ncollaborative\
    \ intrusion detection system that prevents cyberattack and data theft. Their\n\
    proposed scheme manages the trust between the nodes and prevents the input false\
    \ attack\nin the IDS.\nFurthermore, Wu et al. [36] focused on the on-site safety\
    \ issue due to the equipment\ndefects and environmental hazards for tower crane\
    \ safety management. They proposed\na blockchain-based framework utilizing Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric that offers security and au-\nthenticity with trust at the construction\
    \ site. Moreover, Yu et al. [37] addressed data\nvulnerability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ privacy, and the centralized key storage issue of the IIoT data\nstorage applications.\
    \ To overcome this problem, they proposed a Shamir threshold cryp-\ntography scheme\
    \ with blockchain called STCChain that offers availability, accountability,\n\
    and integrity of the data. Then, Na et al. [38] proposed a blockchain-enabled\
    \ access control\nscheme using multisignature that protects autonomous vehicle\
    \ data. They collected and\nstored vehicle data using a dashboard camera and global\
    \ positioning system. Their ﬁndings\nshowed that the proposed scheme offers data\
    \ privacy and security with lower veriﬁcation\ntime and latency. Table 1 shows\
    \ the comparative analysis of existing works for public safety\napplications by\
    \ incorporating security, 6G network with their objective, pros, and cons.\nFrom\
    \ the overall study, we observed that many researchers carried out a lot of research\n\
    work in the security ﬁeld for smart public safety applications. In most papers,\
    \ the research\ncommunity focuses on the role of different security approaches,\
    \ such as cryptographic and\nmobile applications. However, very few of them incorporated\
    \ blockchain-based security in\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n8 of 26\npublic safety\
    \ applications. Therefore, we included a blockchain-based security approach\n\
    using 6G wireless communication in the public safety application domain.\nTable\

    \ of the research article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature\n\
    review of the state-of-the-art works. Section 3 presents blockchain-based 6G services\
    \ such\nas network slicing, spectrum sharing, data sharing, and resource management.\
    \ In Section 4,\nwe proposed layer-wise architecture for IoT-based public safety\
    \ application. Section 5\ndiscusses the results and analysis of the proposed case\
    \ study. Then, we discuss various\nchallenges of the adoption of blockchain in\
    \ 6G network in Section 6. Finally, Section 7\nprovides the conclusion.\n3. Role\
    \ of Blockchain in 6G Services\nThis section provides insights on the 6G-based\
    \ smart services, such as network slicing,\nspectrum sharing, resource management,\
    \ and data sharing. Table 2 shows the comparative\nstudy on blockchain-based existing\
    \ 6G services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n9 of 26\n3.1. Network Slicing\nNetwork\
    \ slicing allows to create different virtual networks, where each network\nposes\
    \ different network services from the physical networks infrastructure. This is\
    \ made\npossible by integrating technologies, such as software-deﬁned network\
    \ (SDN) and network\nfunctions virtualization (NFV), that divide single network\
    \ connections into multiple distinct\nvirtual connections. It delivers virtual\
    \ applications that are directly deployed on the\nslice for instant service delivery\
    \ to the users. As an outcome, mobile applications that\nare running on slices\
    \ have large-scale connections and low-latency services with a high-\nquality\
    \ user experience. Network slices reduce the network complexity by virtualization\n\
    and add automation to a complex network. However, it faces issues in dynamic slice\n\
    creation, resource sharing, wireless resource virtualization, and data security.\
    \ To mitigate\nthe aforementioned issues, blockchain is integrated with network\
    \ slicing to provide user\ntrust, transparency, and privacy. Many researchers\
    \ integrate blockchain as a service in\nnetwork slicing. For example, Abdulqadder\
    \ et al. [39] focused on user authentication,\nload imbalance, and inappropriate\
    \ network slicing issues in an edge-assisted 6G network.\nInitially, they designed\
    \ a deep-learning-based adversarial network that predicts the efﬁcient\nnetwork\
    \ slices and communication links based on the slice capacity, priority, and quality-of-\n\
    service (QoS) demands for data transmission. Further, they applied DAG-based blockchain\n\
    using the proof-of-space approach to enhance the scalability and overcome more\
    \ resource\nconsumption issues. Moreover, they introduced a soft actor–critic\
    \ scheme for load balancing\nin the SDN controller. Finally, the paper concluded\
    \ that the adopted scheme reduces\nhandover latency, packet loss rate, and data\
    \ transmission delay and enhances the system\nthroughput and different attack\
    \ detection rate.\nHe et al. in [40] integrated a multidomain network slice orchestration\
    \ framework with\na blockchain-based CoNet consensus algorithm for data consistency,\
    \ scalability, and security.\nFurther, they proposed a game-theory-based bilateral\
    \ evaluation approach that provides\nsystem fairness with a QoS guarantee. The\
    \ ﬁndings showed that the adopted scheme\nprovides users’ data security and privacy\
    \ with high throughput and low latency. Then,\nChen et al. [41] formulated a blockchain-based\
    \ optical network slicing scheme for IoT\napplications. They focused on the users’\
    \ data security and trust issues while they utilized\nIoT services. The results\
    \ showed that their presented scheme is able to complete slicing\ntransactions\
    \ with a high-quality dedicated communication network.\n3.2. Spectrum Sharing\n\
    The explosive growth of bandwidth-intensive Internet applications such as live\
    \ audio\nand video streaming, web conferencing, big data processing, etc., requires\
    \ high-speed\nnetwork access with a higher frequency spectrum. The 6G wireless\
    \ technology provides\nhigh-speed network access with ultra-reliable low-latency\
    \ communication (URLLC) using\na higher-frequency spectrum [42]. However, it also\
    \ increases congestion and interference in\nthe communication network. To overcome\
    \ this issue, it is required to share the spectrum\nproperly that enhances communication\
    \ capacity and spectrum efﬁciency. Spectrum sharing\naims to efﬁciently use scarce\
    \ natural resources to ensure fairness between mobile users.\nThere are two types\
    \ of methods for spectrum sharing: static and dynamic spectrum sharing.\nOut of\
    \ these two spectrum-sharing mechanisms, dynamic spectrum sharing is the most\n\
    adopted method; it provides feasible, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient spectrum management\
    \ based on\ncognitive radio technology [43,44]. The variety of spectrum bands\
    \ and the rivalry between\ndifferent mobile network operators are the challenges\
    \ in the 6G spectrum sharing. Af-\nter lots of research, many solutions were proposed\
    \ in [45,46] for efﬁcient spectrum sharing;\nhowever, the solutions that address\
    \ the spectrum scarcity problem face issues such as single\npoint of failure,\
    \ malicious activity from unauthorized users, and security concerns.\nTo mitigate\
    \ the aforementioned issue, many researchers incorporate blockchain with\n6G technology,\
    \ which improves security and system performance [47]. For example,\nLiu et al.\
    \ [48] integrated AI with blockchain for radio spectrum resource allocation in\n\
    6G-based enhanced URLLC service. They focused on resource scheduling, classiﬁcation,\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n10 of 26\nand neural network optimization issues between\
    \ IoT devices. For that, they proposed a re-\ninforcement learning approach with\
    \ a blockchain-integrated hybrid cloud. Their presented\nscheme uses uniﬁed coding\
    \ and identiﬁcation standards to build a public management\nplatform to register\
    \ and manage IoT device information. The ﬁndings reveal that the\nadopted scheme\
    \ effectively increases spectrum utilization with security and reliability.\n\
    Further, in [49], the authors presented a blockchain-based user-autonomy spectrum-sharing\n\
    framework that efﬁciently manages the heterogeneous devices of the IoT network.\
    \ They\ndesigned a swarm intelligence approach and a dynamic tip selection algorithm\
    \ to enhance\nthe system and global utility. The simulation results revealed that\
    \ the proposed scheme\nminimizes the average waiting time of transactions and\
    \ power consumption. Moreover, it\nenhances global utility, throughput, and spectral\
    \ efﬁciency. Then, Manogaran et al. [50]\npresented a blockchain-based security\
    \ solution for access control and preserving the data\nprivacy of users’ resources.\
    \ Furthermore, they introduced a Q-learning approach with\nmachine-type communication\
    \ (MTC) that enhanced the performance in the 6G environ-\nment. Compared to the\
    \ existing schemes, their proposed scheme outperformed in terms of\nthe success\
    \ ratio, access time modiﬁcation, time complexity, and memory utilization.\n3.3.\
    \ Data Sharing\nThe 6G-based smart applications such as UAV communication, aerial\
    \ base stations,\nsatellite communication, V2V communication, etc., offer real-time\
    \ data-sharing features\nover the Internet through a mobile communication network.\
    \ Moreover, an increasing\nnumber of social media applications, such as Twitter,\
    \ Facebook, Instagram, etc., and web\nconferencing applications, such as Webex,\
    \ Google Meet, Zoom, etc., require content delivery\nin real-time. These applications\
    \ generate a colossal amount of audio, video, text, and image\ndata. To control\
    \ and share a large scale of data requires an efﬁcient data-sharing scheme\nthat\
    \ overcomes data leakage and security threats. Decentralized blockchain technology\n\
    offers traceability, security, privacy, tamper-resistance, transparency, and immutability\
    \ to\nhandle data-sharing issues in the 6G network. Khowaja et al., in [51], aimed\
    \ to offer a secure\nand reliable data-exchange scheme using a private blockchain,\
    \ i.e., Hyperledger Fabric\nfor vehicular networks. Additionally, they developed\
    \ a deep-learning-based autoencoder\nsegmentation approach that gathers the vehicles\
    \ based on their similarity. The proposed\ndata-sharing scheme achieved better\
    \ throughput, CPU utilization, efﬁciency, applicability,\ncomputational overhead,\
    \ and time complexity.\nFurther, Zhang et al. [52] combined permissioned blockchain\
    \ with federated learning\n(FL) and proposed a channel-based distributed data-sharing\
    \ scheme for data sharing and\npreserving the privacy of the user. Moreover, they\
    \ proposed a data storage scheme using on-\nand off-chain data storage for authenticating\
    \ identity, data, and transactions. The adopted\nscheme enhanced data sharing\
    \ and security, improved data model quality, and prevented\nmalicious attacks.\
    \ Then, in [53], the authors proposed a concrete access control mechanism\nfor\
    \ vehicular communication (vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)). For that, they integrated\n\
    blockchain with ciphertext-enabled attribute encryption (CP-ABE) for user and\
    \ data storage\nidentity management. Further, they enhanced the security mechanism\
    \ and designed the\nadvanced attributed algorithm that minimizes the lightweight\
    \ device’s computational\npressure in VANET. The ﬁndings show that the proposed\
    \ scheme provides effective data\nsecurity with low performance overhead.\n3.4.\
    \ Resource Management\nThe most important service in a 6G wireless communication\
    \ system is utilizing various\nmobile resources such as memory, bandwidth, power,\
    \ and channel. However, managing\nthese resources and fulﬁlling user demands,\
    \ such as on-demand service and real-time visi-\nbility, is critical. Moreover,\
    \ an increasing number of smart applications, such as smart cities,\nsmart homes,\
    \ e-healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, autonomous vehicle, holographic\n\
    communication, etc., require real-time access to various resources. Therefore,\
    \ resource uti-\nlization, allocation, and management are required based on user\
    \ needs. Many researchers\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n11 of 26\nhave proposed efﬁcient\
    \ and optimal resource allocation schemes [54–57]; however, these\nschemes are\
    \ centralized, where a single authority veriﬁes the user and allocates resources\n\
    as per their need. They face various security threats, such as user identity,\
    \ information\nconﬁdentiality, malicious attacks, and a single point of failure.\
    \ Blockchain is considered to\nbe a promising technology to address the abovementioned\
    \ issues. For example, Li et al.,\nin [58], integrated blockchain with MEC-based\
    \ IoT applications to enhance the performance\nof network attributes and ensure\
    \ data-sharing authenticity. They presented the cloud–edge\ncollaborative resource\
    \ allocation mechanism by introducing a collective reinforcement\nlearning (CRL)\
    \ scheme. The authors jointly optimized the data ofﬂoading, blockchain node\n\
    intervals, and transmit power to enhance the energy efﬁciency of the proposed\
    \ scheme.\nIn [59], the authors incorporated blockchain technology with the Internet\
    \ of Every-\nthing (IoE) applications. They proposed a blockchain-enabled metaheuristic\
    \ approach\nfor resource allocation in a cyber twin-driven 6G-IoE environment.\
    \ Additionally, they\ndesigned an optimal resource allocation algorithm using\
    \ graph clustering based on a quasi-\noppositional search and rescue optimization\
    \ approach. Their ﬁndings showed that the\nproposed work reduced average system\
    \ cost to 2.63 and power consumption to 0.012 mW\ncompared to the predeﬁned work.\
    \ Further, Yang et al. [60] intended to optimize the In-\ndustrial IoT device’s\
    \ energy allocation by reducing energy consumption and computation\noverhead.\
    \ Therefore, they incorporated blockchain with IIoT systems and proposed a deep\n\
    Q-learning (DQL)-enabled optimization framework that ensures data security and\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency. Finally, the proposed scheme is compared with existing approaches,\
    \ and it\nperforms better in terms of the computation overhead and weighted cost.\n\

    \ for Public\nSafety Application\nThis section shows the working of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which is AI-, blockchain-,\nand 6G-based secure UAV communication\
    \ for public safety scenarios such as ﬁre incidents,\nroad accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity. Figure 2 shows ﬁve layers of the proposed architecture,\ni.e., data,\
    \ intelligence, blockchain, application, and communication layers. The working\
    \ of\neach layer is discussed as follows.\nFire incident\nRoad accident\nCriminal\

    13 of 26\n4.1. Data Layer\nIn this layer, we considered different emergency services,\
    \ such as ﬁre incidents, road\naccidents, and criminal activity, which require\
    \ faster communication to deliver sensitive\ninformation (e.g., road accidents\
    \ and medical emergencies) to the entities of the applica-\ntion layers. Here,\
    \ UAVs are incorporated to monitor the abovementioned scenarios and\ncollect data\
    \ from them to assist in making a decisive decision for different public safety\n\
    applications. For instance, if a criminal attempts to perform a crime at a particular\
    \ location,\nthe UAVs collect the data from the location and forward it to the\
    \ nearby police station.\nHowever, the criminal can hire an attacker to perform\
    \ adversarial attacks on the collected\ndata to avoid legal protection. An attacker\
    \ can perform different network-related attacks to\nexploit the crime data stored\
    \ in the central repository of police stations. Therefore, there is a\nrequirement\
    \ for an intelligent and automated approach that can seamlessly detect nefarious\n\
    patterns in the network and eradicate it from the public safety environment.\n\
    4.2. Intelligence Layer\nIn this layer, we apply different machine learning (ML)\
    \ classiﬁers that classify the data\ninto attack and nonattack categories. As\
    \ discussed in the data layer, UAVs collect data from\nvarious application scenarios\
    \ and store that data in comma-separated value (CSV) ﬁles.\nThe feature space\
    \ of the dataset is discussed as follows.\n4.2.1. Dataset Description\nIn that\
    \ direction, ﬁrst, we collect the criminal activity dataset from the Kaggle [61]\n\
    that classiﬁes the data into attack and nonattack from the criminal’s behavior.\
    \ However,\nthe collected dataset is not enough to identify the attack or nonattack\
    \ category; therefore, we\naccumulate more data from different sources having\
    \ relevant criminal activity information.\nThe ﬁnal dataset Ψ consists of different\
    \ attributes such as location, crime type, weapon type,\na weapon used or not,\
    \ etc. It has n rows, a1, a2, a3, . . . , an and m columns, b1, b2, b3, . . .\
    \ , bm.\na1, a2, a3, . . . , an ∈ Ψ\n(1)\nb1, b2, b3, . . . , bn ∈ Ψ\n(2)\nwhere\
    \ n is the total count of row 1575 and m is the total count of column 9. The collected\n\
    dataset is stored in the comma-separated values (CSV) ﬁle and further passed to\
    \ the next\nlayer, which is the intelligence layer. Here, there is a risk of data\
    \ modiﬁcation on the judicial\ndata collected from the aforementioned critical\
    \ application scenarios. Therefore, there is a\nneed for data security that protects\
    \ sensitive data from malicious threats.\n4.2.2. ML Classiﬁcation Approach\nThe\
    \ CSV ﬁle has missing values, noise, and unmanaged data columns that affect the\n\
    performance of the ML classiﬁer. To overcome this issue, we replace the missing\
    \ value\nwith central tendency, i.e., mean value. Further, the dataset has numeric\
    \ and textual values\n(alphanumeric), such as location, crime, and weapon types;\
    \ therefore, there is a need to\nconvert nonnumerical data into numeric data.\
    \ We apply the label-encoding technique Le\nthat assigns a numerical value to\
    \ each categorical value.\n∀b3, b4, b5\napply\n−−−→ Le ∈ Ψ\n(3)\nAfter reading\
    \ the CSV ﬁle, we realize that the dataset attributes have different datatype\n\
    D, such as an object, int, and ﬂoat. However, certain ML classiﬁers do not recognize\n\
    attributes with object datatype. To overcome this issue, we change the datatype\
    \ from\nﬂoating to the int using the astype() function.\n∀b7, b8\nchange\n−−−−→\
    \ D\n(4)\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n14 of 26\nThen, we analyze outliers that corrupt\
    \ the dataset and mislead the ML classiﬁers for\nthe wrong classiﬁcation. For\
    \ that, we apply outlier detection techniques that normalize\nthe data using a\
    \ standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or\nlosing\
    \ information. Various normalization approaches exist, such as min-max, standard-\n\
    ization scaling, and Z-score. Here, we apply the min-max method that is mathematically\n\
    represented as follows.\nϑ\n′ =\nϑ − ϑmin\nϑmax − ϑmin\n(5)\nThis normalization\
    \ technique obtains all the scaled data into the range of 0 to 1.\nAfter preprocessing\
    \ the data, we split the data into two classes, training and testing, where\n\
    we train 80% of the data and validate 20% of the data. We pass the training dataset\
    \ (ΨT1)\ninto the ML classiﬁer that classiﬁes the data into attack (1) and nonattack\
    \ (0) categories.\nΨT1\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n−−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(6)\nAfter\
    \ training the model, we feed the testing dataset (ΨT2) into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that\nvalidates the results based on the ΨT1.\nΨT2\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n\
    −−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(7)\nHere, we applied different ML classiﬁers, such as XGBoost,\
    \ random forest (RF), k-\nnearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and\
    \ support vector machine (SVM),\nthat classify the data into attack and nonattack.\
    \ Among all these classiﬁers, we obtained\nthe best results in terms of the accuracy\
    \ and log loss score from the XGBoost algorithm.\nThe XGBoost classiﬁer gives\
    \ effective results with the larger dataset. In this classiﬁer,\nthe data are\
    \ considered for each tree, and we can increase the depth of the tree and decrease\n\
    the min_child_weight that handles the overﬁtting issue in the dataset. The classiﬁed\
    \ data\nare susceptible, which raises the security issue in a public safety application.\
    \ To overcome\nthis issue, we utilize the IPFS-based blockchain network that offers\
    \ the data’s authentication\nand conﬁdentiality, preventing fraud on the dataset.\n\
    4.3. Blockchain Layer\nBlockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology\
    \ that keeps immutable\nrecords of transactions. This layer provides security\
    \ to the classiﬁed data by storing them in\na shared and transparent ledger that\
    \ is only accessible to the authorized network members.\nHere, the data are recorded\
    \ as a block in a blockchain network through the smart contract\n(Sc). Here, a\
    \ smart contract is an agreement between the contract creator and recipient that\n\
    executes automatically when all parties can be sure of the conclusion [10]. Then,\
    \ to provide\na reliable connection between contract and storage, there is an\
    \ interplanetary ﬁle system\n(IPFS) that offers efﬁcient storage and is able to\
    \ share a large ﬁle.\ndata\npass\n−−→ Sc\n(8)\nSc\nStoredata\n−−−−−→ I f\n(9)\n\
    where I f is an IPFS ﬁle system that utilizes content-addressing that uniquely\
    \ retrieves\neach ﬁle in the blockchain network. It stores the data in the blockchain\
    \ network using a\ndistributed hash table (HT). Each stored ﬁle is allocated a\
    \ unique hash value according to\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n15 of 26\nthe content\
    \ of the ﬁle. The mathematical representation of the aforementioned entity is\n\
    as follows.\nI f\ngenerate\n−−−−→ {H1, H1, . . . , Hn} store\n−−→ HT\n(10)\nHT\n\
    add\n−−→ {Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\n(11)\n{Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\
    \ ∈ Blockchainn\n(12)\nHere, different authorized users such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority, and po-\nlice retrieve the secure data.\n4.4. Application\
    \ Layer\nThis layer includes different authorities such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority,\nand police for ﬁre incidents, road accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity, respectively. This\nauthority uses the classiﬁed data for further\
    \ analysis, prediction, and research purposes.\nFor the proposed architecture,\
    \ we considered a criminal behavior dataset that has the crime\nlocation, crime\
    \ type, weapon used, weapon type, etc., attributes that classify the data into\n\
    attack (class 1) or nonattack (class 0). These data will be stored in the IPFS-based\
    \ blockchain.\nFrom that, the police department or any government-regularized\
    \ authority can access\nthe data securely. The advantage of this layer is that\
    \ the public safety regulatory body\n(e.g., emergency response team) acquires\
    \ the attack-free data. This is because the proposed\narchitecture prohibits any\
    \ data injection attacks on secure data storage (blockchain); even if\nthe attackers\
    \ perform any attack on the data storage, it will be known by each blockchain\n\
    participant due to the transparency features of the blockchain technology. Thus,\
    \ the\nproposed architecture offers robust security and reliable communication\
    \ for IoT-based\npublic safety applications.\n4.5. Communication Layer\nThis layer\
    \ comprises the relation between all four layers. We collected criminal\nactivity\
    \ data from the data layer that are further passed to the intelligence layer.\
    \ The data\nwere preprocessed in the intelligence layer and fed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that classiﬁes\nthem into the attack and nonattack classes. The classiﬁed data\
    \ are sensitive to security\nthreats and require immutable and secure storage.\
    \ For that, we store those data in the\ndecentralized and secure IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ layer. In the application layer, authorized\nusers, such as employees from the\
    \ ﬁre department, hospital, and police, access the data\nusing their smartphones,\
    \ tablet, laptop, or other 6G-based gadgets. They all need a strong\ncommunication\
    \ channel with a high data rate and low latency with secure and relevant\ndata\
    \ analysis. Moreover, the data layer to the blockchain layer is synchronized using\
    \ a\npipeline via the 6G network interface. Here, the data coming from the blockchain\
    \ layer\nare ﬁrst converted into the digital signal using a Bernoulli binary digital\
    \ converter and\nthen forwarded into a transmitter block. Here, for the simulation,\
    \ we considered MATLAB-\nbased 5G toolbox that offers certain parameters, such\
    \ as frequency range, modulation\ntechniques, channel impairments, sub-carrier\
    \ spacing, and bandwidth. By modifying these\nparameters, we can mimic the behavior\
    \ of 5G interface to 6G interface. We used a frequency\nrange of 75–110 GHz (operational\
    \ frequency—95 GHz) which is a potential frequency\nrange for beyond 5G speciﬁed\
    \ by the [62], sub-carrier spacing of 240 KHz, and modulation\nwas orthogonal\
    \ frequency division multiplexing (OFDMA), with polar coding for error\ndetection\
    \ and correction. The main aim is not to simulate the 6G network for the speciﬁed\n\
    problem formulation but to use essential properties of the 6G network. This is\
    \ because\nthe 6G simulation is not yet open-sourced by the scientiﬁc community;\
    \ therefore, we have\nto rely on a 5G simulation setup to impersonate the behavior\
    \ of the 6G network. Here,\nthe 6G network interface takes the stored data from\
    \ the blockchain layer and transmits\nthem to the application layer via a 6G network.\
    \ Thus, data, intelligence, and blockchain\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n16 of 26\n\
    layers cumulatively act as a sender that intends to share the data to the application\
    \ layer\nvia adopting 6G communication for faster and reliable communication.\n\
    5. Result and Discussion\nThis section highlightsexperimentation details and results\
    \ analysis of the proposed\narchitecture in terms of accuracy, log loss score,\
    \ and validation curve.\n5.1. Experimental Setup\nThe proposed architecture utilizes\
    \ a Google Colaboratory notebook for developing\nan intelligence layer that uses\
    \ ML classiﬁers, Remix integrated development environment\n(IDE) for the blockchain\
    \ layer, and MATLAB 2022a for the communication layer. The Google\nColaboratory\
    \ notebook is a web IDE for Python programming that uses various Python\nlibraries\
    \ such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Scipy for the ML classiﬁers.\n\
    To simulate the working of the intelligent layer, we incorporated the Google Colaboratory\n\
    notebook that uses ML classiﬁers and provides the classiﬁcation of the data. Here,\
    \ different\nML classiﬁers, such as XGboost, RF, KNN, LR, and SVM, have hyperparameters\
    \ that tailor\nthe classiﬁers’ behavior and improve performance. Table 3 depicts\
    \ the parameters used in\nthe proposed architecture. Here, n_estimators, learning_rate,\
    \ and max_depth are used for\nthe XGBoost classiﬁer, where n_estimators represents\
    \ the tree’s count. Then, learning_rate is\nused as the regularization parameter\
    \ that shows the step size, and the max_depth parameter\ncontrols the overﬁtting\
    \ in the model. The RF classiﬁer used n_estimators value of 200 and\nmax_depth\
    \ value of 1. Moreover, KNN uses the n_neighbors parameter to show the total\n\
    count of neighbors that are utilizedby default for the k-neighbors queries. Furthermore,\n\
    the uniform weights specify that all points are equally weighted in each neighborhood.\
    \ The\nLR classiﬁer uses random_state that shufﬂes the data and the “lbfgs” solver\
    \ with max_iter\nthat uses the solvers to converge. For the SVM classiﬁer, we\
    \ use different parameters such\nas gamma, probability, and kernel. Here, we use\
    \ rbf and linear kernel with the kernel\ncoefﬁcient value such as gamma = “auto”,\
    \ which means 1/n_f eatures.\nTable 3. Parameters of the proposed architecture.\n\

    \ on the Remix IDE with different functions, such as criminal behaviors()\nto\
    \ identify the criminal, weapon() to determine the crime type, addlocation() to\
    \ know\nthe crime spot, updatecount(), and many more. The smart contract is deployed\
    \ over the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n17 of 26\nRinkeby’s network. On a successful\
    \ compilation and deployment of the smart contract,\nvalidated or authenticated\
    \ data from the smart contract are forwarded to the IPFS-based\npublic blockchain\
    \ for secure storage. Further, the 6G network is simulated on MATLAB\n2022a using\
    \ a 5G toolbox. This is because there is not yet any open-source software available\n\
    that provides 6G properties and can integrate that with real-world applications.\
    \ Due to this\nconstraint, we utilized a 5G-based simulation toolbox, where we\
    \ changed the simulation\nparameters, for example, changing the bandwidth allocation,\
    \ transmit power, sub-carrier\nspacing (240 KHz), and modulation (OFDMA) techniques\
    \ of the 5G network to impersonate\na 6G network.\n5.2. Performance Evaluation\
    \ of the Proposed Architecture\nIn this subsection, we discuss the results of\
    \ the ML classiﬁers, blockchain, and 6G\ncommunication. First, we analyze the\
    \ performance of the different ML classiﬁers, such as\nXGBoost, RF, KNN, LR, and\
    \ SVM, for UAV-based public safety applications such as ﬁre\nincidents, road accidents,\
    \ and criminal activity. Here, ML classiﬁers are used to classify the\ndata into\
    \ attack means class 1 and nonattack means class 0. We considered the criminal\n\
    activity dataset that has the crime type, location, weapon type, and criminal\
    \ behavior\nrecords. These records are useful for classifying the arrest and nonarrest\
    \ categories, which\nidentiﬁes whether the data are vulnerable to attack or not.\
    \ Here, we fed 80% of the data\ninto the ML classiﬁer that provide training to\
    \ the classiﬁer. Then, the 20% testing dataset\nis passed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that validates the training dataset. It also ensures that the\ntrained data\
    \ will behave consistently and produce the expected results.\nHere, Figure 3 depicts\
    \ the performance of the ML classiﬁers in terms of the accuracy,\nlog loss score,\
    \ and validation curve. The accuracy (α) of the ML classiﬁers represents\nthe\
    \ ratio of the correctly predicted values out of a total number of predictions.\
    \ Using an\naccuracy measure, we know how many times the ML classiﬁer correctly\
    \ classiﬁed the\ndataset. We can express accuracy in true positive (Tρ), false\
    \ positive (Fρ), true negative (Tη),\nand false negative (Fη) values that are\
    \ used to represent the number of correct and incorrect\npredictions of the proposed\
    \ ML classiﬁer. During the simulation, we observe that a single\naccuracy parameter\
    \ is insufﬁcient to remark on the best ML classiﬁer. Therefore, we require\nadditional\
    \ measures such as precision (β) and recall (γ). Precision represents the correctness\n\
    of the ML classiﬁer. It determines how good the classiﬁer is at predicting a speciﬁc\
    \ class. It\nshows the ratio between the true positive samples and all the positive\
    \ outcomes Tρ + Fρ.\nThe recall measure represents the count, which shows how\
    \ many times the ML classiﬁer\nwas able to determine a speciﬁc class. It gives\
    \ the ratio between true positive samples out\nof all the cases of true positive\
    \ and false negative samples Tρ + Fη. Furthermore, harmonic\nmean of the precision\
    \ and recall is called F1-score (δ). The mathematical representation of\nthese\
    \ performance measures are represented as follows:\nα =\nTρ + Tη\nTρ + Fρ + Tη\
    \ + Fη\n(13)\nβ =\nTρ\nTρ + Fρ\n(14)\nγ =\nTρ\nTρ + Fη\n(15)\nδ = 2 ∗ β ∗ γ\n\
    β + γ\n(16)\nFigure 3a illustrates the accuracy of the different ML classiﬁers\
    \ such as XGBoost, RF,\nKNN, LR, and SVM. From the graph, we found that XGBoost\
    \ classiﬁer gives better accuracy\n(87.93%) compared to the other classiﬁers because\
    \ it handles sparse data and executes\nparallel computing. On the contrary, SVM\
    \ did not perform well because it required high\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n18 of\
    \ 26\ntraining time for the large dataset. Table 4 shows that the XGBoost classiﬁer\
    \ outperforms\nany other ML classiﬁers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall,\
    \ and F1-score.\nTo further measure the ML classiﬁer’s performance, we used a\
    \ log loss score that\nindicates how close the prediction probability is to the\
    \ corresponding actual value in the\nbinary classiﬁcation case. It represents\
    \ the probabilities of the correct class label, which\nmeans that if the predicted\
    \ probability is high, it will obtain a low log loss core and\nvice versa. Figure\
    \ 3b shows the log loss score of the different ML classiﬁers that evaluate\nthe\
    \ performance of the classiﬁers. From the empirical results, we analyzed that\
    \ there is\na higher divergence in the log loss score of the LR and SVM classiﬁers.\
    \ Here, XGBoost’s\nlog loss score is small; therefore, it performed well compared\
    \ to the other ML classiﬁers.\nAdditionally, Figure 3c depicts the validation\
    \ curve of the XGBoost classiﬁer that indicates\nthe sensitivity between changes\
    \ in a classiﬁer’s accuracy and changes in some parameters\nof the classiﬁer.\
    \ Here, if the training score is more than the validation score, the estimator\
    \ is\noverﬁtting, and otherwise performs well.\nXGBoost\nRF\nKNN\nLR\nSVM\nML\

    \ of the literature we observed does not\namalgamate the mentioned key enabler\
    \ technologies, i.e., blockchain, 6G network, AI,\netc. Their approach is based\
    \ on a single technology, but by using that, there must be a\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n19 of 26\nloophole that exists that the attackers can exploit. Therefore,\
    \ an amalgamation of technology\nis needed to offer a secure pipeline for data\
    \ exchange for critical applications, such as\npublic safety applications. The\
    \ work of [63] is similar to our proposed work with better\naccuracies; however,\
    \ their work is based on an image dataset where they used rigorous\ndata augmentation\
    \ techniques and deep learning approaches to acquire better accuracies.\nBecause\
    \ of data augmentation and deep learning approaches, their proposed model is\n\
    highly complex and does not have a commendable system response time. This is because\n\
    deep learning techniques have a higher training time, due to which the response\
    \ becomes\nhigher; hence, one could not send critical data on time to the application\
    \ layer. This can\nalso be seen in Figure 4a, where performance overhead is compared\
    \ between [63] and the\nproposed work. It is clear from the graph that due to\
    \ the high training time, the work of [63]\nhas a high-performance overhead compared\
    \ to our work. Contrary, the proposed work uses\ntext data where minimal data\
    \ preprocessing steps are required to train ML classiﬁers. This\ncan be seen in\
    \ Figure 4b, where training time is computed for all ML classiﬁers. XGBoost is\n\
    outperforming other classiﬁers by attaining a training time of 280.97 s. In [63],\
    \ the authors\nused 1400 iterations to obtain a better training accuracy, which\
    \ takes longer training time\ncompared to our work.\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\n28\n\

    \ the blockchain scalability comparison between the proposed\nblockchain with\
    \ IPFS and the traditional blockchain. Generally, an IPFS-based blockchain is\n\
    a decentralized protocol and is open to the public; therefore, anyone who has\
    \ content hash\ncan access the network. Moreover, it offers persistent data storage,\
    \ fault tolerance against a\nsingle point of failure, and a censorship resistance\
    \ mechanism. Due to the aforesaid bene-\nﬁts, the IPFS-based blockchain has a\
    \ better response time than the traditional blockchain\n(i.e., not using IPFS).\
    \ In addition, the immutable nature of the IPFS-based blockchain eases\nnumerous\
    \ cybersecurity threats. It has no overheads of the consensus protocols to add\n\
    the data and only stores the content hash in the network. Thus, the consensus\
    \ and data\naggregation with transformation must be applied before submitting\
    \ a block or ﬁle to IPFS\nstorage. Due to this mechanism, the IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ is faster and more scalable than\nthe conventional blockchain network.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the proposed architecture consists of UAVs for data accumulation and\ndissemination\
    \ between different participants of public safety applications. As public\nsafety\
    \ applications are categorized under the umbrella of mission-critical applications,\n\
    they must ensure reliable and low-latency communication among all the entities\
    \ of the\nproposed architecture. Here, 6G networks fulﬁll the requirements essential\
    \ to the proposed\narchitecture. The 6G network offers high data-transmission\
    \ rates, with ultra-low latency\nthat makes it 1000 times faster than 5G networks.\
    \ Therefore, the network’s transmitter and\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n20 of 26\n\
    receiver have the minimum packet loss ratio. Figure 6 shows the packet drop ratio\

    \ of Adoption of Blockchain in 6G Network\nBlockchain technology entrenches data\
    \ security, user identity, information authenticity,\nand privacy mechanisms into\
    \ the 6G communication system. However, poor efﬁciency of\nconsensus mechanism,\
    \ computation overhead of network systems, storage capacity, limited\nnetwork\
    \ and computing resources, and cross-network sharing imposes a new challenge in\n\
    blockchain-based 6G application. This section provides the possible challenges\
    \ of adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network. Figure 7 displays the research challenges\
    \ when adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n21 of 26\n\

    \ Challenges\nFigure 7. Blockchain adoption challenges in 6G network.\n6.1. Storage\
    \ Capacity\nBlockchain offers decentralized architecture with an immutable ledger\
    \ that securely\nstores the data transaction that cannot be tampered or altered.\
    \ Blockchain permanently\nkeeps data in immutable blocks and is not allowed to\
    \ be altered or deleted by anyone; there-\nfore, it keeps increasing data volume\
    \ and raising data storage capacity issues. During peak\ntime, an increasing number\
    \ of users and data transactions ﬂood the network, leading to\ntransaction delays\
    \ and network overloading issues. Moreover, due to a growing demand\nfor data\
    \ storage capacity and bandwidth, nodes cannot synchronize with each other to\n\
    join the network [64]. Various cloud platforms exist, such as IPFS, Merkle tree-based\
    \ ﬁle\nsystems (MTFS), StorJ, swarm, etc., that resolve the data storage issue\
    \ in the blockchain-\nbased 6G network. The research community has adopted these\
    \ data storage platforms\nwith blockchain and proposed solutions in supply chain\
    \ management, smart agriculture,\nsmart city, etc., to resolve storage issues.\
    \ For example, Pawar et al. [65] proposed an\nIPFS-enabled blockchain repository\
    \ for supply chain management to minimize ﬁle upload\nand download time. Kumar\
    \ et al. [66] introduced a secured privacy-preserving scheme to\nmaintain scalability\
    \ using IPFS-based off-chain storage for smart agricultural UAVs data.\nHowever,\
    \ these solutions face reliability, privacy, and security issues, such as that\
    \ IPFS does\nnot provide private ﬁle storage; it only offers public ﬁle access.\
    \ Likewise, MTFS has access\nspeed and scalability problems with public ﬁle systems.\
    \ From that, it has been noticed that\nthe limited data storage capacity of blockchain\
    \ is a notable challenge in the current and\nfuture networks.\n6.2. Poor Efﬁciency\
    \ of Consensus Mechanism\nThe blockchain network depends on various consensus\
    \ mechanisms such as prac-\ntical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), proof-of-work,\
    \ and proof-of-stake for enterprise\nand permissionless blockchains. However,\
    \ these algorithms are inadequate because they\nconsume more time and energy for\
    \ block production. Researchers have designed various\nconsensus algorithms to\
    \ monitor and verify block production in 6G network. For example,\nWan et al.\
    \ [67] and Zhang et al. [68] proposed a consensus-algorithm-based strategy for\n\
    collision avoidance in UAV swarms and ﬁxed-wing UAVs, respectively. Still, there\
    \ is\nscope for research in this ﬁeld because the algorithms require higher energy\
    \ consumption\nand are vulnerable to malicious attacks such as the 51% attack,\
    \ Sybil attack, race attack,\nand Finney attack.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n22 of\
    \ 26\n6.3. Cross-Network or Cross-Domain Sharing\nBlockchain introduces an interoperability\
    \ feature that offers a cross-chain mechanism\nto transmit asserts, transaction\
    \ values, virtual contracts, and data between two or more\nblockchain networks.\
    \ Unfortunately, the lack of adequate privacy and maintaining the same\nlevel\
    \ of security raise cross-network sharing issues in blockchain-based 6G applications.\n\
    Recently, much work has been carried out for cross-network sharing in blockchain-enabled\n\
    smart applications. For example, in [69], the authors proposed a cross-network\
    \ data-\nsharing mechanism for the smart grid. Likewise, Xue et al. [70] presented\
    \ a cross-domain\nauthentication scheme for medical information sharing. Besides\
    \ these advantages, several\nchallenges remain to be addressed, such as data ownership\
    \ protection with QoS-based\nnetwork heterogeneity.\n6.4. Computation Overhead\n\
    The 6G applications are bandwidth- and resource-hungry; they require real-time\
    \ data\ntransmission. However, the increasing number of network users hinders\
    \ the QoS of the\ndeveloped applications. Therefore, blockchain integrates with\
    \ 6G technologies, reducing\nthe complex computational cost. A lot of research\
    \ has been carried out to overcome the\ncomputation overhead issue in blockchain-based\
    \ 6G applications. For instance, the work of\nChai et al. [71] offered a diffused-PBFT\
    \ approach to reduce computation overhead and con-\nsensus latency. Likewise,\
    \ in [72], the authors proposed an LSTM-based scheme to optimize\nthe computation\
    \ ofﬂoading in a satellite-UAV-based IoT system. Then, Ahmed et al. [73]\nintroduced\
    \ blockchain in VANET for vehicle authentication and emergency message trans-\n\
    mission between the Internet of vehicles (IoVs). They encrypted blockchain servers\
    \ using\nRSA-1024, a digital signature algorithm, to minimize the computation\
    \ overhead. However,\neach participating block of the blockchain and consensus\
    \ algorithms, such as proof-of-work\nand PBFT, require more computational power\
    \ for calculation. On top of that, the continu-\nous growth of IoT devices and\
    \ smart applications leads to high congestion in the network\nand computation\
    \ overhead, where it is infeasible to properly apply a blockchain-based\nconsensus\
    \ approach.\n6.5. Dynamically Changing Environment\nDigital technologies such\
    \ as AI, IoT, and robotics are continuously growing and chang-\ning the future\
    \ perspective, industrial demand, and human behavior. These technologies\nare\
    \ incorporated into various smart applications such as e-healthcare, smart homes,\
    \ smart\nagriculture, holographic communications and many more. According to user\
    \ demand\nfor a high transmission rate with lower latency, these technologies\
    \ should respond in the\nreal-time environment of industries and organizations.\
    \ Moreover, blockchain networks\nare incorporated in dynamic, experimental, and\
    \ sustainable future technologies to intro-\nduce trust, authenticity, security,\
    \ and privacy [74]. The research community has offered\nmany solutions based on\
    \ blockchain for a dynamic changing environment. For example,\nXiao et al. [75]\
    \ proposed temporal pattern attention and enabled the LSTM approach to\nsense\
    \ the change of natural gas deliverability in natural-gas-based IoT systems. They\n\
    utilized a blockchain-based smart contract that dynamically matched the purchase\
    \ and\nsale details of the gas; it also enhanced the buyer’s and the seller’s\
    \ interests. As a result,\nthey could predict the outcome of natural gas in real-time\
    \ according to the dynamic de-\nmand for sales. However, modeling such a real-time\
    \ technique is highly complex and\ntime-consuming in a dynamic changing environment.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nBlockchain is distributed ledger technology that offers reliability,\
    \ security, immutabil-\nity, and privacy in the 6G-based futuristic smart application.\
    \ It proves its effectiveness by\nproviding trust been two parties in the wireless\
    \ communication network. Many research\ncommunities have discussed the adoption\
    \ of blockchain for 6G-based smart applications\nwith new digital technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, AI, and MEC. This technology offers real-time\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n23 of 26\ncommunication with a higher transmission rate; however, it adds\
    \ various challenges, mak-\ning it difﬁcult to adapt to a 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ it is required to propose an exhaustive\nwork highlighting the ﬁndings of multiple\
    \ researchers who worked in the blockchain-\nbased 6G networks. We discussed various\
    \ 6G applications where blockchain is adopted\nfor the security and privacy of\
    \ data. Further, we discussed blockchain-based services in\nthe 6G network. Then,\
    \ we proposed layer-wise architecture by adopting AI, blockchain,\nand a 6G network\
    \ to protect sensitive crime data in public safety applications. An attacker\n\
    tries to manipulate criminal activity information systems to avoid legal action;\
    \ therefore,\nthe proposed architecture offers a secure pipeline to protect public\
    \ safety applications from\nthe nefarious offense. The proposed architecture is\
    \ evaluated on numerous performance\nevaluation metrics such as accuracy, scalability,\
    \ and packet drop rate. Lastly, we identiﬁed\nthe challenge of adopting the blockchain\
    \ in the 6G wireless networks.\nIn the future, based on this work, we will develop\
    \ a novel solution that mitigates the\nidentiﬁed issues and improves the performance\
    \ of the blockchain-based 6G system.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization:\

    10.1109/JIOT.2014.2337336 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is regarded as a technology and economic wave in
    the global information industry after the Internet. The IoT is an intelligent
    network which connects all things to the Internet for the purpose of exchanging
    information and communicating through the information sensing devices in accordance
    with agreed protocols. It achieves the goal of intelligent identifying, locating,
    tracking, monitoring, and managing things [1]. It is an extension and expansion
    of Internet-based network, which expands the communication from human and human
    to human and things or things and things. In the IoT paradigm, many objects surrounding
    us will be connected into networks in one form or another. RF identification (RFID),
    sensor technology, and other smart technologies will be embedded into a variety
    of applications. As a burgeoning thing, there is not a common accepted definition
    on IoT. Specialists from different perspectives and organizations describe IoT
    on diverse preference. Typical definitions of IoT from different organizations
    are shown in Table I. Following technology evolutions, more and more computing
    power, storage, and battery capacities become available at relatively low cost
    and low size. This trend is enabling the development of extreme small-scale electronic
    devices with identification/communication/computing capabilities, which could
    be embedded in other devices, systems, and facilities [1]. IoT should have the
    following three characteristics [6]. Comprehensive Perception: Using RFID, sensors,
    and two-dimensional barcode to obtain the object information at anytime and anywhere,
    it will be a new opportunity. Using it, information and communication systems
    can be invisibly embedded in the environment around us. Sensor network will enable
    people to interact with the real world remotely. Identification technologies mentioned
    here include objects and location identifications. Identification and recognition
    of the physical world is the foundation of implementing overall perception. Reliable
    Transmission: Through a variety of available radio networks, telecommunication
    networks, and Internet, objects information can be available in any time. Communication
    technology here includes a variety of wired and wireless transmission technologies,
    switching technologies, networking technologies, and gateway technologies. IoT
    further creates the interaction among the physical world, the virtual world, the
    digital world, and the society. Machine to machine (M2M), furthermore, is the
    key implementation technology of the Network of Things, which represents the connections
    and communications between M2M and Human to Machine including Mobile to Machine.
    Intelligent Processing: By collecting IoT data into databases, various intelligent
    computing technologies including cloud computing will be able to support IoT data
    applications. The network service providers can process tens of millions or even
    billion pieces of messages instantly through cloud computing. Cloud computing
    technology will thus be the promoter of IoT. Currently, in China, there are at
    least 9 billion interconnected devices, and it is expected to reach 24 billion
    devices by 2020. According to the GSMA, this amount to $1.3 trillion revenue opportunities
    for mobile network operators alone spanning segments such as health, automotive,
    utilities, and consumer electronics. Many countries consider IoT as strategic
    industries and a new economic growth engine in the future. European Union (EU)
    has invested more than 100 million Euros in a series of projects through Seventh
    EU Framework Programme (FP7 for R&D), and these projects will be actively deployed
    in smart grid, intelligent transportation, smart cities, etc. South Korea invested
    27.8 million U.S. dollars in IoT fundamental technology development, IoT test
    bed advancement, and IoT standardization, etc. China is speeding up the development
    of IoT and defines it as a new engine for economic growth. The government released
    the 12th Five-Year Plan for IoT development. This plan is an outline program for
    developing IoT from 2011 to 2015. The plan gave the goal and objectives of future
    development, and the plan proposed several approaches reaching the goal. The plan
    also puts forward a list of methods to support and promote the development of
    IoT\break industry. This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces
    opportunities of IoT and summarizes its status and applications. Section III introduces
    the policy, R&D plans, and standardization of IoT in China. Based on the introduction
    of Sections II and III, in Section IV, the major problem hampering the development
    of IoT is analyzed, i.e., lack of interoperability among diverse IoT solutions.
    A general open IoT architecture developed in China is given. Section V introduces
    main application fields, examples of typical public applications, and examples
    of industry applications of IoT in China. Section VI analyzes further challenges
    on IoT, including technical challenge and standard challenge, and introduces the
    prospect of IoT. Section VII is the conclusion of this paper. SECTION II. Opportunity,
    Status, and Capability of IoT A. Opportunity of IoT The IoT will create a huge
    network of billions or trillions of “Things” communicating each other. The IoT
    is not subversive revolution over the existing technologies, it is comprehensive
    utilizations of existing technologies, and it is the creation of the new communication
    modes. The IoT blends the virtual world and the physical world by bringing different
    concepts and technical components together: pervasive networks, miniaturization
    of devices, mobile communication, and new ecosystem. In IoT, applications, services,
    middleware components, networks, and end nodes will be structurally organized
    and used in entire new ways. IoT offers a means to look into complex processes
    and relationships. The IoT implies a symbiotic interaction between the real/physical
    and the digital/virtual worlds: physical entities have digital counterparts and
    virtual representation; things become context aware and they can sense, communicate,
    interact, and exchange data, information, and knowledge. New opportunities will
    meet business requirements, and new services will be created based on real-time
    physical world data. Everything from the physical or virtual world will possibly
    be connected by the IoT. Connectivity between the things shall be available to
    all with low cost and may not be owned by private entities. For IoT, intelligent
    learning, fast deployment, best information understanding and interpreting, against
    fraud and malicious attack, and privacy protection are essential requirements.
    B. Status of IoT The IoT can be regarded as an extension of existing interaction
    between people and applications through a new dimension of “Things” for communication
    and integration. The IoT development process is a complex large-scale technological
    innovation process. The IoT is evolving from the vertical application to polymeric
    application. At the early stage of IoT deployment, driving of domain-specific
    applications is the main development strategy. A domain-specific application might
    be a manufacturing control system with its own industry characteristics. The application
    can provide various enterprise management services being integrated with the industry
    production and business processes. Polymeric applications are cross-industry applications
    based on public information service platforms. These applications support both
    home users and industry users. The application are provided and promoted by communication
    operators and solution providers with large scale. For example, a vehicle integrated
    with sensor networks, a global positioning system (GPS), and radio communication
    technology can provide comprehensive detection, navigation, entertainment, and
    other information services. By maintaining such information through the public
    service platform, consumers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), maintenance
    providers, and vehicle management agencies can share these~information and share
    services to improve the vehicle, the vehicle component design, and the fabrication
    process through the vehicle lifecycle management. C. Capability of the IoT Application
    In summary, the IoT applications shall have the following capabilities. 1) Location
    Sensing and Sharing of Location Info The IoT system can collect the location information
    of IoT terminals and end nodes, and then provide services based on the collected
    location information. The location information includes geographical position
    information got from the GPS, Cell-ID, RFID, etc., and absolute or relative position
    information between things. More typical IoT applications include at least the
    following. a) Mobile asset tracking This application can track and monitor the
    status of commodity using the position-sensing device and communication function
    installed on the commodity. b) Fleet management The manger of the fleet can schedule
    the vehicles and drivers based on the business requirements and the real-time
    position information collected by the vehicles. c) Fleet management Traffic information
    system: This application can get traffic information such as road traffic conditions
    and congested locations by tracking the location information of a large number
    of vehicles. The system thus assists the driver to choose the most efficient route.
    2) Environment Sensing The IoT system can collect and process all kinds of physical
    or chemical environmental \nobreak parameters via the locally or widely deployed
    terminals. Typical environmental information includes temperature, humidity, noise,
    visibility, light intensity, spectrum, radiation, pollution (CO, CO2, etc.), images,
    and body indicators. Typical applications include at least the following. a) Environment
    detection IoT systems offer environmental and ecological, such as forest and glacier,
    monitoring; disaster, such as volcanoes and seismic, monitoring; and factory monitoring.
    All are with automatic alarm systems using environmental parameters collected
    by large number of sensors. b) Remote medical monitoring IoT can analyze the recurring
    indicator data collected from the device placed on patients’ body and provide
    the users with health trends and health advice. 3) Remote Controlling IoT systems
    can control IoT terminals and execute functions based on application commands
    combined with information collected from things and service requirements. a) Appliance
    control People can remotely control operating status of appliances through IoT
    system. b) Disaster recovery Users can remotely start disasters treatment facilities
    to minimize losses caused by disasters according to the monitoring mentioned before.
    4) Ad Hoc Networking IoT system shall have rapidly self-organized networking capability
    and can interoperate with the network/service layer to provide related services
    [7]. In the vehicle network, in order to transfer the data, the network between
    vehicles and/or road infrastructures can be rapidly self-organized. 5) Secure
    Communication IoT system can further establish secure data transmission channel
    between the application or service platform and IoT terminals based on service
    requirements. In practice, an IoT application consists of different types of capabilities
    and even applications based on the service requirement. Table II shows examples
    of different IoT applications. TABLE I Definitions of the IoT From Different Organizations
    TABLE II Summary of IoT Applications SECTION III. IoT in China A. China Pushes
    Development of IoT The IoT sensing network research started in China in 1999.
    IoT was positioned as one of the strategic emerging industries and written into
    the government work report in March 2010. The state council’s decision on speeding
    up the incubation and development of strategic emerging industries, which was
    promulgated in November 2010, clearly stated that the IoT research and application
    demonstrations will be promoted. In 2012, the Ministry of Industry and Information
    of China explained the national 12th Five-Year Plan including IoT development
    (2011–2015) [8]. It was the first plan that China government released the development
    of IoT in detail. The plan clearly proposed the development goal of the IoT during
    the period of 2011–2015. By 2015, there should be significant achievements of
    IoT essential technologies, related applications, and standardizations. The plan
    put forward eight main tasks and clearly clarified five key projects, including
    the Key Technology Innovation Project, Standardization acceleration Project, “10
    Industrial sectors \& 100 New Enterprises” Industry Development Pioneering Project,
    Application Demonstration Projects in Key Sectors, and Public Service Platform
    Construction Project. In order to solve the popped-up problems and consider long-term
    development of IoT, the State Council issued the “guidance on tracking and ordering
    for promoting the development of IoT” [9] that determined the development goals
    and threads for IoT in February 2013. The 14 ministries of China established a
    joint meeting for IoT development in September 2013, and organized Expert Advisory
    Committee on the IoT development. The 10 Special Development Action Plans for
    IoT [10], including: 1) top-layer design; 2) standards development; 3) technology
    development; 4) application promotion; 5) industry support; 6) business models;
    7) security; 8) government support; 9) laws and regulations guarantee; and 10)
    personnel training, was issued by the joint meeting. As a part of the Action Plans,
    the strategic alliance for industrial technology innovations of IoT was established
    in October 2013 [11]. Fig. 1 shows the summary of the Special Development Packet
    Plans. Fig. 1. Summary of the Special Action Plans. Show All B. R&D Plans In China,
    the central government established the special funds for demonstration projects
    and research projects to support the development of IoT. In 2011, for supporting
    the development of IoT in China, around RMB 500 million special IoT fund was invested
    into IoT-related fields, 2/3 of the funds were put into R&D and applications;
    this fund has supported 381 related companies since 2011. China government has
    supported 22 National major IoT application demonstration projects since 2011,
    and an announcement was issued by China National Development and Reform Commission
    in October 2013. It was about organizing and carrying out the national IoT pilot
    major application demonstration projects during 2014–2016 in special regions.
    In Research and Development area, the China Ministry of Industry and Information
    Technology had set up a number of key technical research projects on architectures
    and applications such as intelligent transport system (ITS) and e-health under
    the packet of “a new generation of mobile broadband project.” China Ministry of
    Science and Technology also set up a series of fundamental researches for IoT
    on architecture, fundamental theory and design, etc., under the 973 project framework
    (National Key Fundamental Research and Development Plan). The national level IoT
    R&D is distributed as: the enterprises such as operators and vendors provide the
    operation and system development of IoT. Universities and research institutions
    focus on the key technology research, and the standard organizations are responsible
    for the standardization of IoT. At present, IoT-related industry has basically
    formed, and mainly distributed over the Bohai bay area, the Yangtze River Delta
    zoon, the Pearl River Delta zoon, and the central and western regions. Fig. 2
    shows the summary of national R&D plans in IoT. Fig. 2. Summary of National R&D
    plans in IoT in China. Show All C. Standardization The IoT standard system contains
    the architecture standards, the application requirements standards, the communication
    protocol standards, the identification standards, the security standards, the
    application standards, the data standards, the information processing standards,
    and the public service platform standards. The proposed IoT standard set is relatively
    complicated. In China, the standardization efforts started at 2010. The main standard
    organizations for IoT in China are China Communications Standards Association
    (CCSA), China Standardization Working Group on Sensor Networks (WGSN), electric
    tag standards technical committee, etc. These standard organizations are leading
    the standardization process of China IoT. As part of the Special IoT Action Plans,
    actions for the standardization of IoT include to build a standard system, to
    develop common standards, key technical standards, and urgent industry standards,
    to actively participate in the international standardization processes, to conduct
    standard validations and services, to improve the organizational structure. In
    the course of standardization, many research institutions and enterprises in China
    have also been participating in international standardization work in M2M of International
    Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC),
    ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP). China is one of the leading countries in ITU-T and ISO Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) Working Group. CCSA is one of the sponsoring organizations
    of the One M2M, and many enterprises are deeply participating in the MTC-related
    standard development in 3GPP. SECTION IV. Open and General IoT Architecture A.
    Motivation and General Description As seen in the previous introduction to the
    current IoT, most IoT applications in China were domain-specific or application-specific
    solutions. The architectures of these IoT systems are fragmented and cannot correlate
    and integrate the data from different silos; these isolated IoT solutions use
    private protocols and cause much problems in information sharing, technology multiplexing,
    network managements, and upgrading. All these problems are hindering the development
    of IoT. In order to reduce the total IoT cost and share information, we need to
    integrate multiple functions and resources into a larger system. IoT thus needs
    to be designed with an open and generic IoT architecture with open interfaces
    and resources, considering different business scenarios, application-based requirements,
    and current technologies [12]. We have thus seen the motivation to formulate a
    standard for IoT integration in order to reduce the total cost of money and time
    from devices, developments, and deployments. An open and generic IoT architecture
    is an integrated solution with interoperability [13], [14]. It will have the following
    characteristics. 1) Standard Interface and Protocol By comparing various private
    IoT systems, a generic IoT infrastructure has the same hardware and software interfaces,
    and protocols. 2) Public and Operating A general IoT architecture is deployed
    to take over public IoT applications with open-operating capability. A public
    IoT system can thus integrate multiple IoT applications into one architecture.
    3) Open, Scalable, and Flexible An open IoT architecture with open resources,
    open standards, and open interfaces can easily extend its functionality and the
    scale of performance. It can thus adapt to different requirements including technical
    developments flexibly. B. Open and General IoT Architecture China Communications
    Standards Association (CCSA) proposed a reference model for the IoT, which consists
    of sensing layer, network and business layers, and application layer. Complying
    with this reference model, Fig. 3 shows its open and general architecture, which
    is layered, open, and flexible. The architecture includes three functional platforms
    as follows. Fig. 3. CCSA proposed open and general architecture of IoT. Show All
    1) Sensing and Gateway Platform This platform connects sensors, controllers, RFID
    readers, and location sensing device (e.g., GPS) to IoT network layer. Modularization
    of hardware, data format, and software interface is proposed for IoT terminal,
    IoT Gateway, and tip node. IoT terminal, IoT gateway, and tip node can include
    flexible modules combined with control module, common interface module, and communication
    module. Common interface module collects physical interfaces of various sensors
    into a common interface. Common control module can connect sensors, controllers,
    GPS, and RFID readers with a common connection protocol. The software and application
    parameters of an IoT terminal and IoT gateway should be able to self-configure
    and self-adapt. Modularization, common interface, intelligent operation, self-adaption,
    and self-configuration are important characteristics of this platform. 2) Resource
    and Administration Platform Network and service layer includes backbone networks
    and resource administration platforms. The backbone network includes 3G, 4G, internet,
    optical fiber network, Ethernet network, satellite networks, and private network.
    The resource and administration platform provides common capabilities which can
    be used by different IoT applications, such as data processing, data storage,
    security management, and application supporting. These capabilities may also be
    invoked by specific IoT application support capabilities, e.g., to build other
    specific IoT application support capabilities. This platform also provides relevant
    control functions of network connectivity, such as access and transport resource
    control functions, mobility management, or authentication, authorization, and
    accounting for IoT terminals, services, applications, users, and developers. 3)
    Open Application Platform Modularization design in this application platform provides
    common function and open application programming interface (API). An IoT application
    provider can develop its application using these APIs. Meanwhile, this platform
    supports application managements. Various applications can be published to the
    application platform and users can get application information and subscribe applications
    through this platform. Convenient and easy deployment, distribution, and flexible
    application environment are the characteristics of this platform. SECTION V. Typical
    Applications and Deployment in China A. Main Application Fields In China, IoT
    applications will be developed in nine fields, including: 1) domain industry applications;
    2) smart agriculture; 3) smart logistics; 4) intelligent transportation; 5) smart
    grid; 6) smart environmental protection; 7) smart safety; 8) smart medical care;
    and 9) smart home, as shown in Table III. TABLE III Main Application Fields in
    China Three major operators: 1) China mobile; 2) China Telecom; and 3) China Unicom
    had announced their IoT development plans. The IoT has been an important part
    in the strategies of Chinese telecom operators. China mobile plans to implement
    a centralized platform [China mobile IoT operation supporting platform (CMITS)],
    and the branch for IoT was established in Chongqing in 2012. China Telecom plans
    to further enrich IoT services based on key industry requirements, to build an
    open platform for cooperation, and to promote IoT business model innovation. The
    branch for IoT was established in Wuxi in 2014. China Unicom plans to build a
    management and control platform and an operation supporting system for IoT. They
    also planned to offer specific hardware communication modules. The government
    planned to provide special phone numbers (1064xxxxxxxxx with billions of identities)
    dedicated for M2M. Table IV shows IoT development plans and actions from three
    major operators. TABLE IV IoT Developments From Three Major Operators B. Deployment
    of Typical Applications 1) Smart City Smart city is a new development model of
    a city using new technologies, such as IoT, cloud computing, and big data analytics,
    to boost the information sharing and coordination within a city system. IoT is
    important means and tools of building smart city, and it is infrastructure-carrying
    smart city construction. Smart city construction depends on a lot of IoT applications
    for different industries [15], [16]. Smart city development plans are divided
    into three stages: 1) the stage for initial infrastructure construction; 2) the
    stage for data-processing facility construction; and 3) the stage for end-phase
    service platform construction. A large number of smart city projects provide huge
    opportunities for telecom OEM, systems integration enterprises, data aggregation
    and analysis/service enterprises, and telecom operators. In China, some cities
    are focusing on improving infrastructure for smart cities programs, and on developing
    regional smart e-commerce and logistics, while other cities are stepping up efforts
    to improve the management of local utilities. According to estimation, the smart
    city market will have a total value of more than RMB 2 Trillion during the 12th
    Five-Year Plan period (2011–2015). 2) Intelligent Transportation China needs a
    solution to solve the problems of increased amount of traffic congestion in urban
    areas using new technologies such as IoT. The Ministry of Transport in China has
    announced a plan that the development of ITS will be installed and in-use across
    the country by 2020. In the next 10 years, the government will invest about RMB
    4 Trillion in intelligent transportation. Intelligent Transportation System in
    China is developing and keeping a high growth rate. The growing speed of China’s
    urban intelligent transportation control system market is high, including electronic
    police, intelligent traffic signal control, traffic video monitoring, intelligent
    Taxi service management, urban public transport information technology, and ETC.
    Until the completion of the 12th Five-Year Plan, 60% of national highways in China
    will have ETC. The installation of IoT infrastructures in ITS of smart cities
    will be supporting fundamental technologies. Connected vehicles and vehicular
    networks have been identified as a key technology for enhancing road safety and
    transport efficiency [17], [18]. In recent years, vehicular network infrastructure
    integration technology attracts a great amount of attentions; it also brings inestimable
    economic value, and will play an important role in the next generation of intelligent
    transportation systems and communication network development. Separately, built-in
    connectivity in vehicles is predicted to mandatory function for consumers in 2020,
    driven partly by the increasing global demand for availability of charging supply
    for electric vehicles. Government, University, automakers, and telecommunication
    vendors form alliances to develop this industry, such as China ITS Industry Alliance
    and Telematics Industry Application Alliance, to develop the connected vehicles
    industry. The related installation of IoT infrastructures of smart cities will
    be fundamental supporting technologies as well. C. Deployment of Typical Industry
    Applications 1) Intelligent Coal Mine In 2011, The State Administration of work
    safety and State Coal Mine Safety Supervision Bureau in China regulated that all
    coal mines in china must complete the construction of “Mine Six-Hedge Safety Systems”
    until the end of 2013. The Six-Hedge underground systems include: 1) general monitoring
    and controlling system; 2) personnel positioning system; 3) emergent shelter systems;
    4) oxygen provision monitoring system; 5) water supply and drainage monitoring
    system; and 6) mine cable and wireless communication system. All the six systems
    mentioned above are based on pervasive sensing, sensing data collection, real-time
    use of data, and deep data post analyses, which is actually based on IoT. The
    IoT can be widely used in the “six system.” For example, it uses sensors to monitor
    miner position and leak of hazard gases. Fig. 4 shows a typical underground IoT
    system. Fig. 4. IoT system structure for coal mine. Show All Built on underground
    industrial ring network and industrial field bus, the system is actually a comprehensive
    underground IoT platform, which transmits data of mining devices under industrial
    Ethernet protocols to dispatch center so as to monitor various devices and sensors
    inside the dispatch center. The overall design of the system consists of sensing
    and equipment layer, network and access layer, as well application and information
    management layer. The system collects real-time parameters of electromechanical
    devices and data of safety systems, which improves the system efficiency and safety.
    Finally, it highly guarantees the correct dispatching and decision-making of coal
    mines. 2) Intelligent Oil Field Intelligent oil field (IOF) consists of a distributed
    system, holding frequently captured data. The data are evaluated and acted upon
    real-time information. IOF brings lower operational costs, lower capital investment,
    and increased yield of oil and gas. Fig. 5 shows the IOF system based on the architecture
    mentioned in Section IV. It will collect parameters through its entire production
    process, such as sensing and monitoring parameters from oil well and gas well,
    metering house, oil station and gas station, and oil and gas pipe network. Sensed
    data will be collected and transmitted for further analysis between the service
    platform and gateway/terminal with a common connection protocol. Real-time production
    data and equipment condition information support the centralized management and
    control at production command center in production control center. IOF can increase
    the integrity, accuracy, timeliness, and standardization of the production decision-making
    for oil and gas fields. Fig. 5. IOF system. Show All The goal and objectives of
    the IOF system are to increase the accuracy and timeliness of product process,
    decision-making, improvement of the system management level, reducing the operation
    costs, and minimizing risk. As a subsystem in IOF, IoT system offers automatic
    production data collection, remote monitoring, and supporting for production prewarning
    by establishing a standardized general service platform, which covers all oil
    and gas wells and fields, metering house, collect and conveyance station, combination
    station, treatment plant. The platform also supports the process of production
    process management. SECTION VI. Challenge and Prospect of IoT IoT trends to be
    unified, seamless, and pervasive. Large-scale service deployment needs to be framed
    within a set of standards. However, IoT involves many manufacturers, spans multiple
    industries, and it differs widely in application scenarios and user requirements,
    which consequently gives impacts on large-scale commercial deployment of related
    services. The development of IoT is a step-by-step process. There are still many
    problems to be solved, such as low power nodes and computing, low cost and low
    latency communication, identification and positioning technologies, self-organized
    distributed systems technology, and distributed intelligence. A. Challenge of
    IoT The IoT provides many new opportunities to the industry and end user in many
    application fields. Currently, however, the IoT itself lacks theory, technology
    architecture, and standards that integrate the virtual world and the real physical
    world in a unified framework [19]. Following key challenges are thus listed. 1)
    Architecture Challenge IoT encompasses an extreme wide range of technologies.
    IoT involves an increasing number of smart interconnected devices and sensors
    (e.g., cameras, biometric, physical, and chemical sensors) that are often nonintrusive,
    transparent, and invisible. As the communications among these devices are expected
    to happen anytime, anywhere for any related services, generally, these communications
    are in a wireless, autonomic, and ad hoc manner. In addition, the services become
    much more mobile, decentralized, and complex. In IoT, data integrations over different
    environments are thus tough and will be supported by modular interoperable components.
    Infrastructure solutions will require systems to combine volumes of data from
    various sources and determine relevant features, to interpret data and show their
    relationships, to compare data to historical useful information, and support decision-making.
    Single reference architecture thus cannot be a blueprint for all applications.
    Heterogeneous reference architectures have to coexist in IoT. Architectures should
    be open, and following standards, they should not restrict users to use fixed,
    end-to-end solutions. IoT architectures should be flexible to cater for cases
    such as identification (RFID, tags), intelligent devices, and smart objects (hardware
    and software solutions). 2) Technical Challenge IoT technology can be complex
    for variety of reasons. First, there are legacy heterogeneous architectures in
    the existing networking technologies and applications, e.g., different applications
    and environments need different networking technologies, and the ranges as well
    as other characteristics of cellular, wireless local area network, and RFID technologies
    are much different from each other [20]. Second, communication technologies, including
    fixed and mobile communication systems, power line communications, wireless communication,
    and short-range wireless communication technologies, for both fixed and mobile
    devices, either simple or complicated, should be low cost and with reliable connectivity.
    At last, there are thousands of different applications; it is in natural to have
    different requirements on what parties need to communicate with each other, what
    kind of security solutions are appropriate, and so on. To summarize, complexity
    and alternative technologies may introduce problems; unnecessary competition and
    deployment barriers in markets may also introduce problems; systems and communication
    mechanisms with unnecessary dependencies may block the migration of IoT systems
    to the most economic and efficient platforms. All the above may block IoT to connect
    as many “Things” as possible. 3) Hardware Challenge Smart devices with enhanced
    inter-device communication will lead to smart systems with high degrees of intelligence.
    Its autonomy enables rapid deployment of IoT applications and creation of new
    services. Therefore, hardware researches are focusing on designing wireless identifiable
    systems with low size, low cost yet sufficient functionality. As the bandwidth
    of IoT terminals could vary from kbps to mbps from sensing simple value to video
    stream, requirements on hardware are diverging. However, two requirements have
    been nevertheless the essentials: one is the extremely low power consumption in
    sleep mode and the other is ultra low cost. Suppose the sleeping time over active
    time is one million, the leakage power of an IoT terminal shall at least be one
    million time less than that of active. It is so far impossible when an IoT terminal
    is sleeping and receiving RF signals. It will be even difficult when using advanced
    CMOS silicon with relatively more leakage power. Hardware and protocol codesign
    for sleeping has been thus the first hardware challenge of IoT. Billions of IoT
    terminals will be used; the cost of an IoT terminal must be ultra low. However,
    so far, there is no low cost positioning solution for IoT, especially the positioning
    precision of a short-range IoT terminal must be high. Low active power is also
    a challenge for low-cost terminal [21]. Traditionally, low cost equals to lower
    performance or longer process latency. Longer processing latency ends up to higher
    energy consumption. As the spectrum resource is very limited at the lower part
    in L band, IoT may use higher RF such as the frequency bands higher than 5 GHz.
    The higher the RF, the more power consumption from RF PA will be. In another way,
    not yet used very narrow spectrum band between two used bands may have to be used
    by future IoT. To use very narrow band with strong power neighbors, the cost of
    passive component will not be low and that will definitely be a potential challenge
    in the future. 4) Privacy and Security Challenge Compared with traditional networks,
    security and privacy issues of IoT become more prominent [22]. Much information
    includes privacy of users, so that protection of privacy becomes an important
    security issues in IoT. Because of the combinations of things, services, and networks,
    security of IoT needs to cover more management objects and levels than traditional
    network security. Existing security architecture is designed from the perspective
    of human communication, may not be suitable and directly applied to IoT system.
    Using existed security mechanisms will block logical relationship between things
    in IoT. IoT needs low-cost- and M2M-oriented technical solutions to guarantee
    the privacy and the security. In many use cases, the security of a system has
    been considered as a general feature. Related research shall focus on privacy
    control. Low cost, low latency, and energy-efficient cryptography algorithms and
    related flexible hardware will be essential for sensor or device. 5) Standard
    Challenge Standards play an important role in forming IoT. A standard is essential
    to allow all actors to equally access and use. Developments and coordination of
    standards and proposals will promote efficient development of IoT infrastructures
    and applications, services, and devices. In general, standards developed by cooperated
    multiparties, and information models and protocols in the standards, shall be
    open. The standard development process shall also be open to all participants,
    and the resulting standards shall be publicly and freely available. In today’s
    network world, global standards are typically more relevant than any local agreements.
    6) Business Challenge For a mature application, its business model and application
    scenario are clear and easy to be mapped into technical requirements. So the developers
    do not need to spend much time on business-related aspects. But for IoT, there
    are too many possibilities and uncertainties in business models and application
    scenarios. It is thus inefficient in terms of business-technology alignment, and
    one solution will not fit possibilities for all. The IoT is a challenging traditional
    business model. Although small-scale applications have been profitable in some
    industries, it is unsustainable when extended to other industries. In the early
    stage of IoT development, business aspects should be considered to reduce the
    risk of failure. B. Prospect of IoT With the development and maturity of distributed
    intelligent information processing technologies, IoT systems will make intelligent
    sensing widely available through information sharing and collaboration. The gradual
    establishment and improvement of the standards system will inevitably bring IoT
    into our daily life. The IoT creates an opportunity for the web-based services,
    thus enhancing the commercial and social potential future of IoT [23]. The development
    of IoT keeps going forward along scale, collaborative, and intelligent. Promoted
    by technology, standardization, and application experiences, IoT applications
    will expand the scale in the different industries, and more enterprises will be
    attracted to come in. 1) Interoperability Information interoperability will take
    place among different things, different enterprises, different industries, and
    different regions or countries; application models will change from closed to
    open and the globalization of IoT application system serving different industries
    and fields will be constructed. Interoperability is the essential issue for crossing
    layers of physical, device, communication (protocol and spectrum utility), function
    and application. These levels traditionally are built with different languages
    and protocols. Level and domain transparent languages and protocols are, therefore,
    needed. A holistic approach is required in addressing and solving the interoperability
    of IoT devices and services at several layers. 2) Intelligent System The IoT will
    bring seamless business and social networking over fast reliable and secure networks
    into our society. System intelligence will be important for the development of
    IoT and the key point will be context awareness and inter-things information exchange.
    Therefore, increasing and adapting the intelligence at the device level will be
    a focus of research, such as the integration of sensors and actuators, high efficiency,
    multistandard and adaptive communication subsystems, and adaptable antennae. Intelligences
    can be introduced using micro control unit (MCU) on upper layers. However, physical
    layer so far has been far behind the required intelligent level, for example,
    to adapt IoT devices under different radio infrastructures. Four parts in physical
    layer must be further developed to adapt to and/or to form an intelligent IoT
    device, which are as follows. Programmable baseband processor will be used to
    adapt to different modulation algorithms, different error correction algorithms,
    different channel bandwidths, and different channel scenarios. Software-controlled
    RF will be essential for transceiver to adapt to the local radio frequency requirements.
    Fully digital RF PA will be the indispensable device to consume less low power
    and offer programmability for PA to adapt radio transmission requirements. Finally,
    controllable integrated passive components will be an essential glue to connect
    intelligent semiconductor components into a sensor node with low cost, low size,
    and low power. 3) Energy Sustainability In the future, energy-efficient and self-sustainable
    systems will be key enhancing issues to the IoT. The ways to harvest energy from
    environments must be developed. Efficiency in processing and communication must
    also be increased through new circuits, new programming paradigms, and the further
    development of energy-efficient protocols and smart antennae. The development
    of new, efficient, and compact batteries, fuel cells, as well as new energy generation
    devices coupling energy transmission methods or energy harvesting will be the
    key factors for the roll-out of autonomous wireless smart systems. Charging of
    global IoT terminals, power consumption of global IoT access points and gateways,
    as well as the power consumption of IoT data processing in IoT infrastructures
    will be one of the dominant power consumers in the future world. Mechanical energy
    harvest will be sufficient for body network as a part of IoT. Solar or wind energy
    is a conditional energy sources which may not be reliable. It can be used for
    battery charging. SECTION VII. Conclusion The IoT encompasses several technologies
    such as information technology, cognitive sciences, communication technology,
    and low-power electronics. IoT creates a newer information society and knowledge
    economy. But the challenges from research, industries, and the government will
    keep pushing and investing. The development of IoT will depend on technological
    advances in silicon scaling and energy-efficient devices, in getting the information
    from heterogeneous sources, in reducing costs, and in improving efficiencies.
    The development of the IoT exposed many new challenges including the lack of fundamental
    theory supporting, unclear architecture, and immature standards. To meet these
    challenges, we give a three-layer architecture including three platforms. The
    proposed acting standard can hopefully balance desires from different parties,
    can open the door for future fundamental theory development, and can eventually
    stimulate/regulate IoT development. Recent years, Chinese government is pushing
    the development of the IoT. Following the Chinese 12th Five-Year Plan for IoT
    Development, China has accomplished a number of demonstration application projects
    such as the smart city and the intelligent transportation system in public IoT
    applications, intelligent coal mine, and the IOFs in industry applications. The
    future of IoT will be expected to be unified, seamless, and pervasive. Large-scale
    service deployment needs to be framed within a set of standards. Thus, the developments
    of IoT as an intelligent system can be proceeding with interoperability, energy
    sustainability, privacy, and security. IoT have become an inevitable trend of
    development of information industry, which bound to bring new changes to our lives.

    Abstract: The 21st century has seen rapid changes in technology, industry, and\
    \ social patterns. Most\nindustries have moved towards automation, and human intervention\
    \ has decreased, which has led\nto a revolution in industries, named the fourth\
    \ industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Industry 4.0 or\nthe fourth industrial\
    \ revolution (IR 4.0) relies heavily on the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless\n\
    sensor networks (WSN). IoT and WSN are used in various control systems, including\
    \ environmental\nmonitoring, home automation, and chemical/biological attack detection.\
    \ IoT devices and applications\nare used to process extracted data from WSN devices\
    \ and transmit them to remote locations. This\nsystematic literature review offers\
    \ a wide range of information on Industry 4.0, ﬁnds research gaps,\nand recommends\
    \ future directions. Seven research questions are addressed in this article: (i)\
    \ What\nare the contributions of WSN in IR 4.0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the major types of network intruders\nin WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the prominent network security attacks in WSN and IoT?\n(vi) What\
    \ are the signiﬁcant issues in IoT and WSN frameworks? and (vii) What are the\
    \ limitations\nand research gaps in the existing work? This study mainly focuses\
    \ on research solutions and new\ntechniques to automate Industry 4.0. In this\
    \ research, we analyzed over 130 articles from 2014\nuntil 2021. This paper covers\
    \ several aspects of Industry 4.0, from the designing phase to security\nneeds,\
    \ from the deployment stage to the classiﬁcation of the network, the difﬁculties,\
    \ challenges, and\nfuture directions.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); industrial\
    \ revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0); computer networks; network\nsecurity; wireless sensor\

    Smart technologies play a crucial role in sustainable economic growth. They transform\n\
    houses, ofﬁces, factories, and even cities into autonomic, self-controlled systems\
    \ without\nhuman intervention [1]. This modern automation trend and ever-increasing\
    \ use of cutting-\nedge technologies are boosting the world’s economy [2]. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT)\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22062087\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n2 of 36\nand Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSN) both play vital roles in this modernization [3]. IoT\n\
    is a branch of engineering primarily concerned with offering thousands of miniature,\n\
    physical connected objects, which may collaborate to achieve a shared goal. IoT\
    \ has gained\nmuch importance due to the abundant usage of these tiny networked\
    \ devices. These\nare smart, yet basic things that can sense and communicate wirelessly\
    \ [4]. WSN is a\ncollection of sensor and routing nodes, as shown in Figure 1,\
    \ which may be put together\nin the environment to predict physical conditions,\
    \ such as wind, temperature, and many\nothers. These networks collect and process\
    \ data from tiny nodes and then transfer it to\nthe operators. Figure 2 illustrates\
    \ that sensor networks are used in a variety of control\nsystems, including environmental\
    \ monitoring, home automation, chemical and biological\nassault detection, smart\
    \ grid deployment [5], surveillance, and many more. WSN also plays\na signiﬁcant\
    \ role in aquaculture and the oil industry, including data collection, offshore\n\
    exploration, disaster prevention, tactical surveillance, and pollution monitoring\
    \ [6–8].\nFigure 1. Architecture of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nFigure 2.\
    \ Application of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n3 of\
    \ 36\nWSN are often deployed in remote areas where human intervention is not possible\n\
    for post-deployment maintenance. Therefore, efforts are being made to enhance\
    \ their\nefﬁciency and durability [9]. There are many barriers to WSN deployment,\
    \ such as power\nconsumption–long-distance deployment. Due to automation trends\
    \ and applications devel-\noped, these barriers are no longer barriers for large-scale\
    \ remote deployment. In general,\nWSN follows a star topology to decrease the\
    \ network failure probability by connecting all\nsystems to a central node. While\
    \ ad-hoc networks follow mesh topology where each node\nis human-driven [10].\n\
    In physical production systems, grid and energy-saving applications minimize the\n\
    energy resources and noise pollution. In the last few decades, transportation\
    \ has improved\na lot with the usage of smart IoT devices, such as signals and\
    \ high-resolution cameras\non roads, which has led to an increase in trafﬁc ﬂow.\
    \ RFID readers are deployed at toll\nbooths that automatically deduct toll amounts\
    \ after reading RFID tags on vehicles. In the\ntransportation sector, smart vehicles\
    \ reduce the travelling time and also fuel consumption\nwith low cost of mobility\
    \ and reduced human efforts [11], atmospheric monitoring reduces\npollution, and\
    \ surveillance applications reduce crime. Nowadays, WSN also plays a role in\n\
    precision agriculture. On the other hand, WSN applications facilitate our day\
    \ to day lives,\nmaking them more comfortable, such as healthcare applications\
    \ that improve our health\nand longevity.\nBesides WSN, IoT has also played an\
    \ important role in human life. IoT and the digital\nage play essential roles\
    \ in overcoming social and physical barriers and providing ease\nand mobility\
    \ to people, resulting in improved and equal opportunities, and access to\ninformation\
    \ [12,13]. IoT also has many application areas such as agribusiness, climate,\n\
    clinical care, education, transportation, and ﬁnance, as shown in Figure 2.\n\
    In regard to information and communication technology, researchers are attracted\
    \ to\nIoT [14]. By adopting this essential technology, companies have become smarter,\
    \ more\ncompetitive, automated, and sustainable in the global supply chain. In\
    \ today’s competitive\nmarketplace, supply chains are struggling as they compete\
    \ with each other. Therefore,\nIoT devices are an effective way to authenticate,\
    \ monitor, and track products using GPS\nand many technologies [15,16]. Industry\
    \ 4.0 stands for the fourth industrial revolution\nin the digital age, it is associated\
    \ with virtualizing real-world scenarios of production\nand processing without\
    \ human intervention. This virtual world is linked to IoT devices,\nallowing the\
    \ creation of cyber–physical systems to communicate and cooperate [17,18].\nThis\
    \ fully connected manufacturing system—operating without human intervention by\n\
    generating, transferring, receiving, and processing necessary data to conduct\
    \ all required\ntasks for producing all kinds of goods—is one of Industry 4.0’s\
    \ key “constructs”. The con-\ncept of Industry 4.0 is based on the combination\
    \ of three main elements: people, things,\nand business [19]. A complete cyber–physical\
    \ production system created by the integration\nof IoT devices, things and objects\
    \ (IoT), sensor nodes (WSN), and people, is shown in\nFigure 3. CPS is a typical\
    \ example of Industry 4.0. IoT is the connection of smart devices,\nobjects, or\
    \ machines to the internet and with each other. In WSN systems, there is no direct\n\
    connection of these devices to the Internet. These systems can send their data\
    \ to the Internet\nby connecting several sensor nodes to a central routing node.\
    \ While CPS systems involve\nthe integration of IoT devices, computation, networking,\
    \ and physical process, IoT is an\nessential component of CPS. CPS systems are\
    \ key elements in the implementation of IR\n4.0 [20]. Industry 4.0 is the network-enabled\
    \ entity that automates the whole process of\nmanufacturing, connecting business\
    \ and processes. Market demands and the advance-\nments in new technologies are\
    \ transforming manufacturing ﬁrms’ business operations\ninto smart factories and\
    \ warehouses. Due to this automation, IoT devices are producing a\nmassive amount\
    \ of data daily, known as big data [21,22]. Statistics show that, at the end of\n\
    2021, there were more than 10 billion active IoT devices globally [23]. By 2030,\
    \ the number\nof active IoT devices is expected to exceed 10 billion to 25.4 billion.\
    \ By 2025, the data created\nby IoT devices will reach 73.1 ZB (zeta bytes) [24].\
    \ In 2020, the IoT industry was predicted\nto generate more than USD 450 billion,\
    \ including hardware, software, systems integration,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n\
    4 of 36\nand data services. By the end of 2021, it reached USD 520 billion. The\
    \ global amount\nexpected to be spent on the IoT in 2022 is USD 1 trillion. The\
    \ IoT industry is predicted to\ngrow to more than USD 2 trillion by 2027 [25,26].\
    \ The increasing number of devices and the\nusage by humans shows the importance\
    \ of IoT devices; moreover, the industry is growing\nand gaining revenue.\nFigure\
    \ 3. CPS system–integration of IoT, wireless devices, and people in Industry 4.0.\n\
    In this paper, we conduct a detailed systematic literature review on the applications\n\
    and contributions of IoT and WSN in Industry 4.0. We had a large corpus of data\
    \ to\nanalyze papers using systematic approaches. Among the selected articles,\
    \ we obtained\n22 articles describing the detailed review of existing security\
    \ techniques, applications used,\nadvantages/disadvantages, and limitations of\
    \ IoT and WSN. Most of them reviewed the\narticles in terms of application of\
    \ IoT and attacks only. The paper mainly focuses on research\nchallenges, issues,\
    \ limitations, and the future direction of IoT and WSN frameworks in\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0.\n1.1. Motivation\nThe primary motivation for performing SLR is the ever-increasing\
    \ trend of automation\nin Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is made up of both WSN technology\
    \ and IoT to digitize work.\nOver time, we see how digitization and technology\
    \ are replacing people in the workplace,\nand dramatically changing the global\
    \ workforce. Technology has brought ease to human\nlife and the efﬁciency of things\
    \ by making them eco-friendly, more agile, and productive.\nFrom smart cities\
    \ to smart industries, a drastic change has happened due to the intelligent\n\
    usage of IoT and WSN and IR 4.0. For example, a smart factory integrates virtual\
    \ and\nphysical systems and calibrating instruments to record their readings immediately.\
    \ In short,\nthe integration of IoT and WSN with Industry 4.0 has reduced labour\
    \ needs, freed humans\nfrom low-level skilled work, and improved the quantity\
    \ and quality of work. Therefore, To\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n5 of 36\nachieve\
    \ better analysis results, we systematically analyzed almost all research data\
    \ related\nto IoT and WSN domains in Industry 4.0.\n1.2. Contribution\nFrom smart\
    \ factories to individual lives, IoT and WSN play signiﬁcant roles. There are\n\
    many advantages, but security problems have arisen as these devices generate considerable\n\
    amounts of data daily. These papers amalgamated both sides: IoT and WSN contributions\n\
    and their security risks. This paper focuses more on the contributions of IoT\

    \ the state-of-the-art research studies on IoT and WSN.\nWith the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution, it is observed that communication, computation,\nand storage costs\
    \ have remarkably decreased, which make integration of IoT and WSN\npossible and\
    \ cost-effective globally. We studied many review articles and original research.\n\
    Existing review articles lack, in many aspects, research challenges, issues, limitations,\n\
    and future directions of IoT and WSN, but the systematic literature review (SLR)\
    \ given\nin this work is precise enough to deal with the aspects of IoT and WSN\
    \ area. Related\nwork of review papers is provided next. Moreover, Table 2 is\
    \ presented which shows the\ncomparison between the proposed research work and\
    \ the existing state-of-the-art analysis.\nTable 2. Comparative analysis of the\

    Key challenges and open\nissues of both IoT and\nWSN\nin\nIndustry\n4.0\nare discussed\n\
    ✓\nThe authors in [1] discussed the very novel technology “WiFi”. They discussed\n\
    how this technology helps IoT devices–used in various applications, such as smart\
    \ cities,\nhealthcare systems, and smart houses—communicate effectively. Landaluce\
    \ et al. [4]\ndiscussed RFID and WSN technology in detail. They discussed how\
    \ RFIDs are used to\ntrace devices while WSN gathers information about them from\
    \ interconnected devices. The\nauthors also discussed the obstacles and challenges,\
    \ such as energy consumption, fault-\ntolerant, communication interference, and\
    \ cost feasibility, along with detailed surveys. They\nprovided the advantages\
    \ and limitations of wearable sensor devices. Energy consumption\nis increasing\
    \ each day. Therefore, Dailipi [4] explored how IoT evolution has managed the\n\
    electricity consumption process and provided many beneﬁts to grid stations, consumers,\n\
    and suppliers. They also discussed the security issues and challenges after introducing\
    \ IoT\ndevices in smart grids.\nIn [6], the authors discussed how WSN advancement\
    \ had played a signiﬁcant role in\nUASN. They traced the location of sensor nodes\
    \ deployed underwater in the ocean using\nlocalization algorithms. They reviewed\
    \ many applications of UASN, their advantages\nand their disadvantages. They also\
    \ discussed the challenges they faced during deployment\nand presented future\
    \ directions in the acoustic area. In [10], researchers discussed the\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n8 of 36\napplications and advantages of WSN being deployed everywhere\
    \ due to their ﬂexible and\ndynamic nature. They discussed each application of\
    \ WSN in urban areas and their solutions.\nThey analyzed how WSN deployment in\
    \ urban areas demanded much more care and\nattention due to harsh weather and\
    \ perverse channel conditions.\nWSN is applicable in many domains, such as industrial\
    \ automation, and the require-\nment elicitation of the industrial process is\
    \ different from general WSN requirement gather-\nings. In [17], the authors presented\
    \ some standard protocols that were used to measure the\nrequirements of industrial\
    \ applications. They also provide solutions to WSN protocols by\ndiscussing MAC,\
    \ routing, and transport in detail. They also discussed the security issues\n\
    in detail and identiﬁed the unsolved challenges encountered during designing standard\n\
    protocols. In [19], the authors conducted SLR, which is mainly focused on scope\
    \ deﬁnition,\nconcept, literature review, analysis, synthesis, and future research\
    \ directions. Their selected\nstudy has contributed to eight thematic perspectives:\
    \ intelligence factories, CPS, data\nhandling, IT infrastructure, digital transformation,\
    \ HCI, IoT, and cloud [18].\nDue to the rapid evolution in IoT and WSN, technology\
    \ is becoming more vulnerable\nto security threats [42–44]. Therefore authors\
    \ in [27] presented threat models for the security\nof WSN and IoT devices communication.\
    \ In [28], the authors discussed IoT applications,\nadvantages, challenges, and\
    \ security issues from both technological and social perspectives.\nResearchers\
    \ have provided detailed architectures of IoT and WSN and discussions of\nIDS\
    \ system protocols. They also discussed the security challenges and attacks on\
    \ IoT\nand WSN communication devices. Moreover, in [29], the authors conducted\
    \ extensive\nresearch related to smart homes, applications, and IoT. They collected\
    \ 229 articles, analyzed\nthem thoroughly, and divided them into four categories.\
    \ They discussed smart home IoT\napplications in the ﬁrst category. The second\
    \ category concerned with IoT applications\nin smart home technology. In the third\
    \ category, they developed a framework to operate\nfurther. In the fourth category,\
    \ they developed smart IoT home applications.\nIoT has dramatically changed human\
    \ life, especially regarding communication devices\nintegrating technologies.\
    \ Traditional industry is changing in the digital industry, and WSN\nand wireless\
    \ sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are the core parts of Industry 4.0.\nIn\
    \ the article [30], the authors discussed the industrial wireless sensor network\
    \ (IWSN)\nand industrial wireless sensor and actuator network (IWSAN) in detail.\
    \ They discussed\nIWSAN requirements, applications, challenges, solutions, and\
    \ future directions in detail.\nIWSN/IWSAN are compelling technologies due to\
    \ their promising beneﬁts, such as low-\ncost deployment, less complexity, and\
    \ mobility support.\nIn [31], the authors discussed how IoT plays a vital role\
    \ in bringing the physical\nworld close to the digital world. They discussed technologies,\
    \ various challenges, future\ndirections, and various Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ applications.\nIn [32], Sharma et al. have described the sensor nodes according\
    \ to coverage point of\nview. They analyzed the full coverage issues by considering\
    \ node type, deployment type,\ncommunication and sensing range, and positioning-based\
    \ independent algorithms. They\nalso discussed the research challenges of WSN.\n\
    Andrey et al. [33] described a detailed survey on IDS systems and presented the\n\
    methods proposed for IoT. Using a cross-platform distributed approach, they analyzed\n\
    the IDS system, their platform differences, and current research trends in IDS.\
    \ In [34], the\nauthors analyzed and discussed the solutions to identify and detect\
    \ sinkhole attacks in the\nWSN domain. They discussed the advantages and limitations\
    \ of the proposed solution as\nwell. In [35], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ review on security attacks of WSN and IoT\nalong with their preventive measures,\
    \ mitigations, and detection mechanisms. They stated\nthat the integration of\
    \ IoT and WSN has raised new challenges and open security issues.\nAlthough technology\
    \ has increased, it has become prone to external attacks.\nIn [36], the authors\
    \ presented a review on the security of mobile networks. They\ndiscussed the integration\
    \ of WSN with IoT via the Internet and how the inter-connected\ndevices have guarded\
    \ networks against external attacks, keeping the router in a secure and\nprotected\
    \ environment. They discussed the attacks and their detection mechanisms over\
    \ the\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n9 of 36\nInternet. Similarly, the authors in [37]\
    \ have discussed the wormhole attack and its solution\nin IoT and WSN domains.\
    \ They stated that the detection algorithm performed much\nbetter for IoT (70%)\
    \ than WSN (20%). In [45], the authors discussed side-channel attacks\nin smartphones.\
    \ Similarly, the authors in [38] discussed the security threats, challenges,\n\
    and solutions in the IoT domain. While in [39], the authors analyzed existing\
    \ protocols for\nsecure communication between IoT devices. They also discussed\
    \ open issues and challenges\nraised during the communication of IoT devices and\
    \ future directions in IoT. The authors\nin [40] presented a detailed review regarding\
    \ deployment schemes, classiﬁcation, working,\nand comparative analyses of sensor\
    \ nodes. This growing technology trend has converged\nthe “world sense” from traditional\
    \ systems to CPS—this transition is called Industry 4.0.\nThe authors in [41]\
    \ conducted a bibliometric review of 12 different approaches of critical\naspects\
    \ of Industry 4.0.\nFrom the above-detailed literature review, we noticed that\
    \ authors and researchers\nhave worked on IoT and WSN, but the integration of\
    \ both IoT & WSN with Industry 4.0 is\nbenign. They discussed their applications,\
    \ security attacks, advantages, and limitations at\neach level.\nThe proposed\
    \ paper is more oriented towards the applications and contributions of\nIoT and\
    \ WSN in Industry 4.0, along with the security attacks, their challenges, and\
    \ open\nissues in each domain. This paper also provides the limitations and future\
    \ directions for\nIoT and WSN in Industry 4.0.\n3. Research Methodology\nThe SLR\
    \ followed in this work is based on the template of IEEE SLR; all research\nsteps\
    \ and guidelines were followed using the same template. The research process and\n\
    results were manually evaluated by comparing different research methods and techniques\n\
    presented by different authors based on efﬁciency, security, limitations, and\
    \ performance.\nFirst, we formulated our research questions based on the reviewed\
    \ articles and then\nsearched for these keywords in various databases. Using avoidance\
    \ and consideration\ncriteria, only relevant papers were considered. Then, we\
    \ evaluated the quality of the papers,\nand then extracted the relevant features.\n\
    3.1. Planning Review\nThe planning of the review was based on the research questions\
    \ and their objectives.\nAnalyzes of IoT and WSN were conducted to show their\
    \ importance in daily life. The use of\nsmart and appropriate devices has been\
    \ studied in this ﬁeld but still needs critical analysis.\nTherefore, it is important\
    \ to make a systematic review article in this realm, especially\nrelated to IoT\
    \ and WSN, to show future directions. Therefore, we established the search\ntechnique,\
    \ search strings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and quality assessment criteria\
    \ for\nthe papers collected from different repositories. Figure 4 shows the step\
    \ of our proposed\nreview planning process.\nFigure 4. Planning process of systematic\
    \ literature review (SLR).\n3.2. Research Goals\nThe main objective of this study\
    \ is to ﬁnd out the major contributions, solved problems,\nand challenges of IoT\
    \ and WSN in Industry 4.0. In addition, the research gap and limitations\nof current\
    \ work in these areas helped us ﬁnd room for improvement; we also explored\nfuture\
    \ directions and possible outcomes in this area. We designed questionnaires on\
    \ these\ndomains to ﬁnd high quality research papers. Some of them are listed\
    \ in Table 3. In addition,\nwe answer the research questions in Table 3 and in\
    \ Section 4 .\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n10 of 36\nTable 3. Research questions.\n\

    \ of Primary Studies\nIt was a challenge to search the speciﬁc and limited computer\
    \ science/engineering\ndatabases to get a “complete picture” of the research questions.\
    \ After formulating the\nresearch questions, we collected research papers from\
    \ various repositories, such as IEEE\nXplore, ACM, Wiley Online Search, Elsevier,\
    \ etc. The papers from electronic databases\nwith the areas of IoT, WSN, and Industry\
    \ 4.0 were efﬁciently evaluated. Figure 5 shows the\nnames of the repositories\
    \ where the research articles were collected from 2014 to June 2021.\nFigure 5.\
    \ Repositories versus number of studies Used.\n3.4. Selection/Search Criteria\n\
    This SLR combines three domains: IoT, WSN, and Industrial Revolution 4.0, so the\
    \ search\nstrings were related to each domain and its applications in Industry\
    \ 4.0. Table 4 shows the\nsubject search strings used to search for relevant articles.\
    \ The search strings were divided into\nfive groups to search for relevant articles\
    \ from reputable journals and conferences.\nTable 4. Search strings.\nSr. No.\n\

    \ research articles were found on the mentioned domains, IoT, WSN and IR 4.0.\n\
    To extract the most relevant and concise data from these articles, the following\
    \ criteria were\nchosen, as shown in Table 5. The publicly available papers written\
    \ in English and related\nto the search strings and research objectives in IoT,\
    \ WSN, and IR 4.0 published between\n2014 and 2021 were considered for further\
    \ SLR tracking.\nTable 5. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nInclusion Criteria\n\
    1\nInclude only those papers written in the English language.\n2\nInclude papers\
    \ that were published in 2014–2021.\n3\nInclude papers that reﬂected enough knowledge\
    \ about the search strings and search objectives.\n4\nInclude papers whose titles,\
    \ keywords, abstracts, and conclusions provided enough information related to\n\
    WSN, IoT, and IR 4.0.\n5\nInclude papers whose content focused on WSN, IoT, and\
    \ IR 4.0 content and provided in depth insights.\nExclusion Criteria\n1\nExclude\
    \ papers written in a language other than the English language.\n2\nExclude gray\
    \ papers.\n3\nExclude papers that were not published within 2014–2021.\n4\nExclude\
    \ research papers containing less than three pages.\n5\nExclude papers that failed\
    \ to meet the inclusion criteria.\n3.6. Selection Results\nAs mentioned earlier,\
    \ the downloaded articles were based on the initial screening\nprocesses, which\
    \ were based on inclusion criteria. The articles were screened using the\ninitial\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC). The main objective of using the QAC was to\n\
    ensure that the primary studies selected were appropriate to address the concerns\
    \ of\nprevious studies. Nearly 300 articles were found on the above topics. After\
    \ applying\na duplication ﬁlter, 40 articles were discarded, leaving 260 articles\
    \ that were reviewed\nbased on the above exclusion criteria. In the next step,\
    \ 60 articles were excluded based\non the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A quality\
    \ analysis was performed for the remaining\n200 articles. After the quality analysis,\
    \ only 120 articles were reviewed. Figure 6 shows\nthe year-by-year distribution\
    \ of articles reviewed that were used for the SLR study. There\nis no doubt that\
    \ the eliminated articles contained valuable material, but they were not\nstudied\
    \ because they did not meet the screening criteria. The number of articles was\n\
    initially limited to 120, after which they were stored in the citation manager\
    \ software for\ninformation synthesis.\nThe selected papers were evaluated against\
    \ the quality assessment criteria (QAC)\nlisted in Table 6. Table 6 shows the\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC) used to screen the\narticles for response\
    \ grading. Studies selected for screening are described in Table 7. Studies\n\
    with a score greater than or equal to 80 were selected according to the grading\
    \ criteria\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n12 of 36\nFigure 6. Year-wise\

    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n18 of 36\n4.1. RQ1: Contributions of WSN in IR 4.0\nThe use\
    \ of WSN has attracted a lot of attention in industry. Because of their prevalence\n\
    and use in industry, WSN have given rise to IWSN and IWSAN, respectively. These\
    \ net-\nworks enable autonomous work without human intervention. The in-network\
    \ transmission\ncharacteristics are fundamental properties of WSN. Sensor nodes\
    \ do not transmit raw\ndata, but integrate it to save communication costs. Due\
    \ to their unique properties and\nwide range of applications, they are used in\
    \ many systems, such as military, surveillance,\nhome automation, smart cities,\
    \ smart buildings, and healthcare monitoring [27]. WSN- and\nIoT-based devices\
    \ are used to create reliable, realistic, efﬁcient, ﬂexible, and economical\n\
    smart cities and buildings in heterogeneous environments [48].\nFigure 8. Taxonomy\
    \ of existing studies.\nThe categories discussed in this paper and the contribution\
    \ of WSN in IR 4.0 are\nlisted in the form of a taxonomy presented in Figure 8.\
    \ WSN is also used in health care\nmanagement systems to monitor medically ill\
    \ patients, periodically check their various\nmeasurements such as blood glucose\
    \ levels and pulse, and wirelessly transmit this in-\nformation to a central repository\
    \ for further diagnosis [49]. WSN is also used to assist\nelderly and disabled\
    \ people. Disabled people are informed of relevant information about\nreal-time\
    \ activities using smart devices, such as wristwatches [28,50]. In recent decades,\n\
    WSN have been applied in many ﬁelds, including transportation, agriculture [51],\
    \ automa-\ntion, manufacturing process control, and supply chain management. In\
    \ addition, WSN\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n19 of 36\ncan be easily deployed, have\
    \ low construction cost, no expenditure on wiring, and lower\ncomplexity [52,53].\n\
    WSN can be used in various manufacturing applications, such as industrial control,\n\
    process automation, rescue, and defense. WSN is also used to control and automate\n\
    industrial processes known as actuators. They can operate independently of a physi-\n\
    cal environment deﬁned by predeﬁned dimensions [54]. WSN is used to collect, track,\n\
    and record data in smart factories. Data acquisition is usually done by product\
    \ informa-\ntion in smart factories. After data collection, processing is done\
    \ by intelligent machines\nand manufacturing systems. Nowadays, these factories\
    \ are self-sufﬁcient, cost-effective,\nand automated by integrating wireless communications\
    \ with existing private networks\nand reducing labor [30].\nIn software, WSN takes\
    \ maximum advantage of wireless technologies used to build\nindustrial network\
    \ infrastructure [55]. On the other side, Industry 4.0 is integrating big data\n\
    analytics and cloud services [56], 3D printing, computer security, autonomous\
    \ robotics, the\nInternet of Things (IoT), 5G, Augmented Reality (AR), and modeling\
    \ [57,58].\n4.2. RQ2: Contributions of IoT in IR 4.0\nAn integrated digital system\
    \ would introduce a new intelligent and economical man-\nufacturing process using\
    \ cutting-edge technology for a variety of existing items and pro-\ncesses [59].\
    \ The data collected from production process warehouses and consumer in-\nformation\
    \ can be critically analyzed to make a decision in real time under Industry 4.0.\n\
    The real-time decision-making capability of each small and medium organization\
    \ enables\nthem to efﬁciently accept new technologies [60,61]. Industrial IoT\
    \ delivers solutions and\nservices that provide insights into an organization’s\
    \ ability to monitor and control its oper-\nations and assets. IIoT software and\
    \ tools provide important solutions for better process,\nlayout scheduling, organization,\
    \ and administration.\nIn addition, IIoT enables real-time and decision-making\
    \ features among numerous\nnetworked devices that can communicate and interact\
    \ with each other [62]. Because of\nthe rapid communication and data transfer,\
    \ attackers can attack data and cause harm to\nan organization, resulting in cyber\
    \ attacks. Cyber attacks have become a major challenge\nfor the industrial Internet\
    \ of Things (IIoT). Therefore, integrating IoT with Industry 4.0\nplays a critical\
    \ role in securing IoT devices from attacks. Unique security objectives and\n\
    challenges of IIoT have been introduced to overcome industrial-level issues. IIoT\
    \ challenges\nand objectives relate to IoT being used by consumers and its capabilities\
    \ leading to longer\nlife of IoT devices and sensor nodes. In [63], the authors\
    \ analyzed security challenges\nand attacks at three levels of the network (perception,\
    \ network, and application). They\nconsidered cryptographic challenges, authentication,\
    \ network monitoring, and access\ncontrol mechanisms. The IIoT also addresses\
    \ local network connectivity and protection\nfrom attackers inside. Cyber attacks\
    \ have become a serious challenge for the IIoT. Hackers\nattack infrastructure/devices\
    \ through intrusion and hiding, resulting in poor performance.\nA bidirectional\
    \ long and short term memory network with a multi-feature layer has been\ndeveloped\
    \ to avoid temporal attacks. Machine learning-based networks that learn temporal\n\
    attacks from historical data and make associations with test data can effectively\
    \ identify\nand detect different attacks within different intervals [64].\nDL-IIoT\
    \ has enormous potential to improve data processing and contribute to IR 4.0.\n\
    Similarly, machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, are widely\
    \ used for\nmalware detection and security threat protection [65]. Deep learning\
    \ algorithms are also\nused for intelligent analysis and processing. Deep learning\
    \ [46]algorithms such as CNN,\nauto-encoders, and recurrent neural networks have\
    \ applications such as intelligent assem-\nbly and manufacturing, network monitoring,\
    \ and accident prevention. The application\nof deep learning algorithms in IIoT\
    \ has also enabled various smart applications such as\nmanufacturing, active attack\
    \ detection and prevention systems, smart meters, and smart\nagriculture [66].\
    \ DL-IIoT relies heavily on data collection, which affects the privacy of the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2087\n20 of 36\norganization’s data. Therefore, differentiated\
    \ privacy is used to protect user privacy, reduce\nprivacy risk, and achieve high\
    \ performance in IIoT.\nOn the other hand, IoT and IIoT must provide “differentiated\
    \ privacy” for individuals\nand industrial data [67–69]. The contribution of IoT\
    \ in Industry 4.0 has improved the\naverage availability and sustainability of\
    \ the enterprise by knowing market trends and\ndecreasing unanticipated downturns\
    \ [70]. The taxonomy of existing studies and the\ncontribution of IoT in IR 4.0\
    \ is shown in Figure 8.\n4.3. RQ3: Type of WSN Coverage Area for IR 4.0\nWSN coverage\
    \ is an important factor in sensor quality. Sensing and connectivity\nare key\
    \ features of WSN. The former indicate how well a particular sensor behaves and\n\
    monitors a particular area of interest in which it is deployed. Connectivity shows\
    \ how\nwell different nodes communicate with each other. The types of wireless\
    \ sensor network\ncoverage are as follows.\n4.3.1. Area Coverage\nSensors usually\
    \ perform well in area coverage and monitors the ﬁeld of interest (FoI).\nThis\
    \ is also called “blanket coverage” because each node communicates with others.\
    \ Each\nsensor is placed so that the coverage of the other WSN sensors covers\
    \ each other [32].\n4.3.2. Barrier Coverage\nBarrier coverage of the sensor network\
    \ comes into play when some intruders try to\nbreach the security layer of the\
    \ network. Sensors are easy to handle and deploy; therefore,\ntheir wireless nature\
    \ makes them vulnerable to malicious security attacks [71]. The sensor\nnodes\
    \ are primarily distributed throughout the network and are deployed in chains\
    \ to\ndetect interruptions.\n4.3.3. Point Coverage\nPoint coverage aims to ﬁnd\
    \ a target within range using nearby nodes. It is also known\nas target coverage.\
    \ It is characterized by consuming less energy in a given zone than in the\nentire\
    \ region of the FoI. Only a few targets are covered by individual nodes, while\
    \ other\ntargets can be detected under other sensor scopes. The primary goal is\
    \ to select a speciﬁc\ntarget within the FoI to reduce energy consumption [71].\n\
    4.4. RQ4: Classiﬁcation of Network Intruders\nThere are two main types of intruders:\
    \ internal and external. Internal intruders are\npeople inside the organization;\
    \ they can be either a customer or a legitimate user, such\nas an employee of\
    \ the organization’s network. External intruders are people outside the\norganization,\
    \ whether external or internal. Each intruder can be involved in numerous\nillegal\
    \ activities, working alone, as a group, or with agencies. These entities are\
    \ described\nin detail below.\n4.4.1. Solo Entities\nSolo entities are those that\
    \ work alone with minimal safety. They are usually experts\nin their domains by\
    \ employing a single piece of code as equipment, such as viruses,\nworms, and\
    \ sniffers to misuse frameworks. They usually gain access to the organization’s\n\
    framework through hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually\
    \ little,\nand attacks are slightly less critical. Moreover, large and complex\
    \ systems that may contain\nﬂaws are more vulnerable to attacks. Monetary institutions\
    \ are also more exposed to attacks\nas they exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.2. Organized Groups\nSolo entities are those who work alone with minimal security.\
    \ They are usually experts\nin their ﬁeld, using a single piece of code as equipment,\
    \ such as viruses, worms, and sniffers\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n21 of 36\nto abuse\
    \ frameworks. They generally gain access to the organization’s framework through\n\
    hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually small, and attacks\
    \ are\nsomewhat less critical. In addition, large and complex systems that may\
    \ contain ﬂaws are\nmore vulnerable to attack. Monetary institutions are also\
    \ more exposed to attacks because\nthey exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.3. Intelligence Agencies\nIntelligent agencies from other countries are involved\
    \ in this type of attack. These\nagencies constantly seek to test the military\
    \ architecture of other nations, including contem-\nporary monitoring and covert\
    \ political and military activities. To do so, they require many\nresources, from\
    \ software to hardware, research, development, personnel, and ﬁnances.\nBecause\
    \ they have all these resources at their disposal, some agencies now pose a serious\n\
    threat to economic and military espionage. Such organizations pose the greatest\
    \ threat to\nnetworks and must be closely monitored to protect the nation’s important\
    \ assets [73].\n4.5. RQ5: Network Security Attack in IoT and WSN Layers\nThreats\
    \ become more attractive and dangerous as technology increases. Although new\n\
    security mechanisms are being developed, intruders can easily ﬁnd other ways to\
    \ attack\nsystems. Table 8 explains the network security attacks in the IoT and\
    \ WSN domains.\nThe attacks are categorized according to the open system interconnection\
    \ (OSI) layered\npoint of view [74].\nTable 8. Network Security Attacks on IoT\

    5\nApplication layer\nSpooﬁng, alter routing attack, false data ejection, path-based\
    \ DoS.\n4.5.1. Denial of Service Attacks (DOS)\nA Denial-of-service (DoS) attack\
    \ is a malicious attack in which attackers make the\nvictim’s system unresponsive\
    \ and difﬁcult to reach for the legitimate user by making many\nrequests to the\
    \ expected URL than the server can handle [75,76]. DoS attacks typically occur\n\
    when authenticated clients have not been granted access to the information or\
    \ service [77].\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a type of DoS\
    \ attack that uses multiple users\nor infected systems to attack a victim’s system\
    \ or to attack a website so that it becomes\nunresponsive. This attack also prevents\
    \ the website from functioning properly and disrupts\nregular trafﬁc. In WSN,\
    \ a DDoS attack changes the routing protocol information DSR,\nresulting in a\
    \ huge amount of unauthorized trafﬁc and making the network/website\nunavailable.\
    \ On the other hand, a low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attack is another type\n\
    of DoS that penetrates the WSN’s routing protocol, thus compromising the security\
    \ and\ntrust mechanisms. An LDoS attack is difﬁcult to detect due to its non-stationary\
    \ nature and\nlow signal strength52. In this attack, illegitimate trafﬁc affects\
    \ the operational capability of\na network. It causes severe outages and monetary\
    \ losses.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n22 of 36\n4.5.2. Replay Attacks\nWhen an attacker\
    \ replays a ﬂood of messages between the sender and the receiver,\nupdating the\
    \ line table (DT) to steal information, it is called a replay attack [33]. It\
    \ is a\nnetwork layer attack in which a third party intercepts the data during\
    \ transmission. The\nattacker retransmits this data by either modifying or delaying\
    \ it, spooﬁng the sender’s IP\naddress to the attacker’s IP address, and impersonating\
    \ the legitimate sender.\n4.5.3. Trojan Worms, Viruses, and Malware\nAn attacker\
    \ can use malicious software to manipulate data, steal information, or\neven launch\
    \ a denial-of-service attack on a device. A worm, such as a Trojan horse, can\n\
    infect one’s computer when one downloads a ﬁle or receives an update. The worm\
    \ then\nmultiplies and attacks other machines on the network. Unlike a virus,\
    \ many Trojan horses\nusually reside on one’s own computer. A virus can infect\
    \ the host’s ﬁle when sent via\nemail and then spread to other users [78]. Malware\
    \ is malicious content that can interfere\nwith a computer’s operation and slow\
    \ its performance. When data from IoT devices is\ncompromised, malware can infest\
    \ the cloud or data centers. These attacks breach the\nprimary security mechanisms\
    \ of any OS/server, such as a ﬁrewall and window defender.\n4.5.4. Black Hole\
    \ Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack known as a packet drop attack. In this\
    \ attack, a node\nsends an RREQ packet to all its neighbors in the network, and\
    \ the router is supposed to\nforward the packet instead of discarding it. The\
    \ nature of this attack is similar to a DDoS\nattack. Attackers are used to attack\
    \ routers by sending many false requests to prevent\nlegitimate routers from forwarding\
    \ packets. This is also called a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served\nattack because the attacker\
    \ can also use a malicious router or reprogram it to block packets\ninstead of\
    \ sending correct information [78]. These attacks reduce the average throughput.\n\
    When combined with a sinkhole attack, this attack affects performance and stops\
    \ all trafﬁc\naround the black hole. When combined with the sinkhole attack, this\
    \ attack severely\ndegrades trafﬁc and modiﬁes or discards content during transmission.\n\
    4.5.5. Sink Hole Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack where attackers attract\
    \ all network trafﬁc from nearby\nnodes to a compromised node and appear as attractive\
    \ and trusted nodes. This attack\nis also used to initiate other attacks such\
    \ as spooﬁng attacks, DoS, and modiﬁcation of\nrouting information in WSN [34].\
    \ When combined with selective routing and worm attacks,\nsinkhole attacks become\
    \ even more dangerous. A sinkhole attack is initiated in two ways,\neither by\
    \ hacking a node within the network or by a malicious node impersonating itself\n\
    as the shortest path to the base station [35,36]. A sinkhole attack impacts the\
    \ routing\nconﬁguration/protocols of the forwarding node. Due to this behavior,\
    \ it is considered as an\nerror or malicious node by the neighboring nodes, which\
    \ affects the network performance.\nThis leads to mis-routing and incorrect displays\
    \ of the routing protocol.\n4.5.6. Wormhole Attacks\nA wormhole attack is a network\
    \ layer attack in which an invader attacks the WSN\nthrough two or more compromised\
    \ nodes. The invaders forward the data from one\nmalicious node to another node\
    \ at the end of the network through the tunnel. The wormhole\nappears to other\
    \ nodes as a ﬁctitious neighbor. Wormhole nodes usually transmit data\ndirectly\
    \ from one node to the destination without including other nodes in the path.\
    \ Due\nto this nature, other nodes in WSN easily trust those closest to other\
    \ nodes, which causes\nmany routing problems. Moreover, they can build better\
    \ communication channels for\nlong-range communication [37]. Wormhole attacks\
    \ affect the performance of many network\nservices, such as time synchronization,\
    \ localization, and data fusion.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n23 of 36\n4.5.7. Selective\
    \ Forwarding (Gray Hole)\nA selective forwarding attack (SFA) is a special type\
    \ of black hole attack in which\nthe compromised node drops some selective packets\
    \ instead of all packets. Invaders drop\npackets containing critical information,\
    \ such as military information, without noticing them\nor allowing others that\
    \ may contain non-critical information to pass. This can lead to worse\neffects\
    \ and a decrease in network efﬁciency [34–37]. Selective forwarding attacks impact\n\
    network performance and consume limited energy resources.\n4.6. RQ6: Issues in\
    \ WSN and IoT Frameworks\nIn this section, we mention various WSN and IoT frameworks\
    \ that highlight the\nimportance of WSN and IoT in different aspects of life.\
    \ Although many advances have\nbeen made in IoT, there are still many problems,\
    \ as shown in Figure 9, that need to be\nreduced and solved efﬁciently to avoid\
    \ any damage [79,80].\nFigure 9. Issues in WSN and IoT Framework.\n4.6.1. Security\n\
    Security is essential for any organization to protect its environment, systems,\
    \ devices\nand applications from outside attacks. Data and communication technologies\
    \ are increasing\nevery day. Therefore, data and information security are necessary\
    \ tasks [81]. In addition to\ndata, its transmission over the network should also\
    \ be protected. Although technology has\nevolved and security mechanisms have\
    \ improved, attackers have still found many ways to\nbreach the security level\
    \ [38,39]. With the increasing number of IoT devices, new security\nissues have\
    \ emerged. For real-time applications, the most important thing is to keep the\n\
    WSN secure. The network and its associated router or hub should enforce an access\
    \ control\nmechanism to prevent unauthorized users. Each node connected to another\
    \ node is security\nrelevant, whether it is a restricted device or a smart device.\
    \ Acceptance, conﬁrmation,\ncategorization, trust, and information security are\
    \ the most important security requirements\nto be considered in IoT networks and\
    \ WSN. It is challenging to provide security measures\nfor ﬂexible detection devices.\
    \ Therefore, protecting information from dictatorial forces or\nillegal access\
    \ is called security [82,83].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n24 of 36\n4.6.2. Data Conﬁdentiality\
    \ and Privacy\nData conﬁdentiality is a signiﬁcant issue in IoT and network security.\
    \ In IoT frame-\nworks, the client gains access to the information and system\
    \ management in an unintended\nenvironment due to issues such as the use of sensor\
    \ nodes. Attackers can physically capture\nthem and extract data using an energy\
    \ analysis attack [84]. Refurbished devices made from\nthese captured devices\
    \ can launch new attacks and violate security. Therefore, the IoT\ndevice should\
    \ verify whether or not the user or device has been granted permission to\naccess\
    \ the system. The practice of controlling access to data by granting or denying\
    \ permis-\nsion based on a set of laws. Many devices/clients must be authenticated\
    \ by management\nto access the system. Data conﬁdentiality and access are the\
    \ main issues in the Internet\nof Things (IoT). Researchers are trying to ﬁgure\
    \ out how to handle the personalities of\ncustomers, items/articles, and devices\
    \ in a secure manner. Due to the ubiquitous nature\nof IoT and WSN systems, privacy\
    \ and conﬁdentiality are major concerns in IoT devices\nand frameworks. Some issues,\
    \ such as snifﬁng and spooﬁng, unauthorized access, data\nchanging, forging, and\
    \ unapproved alteration of IoT and WSN nodes, pose signiﬁcant\nuncertainties in\
    \ IoT. An attacker can use various IoT devices and applications to capture\nsensitive\
    \ and personal data that is visible to outsiders.\n4.6.3. Data Acquisition and\
    \ Transmission\nThe primary goal of IoT is to collect data and transmit it to\
    \ where it is needed in a\nnetwork. Sensors are the devices used to collect data\
    \ from the environment to transmit it to\nthe base station. After the raw data\
    \ is collected, it is sent to the Sink Hub for processing. Data\ncollection and\
    \ transmission are other problems in IoT and WSN because data is exposed\nand\
    \ modiﬁed during transmission. Data acquisition is an energy-consuming process,\
    \ so\nextra care must be taken during gathering and transmission. Intruders can\
    \ steal the data\nduring transmission if it is not encrypted or transmitted over\
    \ a secure channel. The intruder\ncan take over a node and reprogram it with a\
    \ malicious code, damaging the entire network.\nTherefore, security is required\
    \ for this process. Sometimes intruders attack the databases of\norganizations\
    \ to violate the conﬁdentiality of the data [85]. Also, the intruder may destroy\n\
    the node or collect important or unusual information that could be used against\
    \ the system.\nFor this reason, researchers present many security mechanisms.\
    \ They protect end-to-end\ncommunication links using one-time-pad (OTP) encryption\
    \ method and also identify the\nvulnerabilities in the DBMS application using\
    \ SEPTIC method.\n4.6.4. Resource Limitations\nIf necessary resources in WSN and\
    \ IoT are abandoned or not handled efﬁciently, it may\naffect the performance\
    \ of the network. The network consists of many nodes and sensors that\nrequire\
    \ energy to operate well [86]. Various MAC layer protocols have been developed\
    \ to\nreduce the energy consumption of sensors or nodes. These energy-efﬁcient\
    \ algorithms work\nprimarily by regulating the synchronization of network trafﬁc\
    \ over time and the time period\nduring which a node becomes active in a network\
    \ [87,88]. In contrast, the communication\nmedium is another basic requirement,\
    \ since nodes rely on the Internet for data transmission.\nThere is a constant\
    \ need for energy, otherwise the network will fail. The nodes have limited\nresources\
    \ because battery capacity, correspondence capacity, and computing power are low.\n\
    Again, security is the main problem, because the security measurement expenses\
    \ require\nmore resources to maintain the speed of the network, which is not affordable.\
    \ As a result of\nlow regulated security, attacks can subvert software execution\
    \ and protocols used in the\nnetwork [89,90].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n25 of 36\n\
    4.6.5. Quality of Service\nQuality of Service (QoS) manages networks and resources\
    \ to strengthen IoT connec-\ntivity. QoS manages delay, jitter, reliability, and\
    \ bandwidth by classifying network trafﬁc.\nIt plays an important role in optimizing\
    \ systems. Quality of Service means that energy\nefﬁciency, reliability, bit error\
    \ rate, and latency should be good enough to capture data\nover a network. Therefore,\
    \ it is classiﬁed in two ways: program-speciﬁc and network-\nspeciﬁc. The QoS\
    \ perspective of the network refers to the effective management of network\nresources\
    \ and transmission performance, while the perspective of the program refers to\n\
    mobility, time synchronization, and sampling parameters. Similarly, many algorithms\
    \ have\nbeen developed to distribute heavy trafﬁc evenly, and the energy consumption\
    \ load in a\nnetwork uses a cluster-head approach to achieve high performance\
    \ and efﬁciency [91].\n4.6.6. Tampering\nSensors can be placed either indoors\
    \ or outdoors. Indoor sensors can be easily man-\naged and protected, while outdoor\
    \ sensors are more vulnerable to attackers due to remote\nlocations with poor\
    \ security, harsh climates, etc 78. The probability that these sensors will\n\
    be physically attacked is much higher; therefore, physical protection cannot be\
    \ guaranteed.\nA DoS attack manipulates the network by breaking the connection\
    \ or changing the current\nnetwork. The attacker can also replace the original\
    \ node with a fake or malicious node,\ncausing a severe attack on the network\
    \ [92]. In a Sybil attack, a malicious node penetrates\neach cluster head of the\
    \ network and affects the operation of the routing protocol. Com-\npromised nodes\
    \ can be used to launch new attacks without exposing themselves [41,93].\nThese\
    \ nodes are difﬁcult to detect and isolate, allowing an attacker to alter data\
    \ or transmit\nmalware throughout the network that causes signiﬁcant damage [94].\
    \ Constant monitoring\nof the network is necessary to ensure that WSN nodes cannot\
    \ be tampered with and that\nnetwork performance remains stable [95].\n4.6.7.\
    \ Authorization and Authentication\nNodes are the building blocks of the Internet\
    \ of Things that must be deﬁned in the\nnetwork. Transmission between devices\
    \ and access to the entire network span a wide\nrange in IoT and WSN. IoT devices\
    \ perform role-based access control, and their devices are\nallowed to do only\
    \ what is required [96,97]. Devices and their data must be protected from\nphysical\
    \ and logical attacks on the network. Attacks on the DNS cache could affect the\n\
    overall performance of the network. Authentication is the process by which each\
    \ node on\nthe network can access data based on a ﬁxed connection to a server\
    \ or cloud-based server.\nIf the authentication process is not administered properly,\
    \ it will lead to security issues\nand questions. An attacker can easily access\
    \ the network and make it fail temporarily by\nmaking too many wrong attempts.\n\
    Authentication is complicated due to the massive proliferation of wireless media\
    \ and\nthe nature of sensor networks. Authentication is usually done using the\
    \ credentials of a\nlegitimate user [98,99]. However, this technique is not secure\
    \ enough. Therefore, passwords\nshould be changed regularly and computers should\
    \ not be left unattended to make this\ntechnique robust. Both the sender and the\
    \ recipient should perform authentication to verify\nthe origin of the communication\
    \ [100,101].\n4.7. RQ7: Limitations of the Literature Review\nIn this section,\
    \ Table 9 explains the proposed solutions of the work conducted by\nvarious authors\
    \ and the contributions with the limitations of their work are also described.\n\

    \ is that\nsensor nodes are less efﬁcient at\ncovering a large area to monitor\n\
    and cannot do real-time testing\nand the ﬁeld measurements of sen-\nsors.\nLi\
    \ et al. [113]\nEdge\ncomputing-\nenabled\nwireless\nsensor\nnetworks\nfor\nmultiple\n\
    data\ncollection tasks in\nsmart agriculture\nThey designed a data collection\
    \ al-\ngorithm considering data quality\nfactors in smart agriculture. Then\n\
    modeled the data collection pro-\ncess by merging WSN and IoT.\nThe developed\
    \ edge computing\ndriven framework [47] and data\ncollection algorithm were not\
    \ ca-\npable of collecting data in a real\nagriculture environment.\nKumar et\
    \ al. [114]\nCluster\ncentroid-\nbased\nenergy-\nefﬁcient\nrouting\nprotocol for\

    of developed frameworks in the\ntransportation system and mobile-\nbased IoT network.\n\
    5. Challenges and Open Issues\nIntelligent systems can address various problems\
    \ faced by industry, but there have\nbeen some challenges in integrating IoT and\
    \ WSN into Industry 4.0. Technological improve-\nments in IoT and WSN have increased\
    \ concerns about security and data management [96].\nAs more and more data is\
    \ generated, it is difﬁcult for factories and industries to manage\nit properly.\
    \ Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms have been implemented to manage Big Data\n\
    and make systems and devices act more intelligently. The algorithms are used to\
    \ process\nthe data in different time periods. For education, the data must be\
    \ shared in a central\nrepository, while enterprises are mainly reluctant to share\
    \ their private data due to poor\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n30 of 36\nand insufﬁcient\
    \ organizational support for data in Industry 4.0. There are also safety\nmanagement\
    \ issues in Industry 4.0 [116].\nBig data: The emergence of various technologies\
    \ and the explosion of their use have\nled to the outstanding development of Big\
    \ Data technology and processing. Every device\nproduces a huge amount of data.\
    \ Due to the growing amount of big data, the improve-\nments of Big Data packages\
    \ encounter limitations and demand situations that need to be\n“overcome” in order\
    \ to manage the amount of data used efﬁciently.\nAdapting to 6G: 6G is another\
    \ challenge for wireless sensor networks and the Internet\nof Things. Processing\
    \ power is a major challenge in developing low-power and low-cost\n6G devices.\
    \ In addition, 6G brings privacy and security challenges for WSN and IoT.\nUpdates:system\
    \ components could not be upgraded due to interoperability between\nprotocols,\
    \ systems, and their components. Therefore, systems are more vulnerable to attack\n\
    if any part of a single system from a network is infected in intelligent factories.\n\
    Environment: security is also a critical challenge in WSN [97,100,106]. WSN nodes\n\
    are not secure when deployed in a prone environment due to the wireless transmission\
    \ of\ndata. An attacker can access them from anywhere in the world and manipulate\
    \ them easily.\nInternet attacks can also affect the vulnerability of sensor nodes.\n\
    Supply chain management systems: IoT devices are spreading erery day, posing new\n\
    challenges to the integrity and scalability of supply chain management systems\
    \ [117,118].\nSimultaneously connecting IoT devices to the cloud or the Internet\
    \ requires a lot of access\ncontrol, fault tolerance, data management, privacy,\
    \ and security.\nLimited resources: are other challenges in WSN domain that affect\
    \ the energy of\nsensor nodes used in the network. Sensor nodes usually change\
    \ their mode from sleep to\nactive and vice versa. Therefore, sleep mode is considered\
    \ as \"outside the network\" while\nactive mode brings some other issues such\
    \ as energy consumption [119]. Due to the high\nenergy consumption, they also\
    \ became dead. Sensor nodes usually have limited power,\nprocessing, and memory.\
    \ In addition, sensor mobility is another problem that hinders the\nintegration\
    \ of mobile sensor nodes with the Internet.\n6. Future Directions\nIndustry 4.0\
    \ leads to the merging of people and technology to complement human\nactivities\
    \ with intelligent machines. Industry 4.0 will lead to customized human fashion\n\
    that will minimize the oversupply and unavailability of supplies or items. Human-machine\n\
    interaction will increase productivity and customer satisfaction with customized\
    \ products.\nThe next version of Industry 4.0 is Industry 5.0, which is expected\
    \ to be more user-\nfriendly and better integrate technology with society and\
    \ the environment. It depends\nmainly on robots. Robots are already the backbone\
    \ of manufacturing, and Industry 4.0\ntechnologies [120,121] provide ﬂexibility\
    \ in manufacturing. Industry 5.0 combines human\ncreativity and craftsmanship\
    \ with the speed, productivity (e.g., CPS) [122], and consistency\nof robots.\
    \ In this version, robots can be programmed to work alongside humans.\nSoft computing:\
    \ can be used to reduce the dimensions of these large dimensional\ndata sets [123].\
    \ Good features are essential to make efﬁcient decisions. This is the reason\n\
    why soft computing techniques are used to obtain useful features.\nExplainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI): can be used for interpretability of the deci-\n\
    sion made by the classiﬁcation model. Classiﬁcation models make decisions in a\
    \ black box\nwhere the user does not know how the decision is made. XAI converts\
    \ this black box into a\nwhite box and interprets the decision made by a model.\
    \ XAI increases user conﬁdence to\ntake further action [124].\nFederated learning\
    \ (FL): is an optimal choice for privacy preservation. FL works by\ntraining global\
    \ and local models on the edge device. The model on the edge device does\nnot\
    \ share the data with the global, thus keeping the data private at each edge device.\
    \ Only\nparameters are shared globally to retrain the global model and optimize\
    \ the inference\nresults [125,126].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n31 of 36\nSecure\
    \ devices: sensor nodes are designed to consume less energy and become active\n\
    when they are needed or an event occurs [59]. Further improvements are also needed\
    \ to\nprevent attacks from the Internet. While the IoT has no limitations in terms\
    \ of processing\nor energy. Due to the tremendous proliferation of IoT devices,\
    \ this paradigm is now being\nshifted from the IoT to the Internet of Everything.\n\
    Sustainability: IoT systems are now moving toward the idea of self-organization,\n\
    and systems are becoming capable of responding in an automated and adaptive manner\n\
    and dealing with changes and uncertainties in the environment [118].\nEducation\
    \ 5.0: in this digital era, education must also change from traditional to\nintegrating\
    \ hardware and software with co-bots to develop new skills and a smart society.\n\
    Educational institutes are now using pedagogical tools to provide a better experience.\n\
    Even though IoT-based education is still not widespread, there is still room for\
    \ further\nimprovement, such as sensor node coverage and efﬁciency, wireless data\
    \ transmission of\ndata [127], battery life, and high-cost nodes.\nGeneral directions:\
    \ there are many challenges. Future directions may address het-\nerogeneous interoperability\
    \ of systems, self-organization protocols, routing schemes for\nmanaging IoT networks,\
    \ data management [79], cross-platform optimization, and the\ndevelopment of network\
    \ security algorithms to secure wireless transmission from data\nmanipulation,\
    \ stealing, or hacking activities. On the hardware side, researchers are de-\n\
    veloping energy-efﬁcient sensor nodes [91,115], with net-zero power to reduce\
    \ maximum\npower consumption.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this digital and modern era,\
    \ technology is evolving every day. Due to the massive\nproliferation of technology,\
    \ IoT and WSN play an important role in Industry 4.0 to develop\nsmart applications,\
    \ design networked data centers, and build autonomous smart industries.\nData\
    \ networks have been created and improved with the help of new and smart devices.\n\
    In this systematic literature review, WSN and IoT network threats were analyzed\
    \ and a\ndescriptive comparative study was conducted. These networks are the main\
    \ attack surfaces\nfor attackers to draw meaningful patterns from system and user\
    \ data. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have\
    \ rapidly (and widely) evolved to meet\nthe increasing demand for conventional\
    \ application scenarios, such as plant automation\nand remote process control\
    \ systems. These smart devices are also being used to improve the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ existing networks and create new opportunities for automating and securing\n\
    industrial processes. In this article, we explore seven research questions: (i)\
    \ What are the\ncontributions of WSN in IR4. 0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the main types of network\nintrusions in WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the main network security attacks in\nWSN and IoT? (vi) What are\
    \ the major issues in IoT and WSN systems? (vii) What are\nthe limitations and\
    \ research gaps in the current work? The main purpose of the fourth\nindustrial\
    \ revolution with WSN and IoT explicitly shows that the evolutionary transition\n\
    needs to be intensiﬁed and extended to include emerging research areas and intimidating\n\
    technological challenges. This article covers all elements of WSN, from the design\
    \ phase\nto the security requirements, from the implementation phase to the classiﬁcation\
    \ of the\nnetwork, and from the difﬁculties and challenges of WSN. Future studies\
    \ will address\nthe problems in the coverage regions of wireless sensor networks\
    \ and provide effective\nsolutions to the existing problems and challenges in\
    \ this area. The use and application of\nWSN and IoT in Industry 4.0 involves\
    \ the processing of extracted data and the efﬁcient and\nsecure transmission of\
    \ this data to a remote location.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M.,\

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has been applied in many areas, such
    as smart farming [1], smart home [2], wearables [3], smart city [4], connected
    health [5], connected car [6], connected drones [7], among other areas. The IoT
    allows physical objects to communicate together, share information and coordinate
    decisions. The IoT transforms traditional objects into intelligent objects by
    exploiting its enabling technologies such as communication technologies, Internet
    protocols, application, and sensor networks [8], [9]. The global smart agriculture
    market is expected to reach 15.3billionbytheendof2025comparedto 5 billion in the
    year 2016 [10]. Smart agriculture will become an important IoT application area
    in agri-products exporting countries. Recently, the IoT application has been deployed
    for smart agriculture using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) such as irrigation
    sensor network [11], prediction of frost events [12], precision soil farming [13],
    blind entity identification [14], smart farming [15], and precision agriculture
    [16]. To develop a green IoT-based agriculture solution, there are six main challenges,
    including, hardware, data analytics, maintenance, mobility, infrastructure, data
    security, and privacy [17]. The hardware challenges concern the choice of sensors
    and meters for IoT devices. Therefore, there are various kinds of sensors types
    that can be used in IoT application (e.g., temperature sensor, proximity sensor,
    pressure sensor, water quality sensor, chemical sensor, gas sensor, humidity sensor…etc.).
    The data analytics challenge concern the application of predictive algorithms
    and machine learning (e.g., deep learning approaches) in IoT data to obtain a
    nutritive solution for smart agriculture. The maintenance challenge concerns regular
    sensors checks of all IoT devices since they can be easily damaged in the agriculture
    field. The mobility challenge concerns the type of wireless communication (e.g.,
    4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan, LoRa) that can connect sensors distributed over a large
    area in the agriculture field. The infrastructure challenges concern the installation
    and development of IoT networking architecture using new technologies such as
    fog computing, cloud computing, network virtualization…etc. The main problem in
    the development of green IoT-based agriculture is not located at the physical
    support but mainly in reassuring both security and privacy. With the adaption
    of green IoT-based agriculture, an adversary may find more ways to penetrate into
    the system (e.g., via a false data injection attack), raising new security and
    privacy issues and asking for more secure communications in the smart agriculture
    filed. According to Cha et al. [18], privacy-enhancing technologies in IoT application
    can be classified into seven categories, including, enforcement, control over
    data, personal data protection, anonymization or pseudonymization, partial data
    disclosure, anonymous authorization, and holistic privacy preservation. Therefore,
    security requirements [19] in IoT application can be classified into authentication,
    confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, and access control. These security
    and privacy requirements should be achieved by the security protocols for green
    IoT-based agriculture. There are related survey papers [9], [20]–[23] that focused
    on various aspects of IoT-based agriculture, as presented in Tab. I. Brewster
    et al. [20] presented a review on developing IoT-based large-scale pilots in agriculture.
    Ray [21] presented a systematic survey that covers the IoT deployment for improved
    farming. Recently, the surveys [22], [23] discussed the fundamental structures
    of IoT and its impact in the field of green IoT-based agriculture. However, these
    surveys are very limited regarding research challenges on security and privacy.
    In the literature, there are different related surveys that deal with IoT security.
    As shown in Table 2, we classify the IoT security surveys with respect to the
    following criteria: Threat model: It indicates whether the survey considered the
    threats against the IoT network. Security & Privacy: It indicates whether the
    survey focused considered the security and privacy countermeasures to protect
    the IoT network. Blockchain: It indicate whether the survey considered bloackanin-based
    solution for IoT security. Target IoT application: It indicates whether the survey
    focused on specific or general IoT applications. TABLE 1 Related Surveys on Green
    IoT-Based Agriculture TABLE 2 Related Surveys on IoT Security Most of the IoT
    security surveys [24]–[31] describe the required security and privacy countermeasures
    and target without focusing on any particular application. Some of them restrict
    their covered countermeasures to IoT security taxonomy [26], IoT frameworks [27],
    [30], security communication protocols [24], [25], or trust-based solutions [31].
    Some of the surveys describe the threat models that could comprise the security
    of IoT networks [26], [28], [29], [31]–[33]. Recently, blockchain-based solutions
    for IoT security have attracted more attention in [29], [34]–[36]. Kouicem et
    al. [35] present their security solutions and blockchain-based security solutions
    with respect to five IoT applications: Smart Grid, EHealth, Transportation, Smart
    city, and Manufacturing. Other surveys focused on industrial IoT [32], Smart Grid
    [37], or Smart Home [34]. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the first
    that thoroughly covers threats models, secuirty and privacy countermeasures, blockchain-based
    solutions for IoT security, and focuses only on Green IoT-based agriculture applications.
    Our contributions in this work are: We present a four-tier green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. We present the threat models against green IoT-based agriculture
    and provide a classification into five categories, including, attacks against
    privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity properties.
    We review the security and privacy solutions for IoT applications and how they
    will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. We analyze the privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solutions for IoT applications and how they will be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture. We provide the consensus algorithms for blockchain-based
    solutions and how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. We emphasize
    the security and privacy challenges solutions for green IoT-based agriculture.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the four-tier
    green IoT-based agriculture architecture. In Section III, we present the threat
    models against green IoT-based agriculture and provide a classification into five
    categories. In Section IV, we provide the new trends of security and privacy solutions
    for green IoT-based agriculture. In Section V, we clearly highlight the pros and
    cons of the existing privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions. Then, we discuss
    the security and privacy challenges solutions in Section VI. Lastly, Section VII
    presents conclusions. SECTION II. Green IoT-Based Agriculture Smart agriculture
    based on IoT technology has enabled farmers to improve crop yields, optimize irrigation
    efficiency, and reduce farming costs. It is an intelligent agricultural solution
    combining agriculture with modern information technology. The IoT technology has
    contributed to the emergence of the three aspects: Precision agriculture: is a
    technology which uses advanced technology to improve crop yield, among them, Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) is the main driver for the development of it [40]. It effectively
    reduces the potential risks in the production process and helps farmers making
    accurate and controlled farming practices by deploying a large number of low-power,
    multi-function, wireless communication sensors in environments (such as fields
    and open poultry and livestock breeding) and collecting relevant data in agricultural
    production (such as environment data, crop growth data, livestock health data
    [41]–[44]). The main modern information technology used in precision agriculture
    is “3S” technology, including Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System
    (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS). The most remarkable application of
    GPS in precision agriculture is agricultural drones, they are used in the agriculture
    industry to enhance the different farming practices [45]. The ground and aerial
    drones are used for assessment of crop health, crop monitoring, planting, crop
    spraying, and field analysis. Furthermore, with the integration of IoT and “3S”
    technology in open poultry and livestock breeding, it is possible to collection
    information about the location and health of cattle by attaching sensors to them,
    which allows to identify sick cattle and isolated them. The farmers can also reduce
    time and effort needed to locate their animals [46]. Generally, Precision agriculture
    constructs an expert decision system for agriculture production management to
    replace the subjective traditional agricultural production management method,
    thereby, (1) reasonable using of pesticides to reduce environmental pollution;
    (2) improving the efficiency of agricultural irrigation and reducing the waste
    of resources; (3) Planting crops in an environment suitable for their growth,
    improving the land usage; (4) analyzing the growth law of crops and livestock,
    maintaining their best growth state and greatly improving the output and quality
    of agricultural products. Facility agriculture: is an industrialized agricultural
    production mode that aims at good quality and high yield, belongs to a high-input,
    high-output, capital-intensive, technology-intensive and labor-intensive industry
    [47]. It provides a crop production protection facility created by engineering
    technology to achieve the goal that agricultural production is not restricted
    by environmental factors and automatic and efficient; frees traditional agriculture
    from the shackles of nature; breaks the seasonal characteristics of traditional
    agricultural products; meets the multi-level consumption demand derived from social
    development [48]. Facility agriculture can be divided into facility horticulture
    and farming in terms of types, they mainly use biotechnology, engineering, meteorological
    environment, IoT, computer technology and other technologies. Its core lies in
    the prediction model and decision management control system based on the historical
    data collected by IoT sensors. Facility agriculture has become a mainstay industry
    in some developed countries such as America, Netherlands and Japan, the most prominent
    example is the intelligent greenhouse. IoT sensors can be used to automatically
    monitor and control the internal climate parameters of the greenhouse [49]. The
    sensors collect and transmit real-time data to the farmer. If the values of parameters
    deviate from normal condition, some actions like automatic irrigation can be performed
    without, which helps in reducing the labor cost as no human intervention is needed.
    Aquaculture, poultry and livestock farming are similar with it, the difference
    is different environment factors require deployment of different IoT sensors and
    set up specific computer control cultivation schemes. The current development
    goal of facility agriculture is intelligent plant factory, it enables continuous
    and efficient crop production under fully enclosed and intelligent control conditions.
    Moreover, it frees crop growth from geographical constraints, shortens the production
    cycle of agricultural products and improves product quality and yield. It is one
    of the symbols of the combination of agriculture and industry, and also the development
    direction of agriculture in the future. Contract farming: is a new model of agricultural
    production and management. With the advancement of Urbanization in the world,
    the gap between rural and urban development is gradually widening. According to
    the statistics, 80% of the extreme poor and 75% of the moderate poor live in rural
    areas [50]. Relatively backward agricultural infrastructure, hidden dangers in
    the quality and safety of agricultural products and information isolation in agricultural
    products trading are the main reasons. To solve these problems, contract farming
    emerges as the times require. It outsources the production demand of some agricultural
    products to farmers in advance through customers, reduces the planting and breeding
    risks of growers and avoid blind production, is an effective market-oriented production
    and marketing model [51]. Contract farming includes supply chain management of
    agricultural products, traceability of agricultural products safety, agricultural
    products trading system, agricultural products logistics and the like. The IoT
    technology has been used in tracking the food supply chain (i.e., farm-to-fork
    traceability) [52]. For example, it has been employed to provide information about
    the product to the final consumer [53]. An IoT framework is proposed in [] to
    assess the freshness of fruits in e-commerce deliveries. In [54], IoT is used
    to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, in order to help consumers
    in making better purchase decisions. In [55], an early-warning system, which monitors
    food safety and warns about deterioration of product quality, is proposed. An
    IoT-based monitoring system is developed in [56] to provide geo-location information
    about food storage and transportation. Fig. 1 illustrates the four-tier green
    IoT-based agriculture architecture, which is based on the following four layers:
    1) Agriculture sensors layer; 2) Fog layer; 3) Core layer; 4) and Cloud layer.
    The layers are discussed as follows: FIGURE 1. Four-tier green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. Show All A. Agriculture Sensors Layer This layer consists of IoT-enabled
    devices (e.g., sensor nodes, smartphones, …etc.) equipped with Global Positioning
    System for creating different types IoTs for smart agriculture, including, IoTs
    for field agriculture, IoTs for the greenhouse, IoTs for the photovoltaic farm,
    IoTs for the solar insecticidal lamp, and others. Therefore, the integration and
    adaptation of IoT devices into various levels of agriculture aim to provide two
    goals. The first goal is to provide the reliability of manufacture as well as
    the distribution of the nutrient solution. The second goal is to provide better
    control in term of consumption, which gives the costs low and reduces losses in
    term of solution. In addition to the economic impact, the environmental impact
    will be significantly reduced. The farmer in the green IoT-based agriculture uses
    a digital control system (e.g., Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA))
    for process control to meet agriculture control requirements. To integrate IoTs
    for greenhouse, we propose the sensor and meters nodes for each equipment as follows:
    IoT devices for the water pumping system which takes into consideration the surfaces
    to be irrigated, the pressures to be expected, and the flow rates of drippers.
    Water meters for water storage in order to show real-time updates. IoT devices
    adapted for each filtering equipment (e.g., sand filter) which takes into consideration
    the physical properties of water as well as drippers. Fertilizers meters for the
    storage and injectors of fertilizers (e.g., NPK fertilizers) in order to provide
    real-time updates. IoT devices for controlling the pH and electrical conductivity
    to meet the desired value in term of nutrient solution. Small solar panels with
    IoT sensors for controlling moisture levels and temperature. These IoT devices
    and meters communicate via 5G cellular and satellite communication networks with
    the fog computing layer. B. Fog Computing Layer Since some agriculture IoT data
    need to be processed closer to IoT devices and meters, the fog computing layer
    is proposed especially for this task, which can significantly reduce the processing
    time. This layer is also termed as Edge computing layer. The fog nodes receive
    agriculture IoT data via geo-distributed devices that are managed in a distributed
    network, including, access points, gateway, router, and switch. The fog computing
    layer provides several advantages, such as reduces the traffic overhead and reinforcement
    of agriculture IoT data security [57]. Therefore, there are three hierarchical
    architectures [58] that can be used for fog computing layer in the green IoT-based
    agriculture. The first hierarchical architecture is three-tier (including, Tier
    1-Things/End Devices, Tier 2-Fog, Tier 2-Cloud), which is the basic architecture
    of fog computing. The second hierarchical architecture is four-tier combined fog-cloud
    architecture [59]. The last hierarchical architecture is based on Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) [60]. For example in the IoT use case in greenhouse, the nutrient
    solution can be processed and calculated at the fog computing layer. This nutrient
    solution uses the IoT data (e.g., the composition of water, temperature, and humidity)
    captured from the agriculture sensors layer. C. Core Network Layer The core layer
    is responsible for the transport of data over green IoT-based agriculture from
    fog computing layer to cloud computing layer. This layer is also termed as the
    foundation or backbone network. To ensure that packets are securely routed over
    the network, the core layer includes high-speed cables (e.g., fiber optic cables)
    and high-end switches (e.g., Cisco switches 12000) [61]. In addition, the core
    network layer is responsible for routing by delivering a strategies-based network
    interconnection such as strategy of QoS, strategy of control broadcast and multicast…etc.
    D. Cloud Computing Layer This layer is a centralized system consists of data centers
    and traditional cloud servers, which they have sufficient computing resources
    and sufficient storage. The cloud computing layer is responsible for delivering
    storage, data access, and synchronization [62]. SECTION III. Threat Models Generally,
    the classification of attacks for IoT application is done using the following
    two criteria: 1) Internal or external and 2) Passive or active, as discussed in
    [19]. Therefore, according to the property that the attack trying to compromise
    nodes in green IoT-based agriculture (i.e., IoT devices, Fog nodes, and Cloud
    nodes), we classify the threat models into the following five main categories,
    attacks against privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity
    properties, as presented in Fig. 2. FIGURE 2. Threat models in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Show All FIGURE 3. The blockchain data structure. Show All FIGURE

    and trust solution; BAI: Blockchain-based authentication and identification solution;
    BSDN: Blockchain-based secure SDN solution. Show All FIGURE 6. The consensus process
    based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm for blockchain-based
    agri-products distribution. Show All A. Attacks Against Privacy This category
    of attacks is based on learning the precise location and identity of IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer to get privacy data and compromise the privacy of
    the system. In green IoT-based agriculture, the IoT data (e.g., the composition
    of water, temperature, and humidity) is collected multiple times per hour by IoT
    devices and smart meters at agriculture sensors layer to obtain fine-grained information
    about the plants status and improve nutrient solution efficiency. The detailed
    analysis of this IoT data may easily reveal farmers’ physical activities and the
    nutrient solution adopted. For example, in pH settings, if the pH rises excessively
    indicates that the farmer will increase the ammonium supply, and if the pH falls
    indicates that the farmer will reduce the ammonium supply. Using this information,
    an adversary can plan physical attacks (e.g., sending a drone) to disrupt pH settings.
    Obviously, this private information (i.e. pH settings) must be protected from
    unauthorized access. B. Attacks Against Authentication This category of attacks
    forges identities to impersonate as authorized nodes (i.e., IoT device, fog node,
    or cloud node) in order to gain access to the green IoT-based agriculture. For
    example, an adversary may lunch the following identity-based attacks for forge
    identities, namely, replay attack, masquerade attack, spoofing attack, and impersonation
    attack. A replay attack takes place in the form of man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).
    Its objectives in the green IoT-based agriculture are to intercepting data packets
    between IoT devices or an IoT device with an access point at agriculture sensors
    layer and then relaying them to their destinations without modification. The authentication
    protocols for securing IoT networks use three techniques against replay attacks,
    namely, pairing-based cryptography, hash functions, and timestamp in the encrypted
    data, as discussed in [19]. A masquerade attack aims to masquerade as a legitimate
    node to log into the server at agriculture sensors layer (i.e., log into the access
    point) or fog computing layer (i.e., log into the fog node). The authentication
    protocols for securing IoT networks use three techniques against masquerade attacks,
    namely, 1) behavioral features-based biometric (e.g., keystroke, signature, gait,
    or voice), 2) human physiological-based biometric (e.g., fingerprint palm, electrocardiogram,
    eyes, or face), 3) hashing functions, 4) Elliptic curve cryptosystem, and 5) pairing-based
    cryptography [63]. C. Attacks Against Confidentiality This category of attacks
    attempts to adversarially eavesdrop the network traffic between IoT devices or
    an IoT device with an access point at agriculture sensors layer so as to mislead
    the green IoT-based agriculture to compromise the confidentiality and make wrong
    decisions/actions. For example, an adversary may lunch the following Eavesdropping-based
    attacks to compromise the confidentiality, including, tracing attack, brute force
    attack, and known-key attack. A tracing attack aims to collect enough privacy
    information from IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer to link data with a
    particular real identity. To resist this attack, security solutions based on random
    numbers in commitments and proofs ought to be developed [64]. A brute force attack
    aims to produce a list of all possible passwords that can be used by IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer, then to exhaust them one by one until the correct
    password can be identified [65]. A known-key attack aims to generate new session
    keys based on compromising past session keys. To resist this attack, security
    solutions that integrate random nonce in session key ought to be developed. D.
    Attacks Against Availability This category takes the form of Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks. Its goals are to make the services in green IoT-based agriculture
    (e.g., authentication for IoT devices) are unavailable either by (1) flooding
    servers with a huge amount of data to make it busy and unable to provide a service
    to IoT devices; (2) updating with false data injection attacks; or (3) attack
    on accurate localization for UAV with a malicious 5G station. E. Attacks Against
    Integrity This category of attacks implies an unauthorized party to accessing
    and modifying private information (e.g. pH settings). Under this category, we
    can find the following attacks: forgery attack, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack,
    biometric template attack, and trojan horse attack. To resist this attack, the
    data aggregation schemes based on homomorphic encryption and hash functions ought
    to be developed. SECTION IV. Security and Privacy Solutions Table 3 summarizes
    research for security and privacy solutions for IoT applications and how they
    will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. TABLE 3 Summary of Security and
    Privacy Solutions for IoT Applications and How They Will be Adapted for Green
    IoT-Based Agriculture A. Privacy-Preserving Solutions 1) Privacy-Preserving Data
    Aggregation During running the aggregation at the network edge in green IoT-based
    agriculture, the fog devices cannot see each green product data. The privacy-preserving
    data aggregation solution is very important to protect each green IoT device’s
    data. To resist against inject false data, Lu et al. [70] proposed a lightweight
    privacy-preserving data aggregation solution, named LDPA, for IoT applications,
    which can be applied in green IoT-based agriculture. The LDPA combines three cryptographic
    techniques, namely, the homomorphic Paillier encryption Chinese Remainder Theorem,
    and one-way hash chain. The Chinese remainder theorem is used by the control center
    for computing the mean and variance after collecting, aggregating, and forwarding
    IoT devices’ data from the network edge to the control center. The homomorphic
    Paillier encryption is used for encryption the report of each sensing data from
    each IoT device. The one-way hash chain technique is used for achieving lightweight
    authentication among IoT devices. Therefore, the LDPA solution can resist against
    the false data injection since the one-way hash chain technique as well as the
    time slot are adapted in authentication phase between the fog device and IoT device.
    In addition, the LDPA solution can achieve differential privacy since some noises
    are added in the aggregated data. Guan et al. [75] introduced an anonymous and
    privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol, named APPA, for IoT application.
    The system model considers Fog-enhanced IoT, which contains three layers, namely,
    the lower layer (smart devices), middle layer (Fog nodes), and Upper layer (Cloud
    Computing). To archives anonymity and unforgeability, the APPA protocol uses two
    cryptographic techniques, namely, signature-of-knowledge and paillier cryptosystem.
    The APPA protocol can resist eavesdropping attack and false data injection attack,
    but the availability is not considered. 2) Location Privacy Location-based services
    (LBS) in green IoT-based agriculture will have a very important area for research
    with the rapid development of smart agriculture. Therefore, an adversary can track
    IoT devices in smart agriculture, which may cause problems of loss of privacy.
    Sun et al. [69] proposed a location privacy algorithm for IoT application, which
    can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. To protect location privacy, the
    study uses a dummy location privacy algorithm, which consists of finding an optimal
    set of dummy locations using a greedy approach. The proposed algorithm can resist
    two attacks categories, namely, inference attacks and colluding attacks, but the
    data integrity and authentication are not considered. 3) Content-Oriented Protection
    The content-oriented protection solution is very important against the violation
    of a farmer’s privacy when different IoT data are collected and combined from
    agriculture sensors layer. Gai et al. [72] proposed a dynamic privacy protection
    model, named DPP, for ensuring mobile device user privacy in IoT application.
    The idea of DPP model is based on the classification of the privacy protection
    levels. Specifically, the DPP model uses three main phases, including, (1) security
    classifications for the definition of the privacy weight; (2) content-oriented
    data pairs identification of content-oriented data pairs based on the security
    classifications; and (3) the input data table. The evaluation performance in term
    of plan generation and timing constraints show that the DPP’s average time consumption
    is 1.2% shorter than other related works. 4) Anonymity One of the important security
    properties in green IoT-based agriculture is strong anonymity, which means that
    except for the fog nodes, the agriculture IoT data identity cannot be revealed.
    The CPAL solution proposed by Lai et al. [66] archives user anonymity in IoT application
    using the hybrid linear combination encryption. The CPAL solution defined the
    privacy-preservation with three levels, including, authorized anonymous user linking,
    anonymity, and authentication. Therefore, the CPAL solution can be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture by applying the hybrid linear combination encryption
    between the IoT devices communications at agriculture sensors layer. In addition,
    the CPAL solution is robust against impersonation attack and DoS attack. 5) Privacy-Preserving
    Trust Evaluation Privacy-preserving trust evaluation is an important role to ensures
    trust relationships among green IoT-based agriculture entities. Yan et al. [68]
    proposed two schemes of privacy-preserving trust evaluation that can be adapted
    for green IoT-based agriculture. These two schemes use additive homomorphic encryption
    for providing trust evaluation. The first scheme considers that authorized proxy
    is a fully trusted and collusion does not exist between evaluation party and authorized
    proxy. The second scheme considers that authorized proxy is not fully trusted
    and evaluation party and authorized proxy don’t collude. In both schemes, there
    is a trust evaluation phase, which after receiving the encrypted evidence, a node
    decrypts data and then evaluates the trust of the result using a trust evaluation
    algorithm. 6) Personalized Privacy Personalized privacy consists of providing
    trapdoor indistinguishability and index indistinguishability. The work by Li et
    al. [78] proposed a searchable encryption scheme for personalized privacy in IoT
    application, which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The proposed
    scheme considers an IoT network model that includes three entities, i.e., the
    data owner, cloud server, and data user. The cloud server is used to stores and
    retrieves the encrypted file features, which it received the encrypted file features
    from the data owner. Based on the specific keyword, the data user queries the
    encrypted file features. The proposed scheme is proven using two challenge-response
    games that it satisfies trapdoor indistinguishability and index indistinguishability
    under chosen keyword-file feature level pair attack. Therefore, the proposed scheme
    can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture by adapting a searchable encryption
    scheme using the following five functions: 1) Setup for performing the security
    parameters; 2) KeyGen for generating the private and public keys; 3) Store for
    creating the index table and user authorization; 4) Trapdoor for creating the
    trapdoor query; and 5) Search. The Setup and Store functions are run by the fog
    node. The KeyGen function is run by the fog node and the IoT device. The Trapdoor
    function is run by the IoT device. The Search function is performed interactively
    between the IoT device and the cloud server. B. Data Integrity Solutions To protect
    data integrity and authentication for IoT applications, Song et al. [2] proposed
    a privacy-preserving protocol that uses message authentication codes (MAC). The
    MAC solution is added to the original IoT data, which the sender can verify that
    the IoT data has not tampered during communication. This solution can be applied
    in green IoT-based agriculture (i.e., between a group of IoT devices and fog device)
    in order to protect the integrity of the green IoT device’s data. Wang et al.
    [71] proposed a lightweight label-based access control scheme, named LACS, for
    IoT-based 5G network, which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The
    LACS scheme uses two parts, including, the prover (caching fog node) and the verifier
    (caching server). The user authentication is achieved using verifying data integrity.
    The label-based authentication is used against two attacks, namely, disturbing
    attack and ignoring attack. The performance evaluation shows that the MD5 is more
    efficient than the SHA-1 in the IoT environment that uses LACS scheme. The work
    by Li et al. [80] can provide content integrity verification for named data networking,
    which can be adapted for communication among agriculture IoT nodes in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Specifically, the authors proposed a lightweight integrity verification
    architecture, named LIVE, for ensuring secure content access. The LIVE architecture
    uses the following three security levels: (1) Non-Cacheable; (2) 1-Cacheable;
    (3) All-Cacheable. To produce tokens for signature generation, the LIVE architecture
    uses a hash tree based signature algorithm (Merkle Hash Tree algorithm). C. Authentication
    Solutions 1) RFID Authentication Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology
    used for capturing and automatically identifying information in electronic tags.
    With the adaptation of RFID technology into green IoT-based agriculture, the crops
    will better be controlled and herd better monitored. Therefore, an unauthorized
    party can manage the RFID-tag, which the smart agriculture system will be compromised.
    Gope et al. [73] proposed an anonymous lightweight RFID authentication solution
    for IoT application. Specifically, the network model considered by the study is
    based on four entities, including, two servers (i.e., an authenticated cloud and
    a backend database), a reader, and an RFID-tag. Based on unlinkable pseudo-identity,
    emergency key, and hash function, the proposed solution can resist against the
    following five attacks: replay attack, forgery attack, cloning attack, DoS attack,
    and location tracking attack. In addition, this solution can achieve five security
    properties, namely, mutual authentication, tag anonymity, availability, and scalability,
    but false data injection attack, as well as DDoS attack, are not considered. 2)
    Delegated Authentication Since agriculture IoT data can be transported via untrusted
    public devices, the security solutions need to provide the delegated authentication.
    The work by Zhang et al. [77] proposed a semi-outsourcing privacy-preserving scheme,
    named SOPP, for the IoT data collection. The SOPP scheme considers three components,
    including, data center, public (untrusted) clouds, and IoT devices. To decreases
    the throughput and achieves a longer battery duration, the SOPP scheme applied
    elliptic curve cryptography as a one-way (non-interactive) authentication between
    untrusted public clouds and IoT devices. To block invalid access, the authentication
    is delegated to public clouds. The data center uses data decryption to provides
    data integrity. D. Access Control Solutions To supporting privacy-preserving in
    green IoT-based agriculture, an efficient access control scheme can be adapted.
    The work by Fan et al. [76] designed an access control protocol for fog-enabled
    IoT. The study considered cloud-fog computing that contains five entities, including,
    a cloud service provider, a group of fog nodes, a group of data owners, a certificate
    authority, and a group of IoT devices. For providing revocation and data confidentiality
    with verifiability, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption is adapted when
    an IoT device with an identifier submits a data access request. The the blockchain
    technology [39] can be used for providing an access control in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Ouaddah et al. [81] proposed an access control framework, named FairAccess,
    for IoT application. The FairAccess framework uses the blockchain technology to
    get, grant, delegate, and revoke access. Zhang et al. [74] consider an IoT system
    with a large number of storage devices, servers, user devices, IoT gateways. Specifically,
    the study proposed an access control framework based on the Ethereum smart contract
    platform. This platform contains five main elements, including, smart contract,
    account/address, blockchain, transaction and message, and mining. To manage the
    policies and implement access control, the proposed framework provides functions
    or application binary interfaces (e.g., add new access control policy, updates
    the policy, returns the access result and penalty…etc.). The evaluation performance
    on two Raspberry Pi 3 Model B shows that the proposed framework may not be able
    to reflect the overhead in real-world IoT system. E. Data Confidentiality Solutions
    Data security in green IoT-based agriculture also includes confidentiality, which
    can be achieved by cipher-text based access control technique. Yao et al. [67]
    proposed a lightweight attribute-based encryption scheme for IoT application,
    which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. To provide data confidentiality
    with integrity, the proposed scheme uses an elliptic curve integrated encryption
    scheme (ECDH). Specifically, the ECDH scheme is used for generating a sharing
    secret from two groups, including, the MAC key and encryption key. The performance
    evaluation in term of overhead (the total size of the private key, public key,
    and cipher-text) shows that the proposed scheme is much shorter than other related
    cryptographic methods that use decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent. In
    addition, the proposed scheme is robust against chosen plaintext and attribute-set
    attack. SECTION V. Privacy-Preserving Over Blockchain The blockchain technology
    can be effectively applied in almost all domains of IoT, including, green IoT-based
    agriculture [39], [82]–[85]. The application of blockchain technology for IoT
    is applied to provide privacy-preserving. To be specific, the blockchain is used
    for encrypted data sharing. Therefore, the blockchain can be used in green IoT-based
    agriculture as a distributed digital ledger containing all messages. This distributed
    ledger is replicated and stored in different IoT nodes at agriculture sensors
    layer, as presented in Fig. 6. Table 4 summarizes research for privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solutions for IoT applications and how they will be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture. According to the characteristic of each privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solution, we classify the blockchain-based solutions for green
    IoT-based agriculture into six categories, including, 1) Blockchain-based machine
    learning solution; 2) Blockchain-based distributed key management solution; 3)
    Blockchain-based access control solution; 4) Blockchain-based reputation and trust
    solution; 5) Blockchain-based authentication and identification solution, and
    6) Blockchain-based secure SDN solution, as presented in Fig. 5. TABLE 4 Summary
    of Privacy-Oriented Blockchain-Based Solutions for IoT Applications and How They
    Will be Adapted for Green IoT-Based Agriculture A. Blockchain-Based Solutions
    1) Blockchain-Based PKI Solution Jiang et al. [79] proposed a thin-client Authentication
    scheme, named PTAS, for IoT application. The PTAS scheme is applied in blockchain-based
    public key infrastructure (PKI). The PKI infrastructure is used to secure communication
    between IoT devices, which a certificate authority distribute certificates (a
    public key (PK) and identity (ID)) to IoT devices. To solve the problem of the
    single point of failure, the PTAS scheme is adapted in blockchain-based PKI. Specifically,
    the PTAS scheme uses the method of private information retrieval, which the identity
    of the user can be hidden in k indistinguishable identities. In addition, the
    PTAS scheme is robust against three attacks, namely, Sybil attack, eclipse attack,
    and 51% attack. 2) Blockchain-Based Machine Learning Solution The work by Shen
    et al. [91] proposed a privacy-preserving scheme, named secureSVM, for IoT application.
    The secureSVM scheme considers the data privacy of training support vector machine
    classifier (SVM) using blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. To protect the privacy
    of IoT data, the secureSVM scheme employs a public-key cryptosystem, Paillier,
    which is an additive homomorphic cryptosystem. The secureSVM scheme is robust
    against two threat models, including, known ciphertext model and known background
    model. The secureSVM scheme can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The
    blockchain-based IoT platform can be installed at the agriculture sensors layer
    and IoT data analysts at fog computing layer. The adaptation is summarized by
    the following steps: Step 1: Agriculture sensor nodes use sensing and transmitting
    valuable data through wireless; Step 2: Each access point collect data from the
    agriculture sensor nodes; Step 3: Each access point encrypts data using partially
    homomorphic encryption; Step 4: Each access point records the encrypted data on
    the blockchain; Step 5: Each access point uses the built-in consensus mechanism
    for validating the data; Step 6: Fog nodes communicate with an access point to
    obtain parameters of the training SVM classifier. 3) Blockchain-Based Distributed
    Key Management Solution The blockchain is used in key management architecture
    for eliminating the drawback of introducing a third party. Ma et al. [92] introduced
    a blockchain-based distributed key management architecture, named BDKMA, for IoT
    application. To achieve hierarchical access control, the BDKMA architecture uses
    security access managers for operating the blockchain. Specifically, the BDKMA
    architecture is based on the idea of authorization assignment mode and group access
    pattern. The BDKMA architecture can be applied to the network model composed of
    a device layer, a fog layer, and a cloud layer. The adaptation of BDKMA architecture
    in green IoT-based agriculture is summarized by the following steps: Step 1: Each
    agriculture sensor nodes selects its private key and generates the public key,
    encryption key, and secret access key; Step 2: Each agriculture sensor nodes packages
    encrypted secret access key and then signs and broadcasts the transaction to access
    point; Step 3: Each access point at agriculture sensors layer collects the transactions
    of the agriculture sensor nodes; Step 4: Each access point uses the built-in consensus
    mechanism for validating the data; Step 5: An agriculture sensor node obtain access
    permission from access point using an access query transaction; Step 6: An agriculture
    sensor node periodically update the access keys and sends a key update transaction
    to the access point; 4) Blockchain-Based Access Control Solution To provide scalable
    access management in IoT application, Novo [87] proposed a distributed access
    control architecture using blockchain technology. The access control policies
    are enforced by the blockchain platform. The adaptation of proposed architecture
    in green IoT-based agriculture can bring the following six advantages to access
    control: transparency, scalability, lightweight, concurrency, accessibility, and
    mobility. The adaptation of proposed architecture is summarized in the following
    steps: Step 1: Fog node deploys the smart contract into the blockchain network
    at fog computing layer; Step 2: To be registered as a manager, each access point
    at agriculture sensors layer request the address of the smart contract; Step 3:
    To transfer the management control of an agriculture sensor device, an access
    point at agriculture sensors layer requests the agriculture sensor device’s address
    and the blockchain address of the smart contract; Step 4: An access point at agriculture
    sensors layer enforces the policy creating a transaction towards the smart contract;
    Step 5: An access point at agriculture sensors layer adds an existing policy.
    Ding et al. [94] proposed a attribute-based access control scheme for IoT application,
    which can be adapted for greenhouse. According to the identity or ability of each
    IoT devices, attribute authorities describe a set of attributes to each IoT devices.
    The blockchain is used to record the distribution of these attributes. The adaptation
    of this attribute-based access control scheme for blockchain-based greenhouse
    is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: Greenhouse miner generates a pair
    of public and secret key for each IoT devices; Step 2: Greenhouse miner sends
    both keys in a secure channel based on identity-based cryptography; Step 3: Each
    IoT devices uses an address along with its ID and then generate a corresponding
    address based on the hash algorithm; Step 4: IoT device inside greenhouse generates
    new block and broadcasts to the other consortium nodes using the practical Byzantine
    fault tolerance; Step 5: When IoT device wants to send to another device, they
    use identity-based authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Dorri et al.
    [34] introduced a smart home tier based on the blockchain technology, which can
    be adapted for greenhouse. The network model of the blockchain-based greenhouse
    is composed of the following components: transactions, local blockchain, greenhouse
    miner, and local storage. The adaptation of blockchain-based greenhouse is summarized
    in the following steps: Step 1: Greenhouse miner generates a key with an IoT device;
    Step 2: Greenhouse miner shares the key and stores it in the genesis transaction;
    Step 3: Greenhouse miner defines the policy header and adds it to the first block;
    Step 4: Each IoT device inside greenhouse communicate with another internal device
    using the permission from the miner; Step 5: Each IoT device inside greenhouse
    can store data on the cloud storage using the permission from the miner; Step
    6: When IoT device wants to send to another external device, a Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) connection is used to routes the packets to the shared miner. 5)
    Blockchain-Based Reputation and Trust Solution Dedeoglu et al. [93] proposed a
    reputation and trust mechanism for blockchain-based IoT applications, which can
    be adapted for greenhouse. The proposed model verifying transactions based on
    three key layers, namely the application layer, the blockchain layer, and the
    data layer. The adaptation of blockchain-based greenhouse for trust architecture
    is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: IoT device inside greenhouse generates
    blocks in periodic intervals. The generation is based on the public key and the
    signature of the data source; Step 2: IoT device sends the blocks to greenhouse
    miner at agriculture sensors layer; Step 3: Greenhouse miner validates the blocks
    based on the number of validator node and the reputation of the block generating
    node. To realize reliable storage and sharing of IoT information in green IoT-based
    agriculture, the work by Si et al. [95] is a security mechanism that can be adapted
    for smart agriculture. The proposed mechanism is based on blockchain technology,
    which is applied in three layers, including, the application layer, the transport
    layer, and the sensing layer. The application layer is mainly used by the cloud
    service. The data blockchain part is installed in the fog computing layer. In
    addition, the proposed mechanism uses a double-chain model with tamper-proof of
    data in the data blockchain. Zhou et al. [88] proposed a threshold secure multi-party
    computing protocol, TSMPC, for blockchain-based threshold IoT system. The TSMPC
    protocol extends Shamir’s (t, n)-secret sharing (SSS) [97]. Specifically, the
    TSMPC protocol is applied between a leader and n server, which can be adapted
    for green IoT-based agriculture. The network model is composed of n servers, the
    leader’s device, and a leader. The performance evaluation on the Ethereum blockchain
    shows that a block can record transactions of at most 62,360 bytes. Therefore,
    the adaptation of a threshold secure multi-party computing protocol for green
    IoT-based agriculture is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: A fog computing
    node generates an initialize transaction with a verification key and sends it
    to the blockchain network; Step 2: IoT sensor node at agriculture sensors layer
    verify the transaction’s verification key; Step 3: An access point at agriculture
    sensors layer verifies core shares, which can obtain a reward from the fog computing
    node. 6) Blockchain-Based Authentication and Identification Solution To ensure
    authentication and robust identification of IoT devices in IoT application, Hammi
    et al. [89] proposed an original decentralized system, called bubbles of trust
    , which can be applied for green IoT-based agriculture. Based on the blockchain
    technology, the bubbles of trust system create secure virtual zones (bubbles),
    which can protect the availability and data integrity. The bubbles of trust system
    is resistant against four attacks, namely, Sybil attack, spoofing attack, DoS/DDoS
    attack, and replay attack. Therefore, the adaptation of bubbles of trust system
    for green IoT-based agriculture consists of creating secure virtual zones inside
    the agriculture sensors layer, where devices can communicate securely. Specifically,
    each device at agriculture sensors layer must communicate only with devices of
    its zone. The communications between devices are considered as transactions and
    must be validated by this blockchain network. 7) Blockchain-Based Secure SDN Solution
    To facilitate software and hardware updates for green IoT-based agriculture, software-defined
    networking (SDN) is used, which allows easy control and management in a central
    location. To detect any false injection data, a blockchain-based secure SDN architecture
    is adapted. Derhab et al. [96] proposed two security components, namely, 1) Blockchain-based
    integrity checking system (BICS) 2) Intrusion detection system (IDS). These two
    systems are combined for SDN-architecture, which can be adapted for green IoT-based
    agriculture. The adaptation is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: Integrate
    the SDN controller into the cloud computing layer; Step 2: Integrate a Virtual
    Switch (vSwitch) into the fog computing layer Step 3: Integrate an IDS system
    into the access point at agriculture sensors layer. To detect cyber attacks, the
    IDS system combines two machine learning classifiers, namely, K-Nearest Neighbors
    and random subspace learning; Step 4: The SDN controller creates blocks and shares
    it via the blockchain; Step 5: The Firewall check the rules from vSwitch and blockchain.
    To provides scalability within the current IoT application, the SDN and blockchains
    technology are combined by the work Sharma et al. [86]. Specifically, the work
    proposed a secure SDN architecture, named DistBlockNet, which is based on the
    blockchain technology. The DistBlockNet architecture interconnects a distributed
    blockchain network with the controllers. Each local network includes Shelter modules,
    OrchApp, and Controller. To maintains the updated flow rules table information,
    the distributed blockchain network uses the request/response and controller/verification
    nodes. The performance evaluation shows that DistBlockNet architecture is robust
    against DDoS/DoS attacks and cache poising/ARP spoofing. The adaptation of DistBlockNet
    architecture in green IoT-based agriculture is summarized by the following steps:
    Step 1: Integrate Shelter and OrchApp modules into the cloud computing layer;
    Step 2: Integrate the distributed blockchain network into the fog computing layer;
    Step 3: Interconnect the distributed blockchain network with the controllers at
    fog computing layer; Step 4: IoT sensor node at agriculture sensors layer sends
    data to the controllers. B. Consensus Algorithms for Blockchain-Based Solutions
    A consensus algorithm can be defined as the mechanism by which a Blockchain network
    achieves consensus. The public blockchains (i.e., decentralized) are built as
    distributed systems and, since they do not depend on a central authority, the
    distributed nodes must agree on the validity of transactions using a consensus
    algorithm. Table 5 summarizes consensus algorithms for Blockchain-based solutions
    and how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. TABLE 5 Summary
    of Consensus Algorithms for Blockchain-Based Solutions and How They Will be Adapted
    for Green IoT-Based Agriculture 1) Proof-of-Work (PoW) The PoW is a consensus
    algorithm introduced by Bitcoin and widely used by other cryptocurrencies. This
    consensus is called “Mining”, which the nodes in the IoT network are called “Miners”
    [98]. Specifically, the PoW algorithm is presented as a response to a mathematical
    problem, which requires considerable work, but is usually easily checked once
    the answer is obtained. A miner node continuously tests a variety of unique values
    (known as nonce) until an appropriate value is produced [123]. The minor node
    that solves the puzzle extracts the succeeding block, then adds it to the blockchain
    network and confirms the transactions, and receives the compensation for the block.
    The PoW can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    which each access point at agriculture sensors layer is selected as miners in
    order to calculate the hash values for validating blocks. This adaptation ensures
    that access points are encouraged to maintain the blockchain network, as they
    are compensated for their efforts. The disadvantage of the PoW algorithm for green
    IoT-based agriculture is that computational resources require a lot of energy
    to validate the blocks. 2) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) The PoS is a distributed consensus
    algorithm (used by Peercoin [99] and Nxt [100]) that requires the user to prove
    that they have a specific quantity of currency to validate any additional blocks
    in the blockchain network and to be awarded the reward. Compared to the PoW algorithm,
    the PoS is not computationally costly for validators, but it is vulnerable to
    nothing-at-stake problem. The PoS can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution
    for green IoT-based agriculture, which all IoT nodes in agriculture sensors layer
    are selected as the validators. 3) Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) The DPoS is
    a consensus algorithm (used by BitShares [101] and Steemit [102]) that restricts
    the number of nodes in a blockchain network to a small number of entities chosen
    by token owners. These delegates are responsible for the following three paid
    tasks: 1) implementing changes to the blockchain network, 2) recording transactions,
    and 3) ensuring the integrity of the registry. The DPoS algorithm can be adapted
    by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each access
    point at agriculture sensors layer is selected as a delegate. This adaptation
    ensures that access points provide an efficient, fast, decentralized consensus
    algorithm. 4) Delayed Proof-of-Work (DPoW) The DPoW is a consensus algorithm designed
    by the Komodo project [103], which is a modified version of the Proof of Work
    consensus algorithm. The DPoW algorithm is based on the idea of notary nodes,
    which are used to record data to the blockchain network (e.g., Bitcoin). The DPoW
    can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    which all fog nodes in fog computing layer are selected as notary nodes and all
    IoT nodes in agriculture sensors layer are selected as as normal nodes. This adaptation
    ensures that it is impossible to reorganize notarized blocks, which makes blockchains
    more secure and resistant to attacks 51%. 5) Proof-of-Activity (PoAC) The PoAC
    algorithm (used by Decred [109]) is an extension of the Bitcoin protocol, which
    is based on combining Proof of Work component with a Proof of Stake type of system.
    The PoAC can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture
    as follows [124]. 1) Each fog node (miner) at fog computing layer uses his hashing
    power to generate an empty block header. 2) The fog node broadcasts her block
    header to IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer. 3) All IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer derive N pseudorandom stakeholders using the hash of the block header.
    4) Every stakeholder at agriculture sensors layer checks whether the empty block
    header that the fog node broadcasted is valid. 6) Proof-of-Authority (PoA) The
    PoA is a reputation-based consensus algorithm (used by POA.Network [106] and VeChain
    [107]) for private blockchain networks. The PoA consensus algorithm is based on
    the value of identity, which means that the validators use their own reputation
    to validate the blocks. The PoA can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution
    for green IoT-based agriculture, which all fog nodes in fog computing layer are
    selected as validators. This adaptation ensures a limited number of block validators,
    which provides a highly scalable system. 7) Proof-of-Importance (PoI) The PoI
    is a consensus algorithm proposed by NEM [113]. The PoI can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer are assigned an importance score. The IoT devices with high scores
    of importance have a higher chance of harvesting a block. The transaction graph
    topology can be used as an input into the importance of an IoT device. 8) Proof-of-Weight
    (PoWE) The PoWe is proposed by Gilad et al. [110], which is based on the Algorand
    consensus model. The Algorand uses a Byzantine agreement protocol to reach consensus
    on the blockchain network. The users are selected randomly using verifiable random
    functions. Algorand users use a protocol to communicate, which assigns a weight
    to each user according to the tokens they hold. The users’ weights are used to
    chooses committee members randomly among all users. The PoWe can be adapted by
    a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which an Algorand
    protocol assigns a weight to each farmer according to the tokens they hold. This
    adaptation ensures resistance to Sybil attacks and achieves scalability but reducing
    the incentive since it’s very difficult to be rewarded. 9) Proof-of-Burn (PoB)
    The PoB algorithm (used by Slimcoin [111]) is similar to a proof of work algorithm
    but with reduced energy consumption rates. The PoB network block validation process
    does not require the use of powerful computing resources and does not depend on
    powerful extraction equipment. Instead, Coins are deliberately burned and this
    is a way to “invest” resources in the blockchain, so that candidate miners are
    not required to invest physical resources. By burning Coins, users are able to
    demonstrate their engagement with the network, which can obtain the right to mine
    and validate transactions [125]. The PoB can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each fog node at fog computing
    layer sends coins to a burn address. 10) Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) The PoC is very
    similar to the PoW algorithm, which the storage is used instead of computation.
    The PoC (used by Burstcoin [104]) allows the mining nodes to use the free space
    on their hard disk. The PoC can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for
    green IoT-based agriculture, where each fog nodes at fog computing layer are selected
    as miners since they have high storage compared to nodes at agriculture sensors
    layer. To validating the blocs and winning the mining reward, the fog nodes involve
    a two-step process, including, plotting and mining. 11) Proof of Elapsed Time
    (POET) The POET is a consensus algorithm frequently applied on the permissioned
    blockchain networks to decide on mining authorizations. The POET is based on the
    idea of “Elapsed Time”, where each node involved in the system is expected to
    wait for a randomly selected period of time, and the first node to complete the
    designated waiting time wins the new block. The POET can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each IoT device at agriculture
    sensors layer generates a random wait time and sleeps for a fixed period of time.
    For more details about the PoET algorithm, we refer the reader to the Hyperledger
    Sawtooth project [112]. 12) Proof-of-Reputation (PoR) The PoR algorithm (used
    by GoChain [115]) is similar to PoA algorithm, which it is based on the reputations
    of the IoT nodes. An IoT node in the green IoT-based agriculture must have a reputation
    important enough to be voted as an authoritative node. Once an authoritative node
    is voted, he can sign and validate blocks in the blockchain network. 13) Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) The PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
    algorithm is the first to be able to tolerate “Byzantine” faults, which is proposed
    by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov in 1999 [126]. This algorithm provides reliability
    and robustness properties in a synchronous environment and requires N=3f+1 replicas
    to tolerate simultaneous Byzantine faults. The PBFT algorithm can be effectively
    applied in almost all domains of IoT, including, Internet of Energy [118], Internet
    of Drones [120], Internet of Vehicles [127],…etc. Therefore, the PBFT algorithm
    can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    as presented in Fig. 6. Specifically, when a farmer buyer node wants to buy a
    product from agri-products sellers, they send its request to the fog node. This
    fog node creates a PRE-PREPARE message to propose to the other replicas the scheduling
    of the bloc. The correct replicas respond to the PRE-PREPARE with a PREPARE message,
    which is sent to all replicas (i.e., neighbor nodes). Once the neighbor nodes
    have received 2f PREPARE and the associated PRE-PREPARE, then they agree on the
    order of the farmer buyer node’s request. At the end, the neighbor nodes send
    a VALIDATION message to all replicas. Once a replica has received 2f+1 VALIDATION,
    then it executes the request and responds to both farmer buyer node and agri-products
    seller. If the client does not receive a response after a specified time period,
    he forwards the request to all replicas. When a replica receives a request, it
    starts view-change. Note that there are more variations of PBFT algorithm such
    as Aardvark [128], Zyzzyva [129], HQ [130], Q/U [131], and Abstract [132]. 14)
    Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) The dBFT algorithm is a consensus method
    (used by Neo [116]) where all users elect nodes, called bookkeepers, who are responsible
    for adding new blocks to the blockchain. This elected node group can be updated
    regularly. The vote is weighted by the amount of cryptocurrency owned. Each bookkeeper
    is randomly selected to propose a block. This node is called a speaker. The bookkeepers
    become speakers in turn by random drawing. The speaker checks the signatures and
    the validity of transactions and then collects them in a block. The speaker proposes
    his block to all the other bookkeepers. Afterward, the bookkeepers verify the
    block and then each one vote in favor or against the block. The consensus is reached
    when at least 66% of bookkeepers vote in favor of the block and it is then added
    to the blockchain. The dBFT algorithm can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture
    by applying a voting system in agriculture sensors layer to choose delegates and
    speaker among IoT devices. 15) Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) The SCP protocol
    (used by Stellar Consensus [114]) is based on federated Byzantine agreement (FBA).
    The nodes exchange a series of votes to confirm and accept a value. For this purpose,
    the SCP protocol determines a minimum quorum. The “quorum” is a set of nodes that
    are sufficient to reach an agreement. Each node chooses one or more quorum slices
    and includes in each slice the nodes in which it has confidence. Each quorum slice
    will then produce interactions with each other. To reach an agreement, the SCP
    protocol uses the idea of quorum intersection. A federated Byzantine agreement
    system enjoys quorum intersection if any two of its quorums share a node. The
    SCP protocol can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture by applying a voting
    system in agriculture sensors layer to choose quorum and quorum slice among IoT
    devices and then use quorum intersection to guarantee agreement. 16) Other Consensus
    Algorithms There are other consensus algorithms that can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture. We cite the following nine consensus
    algorithms: Byteball consensus [133], Mokka consensus [134], SPECTRE consensus
    [135], Block-Lattice consensus [136], Hashgraph consensus [137], Tangle consensus
    [138], Directed Acyclic Graphs (used by Iota [139]), Proof of Believability (used
    by IOST [140]), and RAFT consensus [141]. SECTION VI. Challenges To complete our
    overview, we outline research challenges that could improve the security and privacy
    solutions for IoT-based agriculture, summarized in the following recommendations:
    A. Machine Learning Techniques for Intrusion Detection Systems Intrusion detection
    systems (IDSs) are implemented along with other security systems such as authentication
    and access control techniques using encryption mechanisms to protect systems against
    cyber attacks. Using data mining and machine learning techniques (e.g., Deep learning,
    Random forests, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes,…etc), IDSs can differentiate
    between normal and malicious actions. The implementation of IDSs for IoT-based
    agriculture as a software application will able to identify security incidents.
    Therefore, the question we ask here is: how to choose the right machine learning
    technique among different types (i.e., reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning,
    or supervised learning)? We believe that a comparative study of machine learning
    techniques for cyber security intrusion detection is needed for IoT-based agriculture.
    B. Dataset for Intrusion Detection in IoT-Based Agriculture Scenarios The datasets
    for cyber security are so important in intrusion detection, which are used for
    testing the performance of IDSs. Actually, most and recent IDSs are tested with
    KDD 1999 [142], NSL-KDD [143], CICIDS2017 [144], Bot-IoT [145], and CSE-CIC-IDS2018
    [146]. These datasets are not simulated for IoT-based agriculture scenarios. A
    possible research direction in this topic could be related to developing a new
    dataset to build a network intrusion detector under IoT-based agriculture environment.
    C. Scalability Analysis of Blockchain-Based Solutions To solve security and privacy
    problems (e.g., access control, reputation, trust,…etc), we have seen that a blockchain-based
    solution brings advantages for IoT application. The application of a blockchain-based
    solution for IoT-based agriculture requires a study on the characteristics of
    the implementation. Therefore, there are many characteristics should be taken
    under consideration when a blockchain-based solution is proposed for IoT-based
    agriculture, such as scalability issues when the number of participating nodes
    at agriculture sensors layer is increased. Thus, one of the challenges that should
    receive more attention in the future is to provide a scalability analysis of blockchain-based
    solutions for IoT-based agriculture. D. How to Pick the Best Consensus Algorithm
    The performance of a blockchain-based solution for IoT-based agriculture is related
    to the effectiveness of the consensus algorithm. Therefore, since IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer are not always able to satisfy the high computational
    and energy requirements when addressing the validation of blocks and the storage
    of blockchain, consensus-efficient issues arise as follows: If the PoW algorithm
    is used, how to integrate a miner in each greenhouse for processing incoming and
    outgoing transactions? If the stellar consensus algorithm is used, how to design
    a voting system in agriculture sensors layer to choose quorum and quorum slice
    among IoT devices and then use quorum intersection to guarantee agreement? If
    the dBFT algorithm is used, how to design a voting system in agriculture sensors
    layer to choose bookkeepers and speaker among IoT devices? E. Design of Practical
    and Compatible Cryptographic Protocols In some cases of green IoT-based agriculture,
    it is not necessary to use blockchain to solve security and privacy problems (e.g.,
    identity anonymity), which there are many other better solutions such as practical
    and compatible cryptographic solution. Therefore, a new cryptographic solution
    is proposed recently by Yang et al. [147] for the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast,
    which they use the format-preserving encryption (FPE) and lightweight broadcast
    authentication protocol (TESLA) to achieve the identity anonymity. However, resource
    and power-constrained IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer are not always
    capable of meeting the substantial computational and power consumption in the
    processing of new cryptographic solution. Therefore, the design of practical and
    compatible cryptographic protocols is one of the significant research challenges
    in green IoT-based agriculture. F. Resiliency Against Specific Attacks in the
    Context of Low-Resource IoT Devices The threat models discussed in the environment
    of IoT-based agriculture and the key security problem is different in distinct
    smart agriculture applications. Sometimes, the specific problem does not exist
    in an IoT application, and it is meaningless to take combined attacks into consideration.
    The methods to solve attacks can be integrated together to solve problems in an
    application. To propose a scheme against a kind of attack in a smart agriculture
    application, the attack should be specific and defined at the beginning. The most
    important question that may arise is how to develop a new security strategy that
    can resist combined attacks while considering the practicability of deploying
    the solution, particularly in the context of low-resource IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer. G. Counter Measures Against 5G Network Slicing Threats 5G networks
    will be facilitators of IoT based agriculture applications, especially in the
    sensors layer (See Figure 1). 5G adopt network slicing as a means of partitioning
    the physical and network resources to optimally group the different traffic, isolate
    from other tenants and configure the network resources. The logical partitioning
    of network slicing divides and separates a single common physical network into
    various virtual, complete E2E networks and offers complete isolation for these
    virtual networks from each other in terms of access, transport, device and core
    network. The main advantage of Network Slicing is that now MNOs can configure
    and apply tailor-made customization of their network resources to accommodate
    different users and different traffic classes, and hence differentiated services.
    Security of Network Slicing plays a significant role for the control and the coordination
    among different slices and for function of the related mechanisms that are responsible
    for the inter-network slices communication and the coordination between user and
    control plane. A security leakage that is related to the inter-slice communication
    functionality can lead to disruption of the inter-slice communication. Moreover,
    authentication for the identification of the privileged users in order to prevent
    impersonation attacks against slices seems to be critical for the proper control
    of the network resources. Furthermore, the provision of differentiated services
    is also related to the provision of different security level of services among
    the slices. However, this must not affect the security level of another slice.
    In addition, DoS attacks focus on the possible exhaustion of network resources
    to lead in unavailability of network provisioned services [148]. These attacks
    must be dealt with a multi layered security framework that includes traditional
    methods, e.g. IDS and field specific solutions, e.g. slice isolation. H. Deploying
    IoT in Agriculture As we mentioned in Section II, IoT in agriculture can be envisioned
    in different layers and from different perspectives. In this subsection, we try
    to summarize and emphasize the different conditions that exist in an agricultural
    environment that make the deployment of IoT challenging. When talking about the
    WSNs, the specific characteristics of the environment, in which the nodes will
    be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles in farmlands
    whose positions may change over time, cause considerable interference in the communication
    between nodes. These moving obstacles affect the connection quality of links,
    changing the channel conditions over time, affecting the deployment, packet routing
    algorithms, failure diagnosis methods, and other aspects of WSNs. Environmental
    factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, high solar radiation along with
    changing shading by plant leaves, as well as noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, further increase Spatio-temporal climatic variation, greatly
    affecting the communication among nodes that are deployed in such harsh environment.
    This changing environment imposes requirements and calls for novel duty-cycle
    control, sampling and scheduling, data reconstructions, as well as data storage
    and query, intelligent control, and other solutions [38], [149]. Although in theory
    or in simulated environments all these challenges have been already studied and
    analyzed when it comes to the actual deployment of IoT in the agricultural sector
    this task is very demanding and challenging. The modules that are used in order
    to sense and report any situation need to be accurate enough, properly shielded
    against environmental factors which can either lead to false reporting or destruction
    of the sensors permanently [150]. In addition, the replacement of power source
    to distributed sensor nodes that are spread in wide areas can be a very difficult
    task, if not impossible and must be taken into consideration during the design
    of such systems. In terms of communication among nodes, since many different technologies
    can be combined, from GSM to WPAN and P2P, interoperability is the main challenge
    when designing or deploying such systems, especially in agriculture where high
    temperature and high humidity affect it in a negative way. Also when different
    communication methods are used in the same area (e.g. Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi)
    interference is a parameter that needs to be also considered [151]. Since the
    sensors devices are deployed in an open field, which cannot be monitored by people
    all the time, the system can easily be attacked physically. In addition, sensors
    devices are not densely deployed in agricultural applications and they are more
    complex in terms of hardware components. Finally the area where sensor devices
    are located is not monitored so well compared to the one deployed inside a city
    and it is easy to add malicious nodes (e.g., Malicious 4G stations) that can overhear
    the information that is exchanged or perform several attacks like DDoS or MITM.
    SECTION VII. Conclusion In this paper, we surveyed the state-of-the-art of existing
    security and privacy solutions for green IoT-based agriculture. We provided an
    overview of a four-tier green IoT-based agriculture architecture. Through extensive
    research and analysis that was conducted, we were able to classify the threat
    models against green IoT-based agriculture into five categories, including, attacks
    against privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity
    properties. In addition, we analyzed the privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions
    as well as consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture. There still exist
    several challenging research areas, such as machine learning techniques, datasets
    for intrusion detection, scalability analysis of blockchain-based solutions, how
    to pick the best consensus algorithm, and the design of practical and compatible
    cryptographic protocols, which should be further investigated in the near future.

    4 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE 1 MOTIVATION With the popularization of smart and Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices, a tremendous amount of data is being produced by devices
    distributed everywhere on the globe. Meanwhile, many new smart applications are
    appearing which require Internet connection to operate. Artificial intelligence
    (AI)-driven IoT and network applications has been widely recognized as a promising
    solution for smart scenarios.1, 2 For IoT and emerging smart applications (eg,
    smart city, smart healthcare, and smart agriculture), it is often unfeasible to
    collect thousands of uniformly distributed data from heterogeneous distributed
    devices to train a reasonable model. Such systems typically only use relatively
    a small amount of samples to train a goal-oriented model which could be heavily
    affected by minor anomalies. Therefore, in the IoT and emerging network applications,
    it is urgent to detect anomalies from the collected samples to alleviate the side
    effect on model training.3, 4 Anomalies can be defined as the patterns that do
    not conform to expected behavior.5, 6 Actually, anomalies can appear in different
    forms in real applications, f.i., illegal intrusions on the Internet of services,7
    irregular behaviors in the scenario of smart city,8 and abnormal events in smart
    agriculture.9 Anomaly detection has been researched for several decades and many
    anomaly detection methods have been proposed so far. However, an important open
    question to be answered is how to use anomaly detection methods to find minor
    meaningful patterns in real applications. This special issue will focus on identifying
    minor anomalies in real applications by using state-of-the-art anomaly detection
    methods. Examples of applications can be found in many fields, f.i., Internet
    of Things (IoT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Smart Cities, Smart Grids
    and Energy Internet, Smart Healthcare, Smart Exercise Monitoring, Smart Online
    Education, Smart Agriculture, Ubiquitous Patient Monitoring, Intelligent Computing
    System, Decision Support and Therapy Improvement of AI-based Monitoring System,
    Medical Implant Security, Mobile Edge Network Security. 2 KEY ISSUES IN INTELLIGENT
    COMPUTING FOR IOT AND SMART APPLICATIONS The key issues when using intelligent
    computing to enhance IoT applications and services are the data collected by the
    associated applications and devices. The quality of the collected data are strongly
    affect the performance of intelligent computing. Additionally, some IoT applications
    pay more attention to minor anomalies, such as emergent event, unusual visiting.
    Thus, it needs to consider to improve the quality of collected data as well as
    the minor anomalies when adopting intelligent computing for IoT applications and
    services. 2.1 Noises or outliers in collected data It is unavoidable that the
    data collected from IoT applications and devices contains some noises or outliers
    which seriously impact on the quality of the collected data. The applications
    cannot achieve the expected results if directly using the intelligent computing
    methods which are not robust to noises or outliers. Another way is to adopt a
    outlier or anomaly detection method to remove the noises or outliers before training
    intelligent model for smart IoT applications or services. 2.2 Anomalies and emergent
    events In many IoT applications or services, we only care about minor emergent
    events which can be regarded as the anomalies. For instance, we are interested
    in minor illegal access during Internet of services, minor patients in Internet
    of Medical Things, minor accidents in smart transportation, to name just a few.
    In order to solve this issues, it is worth to introduce anomaly detection methods
    into IoT applications and services. 3 THIS SPECIAL ISSUE This special issue comes
    really timely for relevant research communities, and provides a valuable contribution
    to this emerging field. The selected the papers are based on their scientific
    quality and the strength of their contributions. We cannot argue that they cover
    all the topics of the domain. However, we are delighted to present a consistent

    Neural Network” proposes a framework to detect abnormal or illegal visiting in
    network by using deep neural network. The proposed framework implements fine-grained
    analysis for network traffic and user behavior management. The eleventh paper
    “Sport Training Action Correction by Using Convolutional Neural Network” proposes
    a framework to estimate the positions of bone joint points and postures by using
    a convolutional neural network. The positions of bone joint point prediction can
    be further used to correct the actions during sports. The twelfth paper “ECG Signal

    computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans.
    IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination
    just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such
    as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and
    Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices
    are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies
    are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil
    moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide
    spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce
    a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming
    environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of
    countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present
    a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper
    outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain
    and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed
    cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber
    attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

    According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected to exceed
    9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    of new compute-intensive applications and the vision of the Internet of Things
    (IoT), it is foreseen that the emerging 5G network will face an unprecedented
    increase in traffic volume and computation demands. However, end users mostly
    have limited storage capacities and finite processing capabilities, thus how to
    run compute-intensive applications on resource-constrained users has recently
    become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing (MEC), a key technology in the
    emerging fifth generation (5G) network, can optimize mobile resources by hosting
    compute-intensive applications, process large data before sending to the cloud,
    provide the cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN)
    in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware services with the
    help of RAN information. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications,
    where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless vehicles,
    augmented reality, robotics, and immerse media. Indeed, the paradigm shift from
    4G to 5G could become a reality with the advent of new technological concepts.
    The successful realization of MEC in the 5G network is still in its infancy and
    demands for constant efforts from both academic and industry communities. In this
    survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC technology and its potential
    use cases and applications. Then, we outline up-to-date researches on the integration
    of MEC with the new technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond. We also
    summarize testbeds and experimental evaluations, and open source activities, for
    edge computing. We further summarize lessons learned from state-of-the-art research
    works as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions for MEC research.
    Multi-access edge computing (MEC) can be integrated with 5G and beyond technologies
    such as energy harvesting, cloud radio access network, multiple access, Internet

    Transfer SECTION I. Introduction During the last four decades, the evolution of
    wireless communication networks has changed every aspect of our lives, society,
    culture, politics, and economics. Since the commercialization of the first generation
    (1G) of cellular networks in early 1980’s, generations have been launched with
    enormous differences in terms of the network architectures, key technologies,
    coverage, mobility, security and privacy, data, spectral efficiency, cost optimality,
    and so on. The brief summary of wireless communication evolution is shown in Fig.
    1. Now, both academic and industry communities are making tremendous efforts to
    finalize the 5G standardization and commercialization in 2019. 5G communications
    can be categorized into three categories: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable
    low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
    Compared with previous generations, 5G will support not only communication, but
    also computation, control, and content delivery (4C) functions [1]. Moreover,
    many new applications and use cases are expected with the advent of 5G, for example,
    virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), autonomous vehicle, Tactile Internet, and Internet
    of Things (IoT) scenarios. These applications are poised to induce a significant
    surge in demand for not only communication resources but also computation resources.
    To meet such ever-growing demands, various technological concepts have been developed
    for 5G in terms of radio access, network resource management, applications, network
    architectures and scenarios, power supply, and performance improvement [2]. For
    example, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), dense heterogeneous networks (HetNets),
    cloud radio access network (C-RAN), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), IoT, wireless
    power transfer (WPT) and energy harvesting (EH), and machine learning (ML), have
    been considered as key enabling technologies. FIGURE 1. Evolution of wireless
    communication. Show All The Cisco white paper [3] showed that global data traffic
    will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26 percent between 2017 and
    2022 (i.e., increase more than threefold) and reach 122 exabytes (EB) per month
    by 2022. Mobile and wireless networks carried 11.51 EB per month in 2017, 28.56
    EB per month in 2019, and 77.49 EB per month at the end of 2022. Moreover, traffic
    generated by new applications and services will increase at a much higher CAGR,
    for example, 12-fold for AR and VR, ninefold for Internet gaming, and sevenfold
    for Internet video surveillance. It is also anticipated that the number of connected
    things (e.g., sensors and wearable devices) will reach 28.5 billion by 2022, up
    from 21.5 billion in 2019. However, most connected devices have limited communication
    and storage resources and finite processing capabilities, which show the mismatch
    between the stringent requirements for emerging applications and the actual device
    capabilities. Despite recent advancements in the hardware capability, mobile computing
    still cannot cope with the demand of many applications that need to generate,
    process, and store a massive amount of data and require large computing resources.
    One potential solution to these challenges is to transfer computations to centralized
    clouds, which can be, however, burdened by many issues, such as network congestion
    and privacy policies. This has driven the development of mobile edge computing
    (MEC). Prior to MEC, there have been some similar computing concepts, for example,
    mobile cloud computing (MCC), cloudlet, and fog computing. MCC combines cloud
    computing, mobile computing, and wireless communication networks, thus enabling
    developers and service providers to support more complex applications by moving
    the computing capabilities and data storage away from mobile devices and into
    the cloud [4]. However, MCC suffers from considerable disadvantages, e.g., low
    scalability, high latency, privacy and security issues, and extreme burden on
    limited bandwidth. As the very first edge computing concept, Cloudlet, proposed
    by Satyanarayanan et al. in 2009 [5], refers to a trusted and resource-rich computer
    or a cluster of computers that are located in a strategic location at the network
    edge and well connected to the Internet. The main purpose of cloudlet is to extend
    cloud computing to the network edge and support resource-constrained mobile users
    in running resource-intensive and interactive applications. The WiFi connection
    between users and cloudlets can be a serious drawback. In particular, users are
    unable to access cloudlets in the long distance and use both WiFi and cellular
    connection simultaneously [6], i.e., users have to switch between the mobile network
    and WiFi when they use cloudlet services. Fog computing, a term put forward by
    Cisco in 2012, refers to the extension of cloud computing from the core to the
    network edge, thus it reduces the amount of data needed to transfer to the central
    cloud [7]. Fog computing plays an important role in many use cases and applications
    [8], e.g., smart cities, connected vehicles, smart grid, wireless sensor and actuator
    networks, smart buildings, and decentralized smart building control. However,
    a fog node cannot act as a self-managed cloud data center (DC) and needs the support
    of the cloud. The cloudlet and fog computing are similar in that cloudlets and
    fog nodes are not integrated into the mobile network architecture, thus fog nodes
    and cloudlets are commonly deployed and owned by private enterprises and it is
    not easy to provide mobile users with the quality of service (QoS) and quality
    of experience (QoE) guarantees [9], [10]. In late 2014, the European Telecommunications
    Standards Institute (ETSI) Mobile Edge Computing Industry Specification Group
    (MEC ISG) initiated the MEC concept. As a complement of the C-RAN architecture,
    MEC aims to unite the telecommunication and IT cloud services to provide the cloud-computing
    capabilities within radio access networks in the close vicinity of mobile users
    [27]. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications, e.g., driverless
    vehicles, VR/AR, robotics, and immerse media. In order to reap additional benefits
    of MEC with heterogeneous access technologies, e.g., 4G, 5G, WiFi, and fixed connection,
    ETSI ISG officially changed the name of mobile edge computing to mean multi-access
    edge computing in 2017 [28]. After this scope expansion, MEC servers can be deployed
    by the network operators at various locations within RAN and/or collocated with
    different elements of the network edge, such as BSs (aka eNB in 4G and gNB in
    5G), optical network units, radio network controller sites, and WiFi access points.
    This transformation pushes intelligence towards the edge so that not only communication
    functionalities but also computation, caching, and control services can be better
    facilitated. From this point, the correct name for MEC is multi-access edge computing
    and this paper uses that name. Over the last few years, there have been a large
    number of studies focusing on either technical aspects of MEC architectures or
    reviews of attributes and application use cases of MEC. Many also consider the
    importance of MEC in 5G enabling technologies and applications and cover certain
    research aspects discussed in our article, for example, [1], [9], [11]–[19], [21]–[23].
    The previous surveys are summarized as follows. The surveys in [17]–[19] presented
    a general overview of MEC on definitions, architectures, advantages, deployment
    scenarios and testbeds, and security and privacy issues. The survey in [9], [11]
    reviewed several edge computing concepts and focused on computation offloading.
    The authors in [1] reviewed joint communication and computation resource management
    in MEC systems. In [12], the authors described four fundamental enabling technologies
    for MEC including virtual machines and containers, network functions virtualization
    (NFV), software-defined networking (SDN), and network slicing. Moreover, the authors
    provided analyses of the MEC service orchestration, MEC service mobility, and
    joint optimization of virtual network functions and MEC services. Several works
    in [21]–[23] revealed the role of MEC for IoT applications and realization. Recent
    studies in [13], [14] focused on reviewing the integration of communication, caching,
    and computation. Mathematical frameworks for optimization of MEC systems were
    reported in [15], [16]. In particular, the authors in [15] conducted a survey
    on the computation offloading decisions when multiple challenges, e.g., heterogeneous
    resources, large amounts of computation and communication, intermittent connectivity
    and network capacity, are considered (i.e., multi-objective optimization). The
    authors in [16] reviewed research works that applied theoretical games in addressing
    problems and challenges of MEC systems. The tutorial in [20] presented three main
    edge computing concepts: MEC, cloudlet, and fog computing, from the viewpoints
    of standardization, principles, architectures, and application. In Table 1, we
    provide a summary of the recently published surveys and reviews on MEC. TABLE
    1 Summary of existing surveys on multi-access edge computing Previous surveys
    addressed important problems in MEC systems, while they have several limitations.
    These surveys are limited to specific aspects and potential use cases of MEC,
    for instance, MEC overview [17], [19], architecture and computation offloading
    [9], resource allocation [1], and mathematical frameworks [15], [16]. Indeed,
    these articles provide only high-level discussions of the problems and challenges
    of MEC in 5G. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing survey to provide
    a discussion of MEC in the context of other 5G technologies. Furthermore, it is
    necessary to have an updated survey since MEC has gained popularity in years with
    a fast-growing research trend and ETSI has released a set of phase 2 specifications,
    but almost all the articles mentioned in the related work were prepared and/or
    submitted quite long ago. Therefore, this paper sets to provide a comprehensive
    survey of the state-of-the-arts which are focused on the integration of MEC and
    the forthcoming technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond network. In
    a nutshell, contributions offered by our survey can be summarized as follows:
    We conduct an overview of MEC including fundamentals of MEC (e.g., characteristics,
    challenges, and market drivers), and MEC integration in the 5G network with potential
    use cases and applications. We discuss the role of MEC in the 5G network architecture
    and undertake a holistic review of related literature published in the last few
    years for the integration of MEC with the forthcoming 5G and beyond technologies
    and scenarios including NOMA, WPT and EH, UAV, IoT, and heterogeneous C-RAN, and
    ML. We provide a concise summary of lessons learned from the state-of-the-art
    research works and describe potential future directions. The remaining of this
    paper is organized as follows. Sections II provides the fundamentals of MEC, including
    its benefits, integrated architecture in the 5G scenario, and key use cases. The
    major part of this work is a review of MEC in the context of NOMA (Section III),
    WPT and EH (Section IV), UAV communications (Section V), IoT (Section VI), heterogeneous
    C-RAN (Section VII), and machine learning (Section VIII). For each section, we
    first outline background, then provide motivations for the integration, and finally
    outline learned lessons and potential directions. The paper is concluded in Section
    X. For the sake of clarity, Fig. 2 shows the organization of this paper. FIGURE

    Researches We present fundamentals of MEC by listing the main features and discussing
    design challenges of MEC and the benefits offered by MEC. We also show the interactions
    between MEC in the forthcoming 5G technologies and further illustrate MEC use
    cases with representative examples. A. Fundamentals of MEC The key idea of MEC
    is “providing an IT service environment and cloud-computing capabilities at the
    edge of the mobile network, within the RAN and in close proximity to mobile subscribers”
    [29]. The demand for MEC has been driven by many factors, such as the increasing
    pervasiveness of smart and IoT devices, rapid increase in the data volume and
    velocity, the increasing need for the rapid development of new high-bandwidth
    and low-latency applications, introduction of new wireless technologies, and increasing
    requirement of QoE and QoS. Among those factors, low-latency computing is considered
    as the primary driven factor for the development of MEC. The demand for low-latency
    computing is increasing rapidly as low latency is a fundamental metric for network
    performance and is required by many emerging applications (e.g., VR, interactive
    gaming, and mission-critical controls). The development of MEC is further fortified
    by great opportunities for business transformation. On the one hand, mobile network
    operators (MNOs) need to shorten the time-to-market of new applications and services
    to maximize the overall revenue. On the other hand, the success and widespread
    deployment of MEC are guaranteed only when there is the participation of multiple
    stakeholders (e.g., mobile operators, service providers, vendors, and users) as
    well as their collaboration. As suggested in [30], the key growth drivers in the
    MEC market can be classified into four major categories: technical integration,
    potential use cases, business transformation, and industry collaboration (see
    Fig. 3). In the foreseeable future, MEC will open up new markets for different
    industries and sectors by enabling a wide variety of use cases, e.g., IoT, Industry
    4.0, Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, smart city, and Tactile Internet.
    A complete picture of MEC, including challenges, characteristics, use cases and
    applications, and market drivers, is pictorially illustrated in Fig. 3. FIGURE
    3. An overview of MEC: challenges, characteristics, potential use cases and applications,
    and market drivers. Show All According to the ETSI white paper [27], MEC can be
    characterized by some features, namely on-premises, proximity, lower latency,
    location awareness, and network context information. These features can be shortly
    explained as follows: On-premises: MEC can operate in standalone environments
    (i.e., MEC can run isolated from the rest of the network) and has access to local
    resources. Proximity: MEC servers are usually positioned in the close vicinity
    of mobile users, thus MEC can capture information from mobile users for further
    purposes such as data analytics and big data processing. Lower latency: although
    an MEC server has a finite computation power, it is usually sufficient to process
    emerging compute-intensive applications in real time. MEC has the potential of
    shortening the communication and propagation latency, which makes MEC a promising
    enabler for latency-critical 5G applications. MEC also opens up the opportunities
    to alleviate the burdens on the fronthaul and backhaul links and to accelerate
    the content and service responsiveness by appropriately caching popular and locally-relevant
    contents at the network edge. Location awareness: Due to the close proximity,
    MEC can utilize signaling information received from end users to estimate their
    precise locations. This becomes particularly important for MEC location-based
    services. Network contextual information: characterized by proximity, MEC can
    utilize the knowledge of real-time radio network conditions and local contextual
    information to optimize the network and QoS. For example, real-time and contextual
    information can be used to improve user experience via personalized services [30].
    In spite of several opportunities and potentials, many challenges need to be studied
    in order to create an edge ecosystem where all network players (i.e., IoT users,
    service/infrastructure providers, and mobile operators) can benefit from edge
    services. The discussion can be summarized as follows. Distributed resource management:
    Resource allocation is a key challenge for the success of MEC due to finite resources,
    growing number of applications, and explosive increase in the mobile traffic [31].
    The optimization of resource allocation may be multi-objective that varies in
    different situations due to diverse nature of applications, heterogeneous MEC
    servers, various user demands/characteristics, and channel connection qualities.
    With massive users, the wireless channel would be bottlenecked and the competition
    among users for scarce computing resources becomes highly intense [32]. Although
    the centralized approach can achieve competitive performance, it has the weakness
    of high computational complexity and huge reporting overhead. Therefore, the centralized
    approach is not suitable for distributed MEC systems [33], [34]. Additionally,
    there may not exist a dedicated backhaul for information exchange and computation
    offloading and even if there is, the wireless backhaul could be congested due
    to the high burden of huge data sharing [35]. All of these points call for efficient
    and distributed MEC resource allocation schemes. Reliability and mobility: Densification
    is a key block for the 5G network and is expected to lead to enormous benefits.
    However, managing mobility and ensuring reliability are quite challenging in such
    environments. First, under the coverage of multiple small-scale servers, user
    mobility can cause frequent handovers, which introduce the service disruption
    problem and affect the overall network performance [36]. Second, users (e.g. vehicles)
    may move to new locations during the computation offloading period. In such a
    case, users may not be able to receive the computational result since they already
    move out of the service coverage of their serving servers. Therefore, efficient
    computation offloading models are necessary for the application accomplishment.
    Third, variations in the number of offloading users result in random uplink interference
    and time-varying computing resources [37]. Finally, ultra-reliability is an important
    concept in 5G since it initiated the implementation of industrial automation and
    smart transportation. For instance, AR-based applications usually require the
    real-time response and ultra-reliable connection between the server and users.
    While ultra-high reliability on the order of 99.99999% and extremely low latency
    of 0.1-1ms round-trip time are the communication requirements in industrial control
    networks or autonomous mobility systems [38]. These requirements would not be
    well fulfilled under dynamic channel qualities and intermittent connections. There
    has been a great deal of efforts in utilizing MEC for providing reliable and low-latency
    services. We invite the interested readers to read the surveys in [39], [40] for
    more detail. Network integration and application portability: Depending on the
    underlying technologies, technical and business requirements, MEC servers can
    be deployed at different places within the RAN. Thus, another critical challenge
    is the seamless integration of MEC into the underlying network architecture and
    existing interfaces [27]. The existence of MEC and enabled applications should
    not affect the standard specifications of the core network and end devices. According
    to [28], the key component of the MEC integration is the ability of MEC to interact
    with 5G networks in routing the traffic and receiving relevant control information.
    Furthermore, the application migration necessitates a so-called application portability
    requirement. This removes the need for app developers to design multiple versions
    for different MEC platforms. Coexistence of distributed MEC and centralized cloud:
    Cloud DCs, with abundant computing resources, can process big-data applications
    in near zero time and support a large number of users. However, distributed MEC
    is highly desired since the computation at the network edge can not only meet
    the user requirement but also reduce the end-to-end delay caused by the traffic
    congestion and transmission delay. By analogy to the HetNet architecture, it is
    highly beneficial to implement MEC in a hierarchical manner, i.e., user, edge-computing,
    and cloud-computing layers. In this way, the MEC vendor also injects computing
    resources to the small-eNBs so that the advantages of HetNets can be exploited
    for diversifying radio transmissions and spreading computing demands [41]. We
    note that distributed MEC may not have enough computing resources to process all
    computation requests and complete reliance on the cloud poses challenges of providing
    latency-critical services. Therefore, it is intuitive to distribute big-data/latency-critical
    computations to distributed MEC servers while transferring compute-intensive and
    delay-tolerant tasks to the cloud DC [42]. The coexistence of distributed MEC
    and centralized cloud is an important issue and more research is needed for their
    interactions. Coexistence of human-to-human and MEC traffic: Incorporating both
    conventional Human-to-Human (H2H) traffic (e.g., voice, data, and video) and MEC
    traffic in 5G is a challenging task due to massive IoT connections coupled with
    the diverse QoS requirements and unique characteristics of MEC traffic [43]. For
    instance, the IoT system comprises of human-type devices (HTDs) and machine-type
    devices (MTDs) that may run different kinds of applications, e.g., MTD with sensors
    and smart homes, and HTD with video games. While MTDs have a mixed set of QoS
    requirements, such as latency, reliability, and energy efficiency, HTDs typically
    require a high-speed rate with the limited energy budget [44]. Similarly, the
    MEC system should be designed in a way that the QoS requirements of H2H traffic
    are satisfied while unique characteristics of M2M traffic (e.g., real-time response
    and context awareness) are maintained. Security and privacy: Although MEC has
    the capability to improve security and privacy compared with MCC, MEC has its
    own security and privacy challenges. First, MEC can be collocated with different
    heterogeneous network elements, thus making the conventional privacy and security
    mechanisms, which have been already operated in MCC, inapplicable to MEC systems.
    Second, the task offloading over wireless channels may not be secure since computation
    tasks can be overheard by malicious eavesdroppers. The transfer of compute-intensive
    applications’ data can be secured by encryption at the user side and decryption
    at the destination server side. This, however, can increase the propagation delay
    as well as execution delay, thus reducing the application performance [45]. Physical
    layer security, blockchain, and federated learning have emerged as effective solutions
    to secure and protect MEC systems [46], [47]. Finally, sharing the same storage
    and computation resources among multiple mobile users raises issues of private
    data leakage and loss. B. Integration of MEC into the 5G System After initializing
    the MEC concept, the ETSI ISG and many members in the value chain have spent a
    great deal of efforts for the development of MEC specifications based on industry
    consensus. At the time of writing this paper, there are 68 members and 35 participants
    in the ETSI consortium,1 which are not only mobile operators but also manufacturers,
    service providers, and universities, e.g., Vodafone, IBM, Intel, NTT Corporation,
    University CarlosIII de Madrid, etc. Their involvement plays a major role in ensuring
    an open and interoperable MEC environment, and MEC is beneficial to various stakeholders
    including MNOs, application developers, over-the-top players, independent software
    vendors, telecom equipment vendors, IT platform vendors, system integrators, and
    technology providers. The ETSI ISG has published a set of standards and specifications
    focusing on, for example, framework and reference architecture [48], MEC in the
    NFV environment [49], and collocating C-RAN and MEC [50]. The 3GPP started including
    MEC in the 5G network standardization in the technical specification 3GPP TS 23.501
    [51]. Recently, in [28] and based on functional enablers defined in [51, clause
    5.13], the 3GPP clarified how to deploy MEC in and seamlessly integrate MEC into
    5G, which can be illustrated in Fig. 4. The architecture comprises two parts:
    the 5G service-based architecture (SBA) on the left and an MEC reference architecture
    on the right. FIGURE 4. MEC integrated architecture in 5G [28]. Show All The network
    functions defined in the 5G architecture and their roles can be briefly summarized
    as follows. Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF): establishes mobility
    and access procedures, e.g., connection management, reachability management, mobility
    event notification, termination of the RAN control plane, and access authentication/authorization.
    Session Management Function (SMF): performs functionalities related to session
    management, e.g., session establishment, termination of interfaces towards policy
    control functions, and downlink data notification. Network Slice Selection Function
    (NSSF): executes the allocation of slicing resources and AMF set to serve users.
    Network Repository Function (NRF): supports the discovery of network functions
    and their supported services. Unified Data Management (UDM): handles user subscription
    and identification services. Policy Control Function (PCF): unifies the network
    policies and provides policy rules to control plane functions. Network Exposure
    Function (NEF): acts as a service-aware border gateway for providing secure communication
    with the services supported by the network functions. Authentication Server Function
    (AUSF): performs authentication procedures. User Plane Function (UPF): provides
    functionalities to facilitate user plane operations, e.g., packet routing and
    forwarding, data buffering, and allocation of IP address. More details of the
    SBA and the 5G network functions can be found in 3GPP TS 23.501 [51]. The MEC
    reference architecture is composed of the MEC system level and host level [48].
    The MEC orchestrator (MECO) is the core component of the MEC system level, which
    maintains information on deployed MEC hosts (i.e., servers), available resources,
    MEC services, and topology of the entire MEC system. The MECO is also responsible
    for selecting of MEC hosts for application instantiation, on-boarding of application
    packages, triggering application relocation, and triggering application instantiation
    and termination. The host level management consists of the MEC platform manager
    and the virtualization infrastructure manager (VIM). The MEC platform manager
    carries out the duties on managing the life cycle of applications, providing element
    management functions, and controlling the application rules and requirements.
    The MEC platform manager also processes fault reports and performance measurements
    received from the VIM. Meanwhile, the VIM is in charge of allocating virtualized
    resources, preparing the virtualization infrastructure to run software images,
    provisioning MEC applications, and monitoring application faults and performance.
    Finally, the MEC host comprises an MEC platform and a virtualization infrastructure.
    The former includes the set of functionalities needed to run MEC applications
    on a particular virtualization infrastructure and the latter includes the data
    plane functionalities of executing the traffic rules received by the MEC platform
    and steering the traffic among applications and networks. New functional enablers
    were defined in [51] to integrate MEC into the 5G SBA, which can be explained
    as follows. User Plane Reselection and Selection: The 5G core network supports
    the UPF (re)selection for selective traffic routing to the data network. Parameters
    used for the UPF selection mechanism is dependent on the UPF deployment scenario
    and MEC service operator configuration. Local Routing and Traffic Steering: The
    UPF enables various traffic routing schemes for MEC applications in the 5G network.
    Moreover, application functions (AFs) may affect the UPF (re)selection and make
    specific traffic routing rules for a particular user. Local Area Data Network
    (LADN): The support for LADN is enabled by the flexibility in the UPF location.
    Then, MEC hosts can be deployed on the N6 interface that is between the UPF and
    a data network. The user using MEC services may discover LADN availability during
    the registration procedure based on LADN information received from the AMF. Session
    and Service Continuity (SSC): The support for SSC is essential to enable user
    and application mobility. The 5G architecture allows MEC applications to select
    one among three SSC modes [51]. Particularly, SSC mode 1 provides the stable network
    connectivity to the user, SSC mode 2 may release the current connectivity to the
    user before making a new one, and SSC mode 3 ensures service continuity for the
    user by changing the new user plane before disconnecting the existing one. Network
    Capability Exposure: The 5G architecture allows both direct access to network
    functions for the authorized MEC and indirect access via the NEF. Examples of
    exposed capabilities are exposure of user events, exposure of user behavior provisioning
    to external functions, and exposure of analytics to external parties. QoS and
    Charging: The PCF in the 5G SBA defines QoS and charging rules for the user traffic
    routed to the LADN. C. MEC in 5G and Beyond Many services and applications will
    be supported in 5G and beyond, which can derive substantial benefits from MEC
    by being executed at the distributed edge servers. No matter what the service
    is, MEC use cases can be classified under three main categories, namely consumer-oriented
    services, operator and third-party services, and network performance and QoE improvements
    (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5) [29]. The fact is that the MEC ecosystem should support
    all these categories to create a myriad of new services and applications at the
    edge of mobile networks. Generally, the classification is dependent on who could
    reap the advantages and benefits. First, the use case “consumer-oriented services”
    aims to bring direct benefits to users through the capability of running computation-heavy
    and latency-sensitive applications at the network edge. By means of computation
    offloading, users can exploit substantial computing resources on the edge server
    [52]. Applications and services under the first category can include graphical
    rendering applications (e.g., 3D gaming, AR/VR, assisted reality, and cognitive
    assistance), intermediate data-processing (e.g., data analytics and video analysis),
    and low-latency applications (e.g., remote surgery on tactile Internet, AR/VR,
    video games, and interactive applications), and location-based service recommendation.
    Under the second category, operators and third parties take advantages of MEC
    computing and storage facilities to place their own applications and services
    on the network edge. This is enabled by the “open and interoperable environment”
    nature of MEC, and is to encourage innovation and development in MEC from multiple
    parties and overcome obstacles (e.g., deployment difficulties and operational
    costs) in providing MEC services at the hard-to-reach areas [28]. Applications
    and services offered by operators and third-party vendors can include V2X applications
    (e.g., safety, convenience, and driving assistance), big data, active device location
    tracking, security, safety, data analytics, and indoor precise positioning. Finally,
    the services under “network performance and QoE improvements” group intend to
    optimize operations of the network, thus improving the network performance and
    QoE. Examples of the third category are local content caching at the edge, mobile
    backhaul optimization, traffic deduplication, video delivery optimization for
    transmission control protocol (TCP), multi radio access technology (RAT) computation
    offloading, and network congestion in dense-network environments. FIGURE 5. Integration
    of MEC with the forthcoming 5G technologies. Show All To support the aforementioned
    applications and services, new architectures and technologies will be introduced
    in the 5G network. As shown in Fig. 5, the integration of MEC with the forthcoming
    5G technologies is necessary to achieve added values in MEC systems. A brief description
    of MEC in the 5G scenario is given as follows. NOMA, millimeter Wave (mmWave),
    and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO): As a multiple access technology
    to meet the demand for massive connectivity, the integration of NOMA into MEC
    systems is an important research issue, which needs more attention in the years
    to come. Moreover, the coexistence of MEC with mmWave massive MIMO is necessary
    to enable massive wireless connectivity with high data rates, low-latency, and
    large computing capabilities. These schemes are provided in Section III. EH and
    WPT: Thanks to EH and WPT, the design of self-sufficient and self-sustaining wireless
    communications (aka green communication) becomes a reality. The combination of
    EH and/or WPT with MEC in a single system offers great potential to solve fundamental
    limitations of traditional systems, e.g., limited battery lifetime, unstable grid
    power supply, and low computing capability. To understand these issues more clearly,
    research works on EH and WPT MEC systems are surveyed in Section IV. UAV communications:
    UAVs can be exploited to enable many potential applications due to their features
    of flexibility, mobility, maneuverability, and low cost. On the one hand, UAVs
    can be aerial edge servers to perform heavy computations offloaded from ground
    users. On the other hand, UAVs can act as aerial users and associate with ground
    BSs to offload their tasks. The integration of UAV into MEC systems is a promising
    research topic, which will be summarized in Section V. IoT: IoT devices are quite
    resource-constrained to run compute-intensive tasks due to their limited computing
    capability and battery capacity. MEC is a powerful solution to solve these limitations.
    Inversely, IoT expands MEC services into more scenarios and objects like sensors,
    actuators, and mechanized agriculture. We will provide a survey on recent MEC-enabled
    IoT applications in Section VI. H-CRAN: With the realization of NFV, the collocation
    of MEC and heterogeneous C-RAN (H-CRAN) is expected to bring potential benefits.
    In such a scenario, the edge host (i.e., MEC server) in MEC and the BBU pool in
    H-CRAN can be collocated with each other to share the same virtualization infrastructure.
    We will study the integration of H-CRAN and MEC further in Section VII. Machine
    Learning: The massive amount of mobile data, together with recent breakthroughs
    in ML and the non-convexity nature of resource allocation in a complex network,
    inspires many creative solutions for wireless communications and networking problems.
    ML plays a central role in the design of MEC mechanisms as we will elaborate in
    Section VIII. VM, SDN, NFV, and Network Slicing: MEC systems primarily rely on
    four enablers: VM, SDN, NFV, and network slicing. VM virtualization enables transient
    customization of MEC infrastructure, while SDN, NFV, and network slicing provide
    greater flexibility and agility of multi-tenant MEC ecosystems. For more information
    on these issues, we refer the interested readers to [12], [48], [53] and references
    therein. Besides aforementioned ones, integration of MEC with some other technologies
    such as blockchain and cognitive radio is expected to offer various benefits.
    A survey of blockchain in the context of cloud of things can be found in [47]
    and applications of blockchain for 5G and beyond networks were reviewed in [54].
    Cognitive radio is a vital technology for efficient spectrum scarcity, which allows
    to meet the high spectrum demand of many new applications and services, and proliferation
    of massive IoT connections. studies on cognitive radio MEC may have additional
    challenges, e.g., how to sense available spectrum bands, how to protect primary
    users, and how to allocate resources to improve the network performance. Despite
    these issues, integrating cognitive radio with MEC is expected to offer a number
    of advantages. For example, the work in [55] showed that cognitive radio edge
    computing can well support low-latency and compute-intensive industrial applications.
    In the following sections, we will review a number of studies related to these
    technologies in the context of MEC systems. In summary, we focus on the following
    aspects in MEC systems: radio access (NOMA, mmWave, and massive MIMO), network
    architectures and scenarios (H-CRAN and UAV), applications (IoT, V2X, and UAV),
    power supply (EH and WPT), and performance improvement (ML). In the following
    sections, these researches are discussed in more details. SECTION III. MEC With
    Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access A. Fundamentals of NOMA Non-orthogonal multiple
    access (NOMA) has been considered as an essential principle for the design of
    radio access techniques in the emerging 5G network [56]. The key idea of NOMA
    is the use of the superposition coding technique at the BS side and interference
    cancellation techniques (e.g. multiple user detection and successive interference
    cancellation) at the user side. Compared to the conventional orthogonal multiple
    access (OMA), NOMA can enable multiple users to share the same time-frequency
    resource to achieve higher spectral efficiency. There are two main NOMA categories:
    power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA. Power-domain NOMA exploits the channel
    gain differences between users and multiplexes users in the power-domain while
    code-domain NOMA uses user-specific sequences for sharing the entire available
    radio resource [57]. Typical examples of code-domain based access strategies are
    low-density spreading code division multiple access (CDMA), low-density spreading-based
    orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), sparse code multiple access
    (SCMA), and multi-user shared access (MUSA). NOMA has the potential to accommodate
    more users than the number of available subcarriers, which leads to various potentials,
    including massive connectivity, lower latency, higher spectral efficiency, and
    relaxed channel feedback [58]. The comparison between OMA and NOMA is summarized
    in Table 2 [57]. TABLE 2 Comparison Between OMA and NOMA Although NOMA is able
    to support a large number of users simultaneously and surpasses OMA in several
    aspects, various challenging problems associated with NOMA must be addressed before
    this technology can be employed in real networks. Islam et al. in [59] and Dai
    et al. in [60] provided some research directives for NOMA in their survey: dynamic
    user pairing, the impact of transmission distortion, channel and interference
    estimation, etc. NOMA can be flexibly combined with many existing wireless technologies
    and emerging ones including MIMO, massive MIMO, mmWave communications, cognitive
    and cooperative communications, visible light communications, physical layer security,
    energy harvesting, wireless caching, and so on [61]. To gain a deeper understanding
    of the benefits and opportunities that NOMA offers as well as its challenges and
    application scenarios, the interested readers are recommended to refer to NOMA
    research works, such as, [57], [59], [60], [62]–[64]. B. Motivation to Combine
    NOMA and MEC Both NOMA and MEC are considered as the key enabling technologies
    in 5G due to their enormous potentials and wide-range applications. There are
    many benefits of MEC and NOMA, including supporting massive users, reducing the
    transmission latency and the energy consumption of end users and providing high
    performance for more complex network scenarios, i.e. mmWave massive MIMO. The
    combination of MEC and NOMA can significantly improve the user satisfaction and
    network performance through the provision of golden opportunities. While NOMA
    offers several advantages at improving the spectral efficiency and cell-edge throughput,
    relaxing the channel feedback requirement, and reducing the transmission latency,
    MEC brings considerable benefits to not only users, but also operators and third-parties,
    and enables to improve overall network performance as well. It is expected that
    5G will support a massive increase in device connections, high-speed transmissions
    of 1–10 Gbps, and greatly reduce latency and high reliability. The combination
    of MEC and NOMA can reinforce the services and applications that are supported
    by the 5G network. On the one hand, NOMA is expected to vastly increase the number
    of users in various scenarios where rank deficiency can occur [60]. On the other
    hand, edge computing in MEC indicates that computing resources are provided for
    end users in close proximity and at the edge of RANs. Therefore, MEC is capable
    of widely distributing computing resources from centralized cloud to the network
    edge and immediately serving a large number of users, hence MEC has the potential
    to support massive connectivity and distributed computation. The combination of
    MEC and NOMA can provide low-latency transmission. Because the 5G network will
    not completely rely on a single technology, we must optimize the network from
    multiple perspectives, e.g., air interface, network architecture, and enabling
    technologies. To cope with demands for lower latency, MEC and NOMA are two promising
    solutions. MEC moves the cloud services and functions to the network edge, where
    data is mostly generated and handled. Hence, MEC empowers the services running
    at the edge to better meet the lower latency requirements of end users compared
    to the cloud computing. In a similar sense, flexible scheduling and grant-free
    access in NOMA enables lower transmission latency for users in the 5G network.
    NOMA and MEC can be flexibly combined with many existing wireless technologies,
    e.g., MIMO, massive MIMO, mmWave communications, etc., to further increase connectivity,
    spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and computing capability. For example,
    massive MIMO can drastically increase the spectral efficiency of wireless networks
    via excessive spatial multiplexing, thus Massive MIMO-NOMA can support massive
    connectivity and high spectral efficiency. To support gigabits-per-second data
    rates, mmWave bands can be used for wireless communications. The large path-losses
    caused by mmWave can be compensated by high gains, which can be obtained by massive
    MIMO. As a result, NOMA MEC can be deployed jointly with mmWave massive MIMO to
    enable multiple mobile devices to offload tasks simultaneously with high uploading/downloading
    data rates. Promoted by a variety of opportunities and advantages offered by MEC
    and NOMA, both academic and industrial communities have conducted extensive researches
    to design the 5G network with MEC and NOMA [65]–[67]. However, the state-of-the-art
    MEC researches still have not explored the full potential benefits of NOMA in
    the context of MEC. NOMA and MEC are both conceived as the bids to fill the gap
    between IoT devices and IoT applications and services. On the one hand, MEC empowers
    resource-constrained IoT devices with significant additional computational capabilities
    through computation offloading, thus bringing new applications and services to
    IoT devices. Similarly, with IoT, the scope of MEC services and applications is
    applicable to not only mobile phones, but also a wide range of smart objects ranging
    from sensors and actuators to smart vehicles. On the other hand, NOMA is capable
    of substantially improving on system capability since it enables multiple users
    to transmit using a dedicated orthogonal channel resource. Furthermore, motivated
    by the benefits of NOMA over OMA, it appears utterly reasonable that one can exploit
    NOMA to further improve the use of MEC in IoT networks, as compared to the performance
    of conventional OMA-based MEC approaches. Apparently, NOMA can be exploited to
    increase the efficiency and performance of multi-user MEC systems. In the following,
    we present an overview of research works that have explored the combination of
    NOMA and MEC and then discuss fundamental challenges and open directions. C. State
    of the Art While the use cases of NOMA or MEC have been widely studied in the
    literature, there have been some studies on MEC-NOMA scenarios. The advantages
    of NOMA and MEC have motivated several studies supporting the application of NOMA
    to MEC [66], [68], [70], [71], [76], [77]. When NOMA uplink transmission is applied
    to the MEC system, multiple users can offload their tasks to the MEC server simultaneously
    via the same frequency band. By applying the successive interference cancellation
    (SIC) technology at the MEC server, the MEC server can remove the interference
    from the user whose data has been decoded before on the same frequency band. When
    NOMA downlink transmission is applied to the MEC system, one user can utilize
    NOMA to offload multiple tasks to multiple MEC servers simultaneously via the
    same frequency band. The performance comparison of NOMA-MEC and OMA-MEC systems
    was conducted in [66], which reveals that the NOMA-MEC system can achieve superior
    performance in reducing latency and energy consumption. Most existing research
    works focus on resource allocation i.e., computation resource and communication
    resource. Specifically, in [68], partial offloading assignment (i.e., each user
    can partition the computation task into two parts for local computing and offloading)
    and power allocation were investigated to minimize the weighted sum of the energy
    consumption for a multi-user NOMA-MEC system. In this work, an efficient algorithm
    for user’s task partitioning, local computing CPU frequency and transmit power
    allocation was proposed to achieve the minimum energy consumption for multi-user
    NOMA-MEC networks. Unlike OMA-MEC and pure NOMA-MEC systems (i.e., both the users
    offload all of their tasks at the same time) proposed in [66], [68], a hybrid
    NOMA strategy (i.e., a user can first offload parts of its task within time slot
    allocated to other user and then offload the remaining of its task during a time
    slot solely occupied by itself) was proposed in [70], in which power allocation
    and time allocation were optimized to minimize the energy consumption for an MEC-enabled
    NOMA system. Subsequently, the delay minimization was investigated for the hybrid
    NOMA-MEC system [76]. The work in [78] defined the objective function balancing
    the tradeoff between energy consumption and completion delay in hybrid NOMA-MEC
    systems. A joint power allocation and user clustering problem was investigated
    in [78], from which power allocation is provided in closed form and user clustering
    is solved by using a matching theory approach. Different from partial offloading
    tasks, the authors in [71] considered that the offloading tasks are independent
    and non-separate. Then the communication resource (i.e., frequency bands and transmit
    powers) and the computing resource (i.e., computing resource blocks) were jointly
    optimized to minimize the energy consumption for the NOMA-MEC system [71], in
    which an efficient heuristic algorithm of user clustering and frequency and resource
    block allocation was proposed to address the energy consumption minimization problem
    per NOMA cluster. In [77], the computing offloading scheme was investigated in
    the NOMA MEC system where a distributed algorithm based on game theory was proposed
    to improve the system performance. Moreover, the delay minimization problem was
    investigated in [74], [75]. In [75] an efficient algorithm of the offloading workload,
    offloading and downloading duration optimization was proposed to minimize the
    overall delay of the computation tasks. Another study on NOMA-MEC to minimize
    the average overall delay can be found in [79], where a joint offloading decision,
    subchannel assignment, power control, and computing resource allocation problem
    is investigated and users with differentiated uploading delays are taken into
    consideration. The energy efficient power allocation, time allocation and task
    assignment were proposed to minimize the energy consumption for MEC networks [69],
    [72]. Besides the computational resource, SIC decoding order was optimized to
    reduce the task delay for NOMA enabled narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT)
    systems [73]. The summary of the existing works on NOMA MEC is provided in Table
    3. The work in [80] considered minimizing the total completion time of secondary
    users in a cognitive NOMA-MEC system. The latency minimization problem is optimized
    under constraints that the interference at primary users is below an interference
    threshold and the total computing resources assigned to users cannot exceed the
    maximum computing capability of the MEC server. Another interesting work on cognitive
    MEC was studied in [81], where downlink NOMA is applied for the transmissions
    between secondary users to the MEC servers. A joint offloading decision, local
    computing capability control, and NOMA power allocation was considered to minimize
    the system delay. Similar to [80], the decomposition technique is applied to solve
    the problem in [81] in an iterative manner. TABLE 3 Summary of Existing Works
    on NOMA MEC D. Learned Lessons and Potential Works Because of limited researches
    advocated to coexisting MEC-NOMA scenarios there are many key open problems that
    must be investigated. The potential works of NOMA and MEC can be viewed from the
    following four aspects: 1) joint resource optimization; 2) secure communications;
    3) cooperative NOMA MEC; 4) coexistence of NOMA MEC and mmWave massive MIMO; 5)
    low-complexity and online NOMA MEC schemes. 1) Joint Resource Optimization Resource
    allocation plays an important role to improve the performance of the wireless
    network. Thus in MEC-NOMA networks, the communication and computing resource can
    be jointly optimized to enhance the system performance, i.e., sum rate and energy
    efficiency. In other words, the scheduler may need to decide the computation load
    that the user can offload to the MEC server, and the remaining can be computed
    locally to minimize the latency. Moreover, computation capacity (i.e. processing
    speed of MEC servers or mobile devices) and communication resource (i.e. transmit
    power) are also important factors to reduce the computation latency. Joint optimization
    of these factors presents an open and challenging research problem. When NOMA
    uplink transmission is applied to the MEC system, multiple users can offload their
    tasks to the MEC server at the same time. Therefore, the total latency experienced
    by the multiple users can be investigated. By controlling the offloaded computation
    load and transmit power of each user, the optimal and suboptimal strategies can
    be developed to minimize the total latency of the system by considering the total
    energy consumption. The proposed solution can be extended to the NOMA downlink
    MEC system. Moreover, user grouping or user association can be another trend in
    resource optimization of MEC-NOMA systems, where game-theoretic approaches and
    metaheuristic optimizers [41], [82], [83] can be exploited to group users into
    different groups which use different subchannels to offload their tasks. Besides,
    the performance of the SIC technology is sensitive to the availability of channel
    state information (CSI). Thus another possible direction to address this issue
    is to rely on partial CSI. The application of partial CSI in downlink NOMA system
    was investigated in [84], [85], which can be investigated in resource allocation
    for MEC-NOMA systems. 2) Secure Communication Security and privacy-preserving
    communication attract lots of research attention, especially when NOMA is applied
    to the MEC system. For example, two users are offloading tasks to an MEC server
    at the same time by using the NOMA principle. When SIC is performed, one user
    can decode the other user’s message. During this period, an eavesdropper or an
    attacker may attempt to decode the mobile user’s message. To address the scenario
    with external eavesdroppers, the physical layer security can be utilized to cope
    with this challenge for the NOMA-MEC system [86], [87]. The combination of PLS
    and NOMA-MEC is a promising research topic. 3) Cooperative NOMA-MEC System To
    improve the connectivity of the NOMA-MEC network, the cooperative MEC can be adopted
    to enable computation offloading to the main MEC server. In this scenario, the
    mobile device transmits the superimposed signals to the primary MEC server and
    the helper MEC server, which acts as a relay helping MEC server [88], [89]. Considering
    the local computing capacity of the mobile users and energy consumption constraint,
    the task assignment and transmit power allocation can be optimized to improve
    the performance of NOMA MEC system. 4) Coexistence of NOMA MEC and mmWave Massive
    MIMO Massive MIMO-NOMA is another scenario to support massive connectivity and
    high spectral efficiency [61]. To further improve the transmission data rate,
    the mmWave bands (30 GHz to 300 GHz) have been proposed to provide gigabit-per-second
    data rates. Therefore, the integration of NOMA MEC into mmWave MIMO based wireless
    networks can improve the computing capability, spectrum efficiency and reduce
    the task delay, where multiple mobile devices can transmit tasks simultaneously
    via the mmWave bands. Inspired by the challenges of the traditional MIMO transmission
    scheme, an efficient approach of joint beamforming design and communication and
    computing resource allocation will be a major challenge to tackle. Moreover, the
    user grouping needs to be well investigated to further enhance the system performance.
    Very recently, there have been some research studies pertaining to MEC with massive
    MIMO and mmWave like [90], [91]. For example, the work in [90] considered a cell-free
    massive MIMO system with a cloud DC and a number of access points (APs), and further
    derived the successful edge computing probability (SECP). This work showed an
    interesting observation that for a given SECP, the system becomes more energy-efficient
    with higher AP density and less antennas at each AP, rather than with smaller
    AP density and larger number of antennas. 5) Low-Complexity and Adaptive NOMA-MEC
    It is widely known that the NOMA computational complexity (e.g., user clustering,
    signal decoding, and CSI acquisition) is the main barrier against the NOMA practicality
    [92]. Most of the existing studies consider using convex optimization and game
    theory approaches for solving resource management problems in NOMA MEC systems;
    however, they typically have high complexity. Therefore, low-complexity NOMA-MEC
    techniques are of importance for the NOMA practicality. Moreover, to cope with
    the dynamics of MEC wireless environments and computation tasks, designing algorithms
    that are well adaptive to the system dynamics and for online implementation is
    necessary. Besides, investigation of MEC systems employing other multiple access
    schemes, e.g., rate splitting multiple access (RSMA), is a promising direction.
    It is necessary since RSMA has shown considerable benefits over NOMA and OMA [93].
    SECTION IV. MEC With Energy Harvesting and Wireless Power Transfer A. Fundamental
    of EH and WPT The current industrial landscape is becoming increasingly aware
    of the need to optimize energy use and management for all domains, including telecommunications.
    Among others, EH, also known as energy scavenging or power harvesting, is a promising
    technique for 5G systems since EH is an alternative solution to traditional energy
    supply sources [97]. The basic concept of EH is to capture various available energy
    from different sources to power the energy-constrained devices for prolonging
    their lifetime [98]. Together with the traditional energy grid, EH can help to
    fulfill the energy requirements of the different tiers of 5G networks including
    the sensors in IoTs, the mobile devices, the eNBs in HetNets, assisting relays
    in D2D systems, and the computing servers [94]. Additionally, the recent development
    in advanced materials and hardware designs helps realize the EH circuits for small
    portable consumer electronic devices which accelerate the adoption of EH for the
    IoTs [95]. EH is simple in concept, but more complex in implementation which strongly
    depends on the type of EH power sources. The harvestable energy can be scavenged
    from natural or human-made sources which are controllable or uncontrollable [99].
    As illustrated in Fig. 6, various EH techniques (e.g., thermoelectrics, photovoltaic
    conversion, pyroelectrics, piezoelectrics, electrostatics, and radio frequency
    (RF)-based EH and WPT) can be employed to leverage the corresponding sources of
    energy [94], [96]. Besides, different devices may have different energy harvesting
    capabilities, for example, a wearable device and a smart boot may harvest a power
    value of 1 mW and 100 mW, respectively [94]. Compared with the traditional natural
    energy sources, RF signals are less affected by weather or other external environmental
    conditions. As a result, these signals can be efficiently controlled and designed,
    so RF-based EH has great potential to provide stable energy to low-power energy-constrained
    networks including wireless sensor networks (WSNs), IoTs, and extremely remote
    area communication (eRAC) use cases in 5G networks [100]. Specifically, RF-EH
    can be employed in indoor, hostile, and harsh environments, e.g., sensors inside
    a building or human body, toxic environment, and so on [100]. RF-EH can scavenge
    wireless energy from 1) ambient sources (e.g., WiFi, AM, and FM) which can be
    predictable or unpredictable or 2) dedicated sources which are deployed to provide
    an energy supply. RF-EH exploiting the ambient sources normally requires an intelligent
    process to monitor the communication frequency bands and time periods for harvesting
    opportunities. RF-EH with proper management of dedicated energy sources between
    the emitters and the harvesters can be considered as WPT. FIGURE 6. EH technologies
    with generated intermittent power and power consumption for various devices, adapted
    from [94]–[96]. Show All WPT was first proposed by Nikola Tesla in 1899 [99] and
    continuously studied by both industry and academic communities. Existing WPT technologies
    can be categorized into three classes: inductive coupling, magnetic resonant coupling,
    and RF-based WPT. The first two technologies rely on near-field electromagnetic
    (EM) waves, which cannot support mobility for the energy-limited wireless communication
    devices due to the limited wireless charging distances (a few meters) and the
    required alignment of the EM field with the EH circuits [101]. In contrast, RF-based
    WPT exploits the far-field properties of EM waves over long distances (hundreds
    of meters). In the RF-based WPT system, embedding the modulated information (e.g.,
    phase-embedded information) into the RF-based WPT signals forms the concept of
    simultaneous wireless communication and power transfer (SWIPT) which was proposed
    and studied in [102] from an information theoretical perspective. Recently, [94],
    [97] have demonstrated that integrating EH/WPT into typical 5G systems including
    IoTs, device-to-device (D2D) networks, HetNets, and cognitive radio networks (CRNs),
    can bring benefits in improving energy and spectral efficiency. However, integration
    of EH/WPT in 5G architecture also raises some technical challenges as follows.
    How to cover the unstable and intermittent characteristics of the ambient resources,
    i.e, power, spectrum, periods, is a challenging problem which should be considered
    in designing an EH systems. How to allocate the network resources to well balance
    between harvested energy and consumed power is another issue. Towards this end,
    one must well understand the generating environment and the characteristics of
    energy source, the power consumption properties of different elements in the system,
    the coverage area, the communication distance, the data rate, and underlying application
    specifics. In WPT systems, since the energy harvesting process may affect the
    modulated information, joint resource allocation for the EH and data transmission
    should be investigated to improve the network performance. An in-depth study of
    these challenges is required to design an efficient wireless network, which must
    consider different factors, like features of power generators, transducers, power
    storage, power management methods and application requirements. For deeper understanding
    of the benefits and opportunities offered by EH and WPT techniques as well as
    their challenges and potential application scenarios, the interested readers are
    recommended to refer to EH and WPT surveys, such as [98], [103], [104]. B. Motivation
    Both EH/WPT and MEC have been considered as promising technologies for the 5G
    networks, which can improve the energy efficiency of mobile/edge devices and prolong
    their battery lifetime of communication nodes at remote areas. While MEC enables
    to detach the end devices from heavy computation workloads for saving their energy
    consumption, EH/WPT techniques allow them to exploit the energy in their surrounding
    environment for re-charging their batteries. Hence, integrating these two technologies
    in the future wireless communication systems can significantly improve network
    performance by leveraging the strengths of both underlying technologies. EH, WPT
    and MEC technologies will lead to the following benefits: EH/WPT techniques can
    power the edge devices in the MEC systems to enlarge the set of options for computation
    offloading which will result in improving the network performance [105]. Specially
    in the IoT context, important use cases of MEC-enabled 5G networks, scavenging
    the ambient environment and utilizing WPT, provide promising solutions to perpetually
    support the massive number of electronic sensors [95]. Moreover, EH/WPT modules
    by leveraging green energy (e.g. solar and/or wind) can be employed to power MEC
    servers. Especially, EH/WPT provides a great solution for the eRAC use cases of
    MEC-based 5G where the MEC servers and mobile edge devices can be located outside
    the coverage of the electric grid for reasons such as deployment constraints,
    reliability requirements, carbon footprint, weather, disasters, and maintenance
    expenses. The distributed computing power of MEC systems can be leveraged to learn
    time-varying properties of the energy source for optimizing the network performance
    [106]. A MEC server can be deployed to support a cluster of mobile/sensor nodes
    in EH-enabled wireless networks. At the node level, MEC can help each EH device
    reduce processing time and reserve more time for EH by offloading its heavy workloads
    to fog servers [107]. At the network-level, MEC can allow deploying a centralized
    EH strategy to tune the functionality of all devices for better EH and performance
    [108]. A simple EH-enabled and wireless powered MEC system is illustrated in Fig.
    7, where the EH and WPT are employed at MEC servers and mobile devices. For example,
    a batteryless user can utilize WPT to harvest energy from the BS, and then uses
    the harvested energy to offload computation tasks to the MEC server for remote
    computing. While EH and WPT bring many benefits as discussed above, the MEC system
    also faces many challenges including communication resource allocation, computing
    resource allocation, latency minimization, and security problem. In the following,
    we describe some major challenges which must be addressed for efficient integration
    of EH/WPT into the MEC system. In general, mobile devices have limited battery
    size and computation capability. Integrating EH/WPT into MEC-based wireless networks
    facilitates mobile devices with an external power source for processing heavy
    workload but this requires additional processing workload on controlling the EH
    function. Thus, such integrated system must cope with a more complicated resource
    allocation problem. Major research issues along this line include resource allocation
    and offloading design to well balance between harvested energy and consumed energy
    consumption. Specifically, how to perform the energy-efficient computation offloading
    in EH/WPT-MEC system considering practical constraints in the harvesting process
    remains a challenging issue. In the scenarios where MEC servers are primarily
    powered by renewable energy, the availability of energy source in the space and
    time domains would follow a unstable and non-uniform distribution. Moreover, these
    harvested energy level may vary over space which leads to load imbalance among
    servers. Hence, load balancing among all edge servers is also an interesting research
    problem which should be addressed in engineering EH/WPT-based MEC systems. FIGURE
    7. EH/WPT enabled MEC access networks. Show All C. State of the Art This section
    provides a survey on some recent works for efficient integration of EH/WPT into
    MEC systems which are summarized in Table 4. Existing works on combining EH/WPT
    and MEC mainly consider three schemes. In the first two schemes, the EH and WPT
    techniques are implemented at mobile devices in MEC-enabled wireless communication
    networks. These schemes can be applicable to WSNs, IoTs, eRAC, and D2D systems
    in the 5G network which support a massive number of small battery-operated devices
    connecting wirelessly to MEC servers for offloading and data processing. Because
    these devices typically have very limited batteries to supply power for their
    communication, EH and WPT technologies can be employed to provide valuable additional
    powers for their long-term operations such as sensing, reporting data, or offloading
    the heavy computation load. To do so, the edge devices need to estimate the power
    and time consumed by their operation. The resource allocation and offloading decision
    designs for these devices become more complicated due to the additional energy
    harvesting stages in EH/WPT enabled MEC systems which are promising research issues.
    The third scheme focuses on the scenarios in which connecting the MEC servers
    of MEC-enabled systems to the electric grid is costly and even impossible in certain
    situations such as natural disasters, remote locations. Then, on-site renewable
    energy is mandated as a major or even sole power supply source for these MEC servers
    [112]. In these cases, efficient load balancing design among all MEC servers under
    the unpredictable and unstable harvested energy has attracted a lot of research
    attention. TABLE 4 Summary of EH/WPT-MEC Works 1) Offloading and Resource Allocation
    for MEC-Enabled Systems Using EH Technique Recently, [109] considered the multi-user
    multi-task computation offloading problem which aims to maximize the overall revenue
    of the wireless EH-enabled devices. The Lyaponuv optimization approach was adopted
    in this work to devise the energy harvesting policy and the task offloading schedule.
    The tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay for the MEC system
    with EH capability was studied in [110] in which the authors proposed an online
    dynamic task scheduling to minimize the average weighted energy consumption and
    execution delay subject to constraints on the stability of buffer queues and battery
    level. Employing the game theoretic approach, authors in [120] studied the impact
    of the EH technique at mobile devices in the computation offloading design. The
    work aimed to minimize the social group execution cost. Different queue models
    are applied to model the energy cost and delay performance, based on which a dynamic
    computation offloading scheme was designed. Using the deep learning (DL) approach,
    [105] proposed a reinforcement learning offloading scheme, where each EH-based
    IoT device selects its MEC server and the offloading rate without knowledge of
    the MEC model based on the current battery level, the previous radio transmission
    rate to each server, and the predicted harvestable energy. 2) Offloading and Resource
    Allocation for MEC-Enabled Systems Using WPT Technique Considering the WPT-enabled
    MEC systems, [114] aimed to maximize the (weighted) sum computation rate of all
    wireless devices in the network by jointly optimizing the individual offloading
    decision and the time allocation for transmission. Similarly, [115] considered
    the time division strategy for the two-way data exchange between the fog node
    and the mobile user in WPT-based MEC systems. The closed-form average age of information
    for both directions as well as the achievable data rate of the mobile user was
    described in this paper, based on which the trade-off between the downlink and
    uplink performance was investigated. The cooperation among edge users was studied
    in [116], [117]. Specifically, the work [116] aimed to maximize energy efficiency
    (EE) to ensure the fairness of users by encouraging the near user (NU) forwarding
    the far user’s (FU) tasks to the edge cloud. While [117] enabled the surrounding
    idle devices as the helpers to use their opportunistically scavenged wireless
    energy to help remotely execute active users’ computation tasks. The work tried
    to maximize the computation rate by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamforming
    at the ET, as well as the communication and computation resource allocations at
    both the user and its helpers. Reference [121] considered a WPT-based UAV-assisted
    MEC system in which a UAV acts as an MEC-enabled BS offering WPT and offloading
    services to a number of EH-enabled ground mobile devices. The work aimed to maximize
    the system computation rate under both partial and binary computation offloading
    modes, subject to the energy-harvesting causal constraint and the UAV’s speed
    constraint. On another approach, [118] investigated the power splitting problem
    for information transmission and power transfer in the SWIPT-based MEC system.
    Specifically, the authors proposed a new algorithm to minimize the required energy
    under the constraints on required information transmissions and processing rates.
    The work in [122] studied imperfect spectrum sensing in cognitive radio MEC with
    WPT. Specifically, a joint CPU frequency control, time power allocation problem
    was formulated and solved via a number of techniques, including dual decomposition,
    1-dimensional search, bisection and subgradient method. 3) Load Balancing Design
    for Multiple EH-Based MEC Servers In the EH-based MEC systems where the computation
    servers are mainly powered by the uncontrollable and unpredictable energy sources
    (e.g, solar, wind), individual MEC servers may be overloaded at any moment due
    to the limited harvested power and computing capacity [111]. Hence, energy prediction
    and load balancing among all EH-based servers are important research issues which
    must be tackled to achieve effective MEC operations. In particular, [112] considered
    a joint geographical load balancing and admission control for EH-based MEC networks
    which aims to minimize the long-term system cost due to violating the computation
    delay constraint and dropping data traffic. To deal with this geographically load
    balancing (GLB) optimization problem, Xu et al. developed an algorithm, called
    GLOBE, by leveraging the Lyapunov stochastic optimization technique. In particular,
    the algorithm enables MEC-enabled BSs to make GLB decisions without requiring
    future system information. Integrating the EH into MEC-enabled HetNets, authors
    in [113] investigated the joint load management and resource allocation problem
    that maximizes the number of offloading users utilizing the limited energy and
    computation resources, via managing the load and distributing the resources to
    the users. To solve the underlying complicated problem, a distributed three-stage
    iterative algorithm was proposed to obtain the joint load balancing and resource
    allocation solution. D. Learned Lessons and Potential Works Due to the great benefits
    offered by MEC and EH/WPT as well as their complementary properties, it is convinced
    that the combination of MEC and EH/WPT is beneficial in the future. Although various
    problems and issues in EH/WPT-MEC systems have been intensively studied, there
    are still several challenges. In the following, we discuss some challenges and
    outline the open research directions. 1) Energy Prediction Most of the renewable
    energy sources are unpredictable. For example, clouds can appear or disappear
    which can affect the solar harvesting process. Other kinds of harvestable energy
    sources, e.g., wind, heat, and vibration, vary over time. In the WPT systems,
    channel characteristics practically vary depending on the environment in which
    the level of interference and the number of paths cannot be known in advance.
    Thus, understanding the surrounding ambient environment is critical for efficient
    implementation of the EH and WPT techniques. Recently, advanced machine-learning
    and deep-learning methods have been utilized to predict the arrival energy based
    on the historical and geographic data. Notwithstanding considerable benefits,
    ML/DL mechanisms and big data analytics raise some several challenging issues
    for implementation, such as, collecting data, large computation resources required
    to process the high-dimensional big data, which can be overcome by employing the
    MEC concept. Exploiting learning at MEC servers to extract useful information
    collected by all EH-enabled devices can reduce the time caused by sending the
    data to a remote cloud server; hence, the predicted information can be achieved
    on-time for high efficient EH, which can extend the capability of EH-enabled devices.
    2) EH/WPT-Based MEC for IoT/Dense Networks An IoT network aims at supporting massive
    connections from machine-type devices which are small, fabricated and deployed
    at very low cost, and are expected to operate in a self-sufficient manner for
    a long time. The large number of connecting devices and their low power operation
    require an advanced wireless access networks, such as, dense access points or
    multi-hop data transmissions. MEC systems can play a relevant role in this scenario
    to manage functionality of individual nodes in terms of synchronization, reliability,
    efficiency of utilizing channel resource and energy, to exploit the available
    harvestable energy source, to cooperate with others for WPT, data transmission
    and offloading. The other challenge in successful large-scale deployment of devices
    in an IoT infrastructure is to minimize their impact on human-body and the environment
    [123]. The presence of multiple devices implementing various EH technologies corresponding
    to different kinds of energy sources, WPT and SWIPT over different frequency bands
    in the dense-users networks also require efficient and scalable offloading and
    resource allocation designs. SECTION V. MEC for UAV Communications A. Fundamentals
    of UAV Historically, UAVs have been considered as enablers of various applications
    including military, surveillance and monitoring, telecommunications, delivery
    of medical supplies, and rescue operations, owing to their autonomy, flexibility
    and broad range of coverage [124]. However, in those applications, UAVs mainly
    focused on navigation, control, and autonomy. As a result, the communication challenges
    of UAVs have typically been either neglected or considered as part of the control
    and autonomy components [125]. UAVs are commonly known as drones or remotely piloted
    aircrafts, and have several key potential applications in wireless communication
    systems due to its high mobility, flexibility, adaptive altitude and low cost
    [126]. Specifically, small UAVs are more easily accessible to the public recently
    due to its continuous cost reduction and device miniaturization, thus small UAVs
    can be used in weather monitoring, forest fire detection, traffic control, emergence
    search and rescue, cargo transport etc. In recent years, UAV-based wireless communication
    systems attract lots of attention thanks to their cost-effective wireless connectivity
    in scenarios without infrastructure coverage, which is caused by severe shadowing
    by urban or mountainous terrain, or damage to the communication infrastructure
    caused by natural disasters [127]. Among the UAV applications in wireless communication
    systems, UAV mainly serves as two important roles: 1) aerial BS and 2) flying
    mobile terminals. In the first scenario, when UAV serves as an aerial BS, it can
    provide communications in emergency and public safety situations to enhance coverage,
    capacity, reliability and energy efficiency of the wireless networks. In the second
    scenario, UAV can serve as a flying mobile terminal within the cellular networks
    to deliver real time video stream. For UAV classifications, several factors such
    as outlook and application goals, need to be taken into account. The different
    types of UAVs depend on their functions, and capabilities. From their outlook
    characteristics, UAVs can be broadly classified into two categories: fixed-wing
    UAVs and rotary-wing UAVs. From the UAV application and goals, one alternative
    classification of UAVs can be done to meet various QoS requirements, the nature
    of the operation environment and federal regulations. To properly classify the
    applications and use of UAVs, UAVs’ flying altitude and capabilities can be taken
    into account. Among these factors, flying altitude can be utilized for UAVs classification:
    high altitude platforms (HAPs) and low altitude platforms (LAPs) [126]. HAPs,
    e.g., balloons, usually operate in the stratosphere that is 17 km above the Earth’s
    surface. On the contrary, LAPs, flying at altitudes not exceeding several kilometers,
    have several important advantages: fast movement and more flexibility compared
    to LAPs. The benefits of UAVs application in wireless communications can be summarized
    as follow: Cost-effective, fast, flexible and efficient deployment: UAVs can provide
    cost effective wireless communications and can be more flexibly deployed for unexpected
    or limited-duration missions. One of the main applications is that UAVs can serve
    as aerial BS. It is well known that building a conventional terrestrial BS, including
    radio towers and infrastructure deployment, is very expensive. In this case, UAV
    aided BS can provide on-the-fly communications at low cost since UAVs do not require
    highly constrained and expensive infrastructures. Line-of-sight (LoS) link: Compared
    with conventional terrestrial BSs, a UAV-aided flying BS is able to offer on-the-fly
    communications and to establish LoS communication links to ground users. Especially
    in low-altitude UAVs, the established LoS communication links can improve the
    network performance significantly. LoS communication can facilitate high frequency
    (e.g., mmWave). Combined with other 5G and beyond technologies, e.g., mmWave,
    MIMO, and visible light communications, UAV aided BSs can establish LoS communication
    links so as to achieve high data rates [64]. Coverage and capacity enhancement:
    In the downlink communications, UAV aided flying BSs can rapidly reconfigure UAV-to-ground
    user links to provide a large coverage network due to its maneuverability. Specifically,
    in the uplink communications, the UAV-aided flying BS can also collect delay-tolerant
    information from the distributed wireless devices within the coverage. Since UAVs
    experience good channels, e.g., LoS link, they can provide higher transmit data
    rates. Moreover, the speed of UAVs can be manually adjusted to support wireless
    connectivity to the ground terminals. The benefits of large coverage and capacity
    improvement make UAV-aided wireless communication a promising integral component
    of the 5G wireless systems and beyond. Complementary network for emergency situations
    and disaster relief, search and rescue: Compared to the traditional network scenarios
    (e.g., 4G long term evolution (LTE) and WiFi), UAV aided wireless communication
    networks can provide a complementary network to the existing networks in emergency
    situations. For example, UAVs can act as hotpots for an ultra dense network, where
    the ground BS is overloaded. When the ground BS is damaged or even completely
    destroyed by natural disasters (e.g., earth quake, floods, severe hurricanes and
    snow storms), UAV aided wireless networks enable to provide effective communications
    and help rescue lives. B. Motivation to Combine MEC and UAV Due to the features
    of UAV, such as mobility, maneuverability, and flexible development, UAVs can
    be integrated into wireless communication systems to provide seamless, reliable,
    low delay and cost-effective communication [128]. To further improve the computation
    capacity, the combination of UAV and MEC has been proposed in existing works.
    There are two typical scenarios as shown in Fig. 8, including UAV-assisted communications
    and cellular-connected UAVs. In Mode 1 of Fig. 8, UAVs serve as aerial BSs [129].
    In this scenario, UAV can be equipped with an MEC server. Thus, MEC-enabled UAV
    servers provide opportunities for ground mobile users to offload heavy computation
    tasks. After computation, the mobile users can download the computation results
    from UAV based MEC servers via reliable, cost-effective wireless communication
    links. In Mode 2 of Fig. 8, UAVs serve as new aerial mobile users of the cellular-connected
    network, where the MEC server based BS is able to provide the seamless and reliable
    wireless communications for UAVs to improve the computation performance. MEC has
    strong computing capability which can be complementary to the UAVs enabled wireless
    communications systems. The combination of UAV and MEC technology will lead to
    the following benefits: UAV based MEC server: In this scenario, UAVs can be used
    as mobile cloud computing systems, in which the UAV based MEC server can provide
    offloading opportunities to ground mobile users. Due to its flexibility and mobility,
    UAVs can receive the offloaded tasks especially when the territorial MEC servers
    are not available. For example, when the emergency relief or disaster happened,
    the mobile device with limited processing capability can benefit from the moving
    UAV aided MEC server to execute tasks, e.g., analyzing assessment of the status
    of victims, enemies and hazardous terrain [129]. Thanks to LoS links between UAVs
    and ground mobile users, the offloading and downloading capacity can be largely
    enhanced. Moreover, the coverage can be improved by the UAVs based MEC communication
    system. UAV-UE MEC system: Different from the traditional scenario where the mobile
    user is associated with a fixed GBS over the complex fading channel, the UAV-UE
    MEC system enables the high-mobility UAV-UEs to offload their computation tasks
    to the number of optimized GBSs simultaneously leveraging more reliable LoS links.
    There are two advantages of this scenario. On the one hand, the trajectory of
    the UAV can be jointly designed with the resource allocation (offloading task
    scheduling) as it has controllable mobility in 3D airspace. On the other hand,
    UAVs are associated with a group of GBSs simultaneously over LoS links to exploit
    their distributed computing resources to improve the computation capability. FIGURE
    8. MEC-enabled UAV networks architecture. Show All Despite the promising benefits
    from the combination of UAV and MEC, there are several technical challenges existing
    in the MEC-enabled UAV systems. On the one hand, the main challenges in the UAV-BS
    scenario include the optimal 3D deployment of UAVs, the flight time optimization
    and the trajectory optimization. On the other hand, the challenges faced in MEC
    including communication resource allocation, computing resource allocation and
    security problem, need to be addressed. Therefore, combining UAV with the MEC
    system may raise the following challenges: Mobility control and trajectory optimization:
    Since UAV has limited flight time, the optimal path planning for UAVs MEC systems
    is an important research issue. For the UAV-based MEC server, the location and
    flying path must be optimized to provide better offloading opportunities for the
    mobile devices. Similar with the UAV-UE scenario, the location and flying path
    must be optimized to better offload computation tasks to a group of GBSs to provide
    seamless communication with other UAVs. In both scenarios, the mobility control
    has a significant impact on the quality of the network. It is challenging to optimize
    the trajectory of UAV as it typically requires to solve non-convex continuous
    optimization problems. The channel variation and energy consumption and maximum
    flying speed are required in this design. In addition, coupled with other optimization
    factors, such as QoS metric, the trajectory optimization is challenging to tackle.
    Communication and computation resource optimization: In the UAV based MEC server
    communication system, UAVs act as flying BSs equipped with MEC servers. The communication
    resource (i.e., offloading power) and computation resource (i.e., task offloading
    ratio) need to be jointly optimized considering potentially different objectives,
    e.g., relay minimization and energy consumption minimization. In the UAV-UE MEC
    system, UAVs act as high-mobility relay users to offload their computation-intensive
    tasks to the MEC server deployed at GBSs for remote execution. In this case, the
    trajectory of UAVs can be jointly optimized with the communication and computation
    resource allocation, which would be more challenging compared with the fixed user
    and BS cases. C. State of the Art There are two scenarios for which UAVs can be
    combined with MEC in communication systems. In the first scenario, UAVs act as
    flying BSs equipped with MEC servers offering offloading opportunities for the
    users on the ground [129]. This scenario is quite common in practice. For example,
    the moving MEC enabled UAV plays an important role in disaster response and emergence
    scenario, in which the ground BS (GBS) cannot provide any service due to the damages
    caused by a sudden disaster, e.g. earthquake. Mobile devices with limited processing
    capabilities can benefit from the UAV based MEC server. In the scenario of UAV-based
    MEC server [129], the UAV can act as a moving MEC server in the sky to help execute
    the computation tasks offloaded by multiple ground users. This work aimed to minimize
    the total energy consumption considering the QoS requirement. By means of successive
    convex approximation (SCA) methods, the bit allocation was studied to minimize
    the mobile energy for OMA uplink and NOMA downlink in the UAV based MEC system.
    An energy consumption minimization problem was investigated for the UAV-enabled
    MEC system in [130]. To address the limited computing capacity and finite battery
    life time of the mobile device, the UAV based MEC server was proposed to provide
    offloading opportunities to the mobile device. An alternative algorithm was proposed
    to minimize the UAV’s energy consumption by optimizing the offloaded computation
    bits and the CPU frequency of the users and the trajectory of the UAV with the
    maximum speed limitation. Simulation results in this work showed that the proposed
    scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes. In [131], the computing resource allocation
    and UAV hovering time were optimized to minimize the total energy consumption
    of the UAV. Moreover, the CPU’s computational speed was considered in the optimization
    of UAV’s trajectory and task assignment to minimize the energy consumption in
    [132]. Delay minimization is also an important issue for UAV-MEC communication.
    In [133], the delay minimization among all users was studied by jointly optimizing
    the UAV trajectory, the ratio of offloading tasks and the user scheduling. In
    the second scenario, a cellular-connected UAV is served by multiple ground BSs
    that are equipped with MEC servers [134]. In this scenario, UAV needs to complete
    certain computation tasks during the flying time over some given locations. Thus
    the tasks can be offloaded to some selected ground BS. The work [134] aimed to
    minimize the UAV’s mission completion time by jointly optimizing its trajectory
    and computation task scheduling considering the maximum speed constraint of the
    UAV and the computation capacity of the GBSs. It turns out that the formulated
    problem is nonconvex, thus it is difficult to find the global optimal solution
    in polynomial time. Therefore, the alternating optimization and SCA were exploited
    to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. In [136], the total travel distance
    of UAV was minimized and two different solutions were proposed, i.e., MEC-ware
    UAV’s path planning (MAUP) based integer linear programming and accelerated MAUP.
    Physical-layer security was investigated in [135], where the optimal solutions
    based on the condition of three offloading options and the computational overload
    event from a physical-layer perspective were provided. The summary of exiting
    works on UAV MEC is provided in Table 5. TABLE 5 Summary of Existing Works on
    UAV MEC D. Learned Lessons and Potential Works Thanks to the great benefits from
    the combination of MEC and UAVs as well as their limited resource, it can be concluded
    that MEC-UAV is an inevitable trend in the future wireless communication systems.
    Although some existing works have been done to engineer MEC-UAV systems, there
    are still several challenges to address. In the following, we discuss key open
    problems in MEC-UAV systems: Performance analysis of UAV-MEC systems: A fundamental
    performance analysis is required for the UAV-MEC system. In particular, the coverage
    probability, throughput, delay or reliability can be investigated to evaluate
    the impact of each design parameter on the overall system performance. Due to
    the 3D development and short flight duration of UAVs and the delay awareness of
    MEC, the performance analysis for the UAV-MEC system is challenging. Energy-aware
    resource allocation: The flying time and the resource of UAVs are limited because
    UAVs typically have small sizes, weight and limited power. Thus, the trajectory
    and resource allocation (i.e., communication and computation) need to be optimally
    designed to reduce the energy consumption. However, most existing works only considered
    designing trajectory and optimizing resource allocation separately, which cannot
    achieve the highest network performance. Hence, jointly optimizing the path planning
    and resource allocation for MEC-UAV system is an open challenging problem. It
    becomes more challenging when other factors, such as, QoS requirement, offloading
    power allocation and task assignment together with the channel variation, delay
    constraint and maximum flying speed, are considered in such design. User grouping
    and UAV association: In the UAV based MEC server communication system, each UAV
    acts as a flying MEC-enabled BS. The ground users need to offload their tasks
    to one UAV or multiple UAVs simultaneously. Thus the user group problem must be
    solved by using suitable approaches, e.g., matching theory, game theory and convex
    optimization methods. On the contrary, in the UAV MEC systems, UAVs need to offload
    tasks to GBSs for remote computation. The subchannel allocation and UAVs association
    can be investigated. SECTION VI. MEC for Internet of Things A. Fundamentals of
    IoT Thanks to significant advancement in computation and storage technologies,
    and communication networks, billions of devices with their every domain-specific
    applications are able to connect to the Internet to generate/collect data, to
    exchange important messages amongst themselves, and to coordinate decisions via
    complex communication networks [137]. This phenomenon has opened a new era of
    Internet, the so-called the IoT [137]. The basic concept of IoT is that anything
    can be interconnected with the global information and communication infrastructure
    at any time and any place [138]. Things can be physical things existing in the
    physical world or virtual things existing in the information world. IoT has been
    playing a significant role in solving various challenges of modern society effectively
    and improving the quality of human life, such as, safer, healthier, more productive,
    and more comfortable [139]. The fundamental characteristics of IoT can be condensed
    as follows: 1) inter-connectivity, 2) things-related services, 3) heterogeneity,
    4) dynamic changes, see [138] for details. IoT is also one of the main motivations
    for developing the promising 5G technologies to allow the massive connections
    from a large numbers of “things” to the Internet via wireless networks. Inversely,
    5G is considered a basic platform to facilitate emerging IoT applications [140].
    As expected, manifold data traffic (typically of Gbps order), low latency transmission
    can be provided by 5G communication networks which can support a tremendous increase
    in dense connected “things” in wireless networks, including high-mobility IoT/UEs,
    embedded sensors in the human body (or clothing), wearable devices, equipment
    for monitoring biometrics, or even autonomous cars (also called V2X communications).
    Furthermore, by exploiting spectrum resources in high-frequency bands and providing
    the coexistence of multiple numerologies, 5G networks can realize Tactile Internet
    requiring ultra-low latency with extremely high availability, reliability, and
    security [141]. For more information on the techniques and future trends of IoT,
    we invite the readers to further refer to the following references [142]–[144].
    A basic architecture of IoT as well as its specific every-domain applications
    can be summarized in Fig. 9. In particular, the IoT basic architecture consists
    of three layers: Perception, Network, and Application [142], [143]. In the first
    layer, the physical sensors collect useful information/data from things or the
    environment which are then transformed into digital form and it marks all objects
    with a unique address identification. The principal responsibility of the second
    layer is to help and secure data transmission between the perception and the application
    layers [144]. The third layer is to provide the personalized based services according
    to users’ relevant needs and to link the major gap between users and applications.
    It combines the industry to attain the high-level intelligent solutions for IoT
    specific every-domain applications such as the disaster monitoring, healthcare,
    smart house, transposition, production controlling, health care, retail, education.
    In other aspects, the third layer can be further divided into three sub-layers:
    1) The service management layer, 2) The application layer, 3) The Business layer.
    Due to the high-level requirement of some applications and services, one more
    layer has been potentially added between the application and network layers which
    consists of MEC and fog computing servers to perform some specific distributed
    computation duty or pre-data processing. FIGURE 9. The overall picture of IoT
    applications and architecture. Show All B. Motivation to Use MEC for IoT and Challenges
    ETSI, in its report [145], has distinguished IoT as one of the most important
    MEC application instances. There are many benefits of employing MEC into IoT systems,
    including but not limited to, lowering the amount of traffic passing through the
    infrastructure and reducing the latency for applications and services [12]. Among
    these, the most significant is the low latency introduced by MEC which is suitable
    for 5G Tactile Internet applications requiring round-trip latency in the millisecond
    range [146]. MEC technologies are envisioned to work as gateways placed at the
    middle layer of IoT architecture which can aggregate and process the small data
    packets generated by IoT services and provide some additional special edge functions
    before they reach the core network; hence, the end-to-end delay can be reduced.
    Additionally, these techniques are also able to lower the energy consumption of
    small-size IoT devices and prolong their battery-life by supporting significant
    additional computational capabilities through intelligent computation offloading
    strategies. Furthermore, MEC platforms will be offered and deployed by the network
    operator at any tiers of 5G networks, e.g., eNBs, multi-RAT aggregation points,
    neighbor mobile devices, which can be made open to authorised developers and content
    providers to deploy versatile and uninterrupted services on IoT applications [9].
    In addition, based on the context and platforms of MEC, artificial intelligence
    (AI) on the edge can gain the huge benefit to realize distributed IoT applications
    and intelligent system management, which is now considered as a part of beyond
    5G standardization [147]. Inversely, IoT also energizes MEC with mutual advantages.
    In particular, IoT expands MEC services to all types of smart objects ranging
    from sensors and actuators to smart vehicles. Integrating MEC capabilities to
    the IoT systems come with an assurance of better performance in terms of quality
    of service and ease of implementation. C. State of the Art-MEC-Enabled IoT Application
    Scenarios This section focuses on providing a survey on recent MEC-enabled IoT
    works in application scenarios related to 5G uses cases. The technical aspects
    and application scenarios of these works are summarized in Table 6. TABLE 6 Summary
    of MEC-Enabled IoT Papers on Different Application Scenarios and Technical Aspect
    1) Smart Home and Smart City One of the most important use cases of IoT is smart
    city and its important subset smart home/building [183]. Recently, the MEC contexts
    and novel 5G technologies have been enabled to emerge the judicious edge big data
    analysis and wireless access for IoT systems to further improve the urban quality
    of life for citizen with many aspects including security, privacy, energy management,
    safety, convenient life, ect.. For energy management, an fog-based IoT automation
    mechanism was validated in [148] to optimize the resource management for smart
    building systems. By leveraging the fog-enabled cloud computing environments,
    the novel implemented smart home systems can reduce 12% utilized network bandwidth,
    10% response time, 14% latency and 12.35% in energy consumption. For monitoring
    and controlling the smart home/buildings, innovative analytics on IoT captured
    data from smart homes was presented in [149] employing the fog computing nodes.
    This fog-based IoT system can address the challenges of complexities and resource
    demands for online and offline data processing, storage, and classification analysis
    in home/building environment. The MEC-enabled IoT frameworks in [167], [168] focus
    on behaviour features by monitoring the student’s location and activities in school
    environment for safety aspect. In particular, [167] designed a platform to identify
    any student activities that occur at the classroom level in which the raw indoors
    environment data is processed at an edge computing server (Raspberry Pi) for detecting
    the presence of individuals in a classroom while [168] exploited the DL algorithms
    in an MEC-enabled IoT smart classroom for person recognition. For the smart city
    use cases, the security and privacy aspects were considered in [173] where a blockchain-based
    smart contract services for the sustainable IoT-enabled economy is proposed for
    smart cities by employing AI solutions in processing and extracting significant
    event information at the fog nodes, and then utilizing blockchain algorithms to
    save and deliver results. Recent work in [165] studied the energy management aspect
    in smart city where the deep reinforcement learning methods were employed into
    MEC-enabled IoT system to manage the energy grid efficiently. References [169]
    and [177] both considered the safety and convenience aspects where Pratam et al.
    [169] implemented a Raspberry Pi-based MEC system on school shuttle buses for
    tracking the locations of students and vehicles while [177] developed a smart
    routing for crowd management based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms to
    satisfy the latency constraints of service requests from the people. A platform
    to detect potholes and road monitoring was studied in [170] to cope with flooding
    on the roads in rainy seasons for traffic safety. 2) Healthcare Healthcare solutions
    with more intelligent and prediction capabilities have been developed and implemented
    based on the rapid developments of IoT and cyber physical systems [184]. MEC-enabled
    IoT has shown a huge potential in improving the performance of healthcare systems
    which includes but not limited to the mobile monitoring healthcare scheme. In
    this system, the MEC-enabled gateways can offer several higher-level services
    such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining,
    etc. beside controlling the data transmission [185]. These enable to empower the
    system to deal with many challenges of managing the remote devices, i.e., security,
    reliability, latency, energy efficiency issues. Freshly, Li et al. in [174] considered
    the security issue in mobile healthcare systems by proposing a secure and efficient
    data management system named EdgeCare in which healthcare data and facilitating
    data trading are processed at edge servers with security considerations. Focusing
    on improvement of latency and reliability performance, [178] proposed BodyEdge,
    a novel body healthcare architecture consisting of a tiny mobile client module
    and an edge gateway for collecting and locally processing data coming from different
    scenarios. Sharing the same view, [150] implemented an accurate and lightweight
    classification mechanism employing the edge computing to detect the seizure at
    network edge based on the information extracted from the vital signs with precise
    classification accuracy and low computational requirement. The implementation
    results show that the proposed system outperforms conventional non-MEC remote
    monitoring systems by: 1) achieving 98.3% classification accuracy for seizures
    detection, 2) extending battery lifetime by 60%, and 3) decreasing average transmission
    delay by 90%. For emergency department systems, Oueida et al. [175] proposed a
    resource preservation net framework integrated with cloud and edge computing where
    the key performance indicators such as patient length of stay, resource utilization
    rate and average patient waiting time are modeled and optimized considering high
    reliability, efficiency and security. 3) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) IoT In [186],
    3GPP has identified 5G as the key technology supporting the V2X concepts in several
    use cases: Information (state map, environment, traffics) sharing, vehicle platooning,
    remote driving, grouping-based cooperative driving, communication between vehicles,
    cooperative collision avoidance, dynamic ride sharing. The QoS requirements in
    data rate and communication range may vary in different V2X applications [187].
    However, the crucial factors such as ultra low latency, high reliability, and
    security have to be improved due to the safety in most use cases, which can be
    fulfilled by employing MEC technologies [188]. Recently, the security aspects
    in V2X were considered in [171] which enabled a cooperative intelligent transportation
    system by deploying MEC-equipped cell towers hosting local communication to increase
    the safety on roads and the traffic efficiency with smoother flow. Reference [151]
    focused on the latency in MEC based dense mmWave V2X networks by optimizing the
    offloaded computing tasks and transmit power of vehicles and road side units to
    minimize the energy consumption under delay constraint resulting from vehicle
    mobility. The work in [176] enabled the object recognition enhancement with DL
    algorithms at the edge side with MEC deployment in V2X networks to improve the
    information sharing and communication performance. Specifically, an Intel Movidius
    Neural Compute Stick along with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is used as an edge computing
    server to analyze the objects contained in real-time images and videos. 4) Industrial
    Internet MEC yields a significant paradigm shift in industrial Internet of Things
    (IIoT), well-known as Industry 4.0 - a use-case of 5G technologies, by bringing
    computing resources close to the lightweight IIoT devices in IIoT domain [152],
    [189]. In IIoT, there are many application scenarios such as, factory automation,
    process automation, human-machine interfaces, production IT, logistics and warehousing,
    monitoring and maintenance. Intelligently managing the edge resources, MEC enables
    to power the IIoT system to address some significant technical issues, e.g. latency,
    resilience, connectivity, and security. To make MEC an enabler for latency-critical
    IIoT applications, time-sensitive networking (TSN)2 is a vital solution. Reference
    [190] proposed TSN-based configuration architectures of MEC that can support real-time
    IIoT applications. Considering system resources, [152] reported that enabling
    MEC in IIoT systems can improve the system efficiency by jointly designing resource
    allocation and offloading based on an auction-based method where both claimed
    bids and asked prices were given by the MEC servers. Additionally, Li et al. in
    [153] employed MEC servers in SDN for IIoT systems to dynamically optimize the
    routing path considering the aggregation of time deadline, traffic load balances,
    and energy consumption to provide a better solution for IIoT data transmission
    in terms of average time delay, throughput, energy efficiency, and download time.
    Reference [154] proposed a service popularity-based smart resource partitioning
    scheme for fog computing-enabled IIoT. By demonstrating the notable performance
    improvements on delay time, successful response rate and fault tolerance, the
    authors confirm the significant benefit of enabling fog computing to cope with
    the large-scale IIoT services. While [182] implemented DL at the edge servers
    to enhance the range and computational speed of IIoT devices remarkably in the
    MEC-based IIoT framework for increasing the energy efficiency and battery lifetime
    at acceptable reliability (around 95 %). Reference [179] focused on obtaining
    higher reliability of network interactions by proposing a deadlock avoidance resource
    provisioning algorithm for Industrial IoT devices using MEC platforms. Aiming
    at improving the quality of industrial production, [155] implemented parallel
    MEC to improve the efficiency of equipment identification. In particular, adopting
    the long short-term memory to analyze big data features and build a non-intrusive
    load monitoring system with MEC can enlarge the average recognition rate to over
    80%. MEC can also be applied for smart IoT-based manufacturing to improve performance
    of edge-equipment network, information fusion, and cooperative mechanism, based
    on which the excellent real-time, satisfaction degree and energy consumption performance
    of the manufacturing system can be significantly improved [166]. On another view,
    to achieve higher goodput, [157] enabled the MEC platform to improve the caching
    management for IIoT system. For the security purpose, [156] employed a smart blockchain-based
    platform with many MEC servers in IIoT systems to effectively solve the network
    congestion caused by transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between
    a publisher and workers. 5) Wearable IoT, AR and VR The newly emerging applications
    corresponding to mobile AR, VR, and wearable devices, e.g., smart glasses and
    watches, are anticipated to be among the most demanding applications over wireless
    networks so far, but there is still lack of sufficient capacities to execute sophisticated
    data processing algorithms. To overcome such challenges, the emergence of MEC
    and 5G techniques would pose the longer battery lifetime, powerful set of computing
    and storage resources, and low end-to-end latency [160], [191]. Sharing this view,
    [158] presented Outlet system to explore the available computing resources from
    users’ ambiance, e.g., from nearby smart phones, tablets, computers, Wi-Fi APs,
    to form an MEC platform for executing the offloading tasks from wearable devices.
    Promising performance achieved by Outlet, e.g., mostly within 97.6% to 99.5% closeness
    of the optimal performance, has demonstrated the advantage of edge computing into
    wearable IoT systems. Applying MEC on VR devices, [159] presented an effective
    solution to deliver VR videos over wireless networks minimizing the communication-resource
    consumption under the delay constraint. This work also demonstrated the interesting
    tradeoffs among communications, computing, and caching. In [160], a novel delivery
    framework enabling field of views caching and post-processing procedures at the
    mobile VR device was proposed to save communication bandwidth while meeting low
    latency requirement. Impressively, an implementation of MEC concepts over Android
    OS and Unity VR application engine in [161] enabled to reduce more than 90% computation
    burden and more than 95% of the VR frame data. On a different view, Liu et al.
    in [162] illustrated the advantage of implementing MEC in panoramic VR system
    to maintain the high quality of the video streaming by intelligent balancing the
    link adaptation, transcoding-based chunk quality adaptation, and viewport rendering
    offloading. 6) Mechanized Agriculture With IoT IoT emerging the use of low-cost
    hardware (sensors/microcontrollers) and 5G communication technologies for eRAC
    has opened a new era for cultivating soil, namely “smart agricultural” [192].
    Many advanced abilities, e.g., predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops
    or smart logistics and warehousing, can be offered by enabling MEC technologies
    in this scenario [193]. Recently, there are some works on emergence of MEC and
    IoT in agriculture. In particular, [163] proposed an intelligent agricultural
    water monitoring system with advanced MEC technology to effectively manage the
    data collected by the sensors. As a part of EU DrainUse project, [164] presented
    a local/edge/cloud three-tier platform for monitoring and managing soil-less agriculture
    in full re-circulation greenhouses using moderately saline water. In this platform,
    the edge plane is deployed to increase system reliability against network access
    failures while the data analytic modules are located in the cloud. To protect
    the plant on vineyard fields, [172] implemented a disease alerting platform using
    a low-cost sensors in the municipality of Vilafamés (Castelló, Spain). In this
    platform, the edge computing is deployed to improve the capability of monitoring
    meteorological phenomena collect (e.g. temperature, humidity) based on that an
    alert disease model was developed for improving the product quality. 7) Tactile
    Internet Tactile Internet is defined by the International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU) as the next evolution of IoT that combines ultra low latency with extremely
    high availability, reliability and security [194]. Encompassing human-to-machine
    and machine-to-machine interaction, Tactile Internet will combine multiple technologies
    including 5G and MEC, i.e., 5G may be employed for the data transmission with
    low delay and high reliability while MEC efficiently exploit computing resources
    close to the end users for better QoE. The applications related to Tactile Internet
    can be automation, robotics, tele-presence, tele-operation, AR, VR [141], [194].
    The works employing MEC in these scenarios considering low latency and high reliability
    can be found in Table 6 and introduced in the previous parts. The following summarizes
    the recent works focusing on the technical aspects involving to the MEC implementation
    in Tactile Internet. Reference [146] considered an energy-efficient design of
    fog computing networks that supports low service response time of end-users in
    Tactile Internet applications and efficiently utilizes the power of fog nodes.
    The trade-off between the latency and required power was presented and then extended
    to fog computing networks leveraging cooperation between fog nodes. Reference
    [180] exploited the MEC systems including cloud, decentralized cloudlets, and
    neighboring robots equipped with computing resource collaborative nodes for computation
    offloading in support of a host robot’s task execution. Then, a proper task allocation
    strategy by combining suitable host selection and computation task offloading
    was proposed to meet the required task execution time. The work also showed that
    the MEC-based collaborative task execution scheme outperforms the non-collaborative
    scheme in terms of task response time and energy consumption efficiency. Recently,
    Xu et al. in [181] designed a hybrid edge caching scheme for Tactile Internet
    which can reduce latency and achieve better performance in overall energy efficiency
    than existing ones. D. Learned Lessons and Potential Works Several research works
    and implementations in the literature have demonstrated that MEC is an ideal solution
    for IoT systems. In many applications and use cases, exploiting MEC resources
    for managing the data collection or pre-processing the massive data at the edge
    networks is able to lead to significant advantages. These advantages include but
    not limited to reducing the radio resource consumption (i.e., 12% in [148]), shortening
    the reaction time (i.e., 10% in [148]), lessening the system latency (i.e., 14%
    in [148], 90% in [150]), and diminishing the overall energy consumption (i.e.,
    12.35% in [148]). In addition, MEC also helps offload the computational burden
    at IoT devices, which results in prolonging their battery life (i.e., 60% in [150]),
    increasing the accuracy rate of task processing (i.e., improving the seizures
    detection rate over 98% in [150]), mitigating the amount of transmission data
    (i.e., 95% in [161]), and lowering the computation load (i.e., 90% in [161]).
    However, to maximize benefits of MEC in IoT applications, one requires the more
    efficient management of the MEC resources and access networks, and capacities
    as well as abilities of the IoT components or elements. These demands open many
    potential research directions to effectively governance MEC in IoT systems. The
    future works considering technical aspects of IoT and MEC, i.e., scalability,
    communication, computation offloading and resource allocation, mobility management,
    security, privacy, and trust management, have been well indicated and manifested
    in some recent MEC-IoT surveys, such as, [195], [196] to which the interested
    readers are recommended to refer. In the following, we discuss key open problems
    in MEC IoT systems which are different to the mentioned challenging technical
    aspects. 1) Effective Cooperation in Dense MEC-Based IoT Networks Currently, each
    MEC server is deployed by the infrastructure providers to supply the computing
    and radio access services to a specific set of distributed edge IoT nodes at the
    IoT network edge. In addition, a provisioning set of computation or networking
    functions including data analyzing, compressing, caching, routing, etc., are installed
    at a distributed MEC server to serve its set of devices from the aspect of their
    applications. In dense IoT-based smart cities, massive heterogeneous IoT devices
    running diversely advanced services corresponding to various domains of city life
    [197]. This leads to a huge number of devices with diverse service requirements
    from different infrastructure providers locating in a same geographical area.
    Although a new service (i.e., out-set-of-function service) can be supported by
    MEC by offloading raw data to cloud for processing, this may lead to huge cost
    of energy and time. In addition, non-cooperative edge servers deployed by different
    infrastructure providers may result in severe under-utilization of resources.
    Hence, enabling cooperative edge computing environment can open the resource of
    many types of edge computing servers for serving the diverse requirements in the
    dense IoT networks. However, to realize the cooperation among the edge nodes to
    maximize their benefits, several particular challenges should be solved: The trade-off
    between the cloud and the edge; The optimization of the service placement on distributed
    and limited edge resources; The contradiction between the computation-intensive
    edge services and the limited edge resources [198]. 2) Employing AI Techniques
    in MEC-Based IoT Systems Recently, AI techniques with ML/DL have been considered
    as important tools for processing big data in the IoT-based environment. The integration
    of ML/DL and AI algorithms at the network edge can provide efficient data analysis,
    make accurate decisions, predict tasks at the network edge, optimize the mobile
    edge caching, computation offloading, and preserve network security and data privacy.
    In addition, adopting AI techniques for MEC-enabled IoT system can extract the
    behaviors of physical/networking resources and users in different time and scenarios,
    dynamically monitor and adjust the configuration of network resources, and realize
    real-time data collection of loT, efficient processing of computation, based on
    which the intelligent services for heterogeneous IoT devices can be optimized
    [199]. However, to apply the AI technology regularly requiring big data processing
    at the edge nodes which are commonly equipped limited computation, storage resource,
    one needs novel ML/DL-based algorithm with distributed computing and data access
    which is an challenging issue for the future works. For more detail on ML/DL for
    MEC applications, we invite the readers to refer to Section VIII. SECTION VII.
    MEC With Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Network A. Fundamentals of Heterogeneous
    C-RANs To meet the unprecedented increase in the network traffic volume and the
    massive number of connected devices, network densification has become the cornerstone
    of the 5G networks, where more base stations and access points are added and spatial
    spectrum reuse is exploited. HetNet is defined as an integration of higher-tier
    macrocells and lower-tier small cells, for example, picocells, femtocells, and
    relay nodes [200]. HetNets have been developed because of its following benefits:
    1) better coverage and capacity, 2) improved macrocell reliability, cost benefits,
    and 3) reduced cost and subscriber turnover [41], [201]. However, the deployment
    of dense HetNets has several challenges: 1) severe interference, 2) unsatisfactory
    energy efficiency, and 3) inflexibility and unscalability. To overcome these challenges,
    another new promising network infrastructure, C-RAN, is proposed to provide a
    high transmission data rate and high energy efficiency performance, which attracts
    a lot of attention from academic and industrial communities [202]. In [203], the
    challenges and requirements of C-RAN were studied to enable network densification
    and centralized operation of the radio access network over heterogeneous backhaul
    networks. In C-RANs, shown in Fig. 10, a large number of low-cost low-power RRHs
    connecting to the BBU pool through the fronthaul links, are randomly deployed
    to enhance the wireless capacity in hotspots. RRHs operate as soft relay by compressing
    and forwarding the received signals from users to the BBU pool via wire/wireless
    fronthaul links. As a result, the combination of HetNets and C-RANs, known as
    heterogeneous C-RANs (H-CRANs), is proposed as a potential solution to provide
    high spectral and energy efficiency [204]. In order to support more 5G applications
    and reduce the investment cost of MEC deployment, MEC was proposed to be combined
    with CRAN in [50], where MEC services enable to exploit C-RAN by using the planned
    BBU pool. Even though CRANs and MEC can be perfectly paired to provide low latency
    for the IoT applications in HeNets, the co-location of MEC and C-RAN results in
    some challenges (e.g., network management), especially in HetNets. FIGURE 10.
    H-CRAN MEC architecture. Show All B. Motivations and Challenges H-CRANs can provide
    large coverage and high energy efficiency, while MEC can provide the considerable
    computing capability for the low-latency applications. Collocating these two key
    technologies can help support more applications in 5G. Considering the computational
    and storage resources in the BBU pool and the distribution of the RRHs, H-CRAN
    can be combined with MEC to facilitate the implementation of the MEC system. Therefore,
    the combination of MEC with H-CRANs can bring the following benefits: The investment
    of MEC deployment can be significant reduced by collocating MEC and H-CRAN. As
    we all know, it is a significant investment to deploy a sufficiently extensive
    MEC network. One way to mitigate the investment cost is to bootstrap MEC deployment
    to the C-RAN deployment. In this case, the cost of providing additional task calculation
    across the existing BBU pool or RRHs will be reduced. The combination of MEC and
    H-CRAN can provide operational flexibility and network re-configurability, which
    can be offered by virtualization of H-CRAN. The H-CRAN can facilitate a faster
    radio deployment by reducing the time needed in the conventional deployments,
    e.g., standard General-Purpose Processors. Since CRAN virtualizes much of the
    RAN functions, thus MEC can also benefit large coverage, the energy savings, network
    simplicity and high security from H-CRAN. H-CRAN MEC can be flexibly deployed
    across different locations. For example, C-RAN can process the task signals any
    locations, e.g., cell-tower co-located hut. Since H-CRAN deployment requires a
    substantial amount of processing power, it can automatically becomes an MEC server
    to calculate the tasks from the mobile users. In addition to the above benefits,
    there exist several challenges in H-CRAN MEC systems that can be induced by co-location
    of MEC and H-CRAN, e.g., deployment scenarios design. In the following, the major
    challenges of H-CRAN MEC systems are discussed [50], [205]. In the H-CRAN MEC
    system, the balance of the deployment and the network performance should be well
    investigated. Since H-CRAN supports a dynamic capacity of the H-CRAN, how far
    the C-RAN/MEC site is located to cell-sits will affect the performance of MEC
    systems, e.g., how well it can support the applications. For example, locating
    CRAN/MEC site in a central office can reduce the cost significantly but it causes
    high latency [50]. In this case, use-cases should be carefully studied to run
    which applications at which sits. Most resource management methods for MEC consider
    the computation resource at MEC servers [206], [207] and thus can be applied in
    H-CRAN MEC directly. However, it is still challenging to jointly optimize computing
    resource and scheduling network resource in H-CRAN [67]. Especially in HetNets,
    the cross-layer and inter-cell interference needs to be considered. Moreover,
    based on NFV of C-RAN, the dynamic resource management scheme may need to be redesigned
    to elastically schedule virtual computation resources under different network
    sizes and task arrival rates. Security is another issue to be addressed in H-CRAN
    MEC systems. Since MEC service supports various kinds of applications, such as
    third party applications, which are not controlled by mobile network operators
    directly. There may be risks that these applications will exhaust resources or
    offer hackers to affect the functions of the network. Therefore, the service of
    performing integrity assurance checks on applications should be considered at
    installation or upgradation. Due to the existence of inter-carrier interference,
    the resource allocation problem in H-CRAN MEC networks is much more challenging
    than that in traditional MEC systems [67]. To mitigate this effect, the spectrum
    resource within each cell can be divided into orthogonal subchannels, which should
    be efficiently allocated to mobile users (i.e., which subchannel a user should
    use to offload its computation task to the MEC server). In H-CRAN MEC networks,
    various types of resources need to be considered to reduce the inter-cell interference,
    including not only conventional wireless resources (e.g., subchannel, transmit
    power, time, and space) but also contra costs (e.g., backhaul spectrum, harvested
    energy, computing capabilities, and caching storage). The major challenges of
    dense H-CRAN MEC systems are user association, computation offloading, interference
    management, and resource allocation. More importantly, these problems are tightly
    coupled and must be solved jointly. On the one hand, it is foreseeable that a
    massive number of MEC servers will be widely deployed in the near future, which
    can be distinctly different in sizes (computing units) and configurations (computational
    speeds). On the other hand, the association between users and MEC servers (BBUs)
    greatly depends on the deployment locations of the MEC servers (BBUs). User mobility
    can be ignored whenever the UE moves inside the geographical area covered by the
    centralized BBUs. The type of BBU centralization determines the system efficiency
    and the user experience. C. State of the Art The majority of the existing studies
    have focused on Heterogeneous MEC (Het-MEC) and C-RAN MEC. For Het-MEC network,
    there are several papers working on interference management in dense Het-MEC systems
    [208]–[213]. In [208], the authors investigated a joint problem of radio and computational
    resources to minimize the total energy consumption of all mobile users under transmit
    power budget, latency, and maximum computing capability constraints. Similarly,
    Al-Shuwaili et al. in [209] considered several issues in single-server multi-cell
    Het-MEC systems: (1) the management of uplink and downlink interference, (2) the
    allocation of backhaul capacity for task offloading, and (3) the allocation of
    computing capabilities at the cloud for offloading users. Moreover, the joint
    optimization of offloading decisions and resource allocation has been extensively
    investigated to improve the network performance [210], [211]. In order to realize
    the potential benefits of dense Het-MEC networks, a new technical challenge is
    mobility management. According to [214], [215], there are several key issues for
    mobility management in Het-MEC systems. First, users may experience frequent handover
    when they move across different small-size and small-coverage smallcells/MEC servers,
    thus increasing the overhead and interrupting the MEC services [216]. Second,
    continuously performing handover measurements and processing, which is needed
    to discover new target MEC servers in dense Het-MEC systems, is power- and radio
    resource-consuming, especially for battery-limited users. Third, in traditional
    dense HetNets, handover decision is mainly based on the quality of radio signals
    between users and potential eNBs. In addition, due to the lack of future information,
    e.g., channel conditions, available computing resources, task arrivals, the offloading
    and handover decisions should be known without prior information and be optimized
    in a long-term manner [213]. Due to its critical importance, an extensive body
    of work has appeared in the literature to address the challenges of mobility management
    in conventional dense HetNets [214]–[221]. For example, two localized mobility
    management schemes for dense HetNets were proposed in [214], a cache-enabled mobility
    management framework in mmWave-microwave HetNets was studied in [215], various
    energy-efficient cell discovery techniques were discussed in [217], a comprehensive
    review of mobility management was provided in [218], and the adoption of distributed
    mobility management was presented in [219]. Although interesting, the body of
    work in [214]–[221] solely focused on mobility management in HetNets. Taking challenges
    of mobility management in dense Het-MEC systems into consideration, the study
    in [213] optimized the association (which MEC server is selected for remote execution)
    and handover (i.e., when task migration is needed) decisions to minimize the average
    delay with the long-term energy budget constraint. Simulation in [213] indicated
    that without complete future information, the proposed algorithm for energy-efficient
    mobility management can still achieve close-to-optimal performance while guaranteeing
    the long-term energy budget constraint. There are several research works on the
    combination of C-RAN MEC systems [206], [207], [222]. In [222], the authors focused
    on C-RAN MEC systems to minimize energy by the proposed two algorithms, i.e.,
    decentralized local decision algorithm and centralized decision and resource allocation
    algorithm. To deal with the resource-limited mobile user with computation intensive
    tasks, C-RAN with MCC was combined to provide high energy efficiency performance
    [206], in which a joint computational resource and transmit power allocation allocation
    scheme was proposed to minimize the energy consumption under the constraints of
    task latency, and fronthaul capacity. To further enhance the capabilities of mobile
    devices, C-RAN with MEC was proposed to be combined with each other to efficiently
    address the increasing mobile traffic issue [207]. Different from previous work,
    in [207], a resource framework was proposed for power-performance tradeoff of
    mobile service provider. In this work, Lyapunov technique was exploited to dynamically
    make online decisions in consecutive time slots for task request. The proposed
    algorithm can achieve close to optimal performance. In [223], the profit function
    based on revenue and cost analysis was maximized by jointly optimization of offloading
    strategy, communication and computation resource. MEC was applied to ultra dense
    networks (UDNs) [224], where the authors investigated the task offloading policy
    in MEC-enabled UDN and introduced the software defined networking technology to
    manage the computation resource in edge cloud with centralized controller. Furthermore,
    there are other resource allocation schemes were proposed for other C-RAN MEC
    scenarios, i.e., Vehicular Fog-RANs [225], Near-Far Computing Enhanced C-RAN and
    [226]. D. Learned Lessons and Potential Works Due to the great benefits offered
    by MEC and H-CRAN, it is envisioned that the combination of MEC and H-CRAN is
    unavoidable in the future. Although various problems and issues in H-CRAN MEC
    systems have been intensively studied, there are still several challenges. In
    the following, we discuss some challenges in dense H-CRAN MEC systems and outline
    the open research directions. 1) Computational Complexity and Signaling Overhead
    It is obvious that the centralized optimization is usually easy to implement compared
    to distributed approaches and can provide the optimal/near-optimal solution with
    the desired performance guarantee. However, in H-CRAN MEC systems such centralized
    approaches are not scalable due to the explosive increase in the numbers of mobile
    users, eNBs, and MEC servers. As a result, there is a need for lightweight and
    effective algorithms. In these schemes, distributed approaches can offer many
    benefits as they do not need any central entity and the algorithms are based on
    only local information or small amounts of signaling overhead. However, it is
    hard to guarantee the solution optimality with distributed approaches due to the
    lack of complete information. Therefore, one needs to tradeoff between the computational
    complexity and solution optimality. An effective way is to decompose the entire
    network into several regions and assign the responsibility for executing the algorithm
    to distributed MEC servers, that is the underlying problem is decomposed into
    subproblems, which are executed distributively at different MEC servers. This
    would significantly reduce the amount of information which need to be exchanged
    between the central entity and all users; hence, the network overhead can be also
    degraded. 2) Mobility Management Ensuring the benefits of mobile users through
    computation offloading while taking into account user mobility is a challenging
    issue. Most existing studies in (Het-/CRAN-) MEC systems ignore the effect of
    user mobility due to its difficulty and intractability. In the proposed H-CRAN
    MEC systems, users may change their positions while using MEC services, e.g.,
    they can move out of the coverage area of their source MEC servers and are in
    the serving coverage of other ones. This will result in user association in H-CRAN
    MEC since the scheduler may need to re-associate the user to a different RRH and
    then the offloaded task can be calculated by BBU pool with MEC server. In this
    case, the scheduler (BBU pool) needs to be aware of user mobility in order to
    maintain service continuity. Thus the dynamic user association and resource allocation
    can be well studied in the future work. For example, some ML algorithms can be
    exploited to address the user mobility issue in the resource allocation for H-CRAN
    MEC. Another potential solution to deal with user mobility is enabling MEC servers
    to continuously update the user context and then designing context-aware algorithms.
    Instead of using one-shot optimization, long-term optimization can be used to
    tackle the challenges of user mobility. To illustrate this point, we consider
    the following example with a mobile user, which is located far from the MEC server.
    The short-term optimization for computation offloading decision is not offloading,
    that is local execution. However, fixing this short-term decision is not always
    optimal since the user can move to a new position with better channel quality.
    Moreover, the short-term offloading decision affects not only the instant performance
    but also the long-term energy budget. In summary, there is a big room for researches
    into mobility management in dense Het-MEC systems. 3) Interference Management
    and Joint Resource Allocation Inherited from dense HetNets, the spectrum reuse
    among cells incurs severe mutual interference, which may significantly reduce
    the expected system spectrum and energy efficiency. Therefore, the challenges
    for interference management in H-CRAN MEC systems remain to be solved for many
    reasons. Heterogeneity of mobile users and BBU pool with the MEC server makes
    the interference problem more challenging due to various transmit power budgets
    of users in the uplink. Moreover, the network scheduling resource, communication
    resource and computing resource at BBU pool are coupled with each other, which
    makes the resource allocation more challenging. The various computation task characteristics
    require different priorities for users in accessing radio and MEC resources. Finally,
    interference management is highly coupled with other domains, such as resource
    allocation and network planning. Hence, more sophisticated interference management
    schemes incorporating features of H-CRAN MEC systems would be highly required
    for improving the users’ QoS with MEC services. 4) Wireless Backhaul Limitation
    In H-CRAN MEC scenarios, the capacity of backhaul and fronthaul is of an important
    issue. For example, in case that backhaul is limited, the transmission time via
    backhaul links should be taken into consideration, thus affecting the offloading
    decisions of users (and other optimization variables as well). Most research works
    assume that small cells are connected with the central location (where vBBU and
    MEC servers are located) through high-speed wired links, e.g., fiber links [227].
    As a result, the scenario with wired backhaul/fronthaul may be simple and limited
    to implement for H-CRAN MEC networks, and then discuss their proposed approach
    in such network settings. The wireless bachhaul and fronhaul can be further investigated
    to enhance the networks performance. For example, the authors in [228] focused
    on MEC with wireless backhaul; however, the network setting in this literature
    is simple, comprising a small-eNB and an MEC server collocated at the macro-eNB.
    This work is served as a fundamental study for more complex frameworks, e.g.,
    the extension to dense Het-MEC systems and the consideration of mixed wireless
    and wired backhaul links. 5) Physical Security In H-CRAN MEC networks, security
    will be a significant issue since MEC applications will run on the same physical
    platforms as some network functions. Therefore, to reduce the risk of that the
    external eavesdroppers/hackers who may affect the network functions, the physical
    layer security can be studied for H-CRAN MEC systems, which will be a promising
    research topic. SECTION VIII. MEC and Machine Learning This section reviews the
    fundamentals and applications of ML in addressing various MEC problems: edge caching,
    computation offloading, joint optimization, security and privacy, big data analytics,
    and mobile crowdsensing. We also identify challenges and potential directions
    to energize further studies on applications of ML in MEC. A. A Brief Review of
    Machine Learning in Wireless Networks ML has been applied in a myriad of applications,
    for example, virtual personal assistants, video surveillance, social media services,
    email Spam and malware filtering, search engine result refining, and product recommendation.
    There are several reasons why ML algorithms are increasingly being used: 1) ML
    enables systems that can automatically adapt and customize themselves to individual
    users, 2) ML can discover new knowledge from large databases, 3) ML can mimic
    human and replace certain monotonous tasks, which requires some intelligence,
    4) ML can develop systems that are difficult and expensive to construct manually
    because they require specific detailed skills or knowledge tuned to a specific
    task, and finally 5) there is a vast increase in computational power, growing
    progress in available algorithms and theory developed by researchers, and increasing
    support from industries. Generally, ML is divided into three core types: supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (RL), while DL has
    been introduced as a breakthrough technique and a huge step forward in ML, which
    can achieve higher-level representations based on simpler ones. The classification
    and applications of ML in mobile and wireless networking, also in MEC and other
    edge computing paradigms, are illustrated in Fig 11. Recently, the ITU Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector proposed a unified architecture for ML in future networks,
    where MEC is expected to play crucial roles as source, collector, pre-processor,
    model, policy, distributor, and sink [229]. For example, MEC can collect data
    from end users, then perform data preprocessing, and execute an ML model to extract
    necessary information before sending the output to the central cloud for further
    training. Moreover, some surveys and tutorials on ML, DL, (deep) RL, as well as
    their applications in communications and networking [230]–[232] have come out,
    and readers can refer to these literature for more details. FIGURE 11. Classification
    and applications of ML in mobile and wireless networking. Show All Due to the
    rapid evolution of wireless communications and networks, it is believed that artificial
    intelligence in general and ML in particular will play vital roles in beyond 5G
    and 6G [233]. In general, ML can provide the following advantages: First, the
    most natural advantage of ML is the ability to learn from big data to improve
    the network operation and performance, which can be done without any hand-crafting
    feature. The importance of learning arises naturally in wireless networks since
    1) mobile data is massive, 2) mobile data increases at exponential rates, 3) mobile
    data is non-stationary (i.e., the time duration for data validity can be relatively
    short), 4) mobile data quality is not guaranteed (i.e., data collected can be
    low-quality and noisy), and 5) mobile data is heterogeneous (i.e., data can be
    generated from many sources, such as mobile users and IoT devices, and in different
    types) [234]. Second, the design and optimization of wireless networks are sufficiently
    challenging without known channel and mobility models. Conventional optimization
    techniques are usually performed in an offline, heuristic, or iterative manner,
    which cannot guarantee the performance optimality or is not suitable for dynamic
    and time-varying systems. ML is a promising tool such that the network operation
    can be optimized over time, thus continuously improving the network performance.
    For example, ML showed a noticeable improvement in uplink data rate by managing
    uplink interference in cellular networks [235]. Third, joint 4C optimization in
    5G and beyond is immensely complicated due to large state and action spaces, heterogeneous
    network devices, and various QoS requirements. In such a case, ML is capable of
    providing online and/or fully-distributed algorithms. Moreover, model-free wireless
    networks introduce various issues of channel modeling, problem formulation, and
    closed-form solution, which, however, can be efficiently solved by ML. Next, ML
    should be deployed at the IoT device level and on large-scale distributed networks
    without violating user data privacy. In 2017, Google introduced an additional
    ML approach, called “federated learning” that enables individual devices collaboratively
    learn a shared prediction model while keeping their own data locally, thus improving
    the training efficiency and data privacy. As the network will be highly dense
    and heterogeneous, federated learning is expected to be a major tool of beyond
    5G. Motivated by the application of federated learning in Google board in Android
    [236], there have been a wide range of applications and problems in wireless networks
    that can adopt federated learning. Last, since edge computing will play an important
    role in providing low-latency actions and the majority of intelligent applications
    will be deployed at the network edge, the emergence of edge learning is unavoidable.
    On the one hand, exploiting edge learning to extract useful information from a
    massive amount of mobile data can extend the capability of small IoT devices and
    enable the deployment of compute-intensive and low-latency applications at the
    edge [237]. On the other hand, edge learning can circumvent drawbacks of cloud
    AI and on-device AI through the tradeoff between the learning model complexity
    and the training time [238]. B. Machine Learning for Multi-Access Edge Computing
    Optimizing MEC faces several challenges of caching placement, allocation of radio
    and computing resources, assignment of computation tasks, and joint 4C optimization.
    The existing literature has studied a number of problems in MEC systems, including
    computation offloading [105], [106], [233], [239]–[243], caching [244]–[247],
    joint 4C optimization [247]–[252], security and privacy [253]–[259], big data
    analytics [234], [257], [260], and mobile crowd sensing [261]. In what follows,
    we summarize the sate-of-the-art related to applications of ML approaches in these
    aspects. 1) Edge Caching Studies on mobile edge caching have focused on three
    main issues that are where to cache, what to cache, and how to cache [13], [262].
    In terms of caching places, the state-of-the-art showed that the requested content
    can be cached at macro-eNBs, small-eNBs, and/or end users, where the storage resource
    of nearby mobile devices is exploited for content caching and D2D communication
    is used for content retrieving [263]. To decide what to cache, one popular metric
    is the content popularity, which is defined as the ratio of the number of requests
    for a particular content to the total number of requests from all users within
    a specific region during a period of time. The survey paper [13] showed that there
    are five main algorithms: content replacement policies such as the least frequently
    used (LFU) and least recently used (LRU), user preference based policies, learning
    based policies, non-cooperative caching, and cooperative caching. As the content
    popularity is time-varying and cannot be known in advance, many studies have focused
    on ML based caching strategies. Most of the existing works focus on applications
    of deep RL (DRL) for proactive caching since DRL is able to learn caching policies
    automatically without any predefined network model and explicit assumption. The
    authors in [244] explored the key challenges of edge caching and reviewed the
    state-of-the-art related to learning-based caching policies and algorithms. They
    showed that mobile edge caching schemes can be classified into two main approaches:
    popularity-prediction-based approach, where the popularity estimation and caching
    policy are learned separately, and RL based approach, where these two terms are
    learned simultaneously. Other studies on (deep) RL based caching algorithms can
    be found in [246], [247]. It is a widely held axiom that besides the historical
    data, the correlation between social and geographic data of mobile users can be
    utilized to provide more accurate content popularity prediction. Thus, the authors
    in [264] proposed using big data analytics techniques to advance edge caching
    designs and proved the effectiveness of these techniques via two case studies
    of eNB caching and device caching. However, big data analytics, particularly ML/DL
    mechanisms, has several challenging issues for implementation [265]: huge computation
    resources required to process the high-dimensional big data, lack of an appropriate
    prediction model for various types of DL models, optimization of DL parameters,
    e.g., the depth of deep neural networks and learning rate. 2) Computation Offloading
    Due to the importance of computation offloading from the user perspective, recent
    years have seen many research works pertaining to computation offloading. In [240],
    the authors formulated the computation offloading decision problem of a user in
    ad-hoc mobile clouds as an MDP. More specifically, both channel gains between
    the user and cloudlets and the user’s and cloudlets’ queue states are considered
    in the system state, the action is the task distribution decision (i.e., how many
    tasks to process locally and how many tasks to offload to each cloudlet), and
    the reward function is defined to maximize the user utility and minimize the cost
    of required payment, energy consumption, delay and, task loss probability. Simulation
    results showed that the DQN based offloading decision algorithm performed well
    under various task arrival rates. In [105], the combination of a “hotbooting”
    Q-learning,3 computation task queue, user association, and channel gain quality,
    and the immediate reward is the weighted sum of satisfaction of the task execution
    delay and computation task drops, the task queuing delay, the penalty of failing
    to execute a computation task, and the payment of accessing the MEC service. The
    work in [243] utilized RL to jointly consider traffic and computation offloading
    for industrial applications in fog computing. 3) Joint Optimization Due to the
    facts that 1) the joint 4C optimization is needed for improving the network performance
    and 2) conventional approaches cannot efficiently solve the optimization problems
    with large action and state spaces, recent studies on MEC have addressed various
    problems pertaining to joint 4C optimization. For example, the authors in [247]
    investigated two deep Q-learning models for mobile edge caching and computing
    in vehicular networks. To reduce the computational complexity of the original
    problem and circumvent the high mobility constraint of vehicles, the authors further
    proposed deploying two DQN models at two distinct timescales. In particular, each
    epoch is divided into several time slots and then the large timescale deep Q-learning
    model is executed at every epoch while the small timescale model is performed
    at every time slot. We note that the concept of multi-timescale control has been
    applied for some existing research works, e.g., cross-layer optimization [266],
    [267]. The authors in [248] investigated two learning models, classical Q-learning
    and DQN method, for joint optimization of offloading decision and computation
    resource allocation in single-server MEC systems. Since DRL with discretized states
    suffers from the curse of dimensionality and slow convergence when a high quantization
    accuracy is required, a continuous control with DRL based framework of computation
    offloading and resource allocation in wireless powered MEC systems was studied
    in [249]. As shown in [249, Fig. 3], the proposed algorithm is composed of two
    alternating phases: i) offloading action generation to quantize the relaxed offloading
    decision as a set of binary actions, and ii) offloading policy update to select
    the best offloading action among quantized ones. Similarly, the authors in [268]
    extended the framework proposed in [249] for multi-carrier NOMA based MEC systems.
    More recently, there have been some works that study the joint optimization of
    computation, caching, and communication. The work in [250] studied the joint optimization
    of resource allocation in hierarchical networks of fog-enabled IoT with edge caching
    and computing capability. In [251], the authors proposed an integrated framework
    of networking, caching, and computing for connected vehicle networks and showed
    that the proposed DRL based algorithm is superior to the existing static scheme
    and those without virtualization, MEC offloading, or edge caching. Besides the
    integration of edge computing, in-network caching, and D2D communication, the
    literature [252] also took into consideration the social relationships among mobile
    users so as to improve the reliability and efficiency of resource sharing and
    delivery in mobile social networks. 4) Security and Privacy The following reasons
    explain why security and privacy are the greatest challenges [24]. First, since
    there are many enabling technologies of MEC, it is necessary to not only protect
    individual enabling technology, but also orchestrate the diverse security algorithms.
    Second, the distributed nature of MEC causes many new network situations (e.g.,
    heterogeneous computing capabilities and collaboration between edge devices),
    which call for new security mechanisms. Third, it is possible that a large-scale
    edge computing system can be severely affected by the security threats of just
    a network component. Finally, there are many scenarios and aspects that can be
    influenced by privacy and security threats, e.g., private data generated by in-car
    sensors and critical emergency systems. In edge computing paradigms, there are
    numerous security and privacy threats, for example, wireless jamming, denial of
    service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing attacks, privacy leakage, virtual machine
    manipulation, and injection of information [24], [255]. Recently, ML-based security
    and privacy in MEC have been studied from various perspectives. The use of DL
    for cyber-attack detection in edge networks was considered in [254], where the
    experiments demonstrate that the DL based model is better than that with a shallow
    model in terms of learning accuracy, detection rate, and false alarm rate. The
    authors in [255] proposed different RL based edge caching security mechanisms
    of anti-jamming mobile offloading, physical authentication, and friendly jamming.
    Taking the randomness and variation of wireless channels between mobile users
    and fog nodes, the literature [256] studied Q-learning based physical layer security
    in fog computing to improve the impersonation detection attack and the accuracy
    of receivers by learning from the dynamic environment. The work in [258] investigated
    a new ML based privacy-preserving multifunctional data aggregation framework in
    order to overcome drawbacks of existing methods, which are high computation overhead,
    communication efficiency, and single aggregation function calculation. In [259],
    privacy-aware computation offloading in MEC-enabled IoT was studied, where the
    post-decision learning is used in conjunction with the standard DQN to accelerate
    the learning speed. 5) Big Data Analytics As aforementioned, there are three main
    challenges of mobile big data (MBD) analytics: large-scale and high-speed mobile
    networks which reflect MBD volume and velocity, portability which causes MBD volatility,
    and crowdsensing which introduces MBD veracity and variety. Big data analytics
    enable the design of many smart applications, such as smart city, smart building,
    and smart manufacturing [269]. Intelligence at the edge is expected to play a
    major role in data analytics applications. In [234], DL is considered as an attractive
    solution for MBD analytics by leveraging several advantages: 1) DL scores highly
    accurate results, 2) DL can automatically generate intrinsic features from MBD,
    3) DL does not require labeled samples as the input training data, and 4) multimodal
    DL allows the learning from heterogeneous data sources. MEC is highly suitable
    for big data processing. However, there are several challenges [270]: 1) how to
    distribute big data to distributed resource-finite servers, 2) collaborative MEC
    for resource sharing and optimization is needed, 3) 4C resources are tightly coupled,
    and 4) privacy is a critical issue due to the lack of a central management entity.
    Some recent studies have utilized ML to address various problems pertaining to
    MEC big data. The work in [257] divided big data processing into three steps:
    data collection, aggregation, mining and analysis. Moreover, the authors proposed
    two privacy-preserving methods, namely output perturbation (OPP) and objective
    perturbation methods (OJP). In particular, training data privacy can be achieved
    by adding randomization noise to aggregated query results in the OPP method and
    to the objective function in the OJP method. Experimental results showed the high
    accuracy and data utility of OPP and OJP algorithms. In [260], the authors tried
    to provide users with better QoE in pervasive edge computing environments. The
    authors first deployed a Tensor-Fast convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) algorithm
    to guarantee accuracy and increase training speed with big data and next managed
    high-dimensional big data by using different accurate data transmission rates.
    It was shown that the proposed TF-CNN algorithm can achieve a higher QoE performance
    than the state-of-the-art training model. 6) Mobile Crowdsensing While mobile
    crowdsensing (MCS) has been widely studied in the literature, there are only a
    handful of studies on edge computing empowered MCS. There are several benefits
    of MEC in the context of MCS as follows [271]. First, MEC enables the parallelization
    and partitioning of the centralized and large-scale problem, where MEC servers
    are responsible for controlling the sensing process on mobile devices located
    within their deployment area and manage MCS tasks within the same area. Second,
    the immense computational complexity of the central cloud that is caused by a
    large number of mobile users participating in MCS tasks with frequent context
    changes can be greatly reduced because of the distributed deployment of MEC. Third,
    MEC can reduce the latency of data and information propagation, that is suitable
    for real-time MCS services. Next, intensive computations can be offloaded from
    both mobile users and cloud servers to the edge and then being processed therein.
    Finally, MEC can reduce privacy threats since privacy-sensitive data can be distributed
    and handled across MEC servers. Recently, the work in [261] proposed a framework
    that integrates DL and MEC for robust MCS services. In particular, the proposed
    framework can be implemented by firstly designing an auction mechanism for participant
    recruitment, then using DL for data validation, and finally implementing data
    processing at the network edge. In [261], the authors also discussed several open
    research problems, including how to leverage DL to detect privacy and security
    threats, how to reduce computational overhead in vastly and rapidly changing environments,
    and how to implement DL in mobile users for energy and cost efficiency. A hierarchical
    computing architecture for task allocation was proposed in [272], where the cloud
    layer does learning of participants’ reputation and the edge layer communicates
    with participants for data collection and optimization. C. Challenges and Future
    Works Clearly, ML techniques will be an important tool for various problems in
    wireless networks and at the network edge so as to optimize edge caching, computation,
    enhance big data analytics, and improve security and data privacy. A summary of
    key problems solved by ML techniques in MEC is presented in Table. 7 along with
    major challenges. Despite many studies on ML MEC, there are still several key
    open problems that could be investigated in the future. TABLE 7 Summary of Key
    MEC Problems That Can be Solved by Machine Learning Techniques 1) Machine Learning
    Based Frameworks of Ultra-Dense MEC Systems It is widely expected that both wireless
    and wired backhaul solutions will coexist in future wireless networks. The simulation
    results in [228] showed that the bandwidth allocation between wireless access
    and wireless backhaul plays a major role in the achievable performance. In this
    case, ML approaches can be deployed at the macro-eNB to predict the appropriate
    bandwidth partitioning factor based on user CSI and task characteristics. Moreover,
    a critical issue in ultra-dense MEC system is user association and its joint optimization
    with other aspects such as computation offloading and resource allocation. However,
    the joint problem of user association, offloading decision, and resource allocation
    are typically NP-hard non-convex, which are further exacerbated in time-varying
    and dynamic environments. In such networks, DRL can be used to provide fast and
    near-optimal solutions. 2) Distributed and Collaborative ML Implementation in
    Hierarchical and Heterogeneous MEC The central implementation of ML algorithms
    faces serious challenges, such as learning complexity, storage and computation
    resources, and non-suitability for pervasive computing applications and large-scale
    systems. A potential solution is distributed ML, where the computation of a learning
    algorithm is divided into smaller parts and then these computations are allocated
    to distributed MEC servers. However, a number of questions need to be exhaustively
    answered when distributed ML is used: which computation parts can be divided,
    how to divide the computation to subtasks, how to synchronize the output among
    different MEC servers, and how to integrate the outputs from subparts into the
    output of the master model? Distributed ML becomes particularly important when
    a learning agent (e.g., MEC server) cannot observe the global state and action,
    and is merely aware of its local state, reward, and action. Actually, there is
    a tradeoff between the computation capability and learning efficiency when ML
    mechanisms are centralizedly implemented at resource-limited MEC servers. Thus,
    it is hard to efficiently implement a ML algorithm at MEC server with a very large
    number of users and an enormous amount of training data. Due to the fact that
    an artificial neural network (ANN) is composed of many layers (e.g., input, hidden,
    and output layers) [233], the ANN model and the hierarchical MEC architecture
    are supposed to fit together, where an immediate layer of the entire ANN model
    can be offloaded to and performed by MEC layers (e.g., MEC at macro-eNBs and at
    small-eNBs) and the output of the edge learning is then transferred to higher-tier
    clouds for further processing. The collaborative learning offers considerable
    benefits from the reduction of training data size, the exploitation of ubiquitous
    computing, and the preservation of user data privacy. Moreover, DL approaches
    can be deployed at the MEC servers to detect contaminated and/or fake data, thus
    improving the data quality. For instance Li et al. in [273] considered a two-layer
    DL model for video recognition with IoT devices. Due to resource-limited MEC compared,
    the authors proposed determining the maximum number of computation tasks that
    can be handled at the edge layer. 3) Federated Learning and Applications for MEC
    Conventional ML approaches are not a suitable way to preserve data privacy. Federated
    learning leaves the training data distributed across individual users, thus enabling
    them to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping their own data locally.
    Moreover, federated learning is able to address major drawbacks of distributed
    learning [274], which are 1) lack of time and training data, 2) low performance
    due to heterogeneous user capabilities and network states, 3) unbalanced number
    of training data samples, and 4) nonindependent and identically distributed data
    among users. Federated learning is expected to be a sharp tool for various problems
    in MEC. Take the computation offloading problem as an example, where massive users
    are trying to offload their computations to an MEC server for remote execution.
    Conventionally, to determine the offloading decision, users need to report their
    information such as channel gain, current battery level, and computation characteristics,
    to the MEC server [242], [249]; however, such information can be revealed by eavesdroppers
    and can be used illegally to predict the user location. Applying federated learning,
    each user needs to download the master model from the MEC server and then learns
    the offloading decision based on its local information only, and the MEC server
    is merely responsible for updating the master model according to updates from
    individual users. In such way, federated learning can preserve data privacy and
    provide distributed offloading decisions, thus being suitable for large-scale
    MEC systems. Recently, the authors in [275] applied federated learning to estimate
    the tail distribution of the queues in URLLC vehicle communications and the works
    in [276] proposed a new adaptive federated learning protocol in heterogeneous
    MEC systems. SECTION IX. Miscellaneous Researches In this section, we first focus
    on recent open source activities. Then, we look at studies denoted to the testbed
    and implementation of MEC systems. A. Open Source Activities The ETSI ISG has
    created a new group, namely Deployment and Ecosystem Development working group
    (WG DECODE) to accelerate the adoption and implementation of MEC services in the
    industry.4 The group is expected to play a leading role in pursuing research activities
    defined in Phase 2 specifications. To achieve its objectives, the WG DECODE first
    exposes MEC descriptions based APIs to increase the adoption of MEC specifications
    and develop a strong MEC ecosystem. The set of open APIs (e.g., bandwidth management
    service API and radio network information API) are publicly available at https://forge.etsi.org/rep/mec.
    Moreover, the WG DECODE promotes the initiation of open source initiatives and
    facilitates the implementation of open source solutions for MEC applications.
    For instance, the Open Edge Computing Initiative5 was introduced in Jun. 2015
    by Carnegie Mellon University and industry partners (e.g., Intel, Vodafone, and
    T-Mobile). Recently, the Open Edge and HPC Initiative6 was launched in Nov. 2018
    by Atos, E4, Forschungszentrum J , ′ ulich, Fraunhofer FOKUS, Huawei, Mellanox,
    and SUSE. But the availability of many platforms can cause edge market fragmentation,
    thus it leads to the interoperability problems and limits the industry collaboration.
    To circumvent these issues, the Linux Foundation started LF Edge in Jan 2019 to
    establish an open and interoperable framework, which currently includes five projects:
    Akraino Edge Stack, EdgeX Foundry, Open Glossary of Edge Computing, Home Edge,
    and Edge Virtualization Engine.7 Due to the importance of edge computing, we believe
    that there will be many more groups and frameworks. More importantly, harmonizing
    open source platforms for MEC necessitates closer cooperation between ETSI and
    other edge organizations/standards like Open Edge Computing, LF Edge, OpenFog,
    and OpenStack in the future. B. Testbed and Implementation 1) Single-Board Computer
    Based Edge Cloud There are many ways to create an edge server; however, the implementation
    of single-board computers as edge clouds has been considered as an efficient and
    cost-effective solution. The increase in popularity of single-board computers
    (SBCs) (e.g., Raspberry Pi (RPi), Asus Tinker Board S, and Arduino Mega 2560)
    is due to their low cost, low energy, enough resource for various applications
    in not only education, but also in industry, hobbyists, prototype builders, and
    gamers [277], [278]. The availability of SBCs has introduced a new concept, disposable
    computing, such that SBCs are deployed as edge servers at any location where the
    edge service is not available or the current edge server is discarded and needs
    to be replaced by a new one. Another advantage is its potential use in emergency
    applications and security crises. For example, SBCs, built as edge servers, can
    be used for rescue missions in the area, where the underlying infrastructure has
    been destroyed by natural disasters, e.g., earthquakes and windstorms. Elkhatib
    et al. [279] considered the concept of “micro-cloud” and examined the suitability
    and performance tradeoffs of RPi-based micro-clouds using four metrics: serving
    latency, hosting capability, the cost of memory writing/reading, and booting time.
    Experimental evaluations in [279] demonstrated that RPi clouds can serve a large
    number of users with low latency and booting time, and can further reduce the
    cost compared with that of Amazon EC2. In [280], the authors proposed an IoT-edge
    cloud framework for a smart healthcare information system using SBCs. The authors
    in [281] implemented an MEC framework with the OpenAirInterface8 and evaluated
    their prototype framework with a streaming face detection application. Other studies
    have been conducted to realize SBCs for various applications: fast and accurate
    object analysis for AR applications [282], real-time image-based object tracking
    from live videos [283], social sensing applications [284], and latency-aware video
    analytics [285]. 2) Lightweight Platforms for Edge Computing As MEC and D2D communication
    are both applications of the offloading concept [9], [286], [287], the authors
    in [288], [289] proposed different MEC architecture to further improve the network
    performance compared with the standard MEC. A D2D-based MEC architecture was proposed
    in [288], where each relay gateway can act as a local cloud. Further, D2D communication
    is used to establish direct connections between a relay gateway and users so as
    to provide edge services and between two neighbor relay gateways to balance the
    traffic and computation demands among them. The work in [289] introduced a concept
    of “MEC D2D”. Concretely, D2D MEC enables the direct link between users and the
    MEC server, neighboring D2D helps users to connect with the other server if they
    are not satisfied with the local MEC sever, cooperative relay can extend the MEC
    service, conventional MEC provides service to users via the collocated eNB, and
    remote cloud let all users with Internet access use cloud services. Wang et al.
    [290] proposed a lightweight edge computing platform that is based on SBCs, lightweight
    virtual switching, and lightweight container virtualization. Taking into account
    both the QoS requirements of edge services and the deployment cost and status
    of the underlying hardware, a lightweight platform for service deployment at the
    network edge was considered in [291]. To evaluate performance of the proposed
    platform, the authors developed RPis as edge servers and identified a set of the
    system parameters, such as, the number of services to be deployed and the number
    of supported users per service. The work in [292] proposed an open carrier interface
    to offer a fair pay-on-use business model and to provide edge services in a distributed
    and autonomous manner. 3) Middleware for Edge Computing The very first context-adaptive
    middleware, named CloudAware, for computation offloading was proposed in [293].
    CloudAware is able to predict arbitrary context attributes, thus supporting a
    wide range of applications with dynamics of the underlying network. The evaluation
    showed that compared with local computing only, CloudAware can reduce the execution
    time by 276% while maintaining the same level of offloading success rate. More
    recently, there have been a number of other studies on messaging middleware for
    edge computing applications. The middleware investigated in [294] optimized diverse
    user QoS requirements and orchestrated connections between users and brokers,
    [295] leveraged SDN to monitor network conditions for resilient data exchange
    of mission-critical applications, and the messaging middleware proposed in [296]
    enabled the development and deployment of emerging applications in distributed
    and heterogeneous edge computing systems. In [297], the author proposed a middlebox
    approach to implement the MEC paradigm in 4G LTE networks. Some critical issues
    are needed to implement the proposed approach without the need to modify the underlying
    infrastructure: 1) how to intercept and forward the data packets, 2) how to serve
    the data packets by the MEC servers, 3) how to redirect data traffic to the MEC
    servers and to the centralized clouds, and 4) how to identify the tunnel for specific
    users? To solve these issues, the authors in [297] proposed implementing the MEC
    middlebox between the LTE eNB and the core network, and utilizing some novel design
    principles, for example, tunnel stateful tracking and traffic redirection. SECTION
    X. Conclusion and Discussion This paper covers both fundamentals of MEC and a
    review of up-to-date research on “integration of MEC with the forthcoming 5G technologies”.
    In each section, we have presented a brief background, motivations, and overview
    in combining the corresponding individual technology in MEC systems. Moreover,
    we have outlined and discussed the lessons learned, open challenges, and future
    directions. A number of lessons have been learned from this survey paper: There
    have been enormous efforts from academia and industry to realize MEC as the key
    enabler for applications and services (e.g., V2X, Tactile Internet, AR/VR, and
    big data) in the 5G and beyond network. MEC provides a great number of opportunities
    and potentials; however, some challenges exist and need to be further studied
    and tackled, e.g., distributed resource management, reliability and mobility,
    network integration and application portability, the coexistence of heterogeneous
    (i.e., H2H and MEC) traffic, data privacy, and security. There are three main
    types of MEC use cases: consumer-oriented services, operator and third-party services,
    and network performance and QoE improvements. To support these categorizations,
    the integration of MEC with the key enabling technologies in the 5G and beyond
    network is essential. Moreover, to enable a seamless integration of MEC into the
    5G network architecture, the 3GPP has introduced several new functional enablers,
    namely user plane (re)selection, data network interface, local routing and traffic
    steering, session and service continuity, network capability expose, and QoS and
    charging. By integrating with other 5G technologies, MEC systems can support massive
    IoT (NOMA), maintain the system self-sustainability and self-sufficiency (ET and
    WPT), improve the network performance, adaptability, and scalability (ML), improve
    the connectivity and coverage of terrestrial cellular networks (UAV), and help
    service/infrastructure providers make the economics of MEC services (collocation
    with C-RAN). To accelerate the adoption of MEC services, the ETSI ISG has defined
    and exposed a set of open APIs, and further participated in open source activities.
    Moreover, there have been many efforts and solutions for MEC testbeds and implementation.
    For the sake of achieving the seamless integration of MEC in the 5G and beyond
    network, a number of potential works have been given before. Here, we outline
    some open problems and challenges which need to be further studied and tackled.
    Higher-Level Integration: Although existing research integrates MEC with several
    enabling technologies, in fact, they are completely independent of each other.
    Therefore, it is possible to combine more than one of these technologies into
    a single MEC system. For example, IoT devices first harvest energy from a power
    source and then follow the NOMA principle to offload their computation tasks to
    a flying BS equipped with computing capability, where a DRL model is trained to
    determine the UAV’s trajectory and adapt to the underlying dynamic network. Coexistence
    of Multiple MEC Designs: This issue becomes crucial when a number of proposals
    for the same problem of MEC systems are simultaneously proposed, e.g., offloading
    decision and resource allocation. There has been no answer for how different proposals
    can be integrated into a unique framework. One possible solution to overcome this
    issue is that different proposals are classified to find their common viewpoints
    and then a standard solution should be investigated to support MEC systems with
    these viewpoints. More Opportunities and Challenges from 6G: While the 5G standards
    are not well established yet, there have been some speculative studies for 6G
    wireless systems to circumvent limitations of the 5G network. For example, a wireless
    system must support ultra reliability, low latency, high data rate simultaneously,
    which cannot be fulfilled in the 5G system [298]. It is expected that 6G will
    include new use cases like haptic communications for eXtended Reality (XR) services,
    massive IoT for smart city applications, automation and manufacturing. To support
    these new services, various promising technologies have been speculated and discussed
    recently, including pervasive and collective AI, radar-enabled communications,
    metamaterials and intelligent structures, cell-free networks, visible light communication,
    quantum computing and communications, and tiny cells with THz spectrum [298].
    It is inevitable that besides many more use cases and scenarios, new 6G technologies
    and application requirements also introduce hurdles in MEC and tremendous efforts
    need to be paid in the future. More challenges and opportunities with distributed
    learning and FL: To cope with stringent security requirements, data privacy concerns,
    massive connectivity, and network heterogeneity, enabling learning techniques
    (e.g., distributed and FL) in mobile edge networks is of crucial importance. Despite
    their considerable advantages, there are still many challenges and issues. In
    recent review articles [299], several challenges and issues of deploying FL in
    mobile edge networks are discussed, which include, participant selection, tradeoff
    between privacy protection level and system performance, beyond supervised learning,
    interference management, communication security, incentive mechanism designs,
    and asynchronous FL approaches. Moreover, promising research directions, e.g.,
    convergence guarantees for the non-convex loss function, heterogeneity diagnostics,
    and mobile crowdsensing for FL are outlined. In summary, providing solutions to
    these problems and enabling more applications of FL in MEC systems require interdisciplinary
    efforts from a variety of research communities. We strongly believe that this
    survey can help the readers to deeply understand MEC and its interactions with
    the enabling technologies in 5G and beyond. We also hope that this survey will
    stimulate further 5G and MEC research activities. Authors Figures References Citations

    developments in hardware, software, and communication technologies have facilitated
    the emergence of Internet-connected sensory devices that provide observations
    and data measurements from the physical world. By 2020, it is estimated that the
    total number of Internet-connected devices being used will be between 25 and 50
    billion. As these numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume
    of data being published will increase. The technology of Internet-connected devices,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet
    by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and cyber worlds.
    In addition to an increased volume, the IoT generates big data characterized by
    its velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple
    modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this
    big data are the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses
    the various machine learning methods that deal with the challenges presented by
    IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case. The key contribution
    of this study is the presentation of a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms
    explaining how different techniques are applied to the data in order to extract
    higher level information. The potential and challenges of machine learning for
    IoT data analytics will also be discussed. A use case of applying a Support Vector
    Machine (SVM) to Aarhus smart city traffic data is presented for a more detailed
    exploration. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Machine
    learningInternet of ThingsSmart dataSmart City 1. Introduction Emerging technologies
    in recent years and major enhancements to Internet protocols and computing systems,
    have made communication between different devices easier than ever before. According
    to various forecasts, around 25–50 billion devices are expected to be connected
    to the Internet by 2020. This has given rise to the newly developed concept of
    Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is a combination of embedded technologies including
    wired and wireless communications, sensor and actuator devices, and the physical
    objects connected to the Internet [1], [2]. One of the long-standing objectives
    of computing is to simplify and enrich human activities and experiences (e.g.,
    see the visions associated with “The Computer for the 21st Century” [3] or “Computing
    for Human Experience” [4]). IoT requires data to either represent better services
    to users or enhance the IoT framework performance to accomplish this intelligently.
    In this manner, systems should be able to access raw data from different resources
    over the network and analyze this information in order to extract knowledge. Since
    IoT will be among the most significant sources of new data, data science will
    provide a considerable contribution to making IoT applications more intelligent.
    Data science is the combination of different scientific fields that uses data
    mining, machine learning, and other techniques to find patterns and new insights
    from data. These techniques include a broad range of algorithms applicable in
    different domains. The process of applying data analytics methods to particular
    areas involves defining data types such as volume, variety, and velocity; data
    models such as neural networks, classification, and clustering methods, and applying
    efficient algorithms that match with the data characteristics. By following our
    reviews, the following is deduced: First, because data is generated from different
    sources with specific data types, it is important to adopt or develop algorithms
    that can handle the data characteristics. Second, the great number of resources
    that generate data in real-time are not without the problem of scale and velocity.
    Finally, finding the best data model that fits the data is one of the most important
    issues for pattern recognition and for better analysis of IoT data. These issues
    have opened a vast number of opportunities in expanding new developments. Big
    data is defined as high-volume, high-velocity, and high variety data that demands
    cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced
    insight, decision making, and process automation [5]. With respect to the challenges
    posed by big data, it is necessary to introduce a new concept termed smart data,
    which means: ”realizing productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness gains by using
    semantics to transform raw data into Smart Data” [6]. A more recent definition
    of this concept is: ”Smart Data provides value from harnessing the challenges
    posed by volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of Big Data, and in turn providing
    actionable information and improving decision making.” [7]. Finally, smart data
    can act as a good representative for IoT data. 1.1. The Contributions of this
    paper The objective here is to answer the following questions: A) How can machine
    learning algorithms be applied to IoT smart data? B) What is the taxonomy of machine
    learning algorithms that can be adopted in IoT? C) What are the characteristics
    of IoT data in the real world? D) Why is the smart city a typical use case of
    IoT applications? A) To understand which algorithm is more appropriate for processing
    and decision-making on smart data generated from the things in IoT, it is essential
    to consider the following three concepts. First, the IoT application (Section
    3). Second, the IoT data characteristics (Section 4.2), and third, the data-driven
    vision of machine learning algorithms (Section 5). We finally discuss the issues
    in Section 6. B) Around 70 articles in the field of IoT data analysis are reviewed,
    revealing that there exist eight major groups of algorithms applicable to IoT
    data. These algorithms are categorized according to their structural similarities,
    types of data they can handle, and the amount of data they can process in a reasonable
    time. C) Having reviewed the real-world perspective of how IoT data is analyzed
    by over 20 authors, many significant and insightful results have been revealed
    regarding data characteristics. We discuss the results in Section 6 and Table
    1. To gain a deeper insight into IoT smart data, patterns must be extracted and
    the generated data interpreted. Cognitive algorithms undertake interpretation
    and matching, much as the human mind would do. Cognitive IoT systems previously
    learn from generated data and improve when performing repeated tasks. Cognitive
    computing acts as a prosthetic for human cognition by analyzing massive amount
    of data and responding to questions that humans might have when making certain
    decisions. Cognitive IoT plays an important role in enabling the extraction of
    meaningful patterns from generated IoT smart data [8]. Table 1. Characteristic

    case in IoT for three reasons: First, among all of the reviewed articles the focus
    of 60 percent is on the field of the smart cities. Second, smart cities include
    many of the other use cases in IoT. Third, there are many open datasets for smart
    city applications that are easily accessible for researchers. Furthermore, a Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is implemented on the Aarhus City smart traffic
    data to predict traffic hours during one day. By answering the above questions
    about IoT smart data and machine learning algorithms, we would be able to choose
    the best machine learning algorithm that can handle IoT smart data characteristics.
    Unlike similar surveys regarding machine learning and IoT, readers of this article
    would be able to obtain a deep and technical understanding of machine learning
    algorithms, IoT applications, and IoT data characteristics along with both technical
    and simple implementations. 1.2. Organization The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows. Related articles in this field are reviewed and reported in Section
    2. IoT applications and communication protocols, computing frameworks, IoT architecture,
    and smart city segments are reviewed, explained, summarized, and illustrated in
    Section 3. The quality of data, big data generation, sensor data integration,
    and semantic data annotation are reviewed in Section 4. Machine learning algorithms
    in eight categories based on recent studies on IoT data and frequency of machine
    learning algorithms are reviewed and summarized in Section 5. The matching of
    the algorithms to particular smart city applications is carried out in Section
    6, and the conclusion together with future research trends and open issues are
    presented in Section 7, Fig. 1 shows the structure of the survey. Download : Download

    and smart data, it is a challenging area in the field of computer science. The
    important challenges for researchers with respect to IoT consist of preparing
    and processing data. Ref. [9] proposed four data mining models for processing
    IoT data. The first is a multi layer model, based on a data collection layer,
    a data management layer, an event processing model, and a data mining service
    layer. The second model is a distributed data mining model, proposed for data
    deposition at different sites. The third is a grid-based data mining model where
    the authors seek to implement heterogeneous, large scale, and high performance
    applications. The final model is a data mining model from a multi technology integration
    perspective, where a corresponding framework for the future Internet is described.
    Ref. [10] performed research into warehousing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
    data, with a focus specifically on managing and mining RFID stream data. Ref.
    [11] introduced a systematic method for reviewing data mining knowledge and techniques
    in most common applications. In this study, they reviewed some data mining functions
    like classification, clustering, association analysis, time series analysis, and
    outline detection. They revealed that the data generated by data mining applications,
    such as e-commerce, industry, healthcare, and city governance are similar to that
    of the IoT data. Following their findings, they assigned the most popular data
    mining functionality to the application and determined which data mining functionality
    was the most appropriate for processing each specific application''s data. Ref.
    [12] ran a survey to respond to some of the challenges in preparing and processing
    data on the IoT through data mining techniques. The authors divided their research
    into three major sections. In the first and second sections, they explain IoT,
    the data, and the challenges that exist in this area, such as building a model
    for mining, and mining algorithms for IoT. In the third section, they discuss
    the potential and open issues that exist in this field. Here, it is summarized
    that data mining on IoT data involves three major concerns: First, it must be
    shown that processing the data will solve the chosen problems. Next, the data
    characteristics must be extracted from the generated data, and then, the appropriate
    algorithm is chosen according to the taxonomy of algorithms and data characteristics.
    Ref. [13] attempted to explain the smart city infrastructure in IoT and discussed
    advanced communication to support added-value services for the administration
    of the city and citizens thereof. The authors provide a comprehensive review of
    enabling technologies, protocols, and architectures for smart city. In the technical
    part of the article, the authors reviewed the data of Padova Smart City. 3. Internet
    of Things The purpose of Internet of Things (IoT) is to develop a smarter environment
    and a simplified life-style by saving time, energy, and money. Through this technology,
    expenses in different industries can be reduced. The enormous investments and
    many studies running on IoT have made IoT a growing trend in recent years. IoT
    consists of a set of connected devices that can transfer data among one another
    in order to optimize their performance; these actions occur automatically and
    without human awareness or input. IoT includes four main components: 1) sensors,
    2)processing networks, 3) data analysis data, and 4) system monitoring. The most
    recent advances made in IoT began when RFID tags were put into use more frequently,
    lower cost sensors became more available, web technology developed, and communication
    protocols changed [14], [15]. The IoT is integrated with various technologies,
    and connectivity is a necessary and sufficient condition for it to function. Therefore,
    communication protocols are constituents of this technology that should be enhanced
    [16], [17]. In IoT, communication protocols can be divided into three major components:
    (1) Device to Device (D2D): this type of communication enables communication between
    nearby mobile phones. This represents the next generation of cellular networks.
    (2) Device to Server (D2S): in this type of communication device, all the data
    is sent to the servers, which can be close or far from the devices. This type
    of communication is mostly applied to cloud processing. (3) Server to Server (S2S):
    in this type of communication, servers transmit data between each other. This
    type of communication is mostly applied for cellular networks. Processing and
    preparing data for these communications is a critical challenge. To respond to
    this challenge, different kinds of data processing, such as analytics at the edge,
    stream analysis, and IoT analysis at the database, must be applied. The decision
    to apply any of the mentioned processes depends on the particular application
    and its needs [18]. Fog and cloud processing are two analytical methods adopted
    for processing and preparing data before transferring it to other things. The
    whole task of IoT is summarized as follows: First, sensors and IoT devices collect
    information from the environment. Next, knowledge is extracted from the raw data.
    Then, data is ready for transferring to other objects, devices, or servers through
    the Internet. 3.1. Computing framework Another important part of IoT is the computing
    framework of processing data, the most famous of which are fog and cloud computing.
    IoT applications use both frameworks depending on the application and process
    location. In some applications, data should be processed upon generation, while
    in other applications it is not necessary to process data immediately. The instant
    processing of data and the network architecture that supports it is known as fog
    computing. Collectively, these are applied for edge computing [19]. 3.1.1. Fog
    computing Here, the architecture of fog computing is applied to migrating information
    from a data center task to the edge of the servers. This architecture is built
    based on the edge servers. Fog computing provides limited computing, storage,
    and network services, also providing logical intelligence and filtering of data
    for data centers. This architecture has been and is being implemented in vital
    areas like eHealth and military applications [20], [21]. 3.1.2. Edge computing
    In this architecture, processing is run at a distance from the core, toward the
    edge of the network. This type of processing enables data to be initially processed
    at edge devices. Devices at the edge may not be connected to the network in a
    continuous manner, and so they require a copy of the master data/reference data
    for offline processing. Edge devices have different features such as 1) enhancing
    security, 2) filtering and cleaning data, and 3) storing local data for local
    use [22]. 3.1.3. Cloud computing Here, data for processing is sent to data centers,
    and after being analyzed and processed, they become accessible. This architecture
    has high latency and high load balancing, indicating that this architecture is
    not sufficient for processing IoT data because most processing should run at high
    speeds. The volume of this data is high, and big data processing will increase
    the CPU usage of the cloud servers [23]. There are various types of cloud computing:
    (1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): where the company purchases all the equipment
    like hardware, servers, and networks. (2) Platform as a Service (PaaS): where
    all the equipment above is placed for rent on the Internet. (3) Software as a
    Service(SaaS): where a distributed software model is presented. In this model,
    all practical software will be hosted by a service provider and is accessible
    to the users through the Internet [24]. (4) Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS):
    also known as Backend as a Service (BaaS), provides a web or mobile application
    with a path in order to connect the application to the backend cloud storage.
    MBaaS provides features like user management, push notifications, and integration
    with social network services. This cloud service benefits from an Application
    Programming Interface (API) and software Development Kits (SDK). 3.1.4. Distributed
    computing This architecture is designed for processing high volumes of data. In
    IoT applications, because the sensors generate data in a repetitive manner, big
    data challenges are encountered [22], [25]. To overcome this phenomenon, distributed
    computing is designed to divide data into packets, and assign the packets to different
    computers for processing. This distributed computing has different frameworks
    like Hadoop and Spark. When migrating from cloud to fog and distributed computing,
    the following phenomena occur: 1) a decrease in network loading, 2) an increase
    in data processing speed, 3) a reduction in CPU usage, 4) a reduction in energy
    consumption, and 5) an ability to process a higher volume of data. Because the
    smart city is one of the primary applications of IoT, the most important use cases
    of the smart city and their data characteristics are discussed in the following
    sections. 4. Smart city Cities always demand services to enhance the quality of
    life and make existing services more efficient. In the last few years, the concept
    of smart cities has played an important role in academia and industry [26]. With
    an increase in the population and complexity of city infrastructures, cities seek
    methods to handle large-scale urbanization problems. IoT plays a vital role in
    collecting data from the city environment. IoT enables cities to use live status
    reports and smart monitoring systems to react more intelligently to emerging situations
    such as earthquakes and volcanoes. By adopting IoT technologies in city, the majority
    of the city''s assets can be connected to one another, making them more readily
    observable, and consequently, more easy to monitor and manage. The purpose of
    building smart cities is to improve services like traffic management, water management,
    and energy consumption, as well as improving the quality of life for the citizens.
    The objective of smart cities is to transform rural and urban areas into places
    of democratic innovation [27]. Such smart cities seek to decrease the expenses
    in public health, safety, transportation, and resource management, thus assisting
    their economies [28]. In Ref. [29], the authors believe that in the long term,
    the vision for a smart city would be that all the cities'' systems and structures
    will monitor their own conditions and carry out self-repair upon need. 4.1. Use
    case A city has an important effect on society because the city touches all aspects
    of human life. A smart city can assist in having a comfortable life. The use cases
    for smart cities consist of smart energy, smart mobility, smart citizens, and
    urban planning. This division is based on a review of the latest studies in this
    field and the most recent reports released by McKinsey and Company. 4.1.1. Smart
    energy Smart energy is one of the most important research areas of IoT because
    it is essential to reduce overall power consumption [30]. It offers high-quality
    and affordable environmentally friendly energy. Smart energy includes a variety
    of operational and energy measures, including Smart energy applications, smart
    leak monitoring, and renewable energy resources, etc. Using smart energy (i.e.,
    deployment of a smart grid) implies a fundamental re-engineering of the electricity
    services [31]. The smart grid is one of the most important applications of smart
    energy. It includes many high-speed time series data to monitor key devices. For
    managing this kind of data, [32] introduced a method to manage and analyze time
    series data in order to make them organized on demand. Moreover, the smart energy
    infrastructure will become more complex in the future, and therefore [33] proposed
    a simulation system to test new concepts and optimization approaches and forecast
    future consumption. Another important application of smart energy is leak monitoring
    systems. The objective of such a system is to model a water or gas management
    system that would optimize energy resource consumption [34], [35]. 4.1.2. Smart
    mobility Mobility is another important aspect of any city. Through IoT, city officials
    can improve the quality of life in the city. Smart mobility can be divided into
    the following three major components: (1) Autonomous cars: IoT will have a broad
    range of effects on how vehicles are run. The most important question is about
    how IoT can improve vehicle services. IoT sensors and wireless connections make
    it possible to create self-driving cars and monitor vehicle performance. With
    the data collected from vehicles, the most popular/congested routes can be predicted,
    and decisions can be made to decrease traffic congestion. Self-driving cars can
    improve passenger safety because they have the ability to monitor the driving
    of the other cars. (2) Traffic control: Optimizing the traffic flow by analyzing
    sensor data is another part of mobility in the city. For traffic control, traffic
    data will be collected from cars, road cameras, and counter sensors installed
    on roads. (3) Public transportation: IoT can improve the public transportation
    system management by providing accurate location and routing information to a
    smart transportation system. It can assist passengers in making better decisions
    in their schedules as well as decrease the amount of wasted time. There exist
    different perspectives on how to build smart public transportation systems. These
    systems need to manage different kinds of data like vehicle location data and
    traffic data. Smart public transportation systems should be real-time oriented
    in order to make proper decisions in real-time as well as use historical data
    analysis [36]. For instance, [37] proposed a mechanism that considers smart city
    devices as graph nodes, and the authors used big data solutions to solve these
    issues. 4.1.3. Smart citizens This use case for smart cities covers a broad range
    of areas in human lives, such as environmental monitoring, crime monitoring, and
    social health. The environment with all its components is fundamental and vital
    for life. Consequently, making progress in technology is guaranteed to enhance
    security. Close monitoring devoted to crime would also contribute to overall social
    health. 4.1.4. Urban planning Another important aspect in use cases for the smart
    city is reaching long-term decisions. Because the city and environment both play
    major roles in human life, reaching decisions in this context is critical. By
    collecting data from different sources, it is possible to make a decision for
    the future of the city. Making decisions affecting the city infrastructure, design,
    and functionality is called urban planning. IoT is beneficial in this area because
    through smart city data analysis, the authorities can predict which part of the
    city will be more crowded in the future and find solutions for the potential problems.
    A combination of IoT and urban planning would have a major effect on scheduling
    future infrastructure improvements. 4.2. Smart city data characteristics Smart
    city devices generate data in a continuous manner, indicating that the data gathered
    from traffic, health, and energy management applications would generate a sizable
    volume. In addition, because the data generation rate varies for different devices,
    processing data with different generation rates is a challenge. For example, the
    frequency of GPS sensor updates is measured in seconds, while the frequency of
    updates for temperature sensors may be measured hourly. Whether the data generation
    rate is high or low, there always exists a danger of losing important information.
    To integrate the sensory data collected from heterogeneous sources is challenging
    [14], [38]. Ref. [39] applied big data analytic methods to distinguish the correlation
    between the temperature and traffic data in Santander, Spain. Ref. [40] proposed
    a new framework integrating big data analysis and Industrial Internet of Things
    (IIoT) technologies for Offshore Support Vessels (OSV) based on a hybrid CPU/GPU
    high-performance computing platform. Another characteristic is the dynamic nature
    of the data. Data for autonomous cars is an example of dynamic data because the
    sensor results will change based on different locations and times. The quality
    of the collected data is important, particularly for smart city data, which have
    different qualities due to the fact that they are generated from heterogeneous
    sources. According to Ref. [41], the quality of information from each data source
    depends on three factors: 1) Error in measurements or precision of data collection.
    2) Devices'' noise in the environment. 3) Discrete observation and measurements.
    To achieve a better Quality of Information (QoI), it is necessary to extract higher
    levels of abstraction and provide actionable information to other services. QoI
    in smart data depends on the applications and characteristics of data. There exist
    different solutions to improve QoI. For example, to improve the accuracy of data,
    selecting trustworthy sources and combining the data from multiple resources is
    of key importance. By increasing the frequency and density of sampling, the precision
    of the observations and measurements will be improved, which would lead to a reduction
    in environmental noise. The data characteristics in both IoT and the smart city
    are illustrated in Fig. 2. Semantic data annotation is another prime solution
    to enhancing data quality. Smart devices generate raw data with low-level abstractions.
    For this reason, the semantic models provide interpretable descriptions of data,
    its quality, and its original attributes [28]. Semantic annotation is beneficial
    in interpretable and knowledge-based information fusion [42]. Smart data characteristics

    5. Taxonomy of machine learning algorithms Machine learning is a subfield of computer
    science, and is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides machines
    with the ability to learn without explicit programming. Machine learning evolved
    from pattern recognition and computational learning theory. Here, some essential
    concepts of machine learning are discussed as well as the frequently applied machine
    learning algorithms for smart data analysis. A learning algorithm takes a set
    of samples as an input named a training set. In general, there exist three main
    categories of learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement [54], [55],
    [56]. In an informal sense, in supervised learning, the training set consists
    of samples of input vectors together with their corresponding appropriate target
    vectors, also known as labels. In unsupervised learning, no labels are required
    for the training set. Reinforcement learning deals with the problem of learning
    the appropriate action or sequence of actions to be taken for a given situation
    in order to maximize payoff. This article focuses on supervised and unsupervised
    learning since they have been and are still widely applied in IoT smart data analysis.
    The objective of supervised learning is to learn how to predict the appropriate
    output vector for a given input vector. Applications where the target labels consist
    of a finite number of discrete categories are known as classification tasks. Cases
    where the target labels are composed of one or more continuous variables are known
    as regression tasks [57]. Defining the objective of unsupervised learning is difficult.
    One of the major objectives is to identify sensible clusters of similar samples
    within the input data, known as clustering. Moreover, the objective may be the
    discovery of a useful internal representation of the input data by preprocessing
    the original input variable in order to transfer it into a new variable space.
    This preprocessing stage can significantly improve the result of the subsequent
    machine learning algorithm and is named feature extraction [55]. The frequently
    applied machine learning algorithms for smart data analysis and IoT use cases
    are shown in Table 2 and Table 3 accordingly. Table 2. Overview of frequently

    in the data [52], [53] In the following subsections, we assume that we are given
    a training set containing N training samples denoted as , where is the ith M-dimensional
    training input vector and is the corresponding desired P-dimensional output vector.
    Moreover, we collect the M-dimensional input vectors in a matrix, written as ,
    and we also collect their corresponding desired output vectors in a matrix written
    as . However, in Section 5.4 the training set does not contain the desired output
    vectors. 5.1. Classification 5.1.1. K-nearest neighbors In K-Nearest Neighbors
    (KNN), the objective is to classify a new given unseen data point by looking at
    the K given data points in the training set that are closest to it in the input
    or feature space. Therefore, to find the K nearest neighbors of the new data point,
    we need to use a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, norm, angle, Mahalanobis
    distance or Hamming distance. To formulate the problem, let us denote the new
    input vector (data point) by x, its K nearest neighbors by , the predicted class
    label for x by y, and the class variable by a discrete random variable t. Additionally,
    denotes the indicator function: if s is true and otherwise. The form of the classification
    task is (1) i.e., the input vector x will be labeled by the mode of its neighbors''
    labels [58]. One limitation of KNN is that it requires storing the entire training
    set, which makes KNN unscalable to large data sets. In [59], the authors have
    addressed this issue by constructing a tree-based search with a one-off computation.
    Moreover, there exists an online version of KNN classification. It is worth noting
    that KNN can also be used for regression tasks [55]. However, we will not explain
    this here, because it is not a frequently employed algorithm for smart data analysis.
    Ref. [96] proposes a new framework for learning a combination of multiple metrics
    for a robust KNN classifier. Furthermore, [47] compares KNN with a rough-set-based
    algorithm for classifying the travel pattern regularities. 5.1.2. Naive Bayes
    Given a new, unseen data point (input vector) , naive Bayes classifiers, which
    are a family of probabilistic classifiers, classify z based on applying Bayes''
    theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between the features (attributes)
    of z given the class variable t. By applying Bayes'' theorem, we have (2) and
    by applying the naive independence assumption and some simplifications, we have
    (3) Therefore, the form of the classification task is (4) where y denotes the
    predicted class label for z. Different naive Bayes classifiers use different approaches
    and distributions to estimate and [61]. Naive Bayes classifiers require a small
    number of data points to be trained, and can deal with high-dimensional data points,
    and also are fast and highly scalable [60]. Moreover, they are a popular model
    for applications, such as spam filtering [97], text categorization, and automatic
    medical diagnosis [98]. Ref. [49] used this algorithm to combine factors to evaluate
    the trust value and calculate the final quantitative trust of agricultural product.
    5.1.3. Support vector machine Classical Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are non-probabilistic,
    binary classifiers that aim to find the dividing hyperplane that separates both
    classes of the training set with the maximum margin. Then, the predicted label
    of a new, unseen data point is determined based on which side of the hyperplane
    it falls [62]. First, we discuss the linear SVM that finds a hyperplane that is
    a linear function of the input variable. To formulate the problem, we denote the
    normal vector to the hyperplane by w and the parameter for controlling the offset
    of the hyperplane from the origin along its normal vector by b. Moreover, to ensure
    that SVMs can deal with outliers in the data, we introduce a variable , called
    a slack variable, for every training point , which gives the distance by which
    this training point violates the margin in units of . This binary linear classification
    task is described using a constrained optimization problem of the form (5) where
    parameter determines how heavily a violation is punished [64], [63]. It should
    be noted that although we used the norm here for the penalty term , there exist
    other penalty terms, such as the norm, which should be chosen with respect to
    the needs of the application. Moreover, the parameter C is a hyperparameter which
    can be chosen via cross-validation or Bayesian optimization. There exist various
    techniques to solve the constrained optimization problem of equation (5), such
    as quadratic programming optimization [99], sequential minimal optimization [100],
    and P-packSVM [101]. One important property of SVMs is that the resulting classifier
    only uses a few training points, which are called support vectors, to classify
    a new data point. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can perform
    a non-linear classification, which finds a hyperplane that is a non-linear function
    of the input variable. To do so, we implicitly map an input variable into high-dimensional
    feature spaces in a process called a kernel trick [64]. In addition to performing
    binary classification, SVMs can perform multiclass classification. There are various
    methods to achieve this, such as One-vs-all (OVA) SVM, All-vs-all (AVA) SVM [54],
    Structured SVM [102], and the Weston and Watkins [103] version. SVMs are among
    the best off-the-shelf supervised learning models that are capable of effectively
    dealing with high-dimensional data sets and are efficient in terms of memory usage,
    owing to the employment of support vectors for prediction. One significant drawback
    of this model is that it does not directly provide probability estimates. When
    given a solved SVM model, its parameters are difficult to interpret [104]. SVMs
    are useful in many real-world applications such as hand-written character recognition
    [105], image classification [106], and protein classification [107]. Finally,
    we should note that SVMs can be trained in an online fashion, which is addressed
    in [108]. Ref. [109] proposed a method on the Intel Lab Dataset. This data set
    consists of four environmental variables (temperature, voltage, humidity and light)
    collected through S4 Mica2Dot sensors over 36 days at a per-second rate. 5.2.
    Regression 5.2.1. Linear regression In linear regression, the objective is to
    learn a function . This is a mapping and is a linear combination of a fixed set
    of linear or nonlinear functions of the input variable, denoted as and called
    basic functions. The form of is (6) where w is the weight vector or matrix , and
    . There exists a broad range of basic functions, such as polynomial, gaussian,
    radial, and sigmoidal basic functions, which should be chosen with respect to
    the application [68], [66]. For training the model, there exists a range of approaches:
    Ordinary Least Square, Regularized Least Squares, Least-Mean-Squares (LMS) and
    Bayesian Linear Regression. Among these, LMS is of interest since it is fast,
    scalable to large data sets, and it learns the parameters online by applying the
    technique of stochastic gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent
    [67], [55]. By using suitable basic functions it can be shown that arbitrary nonlinearities
    in the mapping from the input variable to the output variable can be modeled.
    However, the assumption of fixed basis functions leads to significant shortcomings
    with this approach. For example, an increase in the dimension of the input space
    is coupled with rapid growth in the number of basis functions [55], [66], [56].
    Linear regression can process at a high rate [48], and this algorithm can be used
    to analyze and predict the energy usage of buildings. 5.2.2. Support vector regression
    The SVM model described in Section 5.1.3 can be extended to solve regression problems
    through a process called Support Vector Regression (SVR). Analogous to support
    vectors in SVMs, the resulting SVR model depends only on a subset of the training
    points, owing to the rejection of training points that are close to the model
    prediction [69]. Various implementations of SVR exist such as epsilon-support
    vector regression and nu-support vector regression [70]. The authors of [46] proposed
    a hybrid method to obtain accurate temperature and humidity data predictions.
    5.3. Combining models 5.3.1. Classification and regression trees In Classification
    and Regression Trees (CART), the input space is partitioned into axis-aligned
    cuboid regions , and then a separate classification or regression model is assigned
    to each region to predict the label for data points fall into that region [71].
    Given a new, unseen input vector (data point) x, the process for predicting the
    corresponding target label can be explained by the traversal of a binary tree
    corresponding to a sequential decision-making process. An example of a model for
    classification is one that predicts a particular class for each region, and the
    example of regression is a model that predicts a constant for each region. To
    formulate the classification task, we denote a class variable by a discrete random
    variable t and the predicted class label for x by y. The classification task takes
    the form (7) where is the indicator function described in Section 5.1.1. This
    equation states that x will be labeled by the most common (mode) label in its
    corresponding region [73]. To formulate the regression task, we denote the value
    of the output vector by t and the predicted output vector for x by y. The regression
    task is expressed as (8) i.e., the output vector for x will be the mean of the
    output vectors of data points in its corresponding region [73]. Download : Download
    high-res image (284KB) Download : Download full-size image To train CART, the
    structure of the tree should be determined based on the training set. This means
    determining the split criterion at each node, along with the threshold parameter
    value. Finding the optimal tree structure is an NP-complete problem, and therefore
    a greedy heuristic, which constructs the tree top-down and chooses the best split
    node-by-node, is used to train CART. To achieve a better generalization and reduce
    overfilling, some stopping criteria should be used for constructing the tree.
    Possible stopping criterion are the maximum depth reached, whether the distribution
    in the branch is pure, whether the benefit of splitting is below a certain threshold,
    and whether the number of samples in each branch is below the criteria threshold.
    Moreover, after constructing the tree a pruning procedure can be used to reduce
    overfitting [72], [55], [56]. Algorithm 1 describes how to train CART. The major
    strength of CART is its human interpretability, owing to its tree structure. Additionally,
    it is fast and scalable to large data sets. However, it is very sensitive to the
    choice of the training set [110]. Another shortcoming of this model concerns unsmooth
    labeling of the input space since each region of the input space is associated
    with exactly one label [73], [55]. Ref. [47] proposes an efficient and effective
    data-mining procedure that models the travel patterns of transit riders in Beijing,
    China. 5.3.2. Random forests In random forests, instead of training a single tree,
    an army of trees are trained. Each tree is trained on a subset of the training
    set, chosen randomly along with a replacement, using a randomly chosen subset
    of M input variables (features) [74]. From here, there are two scenarios for predicting
    the label of a new, unseen data point: (1) in classification tasks, this is set
    as the mode of the labels predicted by each tree; (2) in regression tasks it is
    set as the mean of the labels predicted by each tree. There is a tradeoff between
    different values of M. A value of M that is too small leads to random trees with
    poor prediction power, whereas a value of M that is too large leads to very similar
    random trees. Random forests have a very high accuracy, but this comes at the
    cost of losing human interpretability [111]. Additionally, they are fast and scalable
    to large data sets, and have many real-world applications, such as body pose recognition
    [112] and body part classification. 5.3.3. Bagging Bootstrap aggregating, also
    called bagging, is an ensemble technique that aims to improve the accuracy and
    stability of machine learning algorithms and reduce overfitting. In this technique,
    K new M sized training sets are generated by randomly choosing data points from
    the original training set with replacements. Then, on each new generated training
    set, a machine learning model is trained. The predicted label of a new, unseen
    data point is set as the mode of the labels predicted by each model in the case
    of classification tasks, and is set as the mean in the case of regression tasks.
    There are various machine learning models, such as CART and neural networks, for
    which the bagging technique can improve the results. However, bagging degrades
    the performance of stable models such as KNN [75]. Examples of practical applications
    include customer attrition prediction [113] and preimage learning [114], [115].
    5.4. Clustering 5.4.1. K-means In the K-means algorithm, the objective is to cluster
    the unlabeled data set into K clusters (groups), where data points belonging to
    the same cluster must have some similarities. In the classical K-means algorithm,
    the distance between data points is the measure of similarity. Therefore, K-means
    seeks to find a set of K cluster centers, denoted as , such that the distances
    between data points and their nearest center are minimized [77]. To denote the
    assignment of data points to the cluster centers, we use a set of binary indicator
    variables , so that if the data point is assigned to the cluster center , then
    . We formulate the problem as follows: (9) Algorithm 2 describes how to learn
    the optimal cluster centers and the assignment of the data points }. Download
    : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download full-size image In practice,
    K-means is a very fast and highly scalable algorithm. Moreover, there is an online
    stochastic version of K-means [78]. However, this approach has many limitations
    because of the use of Euclidean distance as the measure of similarity. For instance,
    it has limitations regarding the types of data variables that can be considered,
    and cluster centers are not robust against outliers. Additionally, the K-means
    algorithm assigns each data point only one of the clusters, which may lead to
    inappropriate clusters in some cases [76]. Ref. [116] used MapReduce to analyze
    the numerous small data sets and proposes a cluster strategy for a high volume
    of small data based on the K-means algorithm. Ref. [47] applied K-Means++ to cluster
    and classify travel pattern regularities. Ref. [117] introduced a real-time event
    processing and clustering algorithm for analyzing sensor data, by using the OpenIoT1
    middleware as an interface for innovative analytical IoT services. 5.4.2. Density-based
    spatial clustering of applications with noise In a Density-Based approach to Spatial
    Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the objective is to cluster a
    given unlabeled data set based on the density of its data points. In this model,
    groups of dense data points (data points with many close neighbors) are considered
    as clusters and data points in regions with low-density are considered as outliers
    [80]. Ref. [79] present an algorithm to train a DBSCAN model. In practice, DBSCAN
    is efficient on large datasets, and is fast and robust against outliers. Furthermore,
    it is capable of detecting clusters of arbitrary shape (i.e., spherical, elongated,
    and linear). Moreover, the model determines the number of clusters based on the
    density of the data points, unlike K-means, which requires the number of clusters
    to be specified [79]. However, there are some disadvantages associated with DBSCAN.
    For example, in the case of a data set with large differences in densities, the
    resulting clusters are destitute. Additionally, the performance of the model is
    highly sensitive to the distance metric that is used for determining if a region
    is dense [81]. It is worth, however, noting that DBSCAN is among the most widely
    used clustering algorithms with numerous real-world applications such as anomaly
    detection in temperature data [118] and X-ray crystallography [79]. The authors
    of [109] believe that knowledge discovery in data streams is an important task
    for research, business, and community. They applied DBSCAN to a data stream to
    reveal the number of existing classes and subsequently label the data. Furthermore,
    in [52] this algorithm is adopted to determine the arbitrary shape of a cluster.
    The DBSCAN algorithm produces sets of clusters of arbitrary shape and outlying
    objects. 5.5. Feature extraction 5.5.1. Principal component analysis In Principle
    Component Analysis (PCA), the objective is to orthogonally project data points
    onto an L dimensional linear subspace, called the principal subspace, which has
    the maximal projected variance [83], [85]. Equivalently, the objective can be
    defined as finding a complete orthonormal set of L linear M-dimensional basis
    vectors and the corresponding linear projections of data points such that the
    average reconstruction error (10) is minimized, where is the average of all data
    points [82], [55]. Download : Download high-res image (200KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Algorithm 3 describes how the PCA technique achieves these objectives.
    Depending on how is calculated, the PCA algorithm can have different run times,
    i.e., , , and [119], [55], [120]. To deal with high dimensional data sets, there
    is alternative version of the PCA algorithm based on the iterative expectation
    maximization technique. In this algorithm, the covariance matrix of the dataset
    is not explicitly calculated, and its most computationally demanding steps are
    . In addition, this algorithm can be implemented in an online fashion, which can
    also be advantageous in cases where M and N are large [84], [56]. PCA is one of
    the most important preprocessing techniques in machine learning. Its application
    involves data compression, whitening, and data visualization. Examples of its
    practical applications are face recognition, interest rate derivative portfolios,
    and neuroscience. Furthermore, there exists a kernelized version of PCA, called
    KPCA, which can find nonlinear principal components [86], [84]. 5.5.2. Canonical
    correlation analysis Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a linear dimensionality
    reduction technique that is closely related to PCA. Unlike PCA, which deals with
    one variable, CCA deals with two or more variables. Its objective is to find a
    corresponding pair of highly cross-correlated linear subspaces so that within
    one of the subspaces there is a correlation between each component and a single
    component from the other subspace. The optimal solution can be obtained by solving
    a generalized eigenvector problem [87], [88], [55]. Ref. [51] compared PCA with
    CCA for detecting intermittent faults and masking failures of indoor environments.
    5.6. Neural network One of the shortcomings of linear regression is that it is
    necessary to decide the types of basic functions. It is often difficult to choose
    the optimal basic functions. Therefore, in neural networks we fix the number of
    basic functions, but allow the model to learn the parameters of the basic functions.
    There exist many different types of neural networks, with different architectures,
    use cases, and applications. In subsequent subsections, we discuss the successful
    models used in smart data analysis. Note that neural networks are fast to process
    new data, because they are compact models. However, in contrast they usually require
    a large amount of computation to be trained. Moreover, they are easily adaptable
    to regression and classification problems [91], [90]. 5.6.1. Feed forward neural
    network Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), also known as Multilayer Perceptrons
    (MLP), are the most common type of neural networks in practical applications.
    To explain this model, we begin with a simple two-layer FFNN model. Assume that
    we have D basic functions and our objective is to learn the parameters of these
    basic functions together with the function f discussed in Section 5.2.1. The form
    of the classification or regression task is (11) where , , , and . Fig. 3 visualizes
    this FFNN model. The elements of the input vector x are units (neurons) in the
    input layer, are the units in the hidden layer, and are the units in the output
    layer, which outputs f. Note that the activities of the units in each layer are
    determined by a nonlinear function of the activities in the previous layer. In
    machine learning literature, is also called an activation function. The activation
    function in the last layer is chosen with respect to the data processing task.
    For example, for a regression task we use a linear activation function, and for
    multiclass classification we use a softmax activation function [57], [91], [55].

    Fig. 3. A two-layer feed forward neural network. Note that each output neuron
    is connected to each input neuron, i.e., it is a fully connected neural network.
    With enough hidden units, an FFNN with at least two layers can approximate an
    arbitrary mapping from a finite input space to a finite output space [121], [122],
    [123]. However, finding the optimum set of weights w for an FFNN is an NP-complete
    problem [124]. To train the model, there exist a range of learning methods, such
    as stochastic gradient descent, adaptive delta, adaptive gradient, adaptive moment
    estimation, Nesterov''s accelerated gradient, and RMSprob. There also exist a
    range of methods to enhance the generalization of the model and reduce overfitting,
    such as weight decay, weight-sharing, early stopping, Bayesian fitting of neural
    nets, dropout, and generative pre-training [92], [89]. A two-layer FFNN has the
    properties of restricted representation and generalization. Moreover, compactly
    represented functions with l layers may require an exponential size with layers.
    Therefore, an alternative approach would be an FFNN with more than one hidden
    layers, i.e., a deep neural network, in which different high-level features share
    low-level features [93], [90]. Significant results using deep neural networks
    have led them to be the most commonly employed classifiers in machine learning
    [125], [57]. Ref. [126] presented a method to forecast the states of IoT elements
    based on an artificial neural network. The presented architecture of the neural
    network is a combination of a multilayered perceptron and a probabilistic neural
    network. Furthermore, [21] applied an FFNN for processing health data. 5.7. Time
    series and sequential data So far in this article, the discussed algorithms have
    all dealt with set of data points that are independent and identically distributed
    (i.i.d.). However, in many cases the set of data points are not i.i.d., and often
    result from time series measurements, such as the daily closing value of the Dow
    Jones Industrial Average or acoustic features at successive time frames. An example
    of a non-i.i.d. set of data points in a context other than a time series is a
    character sequence in a German sentence. In these cases, data points consist of
    sequences of pairs rather than being drawn in an i.i.d. manner from a joint distribution
    and such the sequences exhibit significant sequential correlations [127], [55].
    In a sequential supervised learning problem, when data points are sequential,
    we are given a training set consisting of N samples, where each of these is a
    pair of sequences. In each sample, and . Given a new, unseen input sequence x,
    the goal is to predict the desired output sequence y. Moreover, there exists a
    closely related problem called a time-series prediction problem, in which the
    goal is to predict the desired st element of a sequence . The key difference is
    that unlike in sequential supervised learning, where the entire sequence is available
    prior to any prediction, in a time-series prediction only the prefix of the sequence,
    up to the current time , is available. In addition, in sequential supervised learning
    the entire output sequence y must be predicted, whereas in time-series prediction
    the true observed values of the output sequence up to time t are given. It is
    worth noting that there is another closely-related task, called sequence classification,
    in which the goal is to predict the desired single categorical output y given
    an input sequence x [127]. There are a variety of machine learning models and
    methods that can deal with these tasks. Examples of these models and methods are
    hidden Markov models [128], [129], sliding-window methods [130], Kalman filter
    [131], conditional random fields [132], recurrent neural networks [133], [57],
    graph transformer networks [89], and maximum entropy Markov models [134]. In addition,
    sequential time series and sequential data exists in many real-world applications,
    including speech recognition [135], handwriting recognition [136], musical score
    following [137], and information extraction [134]. 5.8. Anomaly detection The
    problem of identifying items or patterns in a data set that do not conform to
    other items or an expected pattern is referred to as anomaly detection, and these
    unexpected patterns are called anomalies, outliers, novelties, exceptions, noise,
    surprises, or deviations [138], [139]. There are many challenges in the task of
    anomaly detection that distinguish it from a binary classification task. For example,
    an anomalous class is often severely underrepresented in the training set. In
    addition, anomalies exhibit considerably more diverse behavior than a normal system,
    and are sparse by nature [140], [139]. There are three broad categories of anomaly
    detection techniques, based on the extent to which the labels are available. In
    supervised anomaly detection techniques, a binary (abnormal and normal) labeled
    data set is given, and then a binary classifier is trained. This should deal with
    the problem of unbalanced data set resulting from the existence of few data points
    with an abnormal label. Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques require a
    training set that contains only normal data points. Anomalies are then detected
    by building the normal behavior model of the system, and then testing the likelihood
    of the generation of the test data point by the learned model. Unsupervised anomaly
    detection techniques deal with an unlabeled data set, by making the implicit assumption
    that most of the data points are normal [139]. Anomaly detection is of use in
    many real-world applications, such as system health monitoring, credit card fraud
    detection, intrusion detection [141], detecting eco-system disturbances, and military
    surveillance. Moreover, anomaly detection can be used as a preprocessing algorithm
    for removing outliers from a data set, which can significantly improve the performance
    of subsequent machine learning algorithms, especially in supervised learning tasks
    [142], [143]. In the following subsection, we shall explain one-class support
    vector machines, which represent one of the most popular techniques for anomaly
    detection. Ref. [45] constructed a novel outlier detection algorithm that uses
    statistical techniques to identify outliers and anomalies in power datasets collected
    from smart environments. 5.8.1. One-class support vector machines One-class support
    vector machines (OCSVMs) represent a semi-supervised anomaly detection technique,
    and are an extension of the SVMs discussed in Section 5.1.3 for unlabeled data
    sets. Given a training set drawn from an underlying probability distribution P,
    OCSVMs aim to estimate a subset S of the input space such that the probability
    that a drawn sample from P lies outside of S is bounded by a fixed value between
    0 and 1. This problem is approached by learning a binary function f that captures
    the input regions where the probability density lives. Therefore, f is negative
    in the complement of S. The functional form of f can be computed by solving a
    quadratic programming problem [94], [95]. One-class SVMs are useful in many anomaly
    detection applications, such as anomaly detection in sensor networks [144], system-called
    intrusion detection [145], network intrusion detection [146], and anomaly detection
    in wireless sensor networks [147]. Ref. [52] reviewed various techniques for stream
    data outlier detection and the related issues in detail. Ref. [53] employed one-class
    SVM to detect anomalies by modeling complex normal patterns in the data. In the
    following section, we discuss how to overcome the challenges of applying machine
    learning algorithms to IoT smart data. 6. Discussion of taxonomy of machine learning
    algorithms To reach suitable decisions for smart data analysis, it is necessary
    to determine which task should be accomplished out of structure discovery, finding
    unusual data points, predicting values, predicting categories, or feature extraction.
    To discover the structure of unlabeled data, clustering algorithms can provide
    the most appropriate tools. K-means, described in 5.4.1, is the most well-known
    and frequently applied clustering algorithm, and can handle a large volume of
    data with a broad range of data types. Refs. [50], [52] proposed a method for
    applying the K-means algorithm for managing smart city and smart home data. DB-scan,
    described in 5.4.2, is another clustering algorithm the structure of data from
    unlabeled data, and is applied in [109], [52], [47] to cluster smart citizen behavior.
    To find unusual data points and anomalies in smart data, two important algorithms
    can be applied. Namely, these are the one-class SVM and PCA-based anomaly detection
    methods explained in 5.5.1, which can train anomalies and noisy data with a high
    performance. Refs. [52], [53] applied a one-class SVM to monitor and detect human
    activity anomalies. In order to predict values and classify sequenced data, the
    linear regression and SVR methods described in 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, respectively,
    are the two frequently applied algorithms. The objective of the models applied
    in these algorithms is to process and train data of high velocity. For example,
    [48], [46] applied a linear regression algorithm for real-time prediction. Another
    fast training algorithm is the classification and regression tree described in
    5.3.1, which has been applied to classify smart citizen behaviors [48], [47].
    To predict the categories of data, neural networks are suitable learning models
    for function approximation problems. Moreover, because smart data should be accurate
    and requires a long training time, a multi-class neural network can provide an
    appropriate solution. For instance, the FFNN explained in 5.6.1 has been applied
    to reduce future energy consumption, by predicting how data will be generated
    in the future and how the redundancy of this data will be removed [21], [126],
    [148]. The SVM explained in 5.1.3 is another popular classification algorithm,
    which is capable of handling massive amounts of data and classifying their different
    types. Because SVM can handle a high volume and a variety of types of data, it
    is commonly applied in most smart data processing algorithms. For example, [109],
    [48] applied SVM to classify traffic data. PCA and CCA, described in 5.5.1 and
    5.5.2, respectively, are the two algorithms most commonly applied for extracting
    features of data. Moreover, CCA can show the correlation between two categories
    of data. A type of PCA or CCA can also be applied to discover anomalies. Ref.
    [51] applied PCA and CCA to monitor public places and detect events in social
    areas. The chosen algorithm should be implemented and developed to reach the correct
    decisions. A sample implemented code is available from the open source GitHub
    license at https://github.com/mhrezvan/SVM-on-Smart-Traffic-Data. 7. Research
    trends and open issues As discussed previously, data analysis provides a significant
    contribution to IoT. In order to exploit the full potential of data analysis for
    extracting new insights from data, IoT must overcome some major challenges. These
    can be categorized into three different types. 7.1. IoT data characteristics Because
    the data is the basis of extracting knowledge, it is vital to have high quality
    information. This condition can affect the accuracy of knowledge extraction in
    a direct manner. Because IoT produces a high volume, fast velocity, and different
    varieties of data, preserving the data quality is a challenging task. Although
    many solutions have been introduced to solve these problems, none of them can
    handle all aspects of data characteristics in an accurate manner, because of the
    distributed nature of big data management solutions and real-time processing platforms.
    The abstraction of IoT data is low; that is, the data that comes from different
    resources in IoT consists mostly of raw data, and not sufficient for analysis.
    A wide variety of solutions have been proposed, while most of these require further
    improvement. For instance, semantic technologies tend to enhance the abstraction
    of IoT data through annotation algorithms, while they require further effort to
    overcome its velocity and volume. 7.2. IoT applications IoT applications fall
    into different categories according to their unique attributions and features.
    Certain issues should be consider for running data analysis in IoT applications
    in an accurate manner. First, the privacy of collected data is highly critical,
    because data collection processes can include personal or critical business data,
    which is inevitable to solve the privacy issues. Second, according to the vast
    number of resources and simply-designed hardware in IoT, it is vital to consider
    security parameters, such as network security and data encryption. Otherwise,
    by ignoring security in the design and implementation, an infected network of
    IoT devices can lead to a crisis. 7.3. IoT data analytic algorithms According
    to the characteristic of smart data, analytic algorithms should be able to handle
    big data. That is, IoT requires algorithms that can analyze data that comes from
    a variety of sources in real-time. Many attempts have been made to address this
    issue. For example, deep learning algorithms, which are a form of neural networks
    incorporating evolution can reach a high accuracy rate if they have enough data
    and time. Deep learning algorithms can easily be influenced by noisy smart data.
    Furthermore, neural network-based algorithms lack interpretation, that is, data
    scientists cannot understand the reasons for the model results. In the same manner,
    semi-supervised algorithms, which model a small amount of labeled data with a
    large amount of unlabeled data, can assist IoT data analysis. 8. Conclusions IoT
    consists of a vast number of different devices that are connected with each other
    and transmit huge amounts of data. The smart city is one of the most important
    applications of IoT, and provides various services in domains such as energy,
    mobility, and urban planning. These services can be enhanced and optimized by
    analyzing the smart data collected from these areas. To extract knowledge from
    collected data, many data analytic algorithms can be applied. Choosing a suitable
    algorithm for specific IoT or smart city application is an important issue. In
    this article, many IoT data analytic studies are reviewed to address this issue.
    Here, three facts should be considered in applying data analytic algorithms to
    smart data. The first is that different applications in IoT and smart cities have
    their own characteristics, such as the number of devices and types of the data
    that they generate. The second is that the generated data will have specific features
    that should be considered. The third is that the taxonomy of algorithms is another
    important aspect in applying data analysis to smart data. The findings in this
    article make it easy to choose a suitable algorithm for a particular problem.
    The analytic algorithms fall into eight categories, described in detail. This
    is followed by reviewing application specifics of smart city use cases. The characteristics
    and qualities of smart data are described in detail. In the discussion section,
    the manner in which data characteristics and application specifics can lead to
    choosing a proper data analytic algorithms is reviewed. In the regarding future
    trends, section recent issues and the future path for research in the field of
    smart data analytics are discussed. Acknowledgments The authors would like to

    Recommendations Comments Skip Abstract Section Abstract The Internet of Things
    (IoT) aims to connect billions of smart objects to the Internet, which can bring
    a promising future to smart cities. These objects are expected to generate large
    amounts of data and send the data to the cloud for further processing, especially
    for knowledge discovery, in order that appropriate actions can be taken. However,
    in reality sensing all possible data items captured by a smart object and then
    sending the complete captured data to the cloud is less useful. Further, such
    an approach would also lead to resource wastage (e.g., network, storage, etc.).
    The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been proposed to counterpart the weakness
    by pushing processes of knowledge discovery using data analytics to the edges.
    However, edge devices have limited computational capabilities. Due to inherited
    strengths and weaknesses, neither Cloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses
    these challenges alone. Therefore, both paradigms need to work together in order
    to build a sustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities. In this article, we
    review existing approaches that have been proposed to tackle the challenges in
    the Fog computing domain. Specifically, we describe several inspiring use case
    scenarios of Fog computing, identify ten key characteristics and common features
    of Fog computing, and compare more than 30 existing research efforts in this domain.
    Based on our review, we further identify several major functionalities that ideal
    Fog computing platforms should support and a number of open challenges toward
    implementing them, to shed light on future research directions on realizing Fog
    computing for building sustainable smart cities. References Mohammad Aazam and

    \ growing demand for food in terms of quality and quantity has increased the need\n\
    for industrialization and intensiﬁcation in the agriculture ﬁeld. Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) is a highly\npromising technology that is oﬀering many innovative\
    \ solutions to modernize the agriculture sector.\nResearch institutions and scientiﬁc\
    \ groups are continuously working to deliver solutions and products\nusing IoT\
    \ to address diﬀerent domains of agriculture. This paper presents a systematic\
    \ literature\nreview (SLR) by conducting a survey of IoT technologies and their\
    \ current utilization in diﬀerent\napplication domains of the agriculture sector.\
    \ The underlying SLR has been compiled by reviewing\nresearch articles published\
    \ in well-reputed venues between 2006 and 2019. A total of 67 papers were\ncarefully\
    \ selected through a systematic process and classiﬁed accordingly. The primary\
    \ objective\nof this systematic study is the collection of all relevant research\
    \ on IoT agricultural applications,\nsensors/devices, communication protocols,\
    \ and network types. Furthermore, it also discusses the\nmain issues and challenges\
    \ that are being investigated in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Moreover, an\nIoT agriculture\
    \ framework has been presented that contextualizes the representation of a wide\
    \ range\nof current solutions in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Similarly, country policies\
    \ for IoT-based agriculture\nhave also been presented. Lastly, open issues and\
    \ challenges have been presented to provide the\nresearchers promising future\
    \ directions in the domain of IoT agriculture.\nKeywords:internetofthings;agriculture;devices/sensors;agriculturalapplications;communicationprotocols\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe widespread of the internet from the last two decades has\
    \ brought unlimited beneﬁts for\norganizations and citizens over the globe. The\
    \ major beneﬁt of this innovation was the capability\nto producer and consumer\
    \ services in real time. Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) is promising\nto provide\
    \ the same beneﬁt through its innovative technologies and giving a way to enhance\
    \ the\nuser’s perception and ability by modifying the working environment. IoT\
    \ oﬀers multiple solutions in\ndiﬀerent domains such as healthcare, retail, traﬃc,\
    \ security, smart homes, smart cities, and agriculture.\nIoT deployment in agriculture\
    \ is considered the ideal solution because in this area there is a need for\n\
    continuous monitoring and controlling. In the ﬁeld of agriculture, IoT is used\
    \ at diﬀerent levels in the\nagriculture industrial production chain [1]. The\
    \ main applications of IoT in agriculture are Precision\nFarming, Livestock, and\
    \ Greenhouses, which are grouped into diﬀerent monitoring domains. All these\n\
    applications are monitored with the help of diﬀerent IoT-based sensors/devices\
    \ by using wireless\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319; doi:10.3390/electronics9020319\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n2 of 41\nsensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) that helps the farmers collect relevant data through sensing devices.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based setups analyze and process the remote data by applying cloud\
    \ services, which helps the\nresearchers and agriculturists make better decisions.\
    \ Nowadays, with the advancement of current\ntechnology, environment monitoring\
    \ solutions oﬀer additional facilities in terms of management\nand decision making.\
    \ A custom-made landslide risk monitoring system has been developed that\nallows\
    \ quick implementations in hostile environments without user intervention [2].\
    \ What is more\ninteresting about the developed system is that it deals with node\
    \ failures and reorganizes the poor\nquality communication links on the network\
    \ by itself. An IoT management is proposed in [3] that\nmonitors the elements\
    \ such as wind, soil, atmosphere, and water over a large area. Moreover, IoT-based\n\
    agricultural monitoring solutions have been identiﬁed based on the sub-domains\
    \ to which they\nbelong. The identiﬁed sub-domains are soil monitoring, air monitoring,\
    \ temperature monitoring,\nwater monitoring, disease monitoring, location monitoring,\
    \ environmental conditions monitoring,\npest monitoring, and fertilization monitoring.\
    \ Further, the IoT paradigm improves human interaction\nin the physical world\
    \ through low-cost electronic devices and communication protocols. IoT also\n\
    monitors diﬀerent environmental conditions to create dense and real-time maps\
    \ of noise level, air,\nwater pollution, temperature, and damaging radiations\
    \ [4,5]. Besides, data collected about diﬀerent\nenvironmental parameters is transmitted\
    \ to the user by trigger alerts or sending recommendations to\nauthorities via\
    \ messages [6].\nIn the last few decades, a large number of studies have been\
    \ presented in the IoT-based agriculture\ndomain. Therefore, it is important to\
    \ collect, summarize, analyze, and classify the state-of-the-art\nresearch in\
    \ this area. The purpose of this research is to present a comprehensive systematic\
    \ literature\nreview in the ﬁeld of IoT agriculture. The contributions of this\
    \ paper related to the IoT agriculture\ndomain are as follows. In Section 2, we\
    \ present a background of IoT agriculture technology. In Section 3,\nwe present\
    \ the research methodology by deﬁning research questions, inclusion/exclusion\
    \ criteria, and\nsearch string to collect eﬀective studies relevant to the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain and focused on diﬀerent\npublication channels. In Section\
    \ 4, we present the research results in the form of tables by synthesizing\nthe\
    \ selected papers. Besides, some IoT-based agricultural applications, sensors/devices,\
    \ communication\nprotocols, and country policies are also presented in this section.\
    \ In Section 5, we present a summary\nof our ﬁndings through a research hierarchy\
    \ and designed an IoT-based smart farming framework.\nIn Section 6, open issues\
    \ and challenges in IoT agriculture have been discussed from many diﬀerent\nperspectives.\
    \ Moreover, research validity threats are presented in Section 8. Section 9 presents\
    \ the\nconclusions of the article.\n2. Background\nResearchers have proposed diﬀerent\
    \ IoT-based technologies in the agriculture ﬁeld that are\nincreasing the production\
    \ with less workforce eﬀort. Researchers have also worked on diﬀerent\nIoT-based\
    \ agriculture projects to improve the quality and increase agricultural productivity.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based agricultural techniques have been identiﬁed from the literature,\
    \ which have been summarized\nin this section.\nCarnegie Melon University has\
    \ worked on a plant nursery by using wireless\nsensors technology [7]. In [8],\
    \ a WSN-based polyhouse monitoring system has been presented\nthat makes use of\
    \ carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature and light detection modules. By using\
    \ GPS\ntechnology and ZigBee protocol a WSN-based system has been proposed that\
    \ monitors diﬀerent\nagricultural parameters [9]. A real-time rice crop monitoring\
    \ system has been designed to increase\nthe productivity [10]. The crop monitoring\
    \ system has been presented in [11], which collects the\ninformation of rainfall\
    \ and temperature and analyzes it to mitigate the risk of crop loss and enhance\n\
    crop productivity. A low-cost Bluetooth-based system has been proposed in [12]\
    \ for monitoring various\nagricultural variables such as temperature by using\
    \ a microcontroller that works as a weather station.\nThe proposed system is best\
    \ for monitoring real-time ﬁeld data. Moreover, the disadvantage of this\nsystem\
    \ is its limited communication range and required Bluetooth conﬁguration with\
    \ smartphones\nfor continuous monitoring. A smart sensing platform based on ZigBee\
    \ has developed by [13] for\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n3 of 41\nmonitoring diﬀerent\
    \ environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and pressure.\n\
    The developed platform provides a fast data rate, low-cost hardware, and an accurate\
    \ sensor working\non mesh network so that each node can communicate with each\
    \ other eﬀectively. A Global System for\nMobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation\
    \ monitoring system has been developed that uses an\nandroid app for measuring\
    \ diﬀerent environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and\ncontrol\
    \ of the water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop a low-cost\
    \ wireless system,\nwhereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating\
    \ command to actuate the ﬁeld\nmotor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse parameters such as humidity and\ntemperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-eﬀective and timely monitoring solutions to monitor\
    \ crop\nand soil conditions [15]. In [16], a simple, ﬂexible networking low-cost\
    \ system has been proposed that\nuses a fuzzy control system to monitor diﬀerent\
    \ greenhouse parameters. The operation and design\nmethodologies for WSN have\
    \ been proposed in [17] for a more advanced monitoring and controlling\nsystem\
    \ in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems related to greenhouses have\
    \ also been\naddressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless node packaging,\
    \ and electromagnetic\nﬁeld interference. In [18], a system has been proposed\
    \ that monitors the animal’s health as well as\nidentiﬁes the widespread diseases,\
    \ whether it originates from biological attacks or natural causes.\nA low-cost\
    \ animal health monitoring system is presented in [19] that measures the heart\
    \ rate, postures,\nand body temperature.\n3. Research Methodology\nA systematic\
    \ literature review (SLR) is selected as the research methodology for this paper.\
    \ The goal\nof this research is to investigate and provide a review of existing\
    \ IoT-based agricultural monitoring\napplications, sensors/devices, and communication\
    \ protocols. We have followed the methodology\nproposed by [20] to make research\
    \ impartial in the context of information selection and results in\nrepresentations.\
    \ The research methodology for this systematic mapping study has been illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 1.\nElectronics 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 41 \nsensor working\
    \ on mesh network so that each node can communicate with each other effectively.\
    \ A \nGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation monitoring\
    \ system has been \ndeveloped that uses an android app for measuring different\
    \ environmental conditions such as \nhumidity, temperature, and control of the\
    \ water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop \na low-cost wireless\
    \ system, whereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating \n\
    command to actuate the field motor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse \nparameters such as humidity and temperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and \nField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-effective and timely \nmonitoring solutions to\
    \ monitor crop and soil conditions [15]. In [16], a simple, flexible networking\
    \ \nlow-cost system has been proposed that uses a fuzzy control system to monitor\
    \ different greenhouse \nparameters. The operation and design methodologies for\
    \ WSN have been proposed in [17] for a more \nadvanced monitoring and controlling\
    \ system in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems \nrelated to greenhouses\
    \ have also been addressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless \n\
    node packaging, and electromagnetic field interference. In [18], a system has\
    \ been proposed that \nmonitors the animal’s health as well as identifies the\
    \ widespread diseases, whether it originates from \nbiological attacks or natural\
    \ causes. A low-cost animal health monitoring system is presented in [19] \nthat\
    \ measures the heart rate, postures, and body temperature. \n3. Research Methodology\
    \ \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is selected as the research methodology\
    \ for this paper. The \ngoal of this research is to investigate and provide a\

    \ [20] to make research impartial in the context of information selection and\

    \ ﬁrst step of this SLR is the deﬁnition of research questions and provision of\
    \ the current\nresearch status on IoT-based agriculture. This SLR addresses eight\
    \ research questions with their\ncorresponding motivation represented in Table\
    \ 1.\nTable 1. Research questions. IoT: Internet of Things.\nNo\nResearch Question\n\
    Main Motivation\nRQ1\nWhat are the major targeted primary publication\nchannels\
    \ for IoT agricultural research?\nIn order to identify where IoT agricultural\n\
    research can be found as well as good\npublication sources for future studies.\n\
    RQ2\nHow has the frequency of approaches been\nchanged related to IoT agriculture\
    \ over time?\nIdentify the publication with the time related to\nIoT in agriculture.\n\
    RQ3\nWhat approaches are used to address problems\nrelated IoT agriculture?\n\
    To ﬁnd out existing IoT agriculture approaches\nreported in the existing IoT agriculture\
    \ literature.\nRQ4\nWhat are the main application domains of IoT in\nagriculture?\n\
    Identify the main areas of agriculture where\nIoT technology is being utilized\
    \ for monitoring,\ncontrolling, and tracking purposes.\nRQ5\nWhat are the primary\
    \ focuses of the selected\nstudies?\nTo identify the signiﬁcant proposed solutions.\n\
    RQ6\nWhat type of IoT devices/sensors have been\nused in agriculture?\nTo identify\
    \ the role of primary\nIoT devices/sensors.\nRQ7\nWhich IoT network/communication\
    \ protocols\nare used in agriculture?\nTo identify the role of network and\ncommunication\
    \ protocols.\nRQ8\nWhich IoT agricultural policy have been\nimplemented in diﬀerent\
    \ countries?\nTo measure the potential of IoT in the agriculture\nﬁeld in the\
    \ diﬀerent countries.\n3.3. Search String\nThe second phase of SLR is to search\
    \ for relevant studies on the research topics. A search string\nhas been deﬁned\
    \ that is used to gather published articles related to the research topics. We\
    \ conducted\na pilot search based on the speciﬁc keywords, and we decided to use\
    \ only IoT applications in the\nagriculture search string. However, in the pilot\
    \ search, we have also used IoT sensors/devices and\ncommunication protocols in\
    \ agriculture. Internet research has been performed by using multiple search\n\
    engines and digital libraries to collect information. The obtained results were\
    \ compiled manually\nto get the best sources for information to answer the deﬁned\
    \ research questions. Selected search\nengines and digital libraries have been\
    \ chosen based on their scientiﬁc contents and closely related\nto the objective\
    \ of this paper. The chosen databases were Springer, Elsevier, IEEE, MDPI, and\
    \ IGI\nGlobal. The next step is to identify the consistent procedures and search\
    \ terms to seek out technical\nand scientiﬁc documentation in search engines and\
    \ digital libraries. The set of keywords selected to\ndeﬁne the search string\
    \ from the research questions is given in Table 2.\nTable 2. Search string.\n\
    Sources\nSearch String\nContext\nIEEE Xplore, Science\nDirect, Springer Link,\n\

    Applications” OR “Devices/Sensors” OR “IoT agricultural\ndevices/sensors”) OR\
    \ (“IoT agricultural protocols” OR\n“IoT Communication Protocols”)\nAgriculture\n\
    3.4. Screening of Relevant Papers\nAll the papers in the search were not precisely\
    \ relevant to research questions; therefore, they\nneeded to be assessed according\
    \ to the actual relevancy. For this purpose, we used the search process\nElectronics\
    \ 2020, 9, 319\n5 of 41\ndeﬁned by Dybå and Dingsøyr [21] for the screening of\
    \ relevant papers. In the ﬁrst screening phase,\npapers were selected based on\
    \ their titles, and we excluded those studies that were irrelevant to the\nresearch\
    \ area. For example, the keyword protocol returns articles relevant to IoT in\
    \ other ﬁelds that\nhave diﬀerent meanings than the IoT technology used in agriculture.\
    \ These papers were totally out of\nscope, so we excluded them. In the second\
    \ phase of screening, we read the abstract of each article that\nwas selected\
    \ in the ﬁrst screening phase. Furthermore, inclusion and exclusion criteria also\
    \ used to\nscreen papers.\nWe decided to exclude the following types of papers:\n\
    •\nArticles not presenting new and emerging ideas.\n•\nPapers published other\
    \ than conferences, journals, patents, and technical reports.\n•\nArticles without\
    \ deﬁning data sources or where the data collection procedure was unclear.\n•\n\
    Articles not published in the English language.\n•\nPapers published before 2006.\n\
    •\nPapers that are not relevant to the search string.\nPapers have been selected\
    \ on the basis of the given exclusion criteria and after examining the\nabstract\
    \ of selected studies, we have decided to include it in the next screening phase.\n\
    3.5. Keywording Using Abstract\nTo ﬁnd the relevant papers through keywording\
    \ by using the abstract, we used a process deﬁned\nby Petersen et al. [22]. Keywording\
    \ has been done in two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, we have examined\nthe abstract\
    \ and identiﬁed the concepts and keywords that reﬂected the contribution of the\
    \ studies.\nIn the second phase, a higher level of understanding is developed\
    \ on the basis of these keywords. For\nthe mapping of reviews, we have used keywords\
    \ to form and cluster the categories.\n3.6. Quality Assessment\nIn an SLR, generally,\
    \ quality assessment (QA) is carried out to assess the quality of selected papers.\n\
    In this SLR, a questionnaire has been designed to measure the quality of the selected\
    \ papers. The QA\nin this SLR is carried out by following the previous mapping\
    \ study [23].\n(a)\nThe study contributes to IoT in agriculture. The possible\
    \ answers for this research question were\n“Yes (+1)” and “No (0)”.\n(b)\nThe\
    \ study represents a clear solution in the ﬁeld of agriculture by using IoT. The\
    \ possible answers\nfor this research question were “Yes (+1)”, “partially (0.5)”,\
    \ and “No (0)”.\n(c)\nThe published studies that have been cited by other articles\
    \ and possible answers for this research\nquestion were: “partially (0)” if the\
    \ citation count is 1 to 5, “No (−1)” if paper is not being cited by\nany author,\
    \ and “Yes (+1)” if citation count is more than ﬁve.\n(d)\nThe published study\
    \ is from a stable and recognized publication source. The answer to this\nquestion\
    \ has been evaluated by considering the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) lists and\
    \ CORE\nranking computer science conferences.\nPossible answers for journals and\
    \ conferences are presented in Table 3.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n6 of 41\nTable\

    \ Process\nThe selection and search processes results are presented in Table 4.\
    \ Initially, 3179 papers were\nselected when the search protocol was applied on\
    \ the selected repositories. A screening process\nhas been applied on the basis\
    \ of the exclusion criteria, keywords, titles, abstracts, and full articles\n\
    of retrieved papers. One author retrieved all these papers; then, two authors\
    \ examined the papers,\nwhich led to the selection of a total 240 papers. After\
    \ that, we eliminated the duplicate titles and the\ntitles that were not relevant\
    \ to the review. For example, most of the excluded papers were related to\ngeneral\
    \ IoT such as privacy, security, healthcare, retail, and smart cities. To determine\
    \ the assessment\nagreement between two authors, a Cohen’s kappa coeﬃcient of\
    \ 0.91 was used, which indicates that\nthe evaluation made by authors is a perfect\
    \ measurement [24]. Furthermore, after reading the full\nabstracts of the selected\
    \ 171 papers in the duplication phase, we have selected 104 papers on the basis\n\
    of their abstracts. In the end, 67 studies were selected out of 3179.\nTable 4.\

    \ been applied to providing a set of possible answers to the deﬁned\nresearch\
    \ questions.\nRQ1: The answer to this question is given by identifying the publication\
    \ channels and sources for\nall papers.\nRQ2: To identify the frequency of approaches\
    \ of each article, which has been classiﬁed according\nto the publication year.\n\
    RQ3: Research approaches have been classiﬁed according to developing techniques\
    \ in the selected\nstudies such as whether they proposed a system, solution, method,\
    \ model, application, survey, platform,\narchitecture, ecosystem, review, and\
    \ framework.\nRQ4: To identify the primary IoT solution for agriculture, diﬀerent\
    \ monitoring, controlling, and\ntracking applications have been investigated.\n\
    RQ5: The deﬁned research question identiﬁes the primary focus of the selected\
    \ studies in the\nIoT agricultural ﬁeld.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n7 of 41\n\
    RQ6: This research question has been designed to measure the utilization of devices/sensors\
    \ used\nby selected IoT agricultural solutions.\nRQ7: Which communication protocol\
    \ or network system has been designed or implemented to\nprovide an IoT-based\
    \ agricultural solution.\nRQ8: Diﬀerent country policies have been discussed to\
    \ measure the value of IoT in agriculture.\n4. Analysis\nIn this section, ﬁndings\
    \ related to the SLR questions that are presented in Table 1 are described.\n\
    Research studies after choosing the screening process have been used to illustrate\
    \ each research\nquestion answer to make an essential contribution to the IoT\
    \ agriculture ﬁeld.\n4.1. Selection of Results\nAnalysis of the state-of-the-art\
    \ IoT-based smart farming studies is a key challenge due to the\ncoverage of multiple\
    \ application domains, communication protocols, sensors/devices, and protocols.\n\
    According to our research questions, we have gathered 67 primary studies in this\
    \ section. After analyzing\nthe selected studies, we have addressed each question\
    \ according to the extracted information. Quality\nassessment and the overall\
    \ classiﬁcation results of the selected papers have been presented in Table 5.\n\

    \ is to evaluate and determine the air condition in order to prevent \nfrom damaging\
    \ effects. In [25] an IoT-based agricultural air, humidity, and temperature monitoring\
    \ \nsystem has been proposed. This system offers a real-time microclimate monitoring\
    \ solution that is \nbased on WSNs. The system consists of a temperature and humidity\
    \ sensor that is supported by a \ncommunication technology called ZigBee and powered\
    \ by solar panels. \nFigure 5. IoT agriculture applications.\nElectronics 2020,\
    \ 9, 319\n20 of 41\nAir Monitoring\nThe aim of this sub-domain is to evaluate\
    \ and determine the air condition in order to prevent\nfrom damaging eﬀects. In\
    \ [25] an IoT-based agricultural air, humidity, and temperature monitoring\nsystem\
    \ has been proposed. This system oﬀers a real-time microclimate monitoring solution\
    \ that is\nbased on WSNs. The system consists of a temperature and humidity sensor\
    \ that is supported by a\ncommunication technology called ZigBee and powered by\
    \ solar panels.\nSoil Monitoring\nPaper categorized in this sub-domain [26] proposed\
    \ solutions for soil moisture and temperature\nmonitoring in the ﬁelds using WSN.\
    \ Both of these systems are maintained through multiple\ncommunication technologies\
    \ such as GPRS, ZigBee, and the internet, where the user interacts with the\n\
    system through web applications [63,85].\nWater Monitoring\nThe studies that have\
    \ been categorized in this sub-domain intend to monitor water quality or\nwater\
    \ pollution by sensing PH, temperature, and chemicals, which can change the normal\
    \ conditions\nof water. In [27], an IoT-based solution has been presented to monitor\
    \ the water quality by measuring\ntemperature, conductivity, and turbidity. This\
    \ solution based on WSN combines sensing devices and\nmonitors the multiple parameters\
    \ of water in urban areas. Moreover, [28] developed a WSN-based\nsystem to monitor\
    \ the rainfall and water level in irrigation systems. A web-based decision support\n\
    system has been proposed in [29] that use sensors to measure temperature, solar\
    \ radiations, humidity,\nand rainfall for irrigation monitoring in olive ﬁelds.\n\
    Disease Monitoring\nThe LOFAR-agro Project is the best example for crop or plant\
    \ monitoring [30]. This project protects\nthe potato crop by monitoring diﬀerent\
    \ climate conditions such as temperature and humidity through\nWSN. The proposed\
    \ system protects the crop by analyzing the collected data from fungal diseases.\n\
    Environmental Condition Monitoring\nAn environmental condition monitoring system\
    \ is proposed in [34] that measures the spatial\nsampling of humidity sensors\
    \ using WSN. To determine the behavior of 2D correlation, a historical\ndatabase\
    \ is being used in the proposed system. Moreover, another environmental conditions\
    \ monitoring\nsystem is proposed in [35] that integrates forecasting and drought\
    \ monitoring musing IoT.\nCrop and Plant Growth Monitoring\nIn this sub-domain,\
    \ farmlands have been analyzed by using the mobile sensors presented in [94].\n\
    The essential purpose of this proposed system is to monitor the growth of grapes\
    \ and control plans\nfor viticulture activities. To monitor apple orchards, researchers\
    \ proposed an eﬃcient and intelligent\nmonitoring system that provides suggestions\
    \ based on the sensed data [95]. The basic purpose of this\nproposed system is\
    \ to decrease the management costs, improve the quality of apples, and protect\
    \ from\npest attacks. It is a WSN-based system that is designed by using ZigBee\
    \ and GPRS to monitor the\ngrowth of apples.\nTemperature Monitoring\nSoil temperature\
    \ plays a vital role in crop productivity. In [96], a system has been proposed\n\
    to monitor the amount of nutrients between surface and ground water. To measure\
    \ the quantity of\nnutrients in soil, electrochemical impedance was applied. Soil\
    \ test results are monitored through\nan inductance (L), capacitance (C), and\
    \ resistance (R) (LCR) meter, and the results are calculated via\nstandard library\
    \ measurements.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n21 of 41\nHumidity Monitoring\nThe\
    \ humidity level is measured in air by using multiple humidity sensors. An inappropriate\n\
    amount of humidity leaves a negative impact on plants regarding cell growth [36].\n\
    Monitoring Gases in Greenhouse\nAgriculture and greenhouse gases are related to\
    \ each other. The excessive amount of gases in a\ngreenhouse increases the temperature,\
    \ which directly impacts the agriculture productivity. To monitor\nthe greenhouse\
    \ gases and CH4, a WSN and solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system\n\
    has been presented [37].\nFertilization and Pest Control\nIn this domain, an IoT\
    \ solution provides conservation approaches to improve the quality of the\ncrops\
    \ and amount of nutrients usage. An online climate monitoring system has been\
    \ presented for\ngreenhouses to monitor pests, irrigation, fertilization, and\
    \ climate [33]. The system use WSN to gather\nand analyze sensed data for eﬃcient\
    \ analysis.\nGreenhouse Illumination Control\nAn automated agriculture system\
    \ is developed to monitor the growth of cabbages and melons in\ngreenhouses [38].\
    \ The designed system monitors the crop growing process and controls the greenhouse\n\
    environmental conditions such as temperature, ambient light, and humidity.\nLocation\
    \ Tracking\nThis sub-domain referred to the tracking and tracing of animal locations\
    \ and any unwanted\nmovement all over the ﬁeld. Diﬀerent monitoring devices and\
    \ sensors have been deployed in the\nﬁeld to save the crop from theft and wild\
    \ attacks. For agriculture, an intrusion detection solution is\npresented in [31]\
    \ that generates an alarm and sends a text message to the farmer’s mobile when\
    \ an\nunwanted movement happens in the crop ﬁeld. Moreover, for livestock, diﬀerent\
    \ monitoring devices\nare implemented to track the animals’ locations and monitor\
    \ their activities. In [32], an IoT-based\nanimal monitoring solution is presented\
    \ that monitors the behavior of swamp deer. Moreover, a herd\nof cattle grazing\
    \ in the ﬁeld can be monitored and tracked by using RFID and WSN [97]. In this\
    \ way\nranchers can get real time monitoring of cattle’s.\n4.1.6. Assessment of\
    \ RQ6: What Is the Role of IoT-Based Devices/Sensors in Agriculture\nMultiple\
    \ organizations and industries are using diﬀerent kinds of devices/sensors for\
    \ a long time,\nbut an invention of IoT has taken advancements of devices/sensors\
    \ totally at a diﬀerent level. An\nIoT device consists of an embedded system that\
    \ interacts with actuators, sensors, and the required WSN.\nEmbedded systems consist\
    \ of a microprocessor, memory, communication modules, and input/output\ncomponents.\
    \ Sensors monitor the diﬀerent environmental parameters and farm variables in\
    \ the ﬁeld\nof agriculture and dynamic data that is obtained through facilities\
    \ intervention.\nCommonly used sensors are temperature sensors, humidity sensor,\

    \ by reducing storage cost [42]. Moreover, it is a diﬃcult task to\nmake the direct\
    \ use of raw agricultural data for decision making on the basis of farmers’ technical\n\
    expertise. In contrast, agricultural experts can also give suggestions and make\
    \ accurate judgments\nbased on quantitative analysis. Therefore, only cloud computing\
    \ provides an intelligent and secure\nplatform for monitoring crop [128] Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology losses related\
    \ to\ninternet connectivity and low power. Edge computing is one of the new computing\
    \ models that\nperform the calculations at the edge of the network. This platform\
    \ also reduces the computational\nload by improving data transmission speed and\
    \ protects agricultural data because processing in edge\ncomputing occurs more\
    \ compared to cloud computing [76,129].\nData processing consists of audio, video,\
    \ text image processing, and many other processing\ntechniques. These features\
    \ may be added or removed according to the system requirements.\nData visualization\
    \ is one of the most visible components in the IoT agricultural ﬁeld, which consists\n\
    of monitoring, controlling, and tracking/tracing. The monitoring function includes\
    \ environmental\nconditions monitoring, crop and plants growth monitoring, disease\
    \ monitoring, soil monitoring, and\nanimal health monitoring. The controlling\
    \ function controls the diﬀerent agricultural parameters such as\npest, fertilization,\
    \ and greenhouse illumination control. Moreover the tracking/tracing sub-component\n\
    tracks the animals and ﬁeld location. The whole monitoring, controlling, and tracking\
    \ process is\ncontrolled is through a controller and managed through the system\
    \ management component.\nThe system management component includes various kinds\
    \ of actuators, sensors, microcontrollers,\nand drone controllers. The most commonly\
    \ used sensors/devices are environmental conditions\nmonitoring sensors, crop/plant\
    \ monitoring sensors, and animal health monitoring sensors/devices.\nThese sensors\
    \ collect information about diﬀerent agricultural variables, and this collected\
    \ information\nis processed through embedded devices to make the proper analysis\
    \ for smart farming.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n30 of 41\n5.3. State-of-the-Art\
    \ IoT Agricultural Solutions in the Market\nAccording to the report of Finistere\
    \ Ventures, more than 2 billion dollars have been invested\naround the globe in\
    \ AgTech, which is expected to increase in the coming years [130]. As IoT is gaining\n\
    is importance in diﬀerent applications of smart farming, almost all of the top\
    \ technology ﬁrms are\ninvesting and supporting this technology in their own way\
    \ to develop innovation in the agriculture\nﬁeld. Table 10 represents the diﬀerent\
    \ IoT agricultural solutions proposed by the top technologies ﬁrms.\nTable 10.\
    \ Available solutions and initiatives regarding IoT in agriculture.\nIndustries\n\
    Initiatives and Solutions\nSamsung\nSamsung takes the initiative in the ﬁeld of\
    \ IoT by providing its Samsung Data Systems\n(SDS) IoT Platform, which connects\
    \ the multiple IoT devices and communication protocols\nsuch as Modbus, Zigbee,\
    \ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), MQTT, and LoRaWAN [131].\nAeroFarms\nAeroFarms provides\
    \ indoor farming solutions by analyzing data related to plants into data\nthrough\
    \ big data, imaging, and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies [132].\nMicrosoft\n\
    Microsoft also works on data-driven farming techniques by resolving the issues\
    \ from cloud\nto sensor [133]. The Bosch technology ﬁrm provides diﬀerent sensors\
    \ analytics techniques\nand IoT-based data management techniques to monitor the\
    \ crop productivity and\ndiseases [134].\nR- Style Lab\nR- Style Lab is the top\
    \ IoT software-providing company that oﬀers multiple software\nsolutions such\
    \ as predictive maintenance, drone’s inspections, and crop/animal monitoring\n\
    solutions, and it provides some embedded software that can easily be integrated\
    \ into\nportable trackers [135,136].\nIBM\nIBM has provide an AI-based service\
    \ called Watson Decision, which is best solution to\nimprove the sustainability,\
    \ harvesting, and quality of smart farming by using IoT and AI\ntechnologies [137].\n\
    Intel\nIntel has been developed an IoT-based platform Inﬁswift, which helps increase\
    \ the\neﬃciency of agricultural solutions through advanced connected services\
    \ [138].\nGoogle\nGoogle has suggested a vision for advanced agricultural solutions\
    \ by joining the MIT\nMedia Lab Open Agriculture Initiative to provide a healthier\
    \ food system [139].\n6. Open Issues and Challenges\nThere are many open issues\
    \ and challenges that are associated with the implementation of\nIoT applications.\
    \ Some of the challenges that are identiﬁed from the literature have been discussed\
    \ in\nthis section.\n6.1. Security\nSecurity issues arise at a diﬀerent level\
    \ of IoT-based agricultural systems, which need to be\naddressed. Due to low security,\
    \ users face many diﬃculties such as loss of data and other on-ﬁeld\nparameters.\
    \ IoT privacy and security issues have been discussed in [140–142] broadly. In\
    \ the agriculture\nﬁeld, IoT devices are at risk due to physical interference\
    \ such as attack by animals and predators or\nmodiﬁcation in physical address\
    \ [142,143]. Moreover, due to low energy consumption and limited\nmemory, it is\
    \ hard to implement sophisticated and complex algorithms. The precision farming\
    \ services\nsuch as IoT-enabled location information and location-based services\
    \ are exposed to hackers that\nmay use this information for device capturing [141,142,144].\
    \ Attackers attack the IoT device and\ntake out cryptographic implementations.\
    \ Other communication layers also undergo some vulnerable\ndenial-of-service (DoS)\
    \ attacks and wireless signal blocking [142]. Major security threats to the cloud\n\
    infrastructure are hijacking attacks, session hijacking, database issues, and\
    \ denial of service attack [142].\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n31 of 41\n6.2. Cost\n\
    While deploying IoT in agriculture, several cost-related issues arise such as\
    \ setup and running\ncosts. The setup costs consist of hardware costs such as\
    \ IoT devices/sensors, base station infrastructure,\nand gateways. Moreover, running\
    \ costs includes an uninterrupted subscription for the management of\nIoT devices,\
    \ the exchange of information among other services, and centralized services that\
    \ provide\ninformation/data collection [47].\n6.3. Lack Knowledge of Technology\n\
    Poor understanding of technology is the main barrier among the farmers who are\
    \ living in rural\nareas. This problem is common in developing countries, where\
    \ most farmers are uneducated [145].\nThe implementation of IoT in agriculture\
    \ is a big challenge, because a lot of investment is required in\nfarmer’s training\
    \ before deploying IoT infrastructure.\n6.4. Reliability\nIn the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ IoT devices are deployed in an open environment due to which harsh\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions may cause communication failure and the humiliation of deployed sensors.\n\
    Therefore, it is important to ensure the physical safety of deployed IoT devices/sensors\
    \ to protect them\nfrom severe climate conditions [146].\n6.5. Scalability\nA\
    \ large number of IoT devices and sensors are deployed in the agriculture ﬁeld,\
    \ due to which an\nintelligent IoT management system is required for the identiﬁcation\
    \ and controlling of each node [147].\n6.6. Localization\nThere are many factors\
    \ that need to be considered while deploying devices/sensors. Such devices\nshould\
    \ have the ability to provide functionality and support to the rest of the world\
    \ without deploying\nadditional devices with overhead conﬁguration [148].\nMoreover,\
    \ it is important to select the\nbest deployment position so that devices can\
    \ communicate and exchange information without\nany interference.\n6.7. Interoperability\n\
    There are billions of IoT devices, standards, and protocols that are needed to\
    \ interoperate.\nInteroperability involves semantic, syntactic, technical, and\
    \ organizational policy. Semantic interoperability\nis the ability to deal with\
    \ the interpretation of content exchanged among humans. Syntactical interoperability\n\
    is related to data formats, such as java script object notation (JSON), data interchanged\
    \ electronically,\nextensible markup language (XML), and variables separated by\
    \ a comma. Technical interoperability\nis associated with the development of infrastructure,\
    \ protocols, and hardware/software components\nthat enable the IoT devices’ communication.\
    \ Organizational interoperability is related to policies for\ncommunicating and\
    \ transferring data effectively across the different geographic regions and infrastructure.\n\
    Whereas, in [149], three methods have been proposed through which interoperability\
    \ can also be obtained,\nwhich are (i) two standards open and close, (ii) partnership\
    \ among services and product developers, and\n(iii) mediator and adaptors services.\
    \ More research work is expected to obtain a high interoperability\namong multiple\
    \ IoT devices.\n7. Integration Challenges of IoT and Cloud Computing in Agriculture\n\
    The aim of the cloud-based IoT paradigm is to analyze and integrate the data that\
    \ is coming from\nthe real world into IoT objects. This paradigm requires interacting\
    \ with millions of end devices that\nare thoroughly distributed [110]. Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology loss related\
    \ to internet\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n32 of 41\nconnectivity, low-power communication\
    \ devices, and many other integration challenges. Moreover,\nthe monitoring and\
    \ controlling processes have made the data sharing of IoT devices more diﬃcult,\n\
    because IoT communication devices face connectivity issues and latency problems\
    \ [111]. Some of the\nnetworking challenges that users face while assessing and\
    \ uploading the information on cloud are\ngiven in Table 11.\nTable 11. Mapping\
    \ problems and solutions regarding IoT and cloud computing integration.\nYear\n\
    Reference\nProblems\nSolutions\n2016\n[150]\nIt has become very diﬃcult to handle\
    \ the\ndata-generating devices and\npower-constrained sensors, in order to\nobtain\
    \ the more valuable services.\nThe cloud of things (CoTs) solution has been\n\
    presented to handle the increasing demand of\ndata-generating devices and other\n\
    communication resources underlying the\nWSNs.\n2016\n[151]\nIoT consist of millions\
    \ of interconnected\ndevices such as WSAN, RFID etc. in\norder to exchange the\
    \ agricultural\ninformation; therefore, cloud computing\ntechnology is necessary\
    \ due to the\nconnectivity limitations in this ﬁeld.\nAuthors presented a survey\
    \ on cloud\ninfrastructures, cloud platforms, and\nIoT middleware for the integration\
    \ of devices\nand communication protocols.\n2013\n[152]\nDue to the adaptation\
    \ of a large number\nof wireless technologies, IoT has stepped\nout to create\
    \ a fully integrated future\nnetwork.\nImplemented cloud solutions by using Aneka,\n\
    which is a centric vision for the convergence\nof internet, WSN, and distributed\
    \ computing.\n2013\n[153]\nThe integration of IoT and cloud\ncomputing has become\
    \ a primary need\nover the last few years to manage\ndiﬀerent power connectivity\
    \ issues.\nThe author designed a framework to procure\ndata from decentralized,\
    \ heterogeneous,\nhighly distributed, and virtual devices that\ncan be controlled,\
    \ analyzed, and managed\nautomatically.\n2014\n[154]\nThe IoT has become more\
    \ persistent due\nto which its integration with cloud\ncomputing is very important.\n\
    The integration of both technologies is not\nsimple, because diﬀerent key issues\
    \ occur\nthat people face while accessing the\ncommunication network to retrieve\
    \ or upload\ninformation to the cloud. A survey has been\npresented that highlights\
    \ the main challenges\nand provides their respective solutions.\n8. Threats to\
    \ Validity\nThere have been four kinds of threats to validity identiﬁed in this\
    \ section.\n8.1. Construct Validity\nIn the SLR, construct validity threats are\
    \ relevant to the classiﬁcation of selected studies [147,148].\nSearch keywords\
    \ have been proposed and identiﬁed by two authors, and seven terms related to\n\
    IoT agriculture have been used in the search string. However, the list is not\
    \ complete; some alternative\nand additional terms may alter the list of ﬁnal\
    \ selected papers [84]. A search string was performed\nby using IEEE Xplore, Science\
    \ Direct, Springer, MDPI, and IGI Global. According to the statistics\nof the\
    \ search engines, we have found most of the research papers related to IoT agriculture\
    \ in these\nelectronics libraries. To mitigate the risk of missing essential and\
    \ related publications, we have sought\nout the related papers in major IoT agriculture\
    \ research venues. Although the standard of the primary\nstudies decreased by\
    \ including publications that are not from top journals and conferences, it indicates\n\
    that the studies relevant to IoT have increased.\n8.2. Internal Validity\nThis\
    \ type of validity handles the extraction data analysis process, in which two\
    \ authors have\nidentiﬁed the classiﬁcation of selected papers and the data extraction\
    \ process, whereas one author\nreviewed the ﬁnal results. Data collection and\
    \ paper classiﬁcation have been made on the judgment of\nElectronics 2020, 9,\
    \ 319\n33 of 41\ntwo authors. The kappa coeﬃcient value was 0.91, which indicates\
    \ that there has been a high level of\nagreement among the authors and reduces\
    \ the dissimilarity threats signiﬁcantly by showing a similar\nunderstanding of\
    \ relevance.\n8.3. External Validity\nExternal validity is related to the generalization\
    \ of this study. The mapping results have been\nconsidered regarding the IoT domain,\
    \ and the validity of the results presented in this paper concerns\nonly the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain. The classiﬁcation of the papers and search string presented\
    \ in this\nresearch may help the practitioners as a starting point for IoT agriculture\
    \ research, and researchers can\ncategorize the addition studies accordingly.\n\
    8.4. Conclusion Validity\nThe conclusion validity threat is related to the identiﬁcation\
    \ of improper relationships that may\ngenerate an incorrect conclusion. In the\
    \ mapping study, a conclusion validity threat refers to the\ndiﬀerent elements\
    \ such as incorrect data extraction and missing studies. To decrease this threat,\
    \ the\ndata extraction and selection process have been clearly deﬁned in the previous\
    \ paragraph on internal\nvalidity. The traceability among the extracted data and\
    \ the conclusion has been strengthened through\nthe direct generation of frequency\
    \ plots and bubble plots generated from the collected data by applying\nstatistical\
    \ analysis.\n9. Conclusions\nThis article has presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that presents a discussion on selective\nhigh-quality research articles\
    \ published in the domain of IoT-based agriculture. The survey has\nbeen conducted\
    \ by employing a systematic methodology to select 67 studies. Thereafter, an analysis\n\
    of diﬀerent IoT agriculture applications, sensors/devices, and communication protocols\
    \ has been\npresented. The most promising fact is that this area of research is\
    \ being patronized by the governments\nof various countries, and many countries\
    \ have their IoT agriculture policies. Apart from this, all\nthe major components\
    \ of IoT-based agriculture have been contextualized in a framework. Lastly,\n\
    the promising future directions have been discussed for the researchers working\
    \ in the domain of\nIoT-based agriculture.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    81 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Smart cities have brought significant improvements
    in quality of life and services to citizens and urban environments. They are fully
    enabled to control the physical objects in real time and provide intelligent information
    to citizens in terms of transport, healthcare, smart buildings, public safety,
    smart parking, and traffic system and smart agriculture, and so on. The applications
    of smart cities are able to collect sensitive information. However, various security
    and privacy issues may arise at different levels of the architecture. Therefore,
    it is important to be aware of these security and privacy issues while designing
    and implementing the applications. This paper highlights main applications of
    smart cities and addresses the major privacy and security issues in the architecture
    of the smart cities'' applications. It also reviews some of the current solutions
    regarding the security and privacy of information-centric smart cities'' applications
    and presents future research challenges that still need to be considered for performance
    improvement. 1 INTRODUCTION In recent decades, the population of urban areas is
    rapidly increasing. Based on a report from the United Nations Population Fund,
    more than 50% of population in the world inhabit urban environments.1 The concept
    of “smart city”2 has attracted too much attention by both academia and industry
    due to its strong requirements and practical background in an urbanized environment.
    Several cities have begun to develop their own strategies toward the concept of
    smart cities to enhance the quality of life and provide better services to citizens.
    Many countries with growing population are spending a vast amount of money on
    smart cities-related projects. For example, China is working on more than 200
    projects toward smart cities paradigm.3 Smart cities-related technologies are
    enabling the urban municipals to manage their everyday operations to make people''s
    life easier. Smart cities'' infrastructure includes many devices and interconnected
    systems to benefit people in a variety of applications such as smart healthcare,
    smart transportation, smart parking, smart traffic system, smart agriculture,
    and smart homes to just name a few. Information-centric networking (ICN) is a
    networking paradigm, which is able to maintain packet delivery in unreliable environments.
    Therefore, ICN can be considered as an alternative for the IP-based networks in
    smart cities.4 The integration of various low-cost smart devices such as sensors
    and actuators, and the rapid development of wireless communication technologies
    enabling small and low-cost objects to connect to the internet has resulted in
    the rise in the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) where physical objects
    are changing to smart objects in everyday life. Besides IP-based approaches such
    as the one presented in the work of Sheng et al,5 ICN solutions can be applied
    to develop the emergence of IoT and its related applications. Information-centric
    networking is characterized as a concept to name content and locate information
    at the center of the architecture6 rather than depending on the IP host identifiers.
    The principal idea is to completely change the internet to a more generic and
    simpler architecture.7 ICN can support various IoT scenarios and overcome their
    current limitations by utilizing its advantages to deploy various applications
    in heterogeneous environments such as smart homes and smart cities.8 It can also
    be used as a framework to connect different objects with sensing capabilities
    to provide multiple services in the IoT environments. Moreover, the use of ICN
    can reduce the energy consumption in the IoT era.9 Cities are being smart and
    this may cause people to face huge security and privacy risks.10 This is because
    of the nature of resource-constrained devices, which makes the smart city vulnerable
    to different security attacks.11 These vulnerabilities may cause several cyberattacks
    in smart cities. For instance, malicious attackers may produce false data during
    the manipulation of sensing data, which results in the loss of control over the
    highly intelligent systems.10 In 2015, 230 000 people in Ukraine suffered a major
    breakdown of electricity due to the attack of hackers to the smart grid (SG),
    which happened to the people in the form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack.1 Many
    resource-constrained devices such sensors and cameras, which are collecting and
    sharing sensitive data in smart cities, can also be vulnerable to attacks by the
    malicious hackers threatening the security and privacy of people in smart cities.
    Due to these cyberattacks, home area information that is collected and controlled
    through smart homes can provide a way to reveal people''s lifestyle in terms of
    privacy and even result in economic loss.10 According to a report, the market
    of smart cities is expected to gradually increase to $1.5 trillion by 2020.12
    Actually, governments are responsible to attract large investments to fulfill
    the vision of smart cities.13 This huge improvement includes deployment of thousands
    of sensor nodes in the city to provide real-time information to people about different
    services such as public transportation, traffic flows, the quality of water and
    air, and the energy consumption rate, to just name a few.14 However, processing
    and analyzing the vast amount of sensitive data generate a number of security
    and privacy challenges and concerns regarding how to protect the sensitive data
    in the presence of unauthorized parties.10, 15 In the IoT era and smart cities,
    cloud computing can provide cost-effective services for data processing and storage.
    However, there are some issues in cloud-based IoT applications such as lack of
    mobility support, location awareness, latency, and security, which can be resolved
    by fog computing paradigm.16, 17 Fog computing addresses these challenges by providing
    computing services to the users at the edge of the network, which, in turn, reduces
    latency and enhances the quality of service.18 However, security and privacy are
    challenging issues in fog computing due to the differences in fog computing and
    cloud computing which make the security solutions for cloud services not suitable
    for fog computing services available to the users. Various cryptographic techniques
    can deal with security attacks. However, these techniques are not appropriate
    for resource-constraint IoT devices in smart cities. One solution in this regard
    can be offloading additional operations related to security to a fog-based node,
    which can enable security and data analysis directly at the edge of the network.19
    In addition, in publish and subscribe systems, which spread data from publisher
    to subscriber, publication is disseminated using a set of brokers, which can collect
    sensitive information of the users. In this regard, the system must ensure confidentiality
    of the publications and subscriptions while brokers are trying to have access
    to publications'' tags and interests of subscribers.20 According to a definition
    by IBM, the concept of smart city is based on three main characteristics called
    “instrumented,” “interconnected,” and “intelligent,”21 which are shown in Figure
    1. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Main characteristics of smart cities
    Instrumented: This characteristic means a city, which is covered with a group
    of devices such as sensors and actuators. Therefore, the core systems of the cities
    have access to reliable and real-time information using these devices. Interconnected:
    It means that smart city has a huge set of systems that are cooperating to provide
    information from various locations and sources. It is then possible to create
    a link from the physical world to the real world by using an accurate combination
    of interconnected and instrumented systems. Intelligent: It refers to an instrumented
    and interconnected environment that utilizes the information obtained from various
    systems and devices such as sensors to improve the quality of life of the citizens.
    1.1 Comparison to similar surveys In spite of the aforementioned benefits of smart
    cities, several security and privacy concerns are arising due to the large number
    of wirelessly connected sensors and cameras which are collecting and sending data
    to base stations and other internet devices used to process data. All these devices
    are generating sensitive data over different networks. Data is the most precious
    asset of people in today''s smart world. All data is handled by software and hardware
    that have some security and privacy issues such as the vulnerabilities in infrastructures,
    and cyberattacks (eg, DoS attacks). Due to these security issues, the performance
    of highly innovative systems can degrade in the form of services. It is important
    to overcome these security challenges to make the future of the highly advanced
    system more secure and beneficial for the users.22 There are several published
    survey papers related to the security and privacy of IoT and smart cities. For
    example, in the work of Zhang et al,10 security and privacy in smart cities''
    promising applications were investigated. The authors also discussed several security
    and privacy challenges in these applications. In the work of Gharaibeh et al,23
    the authors identified the techniques used for data security and privacy and discussed
    the technologies that make smart cities a reality. The study in the work of Eckhoff
    and Wagner24 discussed different privacy types, attackers, and the required sources
    for the attacks in smart cities. The authors also reviewed the current privacy-improving
    techniques and various types of citizens'' privacy in smart cities. Similarly,
    the main research challenges and the current security solutions in the IoT environments
    were presented in the work of Sicari et al.25 Our contributions in this study
    relative to the recent literature can be summarized as follows. This paper highlights
    main applications of smart cities and addresses the major privacy and security
    issues in the architecture of the smart cities'' applications. We provide a number
    of solutions to deal with critical threats regarding the security and privacy
    in smart environments. We also propose a secure IoT architecture for the smart
    cities. Security and privacy techniques dealing with the process of developing
    secure systems are also discussed in the manuscript. Finally, we provide some
    open research issues and challenges that should be taken into account regarding
    the improvements of the smart cities in terms of security and privacy. The remainder
    of this article is organized as follows. Section 3 presents an IoT-based architecture
    that focuses on the security and privacy issues in smart cities. Some typical
    applications of smart cities are outlined in Section 10. Sections 17 and 22 discuss
    a number of security and privacy issues and solutions in smart cities'' environment,
    respectively. The general requirements regarding the security and privacy challenges
    for smart cities'' services are presented in Section 28. Section 36 proposes a
    secure IoT-based architecture for smart cities. Section 41 discusses some open
    research issues and provides future research directions. Finally, Section 49 concludes

    In this section, we provide an IoT-based architecture that emphasizes on the security
    and privacy issues in smart cities. This architecture is built upon the architecture
    proposed in26 and is shown in Figure 2. A brief discussion of each layer of the
    architecture is provided in the following sections. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint An overview of the Internet of Things–based architecture for smart
    cities 2.1 Physical layer Physical layer is also known as perception layer or
    lower layer of the architecture. This layer contains heterogeneous devices (eg,
    sensors and actuators) that collect information and send it to the upper layer
    of the architecture called network layer for further processing. 2.2 Network layer
    Network layer is also known as communication layer, which is the core layer of
    the IoT-based architecture. This layer is dependent on basic networks such as
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the internet, and communication networks.
    The main responsibility of the network layer is to transmit the collected data
    by the physical layer and to connect together various devices of the network such
    as servers and smart things. 2.3 Database layer Database layer is also known as
    support layer and it operates closely with the upper layers of the architecture.
    It consists of database servers and intelligent computing systems. The main responsibility
    of this layer is to provide support for application requirements through intelligent
    computing approaches such as cloud/edge computing. 2.4 Virtualization layer This
    layer provides a mechanism called virtual network to integrate hardware/software
    and network functionality into a single software-based entity that is configured
    logically. A network virtualization27 may need platform virtualization together
    with resource virtualization to be successful. This is obtained using the virtualization
    layer. 2.5 Data analytics and mining layer In data analytics and mining layer,
    raw data is converted into valuable information, which can help improve the efficiency
    of the network and predict the future events such as failure in the system. This
    layer employs various data mining and data analytics techniques such as machine
    learning (ML) algorithms to analyze the data. 2.6 Application layer This is the
    top layer of the secure IoT-based architecture and is responsible to provide intelligent
    and smart applications and services to the users based on their individual requirements.
    Some typical ones of these applications are briefly described in the following
    section. 3 APPLICATIONS OF SMART CITIES Various applications of smart cities have
    been emerged to monitor the physical world. These applications are able to sense
    and collect information through thousands of smart devices (eg, sensors) via internet
    to make people''s lives much easier and effective in different aspects like environment,
    energy, transportation, safety, healthcare, parking, and traffic systems. In the
    following sections, we describe some typical ones on these applications. 3.1 Smart
    grid Smart grid is the next generation of the electric grid and has been often
    used to refer to applications of power grid such as the peer-to-peer (energy trading.28
    Smart grid is a data communication network, which provides a smart approach to
    integrate conventional power generation, energy storage, transmission and distribution,
    and demand management to enhance reliability and provide higher operational efficiency
    and better power quality.29 Smart grid is an intelligent monitoring system that
    control the electricity flowing via the grid system. This uses devices that have
    the capability of bidirectional communication to measure and sense production
    and consumption of electricity. It then sends the information to the operators
    and users and automated devices for monitoring and making decision regarding any
    changes in the condition of the electricity grid.30 3.2 Smart transportation The
    aim of smart or intelligent transportation is to provide a smarter use of transport
    system such as the infrastructure for electronic vehicles charging.31, 32 Smart
    transportation consists of intelligent networks that can serve people by improving
    safety, reliability, and speed.33 By using smart applications such as transport-oriented
    smartphones, people can easily search the fastest and the most economic routes,
    schedule their visits, and easily find the location of buses and trains. Smart
    transportation also facilitates car-parking searching and license recognition
    systems.34 3.3 Smart environment Smart environment can have significant contribution
    toward the building of sustainable societies for smart cities. By using technical
    management devices, smart cities are able to monitor air quality, traffic congestion,
    and energy consumption, and to enhance waste and pollution efficiency.35 Moreover,
    smart environment can monitor greenhouse gases, forest condition, city noise,
    etc, to entail the sustainable and intelligent development. It may also be possible
    to forecast and discover disasters in the future by using environmental WSNs.36
    3.4 Smart living Smart living provides intelligent management of different home
    appliances to enhance energy efficiency and provide convenient home.37 It can
    also support remote monitoring of home appliances, energy savings, education,
    and entertainment. In addition, the applications of smart living can also manage
    the process of waste recycling and parking to provide a smart building with convenient
    life and great experience and sustainable energy and environments for the residents.10
    3.5 Smart health In smart cities, the concept of smart health is to provide the
    health services by using networks and sensing infrastructures of smart cities.38
    Intelligent healthcare system (IHS) provides health monitoring and proper diagnosis
    to the people in smart cities.39 The health conditions of the people can be timely
    monitored by using medical sensors and wearable devices.40 The health data can
    then be forwarded to the processing unit for further diagnosis of the doctors.
    Moreover, the complete health-related information of the patients can easily be
    accessed through a database, which, in turn, increases the possibility of diagnosing
    infectious or chronic illnesses in the early stage.10 3.6 Smart energy In smart
    cities, sensor nodes are widely deployed to monitor energy generation and consumption.
    In this regard, smart energy41 leveraging SG and electronic vehicles charging
    can reduce the energy consumption and stop the failure of the electricity supply
    in power grid and individual energy usage.10 4 SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES IN
    SMART CITIES'' APPLICATIONS Recently, significant problems have been occurred
    in various application scenarios. For instance, in SGs, the smart metering infrastructure
    can control the private lives of the citizens such as their working hours in smart
    cities.42 Furthermore, in smart homes and healthcare context, service providers
    and device manufacturers can have access to sensitive information of the users.43
    Moreover, smart mobility applications can collect huge amount of information related
    to trajectory of a user, which can be used to predict the mobility pattern and
    location of the user.44 In addition to these problems, security and privacy have
    become a major challenge in smart cities-related applications since cities are
    focusing to become smarter. In recent decades, several security and privacy issues
    have been found in various smart cities–related applications.1 In the following
    sections, we list and briefly discuss some majors ones of these security issues.
    4.1 Cyber security Cyberattacks compromise security of smart cities'' applications
    and are mainly of two types: active attack and passive attack. The aim of passive
    attack is to learn and use different information of the system without any changes
    in resources of the system. The main target of this attack is “transmitted information”
    for the purpose of learning the configuration and behavior of the system and its
    architecture. It is hard to detect these attacks because the data is not modified.
    That is why it is better to focus more on the prevention of such attacks. On the
    other hand, the active attacks are scheduled to produce an effect or change in
    the operation of the system using data modification or adding incorrect data into
    the system. Sabotage, manipulation, and espionage are the main reasons behind
    cyberattacks.45 The main cyberattacks, which may occur in various smart cities''
    application, are briefly described in this section as follows.46 Denial of service:
    Denial of service can also be called “availability attack.” The main purpose of
    DoS attack is to suspend the communication of the system. To do so, attacker can
    disable the physical components access through the excessive messages on the communication
    network, which prevents the normal operation of the system. The DoS attacks are
    a type of attacks, which can destroy the availability of the targeted system in
    smart cities. This type of attacks can be classified into network layer and application
    layer DoS attacks.47 Network layer DoS attacks are performed at the network layer
    and they try to overwhelm the resources of the network of the targeted system
    with bandwidth consuming attacks such as user datagram protocol flooding attacks.
    The application layer DoS attacks, on the other hand, utilizes the special characteristics
    of the application layer protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol and voice
    over IP to affect on the resources.48 In smart cities, the impacts of both types
    of DoS attacks on any system that provides centralized monitoring in these areas
    can be extremely bad since the unavailability of the system would result in total
    chaos in the cities.49 Malware: This is a malicious software that can gain illegal
    access to the system. It can also use internal weaknesses of the system aiming
    to steal, change, and ruin physical system components and related information.
    For example, smart cities may contain several closed-circuit television cameras
    controlled either privately or by public authorities. The security of these cameras
    is a challenging task as some of them lack encryption algorithms and others are
    vulnerable to attack by malware.50 Accessing a camera can provide a way to view
    individual''s homes or use a bank camera to control and view the digits being
    pressed by the users. Eavesdropping: This is an instance of a passive attack,
    which is defined as an illegal listening to a communication without the permission
    of the communication''s parties. Eavesdropping is a dangerous attack in smart
    cities that results in break down the confidentiality and integrity of the network
    and can lead to personal and financial failures.51 It can be used to spy on communication
    channels to capture the behavior of the network traffic and obtain the network
    map. Masquerading: It is also known as “impersonation” or “identity spoofing.”
    In masquerading, the attacker tries to steal information by pretending to be a
    legal device or entity. For example, in intelligent transport system (ITS) as
    an application of smart cities, masquerading can provide unauthorized access to
    restricted information, which may ruin the integrity of the network. It may also
    result is loss, corruption, and manipulation of information in ITS.52 False information
    (FI): Attackers transmit erroneous amount of FI in the network, which might affect
    the behavior of other drivers. It can be both intentional and unintentional. Introducing
    FI on the systems in smart cities may result in delays and unnecessary congestions
    as people act based on the FI provided to them. Message modification: In this
    attack, the message is modified to make an unexpected behavior happens in the
    system. Message modification may also include reordering a stream of message and/or
    message delay. Similar to FI, message modification can cause unnecessary congestions
    and delays in the systems and threaten data integrity. As a result, threat to
    data integrity may harm people and infrastructures of smart cities.53 Traffic
    analysis (TA): Traffic analysis is similar to eavesdropping but here, rather than
    content analysis, attackers monitor the traffic pattern and obtain useful information
    from it. Combining TA with eavesdropping may damage privacy. In addition, obtaining
    illegal information from TA attacks can harm confidentiality of information in
    smart cities. Summary of the cybersecurity attacks, which may occur in smart cities,
    is presented in Figure 3. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Summary of
    the cybersecurity attacks in smart cities 4.2 Botnet activities in IoT-based smart
    cities Botnets are one of the latest issues which have recently posed serious
    risks to IoT-based systems. An example of such botnets would be Mirai botnet,
    which modifies or destroys information on various devices such as routers, webcams,
    IP cameras, and printers and send the infection to various IoT devices. This may
    finally result in a distributed DoS attack against the target servers.54 The IoT
    devices are usually designed with almost no security compared to other smart devices
    such as smart phones and computers. This danger was not recognized until 2016;
    therefore, more research is required to overcome this threat in the future. Otherwise,
    this attack will damage the IoT ecosystem.55 An approach to prevent such attacks
    was presented in the work of Ghafir et al.56 The authors proposed an approach
    called BotDet for botnet command and control traffic detection to protect critical
    systems against malware attacks. They developed four detection modules to discover
    various techniques utilized in botnet command/control communications and designed
    a system for alert correlation according to the voting between the detection modules.
    The results reveal the capability of real-time detection in the approach and show
    that the proposed system balances the false- and true-positive rates with more
    that 13% and 82%, respectively. 4.3 Threats of unmanned autonomous vehicles in
    smart cities Driverless cars or autonomous vehicles are a type of car that drive
    itself without the human involvement using various in-vehicle technologies and
    devices such as sensors, global positioning system and antilock braking system,
    etc. Autonomous vehicles have gained too much attention toward the building of
    a smarter society with the goal of reducing the ratio of traffic accidents. Despite
    all the benefits of this growing application, there are major security and privacy
    risks once it is hacked, because it will then threaten data privacy and life safety
    of the citizens in smart cities.57 Particularly, hackers can use the security
    bugs to control the vehicle to shut down the engine or apply the brakes in various
    situations. Moreover, the huge amount of personal data obtained from the computer
    system of an autonomous vehicle may cause crucial security and privacy issues.
    4.4 Privacy leakage Attackers can collect, transmit, and process private information
    such as health conditions, identity and location of the users in transportation
    context, and lifestyle derived from the intelligent surveillance systems. This,
    in turn, makes the smart cities vulnerable to privacy leakage. To overcome this
    issue, a number of security and privacy solutions (eg, anonymity, access control,
    and encryption) can be employed to save sensitive information in smart cities
    against the attacks of hackers.58, 59 However, most of the existing security and
    privacy techniques are designed only against outside attackers and do not consider
    the role of potential inside attackers.59 For example, a smart building may use
    a surveillance camera to discover robbery or unusual activities. Attackers from
    inside the building (eg, employees or those who have access the surveillance records)
    may steal private data or provide a gap for attackers outside the building. Therefore,
    it is a challenging task to develop a security and privacy mechanism in smart
    cities to have a balance between privacy and efficiency. 5 SECURITY AND PRIVACY
    SOLUTIONS FOR SMART CITIES'' ENVIRONMENT In this section, a number of security
    and privacy solutions are introduced which are utilized to deal with critical
    threats regarding the security and privacy in smart environments. 5.1 Blockchain
    Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed, centralized, and public decentralized
    technique that is used to store transactions, sales, agreements, and contracts
    across many computers.11 Blockchain is basically a chain of blocks, where digital
    information is stored in a public database. It is specially developed for cryptocurrency
    such as bitcoin and litecoin. Blockchain technology has gained more attraction
    in recent years. The comprehensive survey in the work of Christidis and Devetsikiotis60
    verified the reliability of utilizing this technology in IoT environments and
    reveals its significance in the developing IoT ecosystems. The main reason behind
    the success and importance of blockchain technology in IoT applications is its
    decentralized feature, which enables various applications to work in a distributed
    manner. For instance, in the work of Biswas and Muthukkumarasamy,11 the authors
    proposed a security framework based on the blockchain technology that can secure
    the communication of different devices in smart cities and enhance the effectiveness
    and reliability of the system. Moreover, a new security framework is developed
    by the integration of blockchain technology into a smart home to improve integrity,
    confidentiality, and availability.61 Similarly, security and privacy issues in
    vehicular communications were addressed using blockchain technology in the work
    of Lei et al.62 In the work of Zyskind et al,63 the authors proposed a personal
    data management system that integrates blockchain technology with off-blockchain
    storage solution so that the users are aware of the collected data by the providers.
    Fu et al64 proposed an auditing system based on blockchain for shared data in
    cloud-based applications. They presented an approach where a number of entities
    should collaborate to get back the identity of a malicious user. Based on the
    proposed blockchain-based architecture, data changes can be traced and correct
    data blocks can be recovered when the data are damaged. In addition, various design
    requirements of solutions based on blockchain technology for data origin tracking
    were discussed in the work of Neisse et al.65 The authors presented the assessment
    of their implementation results to provide a complete overview of various specified
    approaches. In the work of Laurent et al,66 a blockchain-based access control
    was presented that allows owners of data to specify access rights for the data
    sources on remote servers and change the privileges when required. This approach
    provides an authenticated access control managed by blockchain technology that
    ensures the preservation of users'' privacy. Furthermore, blockchain technology
    can provide robust solutions and secure smart cities from cyberattacks. For example,
    blockchain-based digital smart ID can be assigned to everyone and everything to
    provide authentication and authorization for people and connected devices within
    smart cities'' network. 5.2 Cryptography Algorithms utilizing cryptography techniques
    are the backbone of the security and privacy protection in information-centric
    smart cities'' applications since they prevent the access of unauthorized parties
    during the data storing, transmitting and processing. The existing cryptographic
    tools utilized in smart cities'' applications are discussed in this section. Traditional
    encryption algorithms and standards are not fully appropriate for resource-constrained
    smart devices due to the energy consumption and computational complexity.67 Therefore,
    it is a basic requirement to use lightweight encryption for utilizing cryptographic
    algorithms in practice. For instance, in the work of Mahmood et al,68 the authors
    proposed a mechanism for IoT-based scenarios that can secure end-to-end communications
    of the users from distributed DoS attacks. Moreover, a lightweight authentication
    protocol was developed in the work of Li et al69 to secure smart cities'' applications
    by using a public key encryption strategy. In addition, homomorphic encryption
    has recently attracted too much attention due to its strength and capability on
    computations of encrypted data. For instance, homomorphic encryption can be utilized
    for the protection of electricity consumption in SG systems70 and for solving
    security and privacy issues in cloud computing.71 It can also be used to protect
    security and privacy in healthcare monitoring systems.72 Moreover, cryptography
    approaches can be considered as one of the most convenient and effective techniques
    to provide security for cloud-based data as they significantly improve the security
    and privacy of data particularly in public cloud environment.73 In addition, cryptographic
    techniques support well-known privacy preservation algorithms and are able to
    offer very precise analysis results.73 However, it may also be possible to attack
    cryptographic algorithms with the help of simple power analysis. Attackers may
    control and change the data by intentionally injecting errors trying to have an
    effect on the performance of the device.74 Therefore, it is important to carefully
    conduct research in cryptographic algorithms to ensure the security and privacy
    of the data. In addition, cryptography can be used to solve the problem of privacy
    leakage caused by public access policy.75 For example, Cui et al76 proposed a
    scheme to consider a tradeoff between decryption possibility and the policy privacy
    in which the attribute information in the policy is divided into two parts, ie,
    value and name. In the proposed method, the value attribute is hided in the access
    policy instead of concealing the whole attribute. Therefore, it can protect the
    policy privacy reasonably. 5.3 Biometrics Biometrics are broadly used for authentication
    in IoT-based infrastructures. This technology widely depends on human behavior
    and automatically recognizes a person through bio-data obtained from faces, fingerprints,
    handwritten signatures, voices, etc. One of the most accurate methods, which can
    obtain high accuracy and efficiency, is brainwave-based authentication.77 Similarly,
    a mutual authentication protocol was proposed in the work of Amin et al78 to keep
    safe the private information of the users in storage devices. Please note that
    the risk of privacy leakage would increase if the mentioned bio-based approaches
    are not used properly. For example, in the work of Natgunanathan et al,79 the
    authors reported that it is required to develop privacy-preserving biometric schemes
    similar to the one presented in the work of Wang et al.80 Moreover, they revealed
    that these biometrics have promising use-cases in the future in various applications
    such as e-business. Biometrics can also be used to encrypt communication between
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a base station. For example, the study in
    the work of Singandhupe et al81 proposed a safety mechanism with low-cost resources
    based on biometrics for the UAV if an attack is detected. The authors showed that
    the proposed approach could be applied to any UAV scenario where the cybersecurity
    attacks are an important issue. 5.4 Machine learning and data mining Machine learning
    is a part of artificial intelligence with the goal of developing systems, which
    are able to learn from past experience. According to the current situations, ML
    techniques can be used to enhance the efficiency of intrusion detection systems
    in IoT environments.1 For example, the study in the work of Alsheikh et al82 showed
    the advantages of using ML technologies to provide security in WSNs. Similarly,
    Luo et al83 developed a machine-based approach to improve security of data sensing
    in WSNs. In addition, a novel model utilizing ML algorithms was developed in the
    work of Aminato et al84 to discover attacks in Wi-Fi networks. There are also
    several studies that employed ML technologies to strengthen defense-related strategies.
    For instance, in the work of Shamshirband et al,85 the authors developed a model
    based on game theory and ML technologies to discover and prevent intrusions in
    WSNs. Moreover, the existing studies on biometric security systems from the ML
    point of view was reviewed in the work of Biggio et al.86 In addition, there are
    different ML techniques such as supervised learning and unsupervised leaning that
    can be applied to effectively detect the presence of a botnet.87 However, there
    are still some issues such as real-time monitoring and adaptability to new attacks
    that need to be solved regarding ML-based detection techniques. Data mining is
    another technique that can be applied to handle security and privacy in smart
    cities environments. Tsai et al88 showed that the huge amount of data collected
    by various sensors in smart cities are utilized to mine new information and regulations
    which in turn provides better services to the users. However, using data mining
    techniques may result in some security and privacy concerns regarding the disclosure
    of sensitive information of the users such as their locations. In this regard,
    privacy-preserving data mining techniques can be applied to overcome this problem.89,
    90 5.5 Internet of Things regulations Internet of Things includes a wide range
    of communication technologies such as machine-to-machine communication, sensors,
    wireless communication, and radio frequency identification. However, the IoT industry
    is still not regulated. This has resulted in broader security and privacy implications.
    The use of unsecured smart devices in various industries such as military and
    health, and the fact that IoT devices can be easily hacked has created new attacks,
    which can happen at each layer of the IoT protocol stack.91 While the IoT industry
    has been aware of the issues related to security and privacy, recent cyberattacks
    on IoT devices such as the one presented in the work of Jerkins92 and other similar
    attacks had unintended results of increasing the awareness93 regarding the needs
    of having strong security mechanisms and regulations for the devices that are
    connected to the internet. A Summary of the aforementioned solutions for smart
    cities'' environments is presented in Table 2. TABLE 2. A summary of the security
    and privacy solutions in smart cities'' environments Ref Blockchain Cryptography

    FOR SMART CITIES'' SERVICES In this section, we briefly discuss security and privacy
    techniques dealing with the process of developing secure systems. 6.1 Privacy
    by design This is a strategy trying to fix the security and privacy issues in
    information-centric smart cities.94 This strategy includes some principles that
    should be taken into account while designing a new system.95 For example, there
    should be a proactive privacy protection rather than a post reaction after happening
    the violations. Moreover, privacy should be considered in the design of the system
    and available as the default setting. In addition, there should be protection
    for the whole lifecycle of the data. Finally, the system should have transparency
    and visibility, and respect the user privacy. Several studies utilized these principles
    in developing new privacy-friendly systems. For instance, the study in the work
    of Preuveneers and Joosen96 utilized proactivity principle in the design of the
    solution for a remote health monitoring system. Moreover, the study in the work
    of Kung et al97 applied the principle of visibility and transparency to ITSs.
    6.2 Testing and verification This is a crucial part of the design of a security-
    and privacy-friendly system to make sure that the implementation of such systems
    achieves its security and privacy-related requirements. Privacy-related testing
    and verification should be incorporated into the current testing processes as
    they are not basically different from other types of testing.24 The main goal
    of these verification approaches is to find information leaks from different applications,
    for instance, by using black box differential testing.98 The process of testing
    and verification must be applied in design of any new system architecture in information-centric
    smart cities. 6.3 Privacy architecture Privacy architecture is required to consider
    various protection approaches to ensure that there are no privacy leakages in
    the system. For instance, the study in the work of Choi et al99 proposed an architecture
    relying on the trustworthy remote data stores and a broker, which intercedes access
    to the users'' data stores. In addition, the study in the work of Layouni et al100
    combined various cryptographic approaches to provide privacy in the system. 6.4
    Data minimization According to the work of Gürses et al,101 data minimization
    should be considered as one the most important parts of the privacy by design
    strategy. In information-centric smart cities, this strategy can be utilized in
    various application such as in electronic toll pricing system to analyze different
    architectural options.102 It can also be used in the analysis of big data to obtain
    privacy-protection solutions.103 In smart cities, smart systems should be designed
    in a way to avoid recoding unrelated data. For example, cameras for ITSs can also
    record unrelated information or sensors in smart environments may collect more
    data rather than needed. Therefore, data minimization techniques can be used to
    overcome such challenges. 6.5 Secret sharing This method allows distribution of
    secret information among different participants.24 It is usually divided into
    m shares with each participant having one share. This method requires at least
    n shares to recover the secret. Therefore, it provides reliability and confidentiality
    in the system. In information-centric smart cities, secret sharing can be utilized
    for distributed data storage,104 and for data aggregation from smart meters105
    and sensor networks.106 6.6 System security and access control In information-centric
    smart cities, security of the system and its subsystems is crucial for the purpose
    of privacy protection. For example, if there are vulnerabilities in the system,
    attackers can easily have access to smart devices and retrieve the desired data
    which would be very dangerous for the privacy of users'' sensitive data. Therefore,
    it is mandatory to secure the system to avoid any attacks from the hackers. Access
    control restricts the access of data from unauthorized parties. It would also
    help to minimize control of the system from the misuse of stored data. Access
    control is also important for autonomous systems with a connection to the internet
    in which smart devices can be monitored remotely.107 6.7 Secure multiparty computation
    It is a cryptographic approach that permits multiple parties to calculate the
    value of a public function, without showing the private inputs of the parties
    and without depending on a trusted third party (TTP).24 In smart cities, this
    method can be employed in the design of a healthcare system to analyze the results
    of genomic tests where it is required to keep the test sequence and the patient''s
    genome private.108 7 RECOMMENDED SECURE ARCHITECTURE An IoT-based smart city architecture
    operates over heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and consists of millions of resource-constrained
    devices. In Figure 4, basic components of an IoT-based smart city architecture
    are shown. These components include black networks (BNs), trusted software-defined
    networking (SDN) controller named as TTP, unified registry (UR), and key management
    system (KMS).109 These four components are responsible for secure communication
    and authentication across HetNets and have different responsibilities in the architecture.
    Black networks are responsible for data privacy, integrity, confidentiality and
    authentication. Trusted third party is responsible for efficient routing across
    IoT nodes, while UR is used for a database of various devices such as nodes, sensors,
    and gateways. Finally, KMS is responsible for IoT networks. FIGURE 4 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint An overview of the components of a secure Internet of Things
    (IoT)–based smart cities architecture 7.1 Black networks Black networks are used
    to secure data that contains the meta-data, related to each packet in an IoT protocol.110
    They can secure data through various encryption methods which can be done viaGrain128a
    or AES in the EAX or OFB modes. Black networks enable authentication and secure
    communication at both link layer and network layer.109 Moreover, BNs can reduce
    a wide range of active and passive attacks, which, in turn, provides confidentiality,
    integrity and privacy in IoT-based networks because of the secured communications
    at the network and the link layer. 7.2 Trusted SDN controller Software-defined
    networking is a paradigm that provides several opportunities to secure the network
    more efficiently. In this architecture, a SDN controller is used for the communication
    of network devices using various protocols. OpenFlow is the most commonly used
    protocol for the communication between various devices in the network and the
    SDN controller.111 The main aim of the SDN controller is to resolve the routing
    challenges in privacy protection of IoT-based BNs.110 OpenFlow protocol allows
    the SDN controller to begin a secure connection with the devices in the network.
    Trusted SDN controller can manage sleep and/or wake cycles, and can keep up a
    global IoT-based network view.109 7.3 Unified registry The main purpose of UR
    is to consolidate the heterogeneous technologies to create IoT-based networks
    for smart cities. The concept can also be extended to a visiting UR for the IoT
    nodes that are mobile and cross systems. This is crucial from a security perspective
    that variety of IoT networks considers fixed nodes communicating through wireless
    communication technologies. There are several wireless communication technologies
    utilized in smart cities including W-Fi and Long-Term Evolution. Moreover, many
    protocols such as IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks, ZigBee,
    and Bluetooth low energy, and several addressing approaches such as IPv6 128-bit
    addressing, radio frequency identification addressing and Bluetooth 48-bit addressing
    can be utilized in smart environments. All these technologies, protocols, and
    schemes require a unified attribute for identity management, authentication and
    authorization. Furthermore, translation between wireless communication technologies,
    protocols, and addressing approaches has to be done and UR makes the conversion
    process easier. It is difficult to implement a UR due to several regulatory, practical,
    and security issues. However, a logical entity can be implemented in a highly
    distributed manner that focuses on data and attribute set of an IoT node within
    the smart cities'' network. 7.4 Key management system Key management system109
    is the process of managing different tasks associated with various aspects of
    cryptographic key for cryptosystem. It is an important part of all security infrastructures.
    In an IoT environment, resource-constrained devices communicate in a secure manner
    using a symmetric shared key. Keys should be created and stored, and used securely.
    A critical issue regarding symmetric keys in a distributed mobile system is related
    to key distribution. Using a hierarchal KMS provides efficient key distribution
    for symmetric keys in smart cities. It is required to authenticate communications
    between IoT devices.112 Moreover, IoT applications require different security
    protocols and standards as they may deal with different security vulnerabilities.
    Some of the most commonly used IoT protocols such as message queuing telemetry
    transport and constrained application protocol do not have built-in security mechanism.113
    However, constrained application protocol and other protocols can utilize protocols
    such as secure sockets layer to enhance their security. This means that, for secure
    communication between IoT devices, it is not sufficient to have single factor
    authentication.113 Therefore, it is required to have the KMS with two-factor authentication
    mechanism to mitigate the risk and improve the security in IoT networks.114 As
    an example for such an architecture, consider a node in an IoT BN that wants to
    send a packet to another node. The SDN controllers can ensure availability and
    synchronize the nodes for routing by creating the flow tables for the packets
    to be routed from one node to another. In this regard, UR is responsible for identity
    management and node authentication and authorization. In addition, KMS provides
    external key management for the IoT nodes to communicate securely using a shared
    key. A summary of the security components and services in IoT-based smart cities
    is provided in Table 3. TABLE 3. Components and services of a secure Internet

    In spite of different research studies and rapid improvement that have been obtained
    in recent decade regarding the security and privacy in information-centric smart
    cities, there are still open research issues and challenges that should be taken
    into account regarding the improvements of the smart cities in terms of security
    and privacy. 8.1 Mobile crowd sensing Crowd sensing (CS) is a technique where
    a number of people having mobile devices can extract and share information related
    to their interests. Crowd sensing sometimes is referred to as mobile CS (MCS)
    where smart devices such as phones and other wearable devices are emerging as
    sensing, computing, and communication devices.115 Mobile CS has a great potential
    of enhancing people''s quality of life in various applications such as healthcare
    and transportation. Despite all the benefits of MCS, data privacy and user trustworthiness
    are critical problems, which may be faced by it.115 Therefore, these challenges
    are critical for CS in smart cities, which need to be carefully addressed in future
    research. Moreover, MCS has great environmental and social applications for smart
    cities. For example, environmental applications of MCS include measuring the level
    of pollution in a city and the level of water in creeks, and monitoring the natural
    home of wildlife.116 Furthermore, in social MCS, users can share their sensed
    information using a database server, which provides a good understanding of problems
    related to the community.116 8.2 Big data The rapid rise in the number of smart
    devices and big data leads toward the problem of security and privacy in smart
    cities'' applications such as intelligent systems. Attackers can abuse the human
    intelligence and gain access to the big data to infer and violate the privacy
    of data owners. There are many techniques such as cryptographic approaches that
    can be used to detect these attackers. Besides that, it would be beneficial to
    improve the traceability of the network and allow a TTP to control it. In addition,
    it is of great importance to achieve data privacy, integrity, authentication,
    and availability to secure big data. 8.3 Internet of Things–based network security
    The IoT can be considered as HetNets where different networks such as smartphone
    networks, social networks, internet, and industrial networks are integrated and
    connected together to provide better services to the people.117 Due to this complex
    environment, it is required to conduct research on effective technologies to overcome
    the latest challenges regarding security and privacy in smart cities. In this
    regard, development of effective prevention approaches is significantly important.
    Moreover, it is beneficial to model the spread patterns of data in WSNs.118 8.4
    Lightweight security solutions Several approaches have been developed recently
    regarding the security and privacy issues in smart cities. However, the application
    for some of these approaches is not realistic. Due to the availability of resource-
    and energy-constraint devices (eg, sensors) in smart cities'' infrastructures,
    it is not possible to implement advanced and strong security algorithms. Therefore,
    it is required to conduct research on developing lightweight security solutions
    to reduce overhead while providing an acceptable level of protection simultaneously.
    8.5 Authentication and confidentiality In smart systems, authentication is required
    to ensure that services in heterogeneous systems can only be accessed by authorized
    users.119 The IoT devices in smart cities are capable of authenticating the network
    itself and other nodes in the network and the messages from the management stations.
    In addition, since the amount of data authentication is increasing dramatically,
    it is crucial to develop effective and advanced technologies to ensure exact and
    real-time authentication in smart cities. Confidentiality is another requirement
    for securing smart cities. It prevents information from being subjected to the
    wrong source or passive attacks. In IoT networks, attackers can access devices
    and listen secretly to the communication. Therefore, it is important to conduct
    research into encryption-based techniques to protect confidentiality of data transmission
    between nodes. This, in turn, helps to have a reliable communication system.120
    8.6 Availability and integrity In smart cities, services should be available whenever
    they are needed. They should also be capable of maintaining effective actions
    while they are under attack. Furthermore, a smart system in smart cities should
    have the ability to discover unusual conditions and must be able to stop more
    damages to the system. Therefore, it is required to investigate on robust protection
    techniques to deal with the increasingly smart attacks. Moreover, integrity of
    IoT devices and information being exchanged between the devices and the cloud
    is significantly important. Communications occur between various devices in smart
    cities; therefore, it is possible to easily damage the data if they are not properly
    protected during the transmission process. Thus, it is important to investigate
    on effective methods to guarantee the integrity of data in communication between
    IoT devices in smart cities. 8.7 The application of cloud/fog Technology in smart
    cities Cloud computing provides a way to locally store and manage an enormous
    amount of data collected by IoT devices. However, the process of sending such
    a vast amount of data is costly in terms of storage, bandwidth, latency, and communication.
    As a result, IBM suggested to process data at the edge of the network using the
    concept of fog computing, instead of transferring such a huge amount of data to
    the cloud.121 Fog computing has several applications in achieving the requirements
    for building sustainable smart cities such as smart agriculture,122 smart healthcare,123
    and smart water management.124 In spite of the important benefits of fog computing
    for smart cities, several security and privacy challenges need to be taken into
    account such as data/web security and virtualization.125 This is due to the limitation
    of computing resources of fog nodes, which complicates providing security solutions
    for them.126 Moreover, the probability of cyberattacks against fog nodes are higher
    than cloud data centers because they are usually more accessible. 9 CONCLUSION
    Smart cities can improve the functionality of urban environments and enhance the
    quality of life and the well-being of people. By the implementation of various
    smart systems, security and privacy challenges have become an important issue
    which needs efficient and effective solutions. In addition, it is of great importance
    to consider the security and privacy threats in the design and implementation
    of new smart systems. In this paper, we have investigated and discussed the security
    and privacy issues in information-centric smart cities'' applications. First,
    we have introduced some typical applications of smart cities. We then presented
    the general requirements regarding the security and privacy challenges for smart
    cities'' services. Moreover, we presented a number of security and privacy solutions
    for various applications of information-centric smart cities. We finally discussed
    some open research issues that should be carefully taken into account regarding
    the performance improvement of smart cities in terms of security and privacy.

    \ and livestock play a vital role in social and economic stability. Food safety\
    \ and\ntransparency in the food supply chain are a significant concern for many\
    \ people. Internet of Things (IoT)\nand blockchain are gaining attention due to\
    \ their success in versatile applications. They generate a large\namount of data\
    \ that can be optimized and used efficiently by advanced deep learning (ADL) techniques.\n\
    The importance of such innovations from the viewpoint of supply chain management\
    \ is significant\nin different processes such as for broadened visibility, provenance,\
    \ digitalization, disintermediation,\nand smart contracts. This article takes\
    \ the secure IoT–blockchain data of Industry 4.0 in the food sector\nas a research\
    \ object. Using ADL techniques, we propose a hybrid model based on recurrent neural\n\
    networks (RNN). Therefore, we used long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent\
    \ units (GRU)\nas a prediction model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization jointly\
    \ to optimize the parameters of the\nhybrid model. We select the optimal training\
    \ parameters by GA and finally cascade LSTM with GRU.\nWe evaluated the performance\
    \ of the proposed system for a different number of users. This paper aims\nto\
    \ help supply chain practitioners to take advantage of the state-of-the-art technologies;\
    \ it will also help\nthe industry to make policies according to the predictions\
    \ of ADL.\nKeywords: livestock; internet of things; blockchain; advanced deep\
    \ learning; industry 4.0; provenance\n1. Introduction\nIndustry 4.0 incorporates\
    \ wireless technology, sensors, and smart machines to create a wholly\nconnected\
    \ enterprise. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is considered to be a significant\
    \ component\nof Industry 4.0; it collects information about processes, equipment\
    \ performance, supplies, and orders,\nand using big data, it aggregates information\
    \ from suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. Food\nsafety is a significant\
    \ concern in the modern world; governments need to quickly formulate policies\
    \ and\ntake various measures to strengthen the management of the safe production\
    \ of agricultural products,\nincluding identification and tracking. Meat products\
    \ are major components of human food along with\nagricultural products. Agriculture\
    \ and livestock sectors play roles in meeting the hunger requirements of\nthe\
    \ rapidly increasing world population. The green agriculture and livestock revolution\
    \ led to general\nincreases in crop yields and meat consumption.\nPeople not only\
    \ want to eat, but they also wish to eat nutritious meals. According to the World\n\
    Food Program, malnutrition is the leading cause of death of 45% of children under\
    \ ﬁve years of age,\nand 2 billion people suffer from deﬁciencies of vitamin and\
    \ minerals [1]. Many companies and people\nare working to improve the quality\
    \ and quantity of food products [2–5]. Precision agriculture is a\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 2990; doi:10.3390/s20102990\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 2990\n2 of 24\nmain focus of research in the 21st century; it is revolutionizing\
    \ the agriculture industry by introducing\nseveral impressive technologies [6].\
    \ The emergence of information and communications technology\n(ICT)-based techniques\
    \ is having a signiﬁcant impact on the yields of crops; now, farmers can remotely\n\
    monitor the conditions of their farms and can control their equipment remotely\
    \ using a smartphone.\nFarmers widely appreciate the use of unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAV) to capture real-time data\nregarding crop health and to detect weeds [7].\
    \ ICT has helped us to efﬁciently use irrigation and water\nmanagement systems\
    \ for agriculture. It gives access to soil moisture deﬁcit data and weather reports\n\
    through online irrigation scheduling and data regarding the soil pH of agricultural\
    \ areas. It allows the\nhigh-quality cultivation of orchards with the help of\
    \ agricultural robots [8]. The use of information\nand communications technologies\
    \ in the food sector has a signiﬁcant impact; one such technology\nwhich is widely\
    \ recognized for its transparency in the food supply chain is blockchain.\nBlockchain\
    \ was initially introduced for bitcoin [9]. Bitcoin is the latest innovation in\
    \ economic\ncomputing, allowing customers to exchange money in a cheap reliable,\
    \ and fast way using the internet.\nBlockchain has now emerged as the ultimate\
    \ solution to many issues, such as logistical [10] and\ncost issues [11]. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) is also helping to connect devices and sensors, and\
    \ the\ncombination of IoT and blockchain is proving to be a time and money-saving\
    \ approach—one which also\ngenerates a large amount of data. Analyzing these data\
    \ using advanced deep learning techniques (ADL)\nhelps manufacturers to make informed\
    \ decisions [12]. However, only a small percent of manufacturers\nin the food\
    \ and beverage industry use the IIoT and smart manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled\
    \ IIoT\nsystems can be optimized using deep reinforcement learning approaches\
    \ [13]. Blockchain helps\nIndustry 4.0 to secure sensor data [14], as the data\
    \ within the blockchain are cryptographically\nencrypted. This makes blockchain\
    \ a secure platform which can be trusted. Every user has two\nkeys—public and\
    \ private. Figure 1 shows a cryptographic scheme for message transactions in a\n\
    blockchain. While transmitting the data, the public key is used to encrypt a message\
    \ by the sender,\nand the person at the receiving end who has that speciﬁc public\
    \ key can decrypt and read the message.\nFigure 1. Cryptography scheme for transactions\
    \ in a blockchain.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) can be used to interpret data\
    \ and provide the next steps in the\nmanufacturing process if something goes wrong.\
    \ We can even automate suggestions regarding\nhow to ﬁx an issue [15]. We can\
    \ also use natural language processing to monitor our suppliers across\nborders\
    \ with AI in the supply chain. AI reduces the time spent on manual labor, freeing\
    \ employees to\nmake more valuable contributions to a business. AI allows us to\
    \ make better, more informed decisions\nbased on prior historical data. AI provides\
    \ critical alerts and recommendations for when things go\nwrong; it also helps\
    \ us to monitor suppliers in other regions of the world to prevent the problem\n\
    proactively. It simpliﬁes supply chain relationship management and helps us to\
    \ optimize our supply\nchain processes to increase customer satisfaction and generate\
    \ more proﬁt for the business.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n3 of 24\nBlockchain’s\
    \ ability to trace a good through the entire supply chain is one of its most useful\n\
    applications [16]. The fact that blockchain’s distributed ledger is almost impossible\
    \ to change serves\nas the perfect tool for maintaining a comprehensive record\
    \ of the exchange of ownership that occurs\nthroughout supply chains. The advantages\
    \ of blockchain technology (BCT) have attracted the scientiﬁc\ncommunity to determine\
    \ its possible uses in the ﬁeld of the supply chain. This technology can control\n\
    and monitor risk mitigation efforts and strengthen the supply chain, and it could\
    \ prove useful in\npreventing security breaches.\nDairy products such as meat,\
    \ milk, yogurt, butter, and cheese play a vital role in meeting the food\nrequirements\
    \ of humans. Meat is an essential part of food; since the very beginning of humanity,\
    \ meat\nhas been a signiﬁcant source of food. Due to high demand, it has been\
    \ shown that many companies\noverlook the safety of meat, and have distributed\
    \ old and rotten meat to the consumers [17,18]. Recently,\nscandals have emerged\
    \ around the world regarding replaced, stale and tainted meat, including the\n\
    famous horse-meat scandal in Britain [19], tainted meat in Brazil [20], the expired\
    \ meat scandal\nin China [20], and donkey meat in Pakistan [21]. To highlight\
    \ the importance of meat traceability,\nSander et al. [22] investigated different\
    \ perspectives of the meat supply chain; they also performed a\nsurvey for this\
    \ purpose and evaluated how BCT could help in the transparency and traceability\
    \ of the\nmeat supply chain system. The focus of the author was to determine consumer\
    \ views about BCT in the\nsupply chain for traceability and transparency. The\
    \ author used different research methods to check the\nefﬁciency of the transparency\
    \ and traceability of this system. They used an online survey by setting up\n\
    a questionnaire and conducted interviews with retails managers, government ofﬁcials,\
    \ and third-party\ntransparency service providers. With transparency and traceability\
    \ systems, people will assume better\nquality, which will increase their purchasing\
    \ decision power. Although transparency and traceability\nsystems will help meat\
    \ suppliers to achieve a better reputation, the costs will be increased, which\
    \ can\nbe an issue for customers.\nIn this work, we propose a combination of these\
    \ state of the art technologies. We combine the IoT\nand blockchain with ADL.\
    \ We propose a hybrid model based on recurrent neural networks (RNN)\nalgorithms\
    \ to forecast the supply and demand of food, using long short-term memory (LSTM)\
    \ and\ngated recurrent units (GRU) as a prediction model and the Genetic Algorithm\

    \ the wholesale and trading centers for\nmeat products, hundreds of tons of meat\
    \ ﬂow from various farmers’ markets into the urban area\nevery day. To ensure\
    \ safety, the proposed system establishes a blockchain-based digital ledger for\n\

    able to trace the origin of the food. Due to the involvement of IoT, customers\
    \ will get access to the\nfood’s temperature history; the functional modules of\
    \ the proposed system also include administrative\nmodules for farmers and the\
    \ warehouse owner.\nThis paper starts with the study of recent advances in IoT\

    \ products is essential to ensure food safety, but there are\nnumerous and physically\
    \ dispersed stakeholders involved in the agricultural supply chain process,\n\
    including the growers of a speciﬁc product, farmhouses, and the sellers of those\
    \ products, which\nare large in number and not connected. Every company involved\
    \ in the supply chain of agriculture\nproducts has its own data recording systems;\
    \ therefore, it is difﬁcult to achieve a central tracking\nsystem for information\
    \ because of the incompatibility among software or data structures. Table 1\n\
    provides a comparison of existing IoT or blockchain-based supply chain solutions.\
    \ Lin et al. [23]\nproposed an ecosystem for smart agriculture based on BCT and\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT). According\nto this system, all the stakeholders\
    \ can use their smartphones to input data into this system, and it\nalso collects\
    \ the data from IoT devices itself without the intervention of any other person.\
    \ To ensure\nthe effectiveness of this model, they used the virtual trusted trade\
    \ BCT Network Cloud Platform as\na core of their architecture. According to this\
    \ model, two types of transactions are performed: one\nis enterprise resource\
    \ planning, which includes trade, logistics, delivery, warehousing information;\n\
    and the second includes data from IoT devices, such as the air temperature, air\
    \ humidity, soil PH, soil\nnutrition, ground moisture, etc. This model is based\
    \ on BCT, meaning that all the data communicates\nthrough nodes after hashing\
    \ and digital signatures. Such systems can resolve the food safety issues of\n\
    the end consumers. The combination of BCT and IoT technologies can be useful in\
    \ the building of a\ntrusted, self-organized, open, and ecological smart agriculture\
    \ system.\nTable 1. Comparison of supply chain solutions. IoT: Internet of Things.\n\

    IoT and Blockchain technologies (BCT) can transform the food industry in three\
    \ main areas:\n•\nProvenance;\n•\nPayments;\n•\nManagement.\nFigure 2 summarizes\
    \ the significant demands of IoT and blockchain in the food industry. It introduces\n\
    the essential features of different sections. The provenance section comprises\
    \ the supply chain, traceability,\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n5 of 24\nand information\
    \ system; the payments section focuses on cryptocurrency, digital transactions,\
    \ and financial\nservices; and the management section includes digital identity,\
    \ data analytics, and record keeping.\nFigure 2. Applications of IoT and blockchain\
    \ in the food industry.\n2.1. Provenance\nProvenance and radical transparency\
    \ is the key to food safety and consumer trust. With the help\nof BCT, farmers\
    \ can make mobile payments and credits; also, the transaction fees will be decreased.\n\
    The real-time management of supply chain transactions and ﬁnancing will prove\
    \ to be of enormous\nbeneﬁt in the agricultural and food sector. Using blockchain,\
    \ a more direct link can be established\nbetween supplier and retailer to make\
    \ sure that farmers receive fair payment for their products,\nand retailers can\
    \ conﬁrm that they are getting what they have paid for [33]. The digital tokens\
    \ based\non BCT can be exchanged for fertilizer for small farmers. These tokens\
    \ cannot be misused or imitated\nsince they are on a blockchain and can be traced\
    \ to make sure that the government-allocated funds\ncreate the maximum impact\
    \ in the areas for which they are intended. Blockchain-based agriculture\ncan\
    \ be very rich in terms of information for the end-users. For example, a customer\
    \ buys a pack of\ncereal from the market near their house; they can trace it back\
    \ from the warehouse to the farms where\nit was grown or even further back to\
    \ the shop from which the seeds were purchased. All they have\nto do is to scan\
    \ the barcode by using their smartphone [34], which will show all transaction\
    \ data\nrelated to it, including the arrival date of this packet into the market,\
    \ from which farm the cereals were\nproduced, on which day and time it was created,\
    \ the ID of the farm owner, the ID of the staff who\ncollected the plants, collecting\
    \ device information, packaging information, all the temperature and\nother environmental\
    \ data for the plant’s production, process, logistics, storage, etc. The blockchain\n\
    system can verify all of this information without human intervention.\nTo use\
    \ the BCT in agriculture is a significant issue because it is complicated to automate\
    \ storage\nand then to obtain the hash data. Xie et al. [35] proposed a storage\
    \ scheme for the tracking of agricultural\nproducts to address this problem. They\
    \ designed a secured data storage scheme to track agricultural\nproducts based\
    \ on BCT with a double-chain storage structure. They not only implemented the\
    \ plan\nbut also built a practical application to verify its correctness. According\
    \ to their proposed system,\nagricultural products are bound with IoT sensors;\
    \ the sensor obtains the data of the agricultural\nproducts and uploads them to\
    \ the server in real-time. A double-chain storage structure is used\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 2990\n6 of 24\nsimultaneously to store the data in the blockchain automatically;\
    \ the system can also efficiently look\ninto the data and provide them to the\
    \ upper application. The system structure contains three layers:\nthe application\
    \ layer, which is used to view and monitor the tracking of nodes; the data storage\
    \ layer,\nwhich consists of a blockchain system based on Ethereum; and the third\
    \ layer, which is the sensing\nlayer, using sensors mounted on different devices\
    \ and in different locations. This scheme is based on\na double chain structure,\
    \ so a parent transaction hash is added into the database; in this way, all the\n\
    data of the identity can be obtained only using the last transaction hash, and\
    \ data will not have been\nchanged. To improve the storage scheme, the filtering\
    \ of data is done in tracking applications. For this,\na non-normal data judgment\
    \ strategy is added, and through the experiments, the authors observed that\n\
    this scheme provides higher data security as compared to non-chain mode; on the\
    \ other hand, the of\nquerying the data is slow.\nTian et al. [36] also proposed\
    \ a traceability model for the supply chain of food in the context of\nChina.\
    \ This system was based on RFID and BCT. According to the author, this system\
    \ could prove\nbeneﬁcial to rule out fake products from the market. Nevertheless,\
    \ on the other hand, its cost is high, it\nis immature, and more work is required.\
    \ This system covers the whole process of data gathering and\ninformation management\
    \ for every link in the agri-food supply chain, which tracks and registers the\n\
    quality and safety of the agri-food “from farm to fork”.\n2.2. Payments\nICT agricultural\
    \ systems with a BCT foundation are localized and unchangeable management\nsystems\
    \ of records. Tseng et al. [37] proposed a system model of an ICT e-agricultural\
    \ system with a\nblockchain infrastructure, in which BCT is used to store the\
    \ data of water quality monitoring. This\nsystem can help to monitor the amount\
    \ of water which is suitable to obtain a high yield. The author\nalso proposed\
    \ an evaluation tool; this proposed prototype ICT e-agriculture infrastructure,\
    \ built at\nNational Taiwan University, was used to monitor the quality of irrigation\
    \ water-related data collected\nby remote sensors at various farm locations and\
    \ used the GCOIN blockchain system. GCOIN is a\ntype of private blockchain which\
    \ was developed by a professor of the National Taiwan University as a\nproject\
    \ in 2016.\nIn the agri-food sector, market information is non-symmetric, and\
    \ there is no guarantee of\nmarket fairness. To eliminate these issues, Mao et\
    \ al. [27] proposed a food trade mechanism based\non an alliance chain. To design\
    \ a new architecture, the authors used consortium BCT; this helps\nto protect\
    \ the safety of the transactions. Due to the involvement of different roles, authentications,\n\
    and permissions for food transactions in the agri-food supply chain, ensuring\
    \ the safety of transactions\nis very challenging; this technology is beneﬁcial\
    \ in meeting these challenges. Another issue is the\nimprovement of transaction\
    \ efﬁciency and assisting users in ﬁnding suitable transactions. Regarding\nthis\
    \ issue, the improved practical byzantine fault tolerance (iPBFT) algorithm was\
    \ designed, and to\neliminate competition, the authors suggested using an online\
    \ double auction mechanism. This newly\ndeveloped system was named the food trading\
    \ system with consortium blockchain (FTSCON). In this\nsystem, there are two nodes:\
    \ the user node and scheduling node. The user node can be a buyer or\nseller node,\
    \ depending upon the situation. In addition, scheduling nodes are used to authorize\
    \ and\nto verify the transaction data of the system. Before recording a transaction\
    \ in this chain, consensus\nprocessing is applied to verify the data, known as\
    \ a consortium blockchain. This includes a three-part\nblock, which contains the\
    \ transaction data, mechanism of consensus, and smart contract. This system\n\
    was made with the Ethereum architecture, which includes consortium blockchain.\n\
    2.3. Management\nHua et al. [38] proposed a platform design to resolve two critical\
    \ issues in agricultural traceability\nsystems: the ﬁrst is the credibility of\
    \ the data, and the second is the difﬁculty of integrating the\nsubsystems of\
    \ each company involved in this traceability system. According to the designed\
    \ platform,\na distributed peer-to-peer platform is used to overcome the problem\
    \ of data credibility. Once the data\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n7 of 24\nenter into\
    \ the distributed network and a consensus is formed, it can no longer be modiﬁed.\
    \ Secondly,\nto overcome the issue of a subsystem consolidation-designed platform,\
    \ an open data-sharing platform\nis used. However, this system has a loophole:\
    \ this system is a free data-sharing platform, meaning\nthat data will be visible\
    \ to all stakeholders. However, most companies do not want to share their data\n\
    with anyone. Therefore, to overcome this problem, every stakeholder has to choose\
    \ a different license.\nLeng et al. [39] proposed an agricultural supply chain\
    \ system using the concept of the public blockchain,\nwhich is based on a double\
    \ chain architecture. According to this concept, BCT could be public or\nprivate\
    \ based on the rights to record the data. In public blockchains, the information\
    \ privacy of users\ncannot be protected, and the transaction speed is low, whereas\
    \ in the private blockchain, the speed of\ntransactions and consensus is fast.\
    \ The authors designed a public blockchain for agricultural business.\nAt present,\
    \ China is a massive market for agriculture. It has to feed 22% of the world population.\n\
    From the perspective of China, Tse et al. [40] conducted the ﬁrst in-depth analysis\
    \ of blockchain\napplication in food supply information security. In their paper,\
    \ they used theories from different ﬁelds\nof science, including IT, management,\
    \ system, and empirical research methods. According to their\nstudy, by using\
    \ BCT, we can achieve the aim of replacing the paper tracking system, and we could\
    \ have\na permanent, non-tempered record for every transaction. They used a PEST\
    \ analysis analytical model,\nwhich analyzes political factors, economic factors,\
    \ societal factors, and technology factors. According\nto this analysis, the government\
    \ has the critical responsibility for food safety, so it should create an\nenvironment\
    \ in which food supply information systems could grow, and regulatory authorities\
    \ must\nlook after those systems. In the society analysis, the author said that\
    \ people currently want more\ninformation about what they are buying; thus, every\
    \ step of the food supply chain must be accessible\nto the consumers. The author\
    \ suggested that this system should be developed in China, and forceful\nactions\
    \ should be taken.\nAlthough many models and schemes have been proposed for supply\
    \ chain models based on BCT,\nno works have considered the supply chain from the\
    \ view of hazard analysis and critical control points.\nTian et al. [41] proposed\
    \ a food supply chain traceability system with the combination of BCT and\nInternet\
    \ of Things based on hazard analysis. This work mainly focuses on risk management\
    \ and its\nprevention from food safety points. They divide the food supply chain\
    \ into ﬁve links: a production\nlink, where the environment of the crop should\
    \ be assessed; the processing link, which requires the\nassessment of processing\
    \ equipment; the warehousing link, which depends upon the maintenance of\ncold-chain\
    \ equipment; the distribution link, which requires the proper maintenance of transporting\n\
    trucks or vehicles; and ﬁnally, the e-retail link, where all retail management\
    \ practices are evaluated\naccording to good working practices. This traceability\
    \ system is a decentralized distributed system.\nThis system uses different IoT\
    \ technologies to collect data such as RFID, GPS, and wireless sensor\nnetworks\
    \ (WSNs). To store and manage data, BigchainDB is used because it has high throughput,\
    \ low\nlatency, and powerful query functionality. This system can be helpful in\
    \ rebuilding the conﬁdence of\nconsumers of the food industry.\nIn the existing\
    \ supply chain of agriculture, the relationships between members are not very\
    \ strong.\nIn work done by Casado et al. [42], a model to strengthen this relationship\
    \ and to ensure the right of\ninformation of customers was proposed. The European\
    \ Regional Development Fund supported this\nwork. This model involves BCT, smart\
    \ contracts, and a multi-agent system to coordinate the tracking\nof food in the\
    \ agriculture supply chain. Blockchain is currently used in many applications.\
    \ This is\na computerized system, which consists of multiple intelligent agents\
    \ who interact with each other.\nThe use of smart contracts in the blockchain\
    \ to manage the entire supply chain makes the process\nmore efﬁcient.\n3. System\
    \ Model\nMany participants are involved in a food supply chain, but we can categorize\
    \ them into four main\ndivisions: farmer, warehouse, retailer, and consumer. The\
    \ warehouse also consists of two subunits:\nthe meat processor and distribution\
    \ unit. Our proposed food supply chain system is designed to\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 2990\n8 of 24\ntake full advantage of the state-of-the-art technologies such\
    \ as the Internet of Things, blockchain,\nand artiﬁcial intelligence. Figure 3\
    \ demonstrates the designed system scenario of the proposed IoT\nand blockchain-enabled\
    \ intelligent provenance system.\nFigure 3. Designed system scenario.\nThe administrators\
    \ can enroll new participants and can see the records. Farm owners can deal\n\
    with the warehouse for the management of livestock. The farmer is responsible\
    \ for identifying each\nanimal with an ear tag equipped with an electronic label\
    \ at the farmhouse; they are also responsible\nfor uploading the data to the blockchain\
    \ through their mobile device or computer. The warehouse\nupdates the records\
    \ of the total assets present at the slaughterhouse through the weighing platform,\n\
    attaches a hook label for raw meat during the slaughter process, and transfers\
    \ all types of data to the\nblockchain. In the processing of divided meat, each\
    \ part of the split meat is uniquely identiﬁed by\nbarcode technology, and a related\
    \ information tracking system is established to record the production\nprocess\
    \ of the divided meat. All kinds of data are aggregated to the blockchain server.\
    \ In the warehouse,\nthere are two central units: processing and distribution.\
    \ The processing unit deals with the cutting of\nmeat and packaging, whereas the\
    \ distribution unit is responsible for supplying the assets to the retailer.\n\
    In the case of live animals, the farmer can directly provide the animal to the\
    \ retailer. The last—and\none of the most signiﬁcant—parts of the system is the\
    \ end consumer, who buys the assets from the\nretailer and consumes it. The consumers\
    \ could be restaurant owners or individual customers. Finally,\nthe blockchain\
    \ can be used to query meat products through mobile tags or serial numbers, to\
    \ establish\na complete management system for livestock breeding and meat product\
    \ production and sales.\n4. Proposed Solution\nWe have proposed an IoT and blockchain-enabled\
    \ optimized provenance system for Industry 4.0\nin the food sector using advanced\
    \ deep learning. We have used Hyperledger Fabric as a blockchain\nfor our proposed\
    \ method; Hyperledger Fabric allows the network manager to manage a private\n\
    blockchain in a user-friendly manner.\nFigure 4 demonstrates the architecture\
    \ of the IoT–Blockchain-enabled intelligent provenance\nsystem. In our proposed\
    \ method, we have taken farm owners as participants and allowed them to\nestablish\
    \ a ﬁle of meat products for each animal. The farmer can create personnel ﬁles\
    \ and duty\nrecord ﬁles for each section. They can also use smart contracts and\
    \ event notiﬁcation functions for the\nupper and lower limits of inventory information.\
    \ The second participant is the processing unit of the\nwarehouse; in the production\
    \ and processing link, the data identiﬁed by the ear tag in the breeding\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 2990\n9 of 24\nunit are transferred to the production and processing\
    \ unit. The processing unit is responsible for the\ninformation regarding different\
    \ nodes of the production and processing, which is collected according\nto the\
    \ management standards and speciﬁcations and uniquely identiﬁed through the barcodes.\
    \ Then,\nthe data are transferred to the distribution unit. The distribution unit\
    \ is responsible for transferring\nassets to the retailers. During the transportation\
    \ of the goods, this information is written on the pallet\nof the delivered goods\
    \ or the barcode of the packaging box according to the speciﬁed standards of the\n\
    origin, quantity, quality, grade, and so on. While taking full advantage of IoT,\
    \ each delivery truck will\nhave temperature sensors and GPS for tracking. When\
    \ the goods are transported to the designated\nretailer or designated distribution\
    \ point of the wholesale market or shopping mall, the information\nregarding the\
    \ products stored in the labels of the packaging boxes must be read ﬁrst and uploaded\
    \ to\nthe system. For warehousing and logistics distribution management, a traceability\
    \ system is established\nin the production and processing and store supply chain\
    \ through barcodes. In logistics, the goods\ninformation is recorded on the label\
    \ of the pallet or goods box. In this way, the barcode system can\nhouse the location,\
    \ identity, storage and transportation history, destination, expiration date,\
    \ and other\nuseful information of the boxes on the pallet or even individual\
    \ items. The barcode system can provide\ndetailed data for the actual goods in\
    \ the supply chain and establish a physical connection between\nthe products and\
    \ their complete identity. Users can easily access these completely reliable goods\
    \ data,\nand through the efﬁcient data collection system of the barcode, the warehouse\
    \ logistics information\ncan be fed back to the production and processing stage\
    \ in time to guide the production. At the point of\nsale (PoS), the end consumer\
    \ must be informed of the origin of the meat product; thus, retail labels on\n\
    packaged meat products must have human-readable information, and non-packaged\
    \ meat products\nmust provide relevant information in other ways.\nFigure 4. IoT–blockchain-enabled\
    \ intelligent provenance system.\n4.1. Private Blockchain Platform\nThe blockchain\
    \ refers to distributed data technology. It is a method for recording data using\n\
    cryptographic hash functions; in the ﬁeld of computer network security, this is\
    \ a critical feature.\nTo secure a network, different authentications methods\
    \ are implied. Usually, a server is used to\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n10 of 24\n\
    authenticate the users, but there is no centralized system in the blockchain because\
    \ it is a peer-to-peer\nnetwork. Therefore, to verify the users in these networks,\
    \ digital signature technology in encryption\nalgorithms is used. In this type\
    \ of encryption, a pair of keys is used: one is public, and the other is\nprivate.\
    \ The private key can decrypt the data encrypted by the public key, and vice versa.\
    \ Users in the\nblockchain system use an asymmetric encryption method to indicate\
    \ their identity; in this way, the user\nkeeps ther private key and distributes\
    \ the public key to others. Their private key signs the information\nsent by the\
    \ user, and the other users use the corresponding public key to verify the authenticity\
    \ of the\ndata. Blockchain also provides an essential feature of a smart contract\
    \ to automate the trade between\ntwo parties without the involvement of an intermediary\
    \ [43]. The smart contract is the soft form of a\ncontract written in the programming\
    \ language.\nIn this article, Hyperledger Fabric is used as a private blockchain\
    \ platform. It is an open-source\nplatform developed by IBM. Hyperledger composer\
    \ is used as a tool to build and deploy the private\nblockchain [44]. It allows\
    \ the users to write smart contracts and deﬁne participants and assets using\n\
    the command-line interface (CLI). Figure 5 presents the general architecture of\
    \ the private blockchain\nplatform. In a private blockchain network, only authorized\
    \ clients can interact with the system.\nUsers interact with the Hyperledger network\
    \ with the REST server [45]. Every user is enrolled\nby the certiﬁcate authority\
    \ (CA). Hyperledger Fabric contains different types of services, such as\nconsensus\
    \ services, scheduling services, and smart contract services. There are also three\
    \ kinds of\npeers: the endorsing peer, non-endorsing peer, and the orderer. This\
    \ network consists of different\nnodes, and every node holds a copy of the immutable\
    \ chain. This chain consists of a different block,\nand every block consists of\
    \ the hash value, encrypted data, and timestamp.\nFigure 5. Architecture diagram\
    \ of a private blockchain.\nFigure 6 shows the sequence diagram of a transaction\
    \ between the retailer and warehouse within\nthe blockchain network. Hyperledger\
    \ provides the certiﬁcate authority (CA), which is responsible for\nregistering\
    \ new nodes and issuing certiﬁcates. The retailer ﬁrst needs to be registered\
    \ by CA; only\na registered participant can initiate a transaction. The retailer\
    \ will submit a proposal to the smart\ncontract, which will be forwarded to the\
    \ warehouse by endorser peer. The warehouse will execute the\ntransaction and\
    \ generate the completion of the transfer event. A smart contract, after checking\
    \ the\npredeﬁned rules, asks the client to acknowledge. On successful acknowledgment,\
    \ the smart contract\nwill release the amount to the warehouse and broadcast this\
    \ to the orderer, which will forward this for\nvalidation and writing purposes.\
    \ In the end, a notiﬁcation will be sent to all parties on the successful\ncompletion\
    \ of the transaction.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n11 of 24\nFigure 6. Transaction\
    \ processes in the blockchain.\n4.2. Endpoint Security\nEndpoint security deals\
    \ with the protection of endpoints or end-user nodes. Endpoints act as\naccess\
    \ points to the blockchain network. Malicious parties can use these points; therefore,\
    \ in a secure\nsupply chain, securing endpoints is important. Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ provides digital certiﬁcates to the\nend nodes to secure the network. All sorts\
    \ of nodes of the network, including admin, peers, orderers,\nand clients, need\
    \ certiﬁcates to interact with the network. Figure 7 depicts the identity management\n\
    system for endpoint security in the Hyperledger blockchain. CA assigns the certiﬁcate\
    \ to the nodes;\none central root certiﬁcate authority (RCA) can assign the certiﬁcate\
    \ to an intermediate certiﬁcate\nauthority (ICA), and each ICA can further assign\
    \ the certiﬁcates to another ICA and nodes as well.\nA certiﬁcate revocation list\
    \ (CRL) is also present, which consists of malicious or revoked certiﬁcates.\n\
    Before assigning the certiﬁcate to the nodes, the CA checks it against the CRL.\
    \ Nodes can interact with\nCA through the fabric CA client or software development\

    \ Integration of IoT with Blockchain\nAccording to the goal of the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), conventional devices become smart and\nautonomous.\nBlockchain\
    \ has emerged as a critical technology that will transform how we share\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 2990\n12 of 24\ninformation. Building trust in distributed environments\
    \ without the need for authorities is a technological\nadvancement that has the\
    \ potential to change many industries, including the IoT. The integration of IoT\n\
    with blockchain in the food supply can be beneﬁcial in automating tasks and saving\
    \ time. Figure 8\ndescribes the integration scenarios of IoT with the blockchain\
    \ and the interaction of participants\nwith them.\nFigure 8. Integration scenarios\
    \ of IoT with blockchain.\nThe functions that are involved in the integration\
    \ process are device registration, task generation,\ntask allocation, and task\
    \ veriﬁcation [46]. The ﬁrst step is to register the IoT device with the network;\n\
    the membership service provider will register the IoT devices, and each device\
    \ will receive a unique\nidentity to communicate with the system. The second step\
    \ is to generate the tasks for the IoT devices;\ndevice owners can specify the\
    \ required task information, which can include a task ID, device ID, device\n\
    data, and participant information, and they will submit a transaction proposal\
    \ to the smart contract.\nThe nodes of the blockchain network execute the transaction\
    \ proposal and append the transaction\nin the ledger. An event is emitted from\
    \ these nodes to inform the device of whether the transaction\nsucceeded or failed.\n\
    The next step is to allocate the task from the sensors or actuators. For this\
    \ purpose, the device\nowner has to again submit a proposal to the smart contract\
    \ with sensing task information; if the network\npermits the request, then an\
    \ event is emitted from these nodes to inform the device owner that they\ncan\
    \ assign the sensing or actuating task to the sensor or actuators. Then, an event\
    \ is emitted from these\nnodes to notify the device owner that the actuator status\
    \ is changed. The ﬁnal step is task veriﬁcation:\nsmart contracts are used to\
    \ verify the tasks according to the predeﬁned set of rules. These rules are\n\
    deﬁned at the time of building the network. The sensor state can be updated using\
    \ Algorithm 1.\nThe user needs a sensor ID to obtain the data of a speciﬁc sensor\
    \ or actuator. The algorithm starts with\ninitializing the asset and device ID\
    \ values. Here, t-sensor represents the list of sensors. The algorithm\nwill check\
    \ if the transaction state for a speciﬁc sensor is new; then, it will change the\
    \ state of the sensor,\nand it will also enable the transaction. After that, it\
    \ will update the sensor registry and generate an\nevent to notify the user that\
    \ the state has been updated.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n13 of 24\nAlgorithm 1 Pseudo\

    \ to the membership of the participant and can allow a speciﬁc set of users to\n\

    4.4. Advanced Deep Learning\nWe have proposed a hybrid model for the optimization\
    \ of the supply chain. This model is based\non a recurrent neural network (RNN),\
    \ which is a class of artiﬁcial neural networks. Long short-term\nmemory (LSTM)\
    \ and gated recurrent units (GRU) are two models of RNN. Generally, the weight\n\
    and bias matrixes of LSTM and GRU are random. We have used the Genetic Algorithm\
    \ (GA) for\nthe optimization of hyperparameters. GA is used to ﬁnd the optimal\
    \ parameters, such as the initial\nweights, the number of hidden layers, neurons,\
    \ and epochs for neural networks [47].\nFigure 10 shows the workﬂow of the proposed\
    \ system. We take the data from the blockchain and\ndivide these data into training\
    \ and testing sets. Our proposed hybrid RNN takes the parameters and\nuses them\
    \ as weights for LSTM and GRU. Both algorithms run independently on the same data;\
    \ then,\nthe prediction results of both models are used as predictors for the\
    \ meta learner. Then, we evaluate its\nﬁtness. The root means square error (RMSE)\
    \ of the model on the validation set will become a ﬁtness\nvalue; if it is satisﬁed,\
    \ then these features are taken as optimal parameters; otherwise, these features\n\
    will be forwarded to the Genetic Algorithm.\nFigure 10. Advanced deep learning\
    \ workﬂow.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n15 of 24\n4.5. Genetic Algorithm\nThe Genetic\
    \ Algorithm is a heuristic search and optimization method based on the natural\n\
    selection process. GAs are widely used for the optimization problem of ﬁnding\
    \ approximate optimal\nsolutions in ample parameter space [48]. The Genetic Algorithm\
    \ has been widely used as the optimal\nparameter search technique. Wang et al.\
    \ [49] used Genetic Algorithms for the modeling of power\nampliﬁer behaviors and\
    \ to improve the hyperparameters of two-layer neural networks. They offered\n\
    the GAs the input of hyperparameters in binary form, and the GAs treat these binary\
    \ numbers as\ngenes and train them to approach the optimal solution.\nOur problem\
    \ is categorized as a metaheuristics problem, for which GA, particle swarm\noptimization\
    \ (PSO), and other evolutionary algorithms were considered. Although the difference\
    \ in the\nperformance of the PSO and GA was marginal, GA was shown to perform\
    \ slightly faster [50]; therefore,\nwe chose GA for the optimization of hyperparameters.\
    \ The process of species evolution is imitated in\nGA, and it relies on biologically\
    \ inspired functions, such as crossovers, mutation, and selection. GA\nworks based\
    \ on the natural evolution process; this is a slow, gradual process, and it makes\
    \ small, slow\nchanges in the solution in order to ﬁnd the best solution. The\
    \ population that is processed by GA is\nthe number of solutions. Each solution\
    \ is called an individual, and each individual solution has a\nchromosome. The\
    \ chromosome is represented as a set of parameters that deﬁne an individual, and\
    \ each\nchromosome contains a set of genes [51]. Besides, since it does not consider\
    \ auxiliary information,\nGA can be used for discrete and continuous optimization.\
    \ The ﬁtness function deﬁnes the solution\nreserved for further replication. Crossover\
    \ describes how to create a new solution from an existing\nsolution; for example,\
    \ n points cross. The mutation is used to introduce diversity and novelty into\
    \ the\nsolution pool by randomly switching or closing answers. An optimization\
    \ problem that seeks to ﬁnd\nthe maximum value of the function can generally be\
    \ described as per Equation (1):\nGA =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax f (x)\nx ∈ A\n\
    A ⊂ C\n(1)\nwhere x is the decision variable, the solution x that satisﬁes the\
    \ constraints is called a feasible solution,\nand the set A represents the set\
    \ of all solutions that meet the constraints C and is called the reasonable\n\
    solution set.\n4.6. LSTM and GRU\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent\
    \ units (GRUs) are two widely used models\nof recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\
    \ Figure 11 shows the architecture of basic LSTM and GRU\nunits. RNNs have short-term\
    \ memory. If the chain is long, it is not easy to transfer information from\n\
    previous time steps to subsequent time steps. During back-propagation, an RNN\
    \ suffers from the\ndisappearance of values used to update the weight of the neural\
    \ network, which is called a vanishing\ngradient problem. The problem with the\
    \ vanishing gradient is that the gradient shrinks over time; if\nthe gradient\
    \ value becomes too small, no learning effect will result. Therefore, in the RNN,\
    \ a layer\nreceiving a smaller gradient update will stop learning. RNN has short-term\
    \ memory as it can forget\nwhat is seen in longer sequences. Researchers present\
    \ LSTM and GRU as short-term memory solutions.\nLSTM can learn the minimum time\
    \ delay across discrete time steps by transmitting a constant error\nﬂow through\
    \ a constant error carousel in a speciﬁc unit. The multiplication gate unit learns\
    \ to open\nand close access to constant errors [52]. Researchers have used LSTM\
    \ for various purposes such as\ntopic predictions [53], price forecasting [54]\
    \ and the prediction of rainfall [55].\nLSTM uses memory cells to handle the long-term\
    \ temporal dependencies in the data. LSTM use\nthree types of gates: an input\
    \ (IGt), output (OGt) and forget gate (FGt) [56]. The logistic sigmoid\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 2990\n16 of 24\nfunction usually acts as the activation function of\
    \ these gates [57], and t is used for the current time.\nFigure 11a shows the\
    \ structure of basic LSTM unit.\nIGt = σg(Wi(ht−1, xt) + bi)\n(2)\nOGt = σg(Wo(ht−1,\
    \ xt) + bo)\n(3)\nFGt = σg(Wf (ht−1, x) + bf )\n(4)\nEquation (2) shows the function\
    \ for input gate. where Wi represents the weight for input and bi\nrepresents\
    \ the bias vector. Equation (3) shows the function for the output gate and Equation\
    \ (4) shows\nthe function for the forget gate. σg represents the sigmoid activation\
    \ function and ht−1 represents the\nhidden state as the present time in these\
    \ equations.\n(a) Long short-term memory (LSTM)\n(b) Gated recurrent unit (GRU)\n\
    Figure 11. Architecture of basic LSTM and GRU units.\nGRU is the modiﬁed version\
    \ of LSTM. It combines the two gates (input and forget) of LSTM into a\nsingle\
    \ update gate, and thus has only two gates: reset (RGt) and update gate (UGt)\
    \ [58]. The number\nof tensor operations in GRU is less than LSTM; thus, it takes\
    \ less time to train. Researchers have\nused GRU for various purposes such as\
    \ transaction fraud detection [59], prediction of sea surface\ntemperature [60]\
    \ and fault diagnosis [61]. GRU works efﬁciently on sequential problems.\nRGt\
    \ = σg(Wr(ht−1, xt) + br)\n(5)\nUGt = σg(Wu(ht−1, xt) + bu)\n(6)\nEquations (5)\
    \ and (6) show the function for the reset and update gates, respectively, where\
    \ x denotes\nthe input , W denotes the weight and b denotes the bias at time t.\n\
    4.7. GA-Based Hybrid Deep Learning Model\nWe have proposed a hybrid deep learning\
    \ model that uses GA as an optimizing algorithm for\nfeature selection. It ensemble\
    \ the predictions from LSTM and GRU models.\nAlgorithm 2 explains the pseudo-code\
    \ for the GA-based hybrid RNN model. It initializes by\nsetting the evolution\
    \ counter c = 0 and setting the maximum evolution C and randomly generates M\n\
    individuals as the initial group P (0). Then, the LSTM and GRU models are trained\
    \ and the ﬁtness\nafter ensembling them is computed. If the termination criterion\
    \ is achieved, then the output of optimal\nparameters is given; otherwise, an\
    \ increment in C is performed, and the other three functions of the GA\nare applied.\
    \ The selection operator is applied to the group. The purpose of selection is\
    \ to inherit the\noptimized individuals to the next generation directly or to\
    \ generate new individuals through pairing\nand crossover to the next generation.\
    \ The selection operation is based on the assessment of the ﬁtness\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 2990\n17 of 24\nof the individuals in the group. After that, the crossover\
    \ operator is applied to the group. The crossover\noperator plays a central role\
    \ in Genetic Algorithms. Finally, the mutation operator is applied to the\ngroup;\
    \ that is, for some individuals in the population of the string locus, a gene\
    \ is used for a change in\nvalue. After the selection, crossover and mutation\
    \ operations, the population P (c) obtains the next\ngeneration population P (t\
    \ + 1). If c = C, the individual with the most exceptional ﬁtness gained in the\n\
    evolution process is used as the optimal solution output to terminate the calculation;\
    \ this trained model\nwill be used to forecast the supply and demand and recommend\
    \ the best retailers to the end customers.\nAlgorithm 2 Pseudo code for the GA-based\

    5. Performance Evaluation\nWe have used an open-source dataset [62] to evaluate\
    \ the performance of the proposed ADL\nmodel. The time-series data consist of\
    \ daily sales data for two years from February 2018 to February\n2020. We have\
    \ used our proposed ADL model to understand the sales pattern for a speciﬁc store.\n\
    Figure 12 shows the forecasting results of sales data, where blue lines represent\
    \ the actual sales,\nand orange lines represent the forecasted results. The graph\
    \ shows that the model predicts sales data\naccurately. We split the data into\
    \ training and testing parts; then, we trained our model and evaluated\nits performance\
    \ using the test data. We observed a signiﬁcant improvement in the RMSE values\
    \ of\nthe proposed model. with values of 872.56, 819.65, and 512.21 with LSTM,\
    \ GRU, and the introduced\nhybrid models, respectively. The forecasting results\
    \ chart depicts actual data and prediction results as\na single trending component.\
    \ This demonstrates that the proposed model is robust and performs well\nunder\
    \ different seasonal effects.\nWe have conducted several experiments by using\
    \ different performance matrices to evaluate the\nperformance of our proposed\
    \ private blockchain system. For this purpose, we used an open-source\nsimulation\
    \ tool by IBM called Hyperledger Caliper [63]. For our experimental purpose, we\
    \ created\nthree groups of 200, 400, and 800 nodes. We recorded the percentile\
    \ latency (in milliseconds) of the\nproposed blockchain platform in the median,\
    \ minimum, and maximum time.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n18 of 24\nFigure 12. Forecasting\
    \ results of sales data.\nFigure 13 depicts the bar graph of three groups. The\
    \ chart shows that the network exhibits a\nchange in latency with an increasing\
    \ number of users; however, this will not affect the performance\nof the system.\
    \ The median values for the group of 200, 400, and 800 users were recorded as\
    \ 198, 216,\nand 768 ms, respectively, whereas the minimum values were 81, 69,\
    \ and 164. We have observed a\nmassive gap in the maximum amount for the group\
    \ of 800 users, which was 987 ms longer than that of\n400 users. Latency evaluation\
    \ results indicate that with an increase in the number of users, the system\n\
    exhibits an increase in the latency.\nFigure 13. Latency for the query “get request\
    \ transaction”.\nWe also performed simulation experiments to determine the response\
    \ time of the three user\ngroups. Figure 14 shows the response time in ms on the\
    \ Y-axis and elapsed time on the X-axis. We\nran simulations with a 100 millisecond\
    \ granularity. In general, the response time increases with\nthe increase in the\
    \ number of users when simultaneous system requests occur. The response time\n\
    evaluation results indicate that, despite the rise in the number of users, the\
    \ response time remains\nstable. This ﬁgure illustrates that the response time\
    \ is almost the same for the groups of 200 and 400\nusers, but as we increased\
    \ it to 800, we observed a signiﬁcant change in the response time. When we\nincreased\
    \ the number of users and the load on the system increased, we noted a delay in\
    \ response\ntime; however, in a private network, the number of users remains limited,\
    \ and this will therefore not\naffect the performance of the system.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 2990\n19 of 24\nFigure 14. Response time for different simultaneous\
    \ requests from three user groups.\nWe performed the resource utilization analysis\
    \ to determine the CPU and memory consumption.\nWe also recorded the trafﬁc in\
    \ and out which was exhibited in 10 iterations by the proposed system.\nTable\
    \ 2 shows the resource utilization analysis of the proposed method. Resource allocation\
    \ does not\napply to the bench client. We can observe that CA and ICA do not consume\
    \ many resources in terms\nof memory or network. Administrator peers usually require\
    \ more resources because they manage the\nnetwork, and the same is true with the\
    \ CouchDB, which is used as a database of the system. The trafﬁc\nﬂow and resource\
    \ utilization of the CPU and memory do not reach the higher or lower limits; thus,\n\
    the network can easily handle a large number of users. The resource utilization\
    \ analysis results indicate\nthat the resource occupation rate of the proposed\
    \ private blockchain network is low; due to the low\nusage of memory and trafﬁc\
    \ ﬂow, it provides a comfortable user experience, and it is highly reliable.\n\

    The world population is increasing rapidly. To meet the requirements of food for\
    \ this number of\npeople, there is an urgent need for revolutionary innovations\
    \ in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Increasing\nnumbers of people around the world understand\
    \ the utility of the blockchain, IoT, and AI and have\nstarted to use these innovative\
    \ technologies in their daily lives. Industrial IoT and advanced deep\nlearning\
    \ approaches will completely reshape the global economy; this will trigger a new\
    \ agricultural\nSensors 2020, 20, 2990\n20 of 24\nrevolution. The replacement\
    \ of the paper tracking system means that we could have access to a\ntracking\
    \ system with data “from farm to fork” within seconds.\nThe functions of the proposed\
    \ management system take advantage of the IoT, blockchain, and AI\ntechnologies.\
    \ It provides meat product tracking management functions with the comprehensive\n\
    management of all user information. It has the option of meat product price management\
    \ at all\nlevels, including a single batch of meat product prices, as well as\
    \ management and traceability\ninformation management. It offers all levels of\
    \ authority management and can be set freely with\nauthority. Blockchain and AI\
    \ have proved themself to be astonishing technologies; however, some\nchallenges\
    \ need to be addressed. Both applications demand a great deal of expertise, which\
    \ is difﬁcult\nfor small and medium-size organizations. There is a lack of awareness\
    \ about the BCT, and no proper\ntraining platforms exist for educating non-specialized\
    \ people. Another challenge is the lack of trust in\ncryptocurrencies; many countries\
    \ have banned cryptocurrency on the state level. Some regulations\nshould be made\
    \ on the governmental level to allow the use of this technology in the food sector.\n\
    Many legal constraints are also involved in the implementation of such a system.\
    \ Another problem\nis to ensure that farm owners must share the right information\
    \ on the network. The involvement of\ngovernments could address these challenges.\
    \ The government must take proper measures to ensure\nthat complete data should\
    \ be shared between all stakeholders across all supply chains, because if\nsomeone\
    \ is not willing to be a part of this transparent chain, this could indicate nefarious\
    \ motives.\nBy implementing BCT in the meat supply chain, an environment of fair\
    \ competition and a transparent\nmarket place can be created in which users can\
    \ search for meat products with full conﬁdence, and this\nwill ensure safe and\
    \ healthy food “from farm to fork”. According to Lin et al. [64], the next step\n\
    in IoT-enabled e-agriculture schemes is the combination of IoT and e-agriculture\
    \ with blockchain\ninfrastructure. We can create a trusted and secure sustainable\
    \ agricultural environment with the\nguarantee of the transparency of data by\
    \ using BCT and IoT. We can engineer the monitoring of data\nstored in a distributed\
    \ blockchain reliable using this prototype.\n7. Conclusions\nThis article proposed\
    \ an optimized supply chain provenance system for Industry 4.0 in the food\nsector\
    \ using state-of-the-art technologies such as IoT, blockchain, and advanced deep\
    \ learning. It\nprovides access to the end-users to verify their food before consumption;\
    \ they can check the origin and\nsupply chain of the food on their table. Taking\
    \ advantage of advanced deep learning, the participants\ncan optimize their businesses\
    \ by obtaining future forecasts and trends of food demands; they can also\nmanage\
    \ their assets on the presented immutable private ledger. Every transaction on\
    \ this ledger is\ntimestamped and encrypted, and IoT-enabled warehouses, supply\
    \ trucks, and retailer shops provide\nthe guarantee that the product was treated\
    \ at the proper temperature. We have discussed the system\nmodel and architecture\
    \ of the proposed system. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed\n\
    scheme with different scales of users. We have obtained improved results with\
    \ the proposed system.\nWe created three groups of 200, 400, and 800 users and\
    \ recorded the percentile latency, response time,\nand resource utilization by\
    \ the system. We observed that our proposed method could handle a large\nnumber\
    \ of users, and that this will not affect the performance of the system. In future,\
    \ this work can\nbe enhanced by investigating more complex business networks.\n\

    The forecast for future 10 years’ traffic demand shows an increase in 1000 scales\
    \ and more than 100 billion connections of Internet\nof Things, which imposes\
    \ a big challenge for future mobile communication technology beyond year 2020.\
    \ The mobile industry is\nstruggling in the challenges of high capacity demand\
    \ but low cost for future mobile network when it starts to enable a connected\n\
    mobile world. 5G is targeted to shed light on these contradictory demands towards\
    \ year 2020. This paper firstly forecasts the vision\nof mobile communication’s\
    \ application in the daily life of the society and then figures out the traffic\
    \ trends and demands for next\n10 years from the Mobile Broadband (MBB) service\
    \ and Internet of Things (IoT) perspective, respectively. The requirements from\n\
    the specific service and user demands are analyzed, and the specific requirements\
    \ from typical usage scenarios are calculated by\nthe defined performance indicators.\
    \ To achieve the target of affordable 5G service, the requirements from network\
    \ deployment and\noperation perspective are also captured. Finally, the capabilities\
    \ and the efficiency requirements of the 5G system are demonstrated\nas a flower.\
    \ To realize the vision of 5G, “information a finger away, everything in touch,”\
    \ 5G will provide the fiber-like access data\nrate, “zero” latency user experience,\
    \ and connecting to more than 100 billion devices and deliver a consistent experience\
    \ across a\nvariety of scenarios with the improved energy and cost efficiency\
    \ by over a hundred of times.\n1. Introduction\nThe first generation of mobile\
    \ communication system based\non analog signal was born in the 1980s, and it helped\n\
    people get rid of the shackles of telephone line. In the 1990s\nmore efficient\
    \ second-generation (2G) mobile communi-\ncation systems based on digital communication\
    \ occurred,\nand after that personal mobile communications have had a\nrapid development\
    \ on a global scale. After 2000, with the\ndeployment of 3G systems, people can\
    \ enjoy faster mobile\nInternet experience, such as video telephony. When it comes\n\
    to 2010, deployment of Long Term Evolution (LTE) based 4G\ncommercial network\
    \ further enhanced the system capacity\nand user experience. According to the\
    \ statistics of Global\nTD-LTE Initiative (GTI), 364 LTE commercial networks have\n\
    been launched by the third quarter of 2015. The evolution\nmap of mobile communications\
    \ since 1980s is summarized\nin Figure 1. With the IMT-Advanced (IMT-A) systems\
    \ being\ndeployed in the world, the 5th-Generation (5G) mobile com-\nmunication\
    \ technologies are emerging into research fields.\nIn order to drive future development\
    \ of mobile communi-\ncation techniques, the METIS (Mobile and Wireless Commu-\n\
    nications Enablers for the Twenty-Twenty Information Soci-\nety) project [1] of\
    \ European Union started research work of\n5G at the end of 2012. In China, IMT-2020\
    \ promotion group\nwas founded in April of 2013. IMT-2020 promotion group\nwill\
    \ serve as a platform to promote the 5G study. Its target\nis to organize domestic\
    \ forces to actively carry out interna-\ntional cooperation and to jointly promote\
    \ the international\ndevelopment of 5G. In Korea, Samsung tested and verified\n\
    the technical feasibility of millimeter wave in the bands of\nabout 28 GHz [2].\
    \ Other possible candidate technologies such\nas massive MIMO [3], novel multiple\
    \ access [4], and new\nchannel coding [5–7] have attracted more and more interest.\n\
    The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has also\nstarted its study on\
    \ the International Mobile Telecommuni-\ncation system towards 2020 (IMT-2020)\
    \ since 2013 [8]. Third\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) will start its\
    \ study and\nstandardization work on IMT-2020 from March 2016 [9].\nHindawi Publishing\

    \ communication system could be built to meet the\nmarket demand of year beyond\
    \ 2020.\n2. Vision for Mobile Communication\ntowards 2020\nThe global deployment\
    \ of LTE cultivates the mobile users to\nbe used to the mobile data in their daily\
    \ life tremendously. The\nvideo service and social applications, for example,\
    \ WeChat,\nFacebook, and Twitter, have changed our life very much with\nthe capabilities\
    \ of LTE, especially high data rate and low\nlatency. It is believed that the\
    \ mobile communication will\npenetrate into every element of future society and\
    \ create\nan all-dimensional, user-centered information ecosystem. A\nfully mobile\
    \ and connected society is expected in the near\nfuture, which will be characterized\
    \ by a tremendous amount\nof growth in connectivity, traffic volume, and a much\
    \ broader\nrange of usage scenarios [10].\nAccordingly, the Mobile Broadband (MBB)\
    \ service and\nthe Internet of Things (IoT) will be the two main drivers in\n\
    the future development of mobile communications, and they\nwill provide a broad\
    \ prospect for the next generation mobile\ncommunication system (5G), the overall\
    \ vision of which is\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMobile Broadband service disrupted\
    \ the traditional busi-\nness model of mobile communications, enabling unprece-\n\
    dented user experiences and making a profound impact on\nevery aspect of people’s\
    \ work and life. Looking ahead to year\n2020 and beyond, MBB service will promote\
    \ the continued\nevolution of the way humans interact and provide users with\n\
    ultimate experience through more immersive services such\nas augmented reality,\
    \ virtual reality, ultra-high-definition\n(UHD) 3D video, and mobile cloud. The\
    \ further development\nof mobile Internet will trigger the growth of mobile traffic\
    \ by\na magnitude of thousands in the future and promote a new\nwave of upgrades\
    \ and a revolution in mobile communications\ntechnologies and the industry as\
    \ a whole.\nLooking ahead to the year 2020 and beyond, there will be\nexplosive\
    \ growth in mobile data traffic as shown in Figure 3.\nIt is estimated that the\
    \ global mobile data traffic will grow\nby more than 200 times from 2010 to 2020\
    \ and by nearly\n20,000 times from 2010 to 2030. In China, the growth factors\n\
    are projected to be even higher, with mobile data traffic\nbeing expected to grow\
    \ by more than 300 times from 2010\nto 2020 and by more than 40,000 times from\
    \ 2010 to 2030.\nFor developed cities and hotspots in China, the growth of\nmobile\
    \ data traffic will exceed the projected average growth\nfor all of China. For\
    \ example, from 2010 to 2020 in Shanghai,\nthe mobile data traffic is projected\
    \ to grow by 600 times.\nIn Beijing and during this same period, it is estimated\
    \ that\nhotspot traffic may grow by up to 1,000 times.\nThe IoT has extended the\
    \ scope of mobile commu-\nnications services from interpersonal communications\
    \ to\nsmart interconnection between things and between people\nand things, allowing\
    \ mobile communications technologies to\npenetrate into broader industries and\
    \ fields. Looking ahead\nto the year 2020 and beyond, applications such as mobile\n\
    health, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), smart home, industrial\ncontrol, and environmental\
    \ monitoring will drive the explo-\nsive growth of IoT applications, facilitating\
    \ hundreds of\nbillions of devices to connect to a network creating a true\nChinese\

    \ of unprecedented scale and instill infinite vitality\nto mobile communications.\
    \ Meanwhile, the massive amount\nof interconnected devices and the diversified\
    \ IoT services will\nalso pose new challenges to mobile communications.\nAs illustrated\
    \ in Figure 4, the total number of devices\nconnected by the global mobile communications\
    \ network\nwill reach 100 billion in the future. By 2020, it is projected that\n\
    the number of mobile terminals around the world will surpass\n10 billion, of which\
    \ China will contribute over 2 billion. The\nnumber of IoT connections will also\
    \ expand rapidly, reaching\nthe size of the global population of 7 billion in\
    \ 2020, of which\nChina will contribute 1.5 billion. By 2030, the number of\n\
    global IoT connections will reach 100 billion, of which China\nwill make up over\
    \ 20 billion. Among all types of terminals,\nsmart phones will contribute most\
    \ of the traffic and IoT\nterminals will contribute less, even though the number\
    \ of\ndevices is much larger.\nTowards year 2020 and beyond, the typical trends\
    \ could\nbe summarized as follows.\n(i) Explosive Growth of Data Traffic. There\
    \ will be explo-\nsive growth in traffic; the global data traffic will\nincrease\
    \ by more than 200 times from 2010 to 2020\nand about 20000 times from 2010 to\
    \ 2030.\n(ii) Great Increase of Devices in Connection. While smart\nphones are\
    \ expected to remain as the main per-\nsonal devices, the number of other kinds\
    \ of devices,\nincluding wearable devices and MTC devices, will\ncontinuously\
    \ increase.\n(iii) Continuous Emergence of New Services. Different\nkinds of services,\
    \ for example, services from enter-\nprises, from vertical industries, and from\
    \ Internet\ncompanies, will be exploited.\nTo meet the service and market demand\
    \ towards year\n2020 and beyond, the IMT-2020 is targeted to be deployed by\n\
    year 2020 (5G) and meet new and unprecedented demands\nbeyond the capability of\
    \ previous generation systems. 5G\nwill break through the limitation of time and\
    \ space to\nenable an immersive and interactive user experience. 5G will\nalso\

    \ in Figure 2, the future mobile communication\nsystem will penetrate to every\
    \ corner of the society and bring\nus the immersive user experience. To derive\
    \ the requirements\nfor the 5G system, the typical service and user demand will\n\
    be the mandatory requirements for the 5G, while the typical\ndeployment scenarios\
    \ will also bring some bottlenecks to\nbe solved by 5G system, especially from\
    \ the domestic and\ncommercial application perspective, for example, the cost\n\
    and efficiency. This section identifies the service and user\ndemands beyond year\
    \ 2020 according to the possible popular\nservices and user behavior in 5G era\
    \ and derives the specific\nrequirements of 5G system from the typical usage scenarios\n\
    perspective.\n3.1. Services and User Demands. Mobile Internet is aiming\nat people-oriented\
    \ communications with a focus on user\nexperience. Towards the year 2020 and beyond,\
    \ the increasing\npopularity of ultra-high-definition (UHD) and 3D and video\n\
    immersion will significantly drive up the data rates. For\nexample, with a hundredfold\
    \ compression, the transmission\nof 8 K (3D) video will require a transmission\
    \ rate close to\n1 Gbps. Services, such as augmented reality, desktop cloud,\n\
    and online gaming, will not only pose a challenge for uplink\nand downlink data\
    \ transmission rates but also generate\nstringent demand for the so-called imperceptible\
    \ latency. In\nthe future, vast amounts of individuals and office data will be\n\
    stored in the cloud. Such massive data activity will require\ntransmission rates\
    \ to be comparable to optical fiber com-\nmunications, which will lead to enormous\
    \ traffic challenges\nfor mobile communications networks particularly in hotspot\n\
    areas. Over-the-top (OTT) services, such as social network-\ning, will be counted\
    \ among leading applications going for-\nward, and the associated frequently occurring\
    \ small packets\nwill devour signaling resources. At the same time, consumers\n\
    will continue to demand better experiences on mobile\ncommunications wherever\
    \ they are. A consistent service\nexperience is expected in all kinds of scenarios,\
    \ including\nultra-dense scenarios such as stadiums, open-air gatherings\nand\
    \ concerts, and high-speed moving scenarios such as high-\nspeed trains, vehicles,\
    \ and subways.\nIoT is focused on communications between things and\nbetween things\
    \ and people, involving not only individual\nusers, but also a large number of\
    \ various vertical industrial\ncustomers. The IoT services types and relevant\
    \ requirements\nof IoT services are very diverse. For services such as smart\n\
    home, smart grid, environmental monitoring, smart agricul-\nture, and smart metering,\
    \ the network will be required to sup-\nport a massive amount of device connections\
    \ and frequently\noccurring small data packets. Services like video surveillance\n\
    and mobile health will have strict requirements on transmis-\nsion rates, while\
    \ services such as IoV and industrial control\nwill demand millisecond-level latency\
    \ and nearly 100% reli-\nability. In addition, many IoT devices may be deployed\
    \ in\nremote areas such as mountains, forests, and bodies of waters\nor in areas\
    \ where transmission losses can be a problem, such\nas indoor corners, basements,\
    \ and tunnels. Therefore, the\ncoverage of mobile communications network needs\
    \ to be fur-\nther enhanced. In order to penetrate into more IoT services,\n5G\
    \ should be more flexible and more scalable, to support\nmassive device connections\
    \ and meet diverse user require-\nments.\nUsers expect better, yet more cost-effective,\
    \ services and\nexperiences with mobile Internet and the IoT. In addition to\n\
    satisfying cost and experience demands, 5G will also need to\nmeet extremely high\
    \ security requirements, particularly for\nservices such as e-banking, security\
    \ monitoring, safe driving,\nand mobile health. 5G will also be able to support\
    \ lower power\nChinese Journal of Engineering\n5\nDense residence\nGbps user experienced\

    many aspects of life in the future, such as residence, office,\nleisure, and transportation.\
    \ The 5G scenarios include at\nleast dense residential areas, office towers, stadiums,\
    \ open-\nair gatherings, subways, fast ways, high-speed railways, and\nwide-area\
    \ coverage. These scenarios, which are characterized\nby high traffic volume density\
    \ or high connection density or\nhigh mobility, may be quite challenging for 5G\
    \ as described\nin Figure 5.\nSome typical services, such as augmented reality,\
    \ virtual\nreality, ultra-high-definition videos, cloud storage, Internet of\n\
    Vehicles, smart home, and OTT services, will occur in these\nscenarios. The performance\
    \ requirements for 5G are derived\nfor each scenario, according to the predicted\
    \ distribution of\nusers, percentage of different services, and service require-\n\
    ments such as data rate and latency. The key performance\nindicators for 5G are\
    \ listed in Table 1, which include user\nexperienced data rate, connection density,\
    \ end-to-end delay,\ntraffic volume density, mobility, and peak date rate.\n4.\
    \ Sustainability and Efficiency Requirements\nTo provide the immersive services\
    \ to the users in an afford-\nable way, the cost and efficiency of 5G system need\
    \ to\nbe considered when it is deployed and maintained after\nthe commercial deployment.\
    \ As forecasted in Figure 3, the\nmobile data traffic by year 2020 could grow\
    \ by more than 1000\ntimes, while it is not possible for the user to pay for the\
    \ mobile\ndata approximately to the data volume. To achieve this, the\nhigh cost\
    \ efficiency of the network will be a key to make a\nsuccessful 5G. To reduce\
    \ the cost per bit of 5G, the spectrum\nefficiency of 5G, the flexibility to adaptation\

    \ are highly expected from 5G.\n4.1. Sustainability. Several problems are anticipated\
    \ if today’s\nnetworks are used to handle the explosive development of\nmobile\
    \ Internet and IoT as follows.\n(i) The energy efficiency level, overall cost\
    \ per bit, and\ncomplexity of network deployment and maintenance\ncannot effectively\
    \ handle the 1000-time traffic growth\nand a massive amount of connected devices\
    \ in the\nfuture next decade.\n(ii) Coexistence of multiple radio access technologies\n\
    (RAT) causes increased complexity and degraded\nuser experience.\n(iii) Existing\
    \ networks cannot realize accurate monitoring\nof network resources and effective\
    \ awareness of ser-\nvices, and therefore they cannot intelligently fulfill the\n\
    diversified requirements of future users and services.\n(iv) Widely distributed\
    \ and fragmented spectrum will\ncause interference and coexistence complexity.\n\
    To solve these problems, 5G should have the following\ncapabilities to achieve\
    \ sustainability. In terms of network\nconstruction and deployment, 5G needs to\n\
    (i) provide higher network capacity and better coverage,\nwhile decreasing the\
    \ complexity and cost of network\ndeployment, especially the deployment of ultra-dense\n\
    networks;\n(ii) have a flexible and scalable architecture to adapt to the\ndiverse\
    \ needs of users and services;\n(iii) make flexible and efficient use of various\
    \ spec-\ntrum resources, including paired and unpaired spec-\ntrum, refarmed spectrum\
    \ and new spectrum, low-\nfrequency and high-frequency bands, and licensed\nand\
    \ unlicensed bands;\n(iv) have stronger device-connection capabilities to deal\n\
    with the access requirements of huge amounts of IoT\ndevices.\nIn terms of operation\
    \ and maintenance (O&M), 5G needs\nto\n(i) improve network energy efficiency and\
    \ the O&M cost\nper bit to cope with data traffic growth and the diverse\nneeds\
    \ of various services and applications;\nTable 2: 5G key efficiency indicators.\n\

    \ variety of network security solutions to\nmeet the needs of all types of devices\
    \ and services of\nmobile Internet and IoT.\n4.2. Efficiency Requirements. Spectrum\
    \ utilization, energy\nconsumption, and cost are the three key factors which\n\
    must be addressed in sustainable mobile communication\nnetworks. In order to achieve\
    \ sustainability, 5G needs to make\nsignificant improvements in the following\
    \ aspects:\n(i) Spectrum efficiency: 3∼5 times.\n(ii) Energy efficiency: 100+\
    \ times.\n(iii) Cost efficiency: 100+ times.\nThe definitions of these efficiency\
    \ indicators are listed in\nTable 2.\n5. Key Capabilities of 5G\n5G systems must\
    \ dramatically outperform previous genera-\ntion systems. 5G should support the\
    \ following:\n(i) User experienced data rate: 0.1∼1 Gbps.\n(ii) Connection density:\
    \ 1 million connections per square\nkilometer.\n(iii) End-to-end latency: millisecond\
    \ level.\n(iv) Traffic volume density: tens of Gbps per square\nkilometer.\nChinese\

    (vi) Peak data rate: tens of Gbps.\nAmong these requirements, user experienced\
    \ data rate,\nconnection density, and end-to-end latency are the three\nmost fundamental\
    \ ones. Meanwhile, 5G needs to significantly\nimprove the efficiency of network\
    \ deployment and opera-\ntions. Compared with 4G, 5G should have 3 to 5 times’\n\
    improvement on spectrum efficiency and more than 100\ntimes’ improvement on energy\
    \ and cost efficiency.\nThe performance requirements and efficiency require-\n\
    ments define the key capabilities of 5G, which can be\nillustrated as a “blooming\
    \ flower” in Figure 6. The petals and\nleaves rely on each other. The petals represent\
    \ the six key\ncapabilities in terms of performance and can fulfill the diverse\n\
    requirements of future services and scenarios. The leaves\nrepresent the three\
    \ key capabilities in terms of efficiency and\ncan guarantee the sustainable development\
    \ of 5G. The top of\neach petal means the maximum value of the corresponding\n\
    capability.\n6. Candidate Technologies and Spectrum\nTo achieve the above 5G requirement\
    \ objectives, there are\nsome emerging technologies proposed by many organiza-\n\
    tions and companies including the following:\n(i) Novel multiple access, such\
    \ as SCMA (Sparse Code\nMultiple Access), MUSA (Multiuser Shared Access),\nPDMA\
    \ (Pattern Division Multiple Access), and\nRSMA (Resource Spread Multiple Access)\
    \ (this kind\nof technologies can increase the spectrum efficiency,\nuser experienced\
    \ data rate, system capacity, and\nconnection density).\n(ii) New waveforms, like\
    \ filtered-OFDM, UFMC (Uni-\nversal Filtered Multicarrier), window-OFDM, and so\n\
    forth, to maximize the spectrum utilization.\n(iii) Massive MIMO technologies\
    \ to increase the spec-\ntrum efficiency, user experienced data rate, and sys-\n\
    tem capacity.\n(iv) New channel coding such as polar code and LDPC\n(Low Density\
    \ Parity Check Code), to increase the\nspectrum efficiency.\n(v) Software defined\
    \ air interface and end-to-end net-\nwork slicing to increase the system flexibility\
    \ to\nsupport all kinds of services and to enhance the\noverall network cost efficiency.\n\
    There are three solutions to satisfy the increasing spec-\ntrum demands for 5G\
    \ services. Identification of more spectra\nboth below and above 6 GHz for IMT\
    \ is the solution with\nhighest priority. Bands below 6 GHz are the core spectrum\n\
    bands used for IMT, with C band being a key band in the\nnear future. The second\
    \ one is to refarm spectrum used by\nlegacy systems. The third one is to promote\
    \ new technologies\nto share spectrum of the other radio services.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    5G will be able to sustainably satisfy the requirement of the\n1000-time traffic\
    \ growth. 5G will provide users with fiber-like\naccess data rate and “zero” latency\
    \ user experience. 5G will\nbe capable of connecting 100 billion devices. 5G will\
    \ be able\n8\nChinese Journal of Engineering\nto deliver a consistent experience\
    \ across a variety of scenarios\nincluding the cases of ultra-high traffic volume\
    \ density, ultra-\nhigh connection density, and ultra-high mobility. 5G will\n\
    also be able to provide intelligent optimization based on\nservices and users\
    \ awareness and will improve energy and\ncost efficiency by over a hundred of\
    \ times, enabling us\nall to realize the vision of 5G, “information a finger away,\n\
    everything in touch.”\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare that they have\

    \ Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have huge potential\n\
    to efﬁciently manage the automated operation of the internet of things (IoT) nodes\
    \ deployed in\nsmart cities. In smart cities, the major IoT applications are smart\
    \ trafﬁc monitoring, smart waste\nmanagement, smart buildings and patient healthcare\
    \ monitoring. The small size IoT nodes based on\nlow power Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1)\
    \ standard and wireless sensor networks (WSN) (IEEE 802.15.4)\nstandard are generally\
    \ used for transmission of data to a remote location using gateways. The WSN\n\
    based IoT (WSN-IoT) design problems include network coverage and connectivity\
    \ issues, energy\nconsumption, bandwidth requirement, network lifetime maximization,\
    \ communication protocols\nand state of the art infrastructure. In this paper,\
    \ the authors propose machine learning methods as\nan optimization tool for regular\
    \ WSN-IoT nodes deployed in smart city applications. As per the\nauthor’s knowledge,\
    \ this is the ﬁrst in-depth literature survey of all ML techniques in the ﬁeld\
    \ of low\npower consumption WSN-IoT for smart cities. The results of this unique\
    \ survey article show that the\nsupervised learning algorithms have been most\
    \ widely used (61%) as compared to reinforcement\nlearning (27%) and unsupervised\
    \ learning (12%) for smart city applications.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT);\

    \ and the Internet of Things\n(IoT) enabling technologies to collect data from\
    \ different locations and uses to enhance the\nquality of life of the people.\
    \ The low power, low data rate wireless sensor networks (WSN)\nare used for monitoring\
    \ and control applications in smart cities. The WSN nodes are used\nas the underlying\
    \ technology infrastructure in the IoT. In the IoT, the “things” refer to the\n\
    tiny embedded physical sensing devices (i.e., WSN nodes) connected to the internet\
    \ to\nperform a speciﬁc application. Currently, a new revolutionary technique\
    \ known as artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is evolving\
    \ as the future of fully automated\nIoT applications. Machine learning is a part\
    \ of AI, in which, the computer algorithms learn\nby themselves by improving from\
    \ past experiences. A detailed survey of ML algorithms\nwas performed in [1] until\
    \ the year 2013. As the ML and IoT, technologies are emerging\nrapidly, therefore,\
    \ the authors extend their survey work also. The IoT applications in\nsmart cities\
    \ are smart trafﬁc monitoring [2], smart grids [3], smart waste management [4],\n\
    smart agriculture [5], smart medical healthcare [6], etc. Table 1 provides a full\

    \ in WSN based IoT (WSN-IoT) are fully autonomous operation,\nmaximum network\
    \ lifetime, energy efﬁciency, quality of service (QoS), cross-layer optimiza-\n\
    tion, high bandwidth requirement, sensor data analysis, cloud computing, communication\n\
    protocol design, etc. Currently, the industrial IoT (IIoT) or industry 4.0 is\
    \ the biggest\nrevolution for smart industries, smart manufacturing sector, automobile\
    \ sector, smart cities\nand medical healthcare sector. Worldwide, various major\
    \ companies like Microsoft, Google\nand Amazon are working on the development\
    \ of AI and ML-based algorithms in advanced\nIoT applications for smart cities.\n\
    Machine learning can be applied in WSN-IoT for dynamic updating of routing tables\n\
    in WSNs, node localization in mobile WSN-IoT nodes, identiﬁcation and separation\
    \ of\nfaulty nodes for network optimization and prediction of the amount of energy\
    \ harvesting\nin energy harvesting WSN (EH-WSN). Through this paper, the authors\
    \ have tried to answer\nthe following research questions: Why machine learning\
    \ methods are used in WSN-IoT?\nWhat is its superiority of using ML over traditional\
    \ optimization methods in WSN-IoT?\nWhy is the smart city a typical use case of\
    \ IoT applications?\nIoT offers new opportunities for smart cities to use data\
    \ to manage trafﬁc, reduce\npollution and make better use of infrastructure. The\
    \ following are the advantages of using\nmachine learning in traditional WSN-IoT:\n\
    •\nWSNs are generally deployed in a dynamically changing environment. Therefore,\n\
    self-adaption to the new environment is expected from a fully automated IoT scenario.\n\
    •\nUnknown parameter monitoring requires automatic adjustment of network topology\n\
    and conﬁgurations, e.g., temperature measurement in a glacier or volcano monitoring.\n\
    •\nLack of accurate mathematical models of the unknown parameters in WSN-IoT.\n\
    •\nWSN-IoT deals with a large amount of sensor data, therefore the correlation\
    \ between\ndifferent data set may be of critical concern.\nElectronics 2021, 10,\
    \ 1012\n3 of 22\n•\nIntegration of WSN in IoT using cloud-based services for better\
    \ monitoring and con-\ntrol.\n•\nFuture predictions and possible actions in WSN-IoT.\n\
    •\nThe IoT generates a large amount of data from millions of sensor nodes. Machine\n\
    learning is powered by data and generates useful information from previous data.\n\
    Machine learning uses past IoT data to identify hidden patterns and builds models\n\
    that help predict future behavior and events.\nAs WSN-IoT are resource-limited\
    \ (ﬁnite bandwidth and power availability) therefore,\nthere are some limitations\
    \ for running ML-based inferences on IoT nodes also such as:\n•\nA large number\
    \ of computations are required to process the more amount of data,\nhence computation\
    \ complexity increases.\n•\nAdditional power consumption.\n•\nTraining of WSN-IoT\
    \ nodes for various ML algorithms requires complex operations\nand multi-domain\
    \ skilled programmers.\nThe following are the contributions of this survey article\
    \ in the ﬁeld of WSN-IoT:\n•\nIn this paper, ML techniques are proposed as an\
    \ optimized solution for traditional\nWSN-IoT problems in smart cities.\n•\nDesign\
    \ guidelines of the WSN-IoT framework using AI and ML have been proposed.\n•\n\
    An in-depth literature survey of WSN-IoT in smart cities is presented in detail\
    \ for ML\nengineers and data scientists.\nThis paper is organized as follows:\
    \ Section 2 provides operation of WSN-IoT in smart\ncities, Section 3 provides\
    \ machine learning for WSN-IoT, Section 4 provides open research\nissues in WSN-IoT,\
    \ which can be solved by machine learning techniques, Section 5 provides\na literature\
    \ survey of machine learning in WSN, Section 6 provides a summary of ML\ntechniques\
    \ in WSN-IoT, Section 7 provides the survey report and, ﬁnally, Section 8 provides\n\
    the conclusion and future work.\n2. Wireless Sensor Networks Based Internet of\
    \ Things (WSN-IoT)\nThe operation of WSN-IoT in a smart city is shown in Figure\
    \ 1. Here, the WSN nodes\nare deployed in smart city applications such as smart\
    \ trafﬁc monitoring, smart grids in\nbuildings, remote health care monitoring,\
    \ smart agriculture and industrial applications.\nThe function of an IoT-WSN node\
    \ deployed in a smart city is to continuously monitor\nand control any physical\
    \ quantity like temperature, humidity, pressure, acceleration, etc.\nThe main\
    \ function of these sensor nodes is to sense the data and send it to the main\
    \ WSN-\nIoT gateway node. From the gateway node, the data is sent to the cloud\
    \ server. At the IoT\ncloud, cloud computing takes place. The IoT cloud is directly\
    \ connected to remote servers,\nuser mobile phones, computers, mobile phone towers,\
    \ etc. The IoT and machine learning\ntasks require a large amount of data processing\
    \ and memory requirements. Therefore, the\nIoT cloud server is designed as a high\
    \ processing, high-performance computer with huge\nstorage capacity. However,\
    \ the WSN end nodes have small computing capabilities with\nlimited processing,\
    \ small storage and ﬁnite non-rechargeable battery power supply.\nThe WSN-IoT\
    \ end nodes based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard have the maximum\ndata rate of\
    \ 250 kbps only. In WSN-IoT, the end nodes are powered by two AA-size bat-\nteries\
    \ (1.5 volts, 1000 mAh), and the gateway is connected to the mains power supply.\n\
    Furthermore, if the WSN-IoT nodes are powered by renewable energy harvesting power\n\
    supplies [7], then machine learning algorithms can also be utilized to predict\
    \ the future\navailable energy in IoT-WSNs. In the battery management system,\
    \ machine learning tech-\nniques can be used for tracking maximum power point\
    \ technique (MPPT) algorithms [8,9].\nAs these WSN sensor nodes generate a lot\
    \ of sensor data, therefore, machine learning\nalgorithms can also be applied\
    \ to them for data analysis, data prediction and other suit-\nable tasks.\nElectronics\

    \ renewable energy harvesting power \nsupplies [7], then machine learning algorithms\

    \ the features are classi-\nfied according to the requirement of the machine learning\
    \ process. Now some training \nFigure 3. Process ﬂow-chart of machine learning\
    \ in WSN-IoT.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1012\n7 of 22\n3.1. Training Process\nHere,\
    \ ﬁrst of all, data is acquired from a particular application. The features are\n\
    extracted from this raw data. For example, if the data is image data then the\
    \ colors,\npixels, brightness and contrast of all images database are extracted.\
    \ Then the features are\nclassiﬁed according to the requirement of the machine\
    \ learning process. Now some training\nexamples are applied to the basic initial\
    \ algorithms for their learning or improvement.\nThus, algorithms are trained\
    \ and optimized according to the data patterns.\n3.2. Testing Process\nNow the\
    \ next step is to deploy this trained WSN in any real-life application. In real\
    \ life,\nthe unknown data is taken as input and the features are extracted from\
    \ it. These extracted\nfeatures are applied to an already trained algorithm. The\
    \ output of the trained algorithm is\nclassiﬁed as data predictions.\n3.3. WSN\
    \ Actions\nFinally, based on predicted output data the necessary actions by the\
    \ WSN are decided.\n4. Open Research Problems in WSN-IoT Which Can Be Solved by\
    \ Machine\nLearning Techniques\nThe following are the currently open research\
    \ issues in WSN-IoT, which can be solved\nby ML techniques.\n4.1. IoT Node Localization\n\
    In a WSN scenario, the current location identiﬁcation of a sensor node is called\
    \ node\nlocalization. In mobile WSN nodes, path planning is a very important step.\
    \ Node local-\nization is considered a classiﬁcation problem because all the nodes\
    \ are divided (classiﬁed)\ninto range-based and range-free nodes. Several ML algorithms\
    \ like, SVM, K-NN and\nRL-based techniques (Q-learning, SARSA) are used in WSN-IoT\
    \ for node localization as a\nclassiﬁcation problem [31].\n4.2. IoT Node Coverage\
    \ and Connectivity\nIn a WSN scenario, the sensing coverage is the ﬁeld of interest\
    \ (FOI), in which at least\none sensor node covers all the points. Therefore,\
    \ the optimal placement of sensor nodes is\na design issue. To maximize the WSN\
    \ lifetime, the connectivity should be proper between\nthe neighbor nodes [32].\n\
    4.3. Routing Layer Issues\nThe processing for sending the data packets from one\
    \ node to another via intermediate\nnodes is called routing. In the routing process,\
    \ long routing tables are maintained by the\ngateway nodes, which consists of\
    \ the source and destination address of all the packets\nin the network. In WSN,\
    \ the sensed data is sent towards the main gateway node by the\nend nodes. If\
    \ the routing path is very long then unnecessary energy is wasted in a WSN\nnetwork.\
    \ Therefore, smart routing algorithms need to be designed carefully to ﬁnd the\n\
    optimal routes between end node and gateway nodes. Several machine learning techniques\n\
    such as decision tree, random forest, ANN, SVM and Bayesian learning are used\
    \ to ﬁnd\nthe optimal path in WSNs [33].\n4.4. MAC Layer Issues\nThe MAC layer\
    \ controls the medium accessing technique in WSN. The sensor MAC\n(SMAC) protocol\
    \ is generally used in WSN. Reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithms\nare\
    \ used for MAC protocol design in WSN. The RL-MAC techniques control the sleep,\n\
    wake, transmission and reception in sensor networks [34].\nElectronics 2021, 10,\
    \ 1012\n8 of 22\n4.5. Sensor Data Aggregation\nIn a smart city, thousands of small\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed to measure the same\nphysical quantity, e.g., temperature,\
    \ humidity, light, carbon dioxide (CO2) gases, etc.\nSeveral sensors may report\
    \ the same information to the gateway. This large amount of data\nis difﬁcult\
    \ to handle by the gateway. Therefore, sensor data aggregation is important in\n\
    WSNs for smart city applications. Data aggregation means collecting and summarizing\n\
    useful information from multiple sources. In this process, the data redundancy\
    \ and data\naccuracy are improved. Data aggregation saves the power consumption\
    \ of WSN nodes and\nhence improves the network lifetime also. Machine learning\
    \ is useful for data aggregation.\nThe cluster aggregates the data from the cluster\
    \ head and transmits it to the base station. ML\ntechniques based on artiﬁcial\
    \ neural networks (ANN) and quality (Q)-learning algorithms\nare useful for data\
    \ aggregation tasks in WSN-IoT [35].\n4.6. Event Monitoring and Target Detection\n\
    In a smart city application, the WSNs are deployed for event monitoring and target\n\
    detection such as intrusion detection and trafﬁc monitoring. In WSN, node failure,\
    \ target\nrecovery and tracking latency from sensing nodes are required. Various\
    \ ML techniques\nlike Bayesian, Q learning and genetic algorithms are used for\
    \ event monitoring and target\ntracking in WSNs. Applying, ML techniques in WSNs\
    \ can be useful to detect an event or\ntarget from the complex image sensor data\
    \ [36].\n4.7. Energy Harvesting\nEnergy harvesting is the process of extracting\
    \ environmental energy from the sun,\nwind, tides, radio waves, etc., and converts\
    \ it into the corresponding electrical energy. The\nbroad objective of energy\
    \ harvesting is to save our limited available fossil fuels (coal, oil\nand gases).\
    \ However, in the smart city application, energy harvesting can also be used\n\
    for achieving maximum network lifetime in rechargeable battery-based WSN-IoT nodes.\n\
    Furthermore, the ML techniques are used in energy harvesting WSN-IoT for future\
    \ available\nenergy prediction tasks. The ML algorithms like regression technique\
    \ and reinforcement\nlearning techniques (Q-learning) are suitable for energy\
    \ harvesting applications. Generally,\nsolar energy, radio frequency (RF) waves\
    \ and wind energy are used with rechargeable\nbattery-based WSNs. Harvested energy\
    \ prediction, battery power management are the\ntasks that can be optimized by\
    \ using the ML algorithms in traditional WSN-IoT [37].\n4.8. Node Query Processing\n\
    In WSNs, the end nodes, cluster heads and gateway nodes perform various types\n\
    of queries such as sensor data aggregation, routing paths, synchronization and\
    \ control\noperations, packet delivery with each other, etc. The k-nearest neighborhood\
    \ (k-NN) based\nML techniques are used for sensor data queries in WSN.\nTable\

    \ upon the type\nof input and system function. The objective of supervised learning\
    \ is to approximate the\nmapping function so that when a new unknown input data\
    \ is applied then, the output (y)\ncan be predicted [39,40].\ny = f (x)\n(1)\n\
    In this section, we will discuss various supervised learning algorithm, which\
    \ can be\napplied in WSN-IoT applications. The supervised learning algorithms\
    \ are used in WSN for\ntarget tracking, localization of Nodes, event monitoring,\
    \ data security, fault detection, etc.\nThere are two types of supervisor learning\
    \ as regression and classiﬁcation.\n5.1.1. Regression\nIn regression, the output\
    \ variable (y) has some continuous numerical value like\nrupees, height, weight,\
    \ etc. Regression is applied to solve various issues in WSNs such as\nlocalization,\
    \ connectivity problem, data aggregation and energy harvesting [41].\n5.1.2. Classiﬁcation\n\
    In classiﬁcation, the output variable(y) is a category of objects like the type\
    \ of colors\n(e.g., red or yellow), type of diseases (e.g., fever or fracture),\
    \ etc. There are the following\ntypes of classiﬁcation problems as k-NN, decision\
    \ tree, ANN, Bayesian learning, etc [42].\n(A). K-nearest neighborhood (k-NN)\
    \ [43]: This is an instance-based supervised learn-\ning algorithm. Here, all\
    \ training instances are stored in a master database. When a new\ninstance query\
    \ (xq) arrives then this new query is compared with the stored database and\n\
    classiﬁed results are derived. In the k-NN algorithm the distance between each\
    \ data points\nis calculated by using the Euclidian distance formula\nd(q, p)\
    \ =\nq\n(q1 − p1)2 + (q2 − p2)2 + . . . + (qn − pn)2\nOr\nd(q, p) =\ns\nn\n∑\n\
    i=1\n(qi − pi)2\n(2)\nwhere q and p are data points and d is the distance between\
    \ them. In [44] data streaming in\nIoT using the k-NN algorithm is proposed. The\
    \ KNN algorithm is also used for the early\ndetection of agriculture pests, diseases,\
    \ sensor node failure and fault detection issues [45].\n(B). Decision tree (DT)\
    \ [46]: In the DT algorithm, the main task is to calculate the\nattribute of the\
    \ root node from each level. This process is called attribute selection. There\n\
    are two methods for attribute selection as information gain and Gini index. The\
    \ average\namount of information is called entropy and is given as\nEntropy =\
    \ −\nn\n∑\ni=1\npi ∗ log(pi)\n(3)\nGini index is a metric to measure how often\
    \ a randomly chosen element would be\nincorrectly identiﬁed.\nGini Index = 1 −\n\
    n\n∑\ni=1\np2\ni\n(4)\nwhere pi is the probability of occurrence of an ith event,\
    \ n is the number of training examples.\nIt is a classiﬁcation method for predicting\
    \ labels of data by iterating the input data through\na learning tree. During\
    \ this process, the feature properties are compared relative to decision\nconditions\
    \ to reach a speciﬁc category. In WSNs, decision tree (DT) algorithms like ID3\n\
    are used to identify the link reliability, mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean\
    \ time to\nrepair (MTTR). Figure 5 shows an example of the DT algorithm, in which\
    \ the decisions\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1012\n11 of 22\nare taken by a WSN node\
    \ system for different conditions. Here, if the 1st condition of\nWSN node battery\
    \ voltage is greater than 2.7 volts (i.e., Vbattery > 2.7 volts) is not true,\
    \ then\nall decision ﬂows towards the left-hand side of the tree. On the left-hand\
    \ side, the 2nd\ncondition to be checked is supply availability. On the other\
    \ hand, if the 1st condition (i.e.,\nVbattery > 2.7 volts) is true, then all decisions\
    \ ﬂow towards the right-hand side of the tree.\nElectronics 2021, 10, x FOR PEER\

    \ and Future Work\nIn this paper, we outlined various machine learning algorithms\
    \ in WSN-IoT for smart\ncity applications. In this paper, we performed a detailed\
    \ survey of ML techniques in WSN-\nIoT for the smart city challenges. From this\

    \ used with the highest amount, i.e., 61% as compared to RL\nat 27% and unsupervised\
    \ at 12% only. The ML algorithms are so versatile and powerful\nthat a single\
    \ type of ML algorithm can be used for multiple tasks in WSN-IoT in smart\ncities.\
    \ For example, the powerful SVM algorithm can be used for classiﬁcation and for\n\
    regression tasks in WSN-IoT. In the future, a more powerful and complex algorithm\
    \ will\nemerge, which minimizes human intervention. The futuristic IoT-based solution\
    \ for smart\ncities will include machine learning techniques. For example, the\
    \ heart stroke rehabilitation\nsystem [95] in smart health care using LDA, MLP\
    \ and SVM algorithms. Next-generation\nsmart cities will have ultra-dense cellular\
    \ IoT networks using high-performance machine\nlearning algorithms [96–100].\n\

    Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers to the network of physical objects or
    "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable
    objects to exchange data with servers, centralized systems, and/or other connected
    devices based on a variety of communication infrastructures. IoT data collected
    from different sensors, nodes and collectors are transferred to the cloud over
    the internet. IoT devices are used by consumers, healthcare, businesses as well
    as by the governments. It is being forecast that 31 billion IoT devices will be
    deployed all over the world by the year 2020. As the use of IoT devices is increasing
    every moment several IoT vulnerabilities are introduced. The results and analysis
    indicate that massive deployment of IoT with an integration of new technologies
    are introducing new security challenges in IoT paradigm. In this paper, IoT security
    challenges and open issues are discussed which provides a ground for future research.

    Review of IoT Platforms and Applications in Industry Chapter © 2018 1 Introduction
    IoT is a dynamic network framework which intends to coalesce the physical and
    the virtual domains by utilizing the internet as the medium for communication
    and transmission of data between them [1]. Physical and virtual worlds are perfectly
    amalgamated into one big data network with the usage of communication protocols
    in the self-configuring IoT infrastructure. It has been characterized as an arrangement
    of interrelated computing gadgets, mechanical and electronic machines, articles,
    creatures or individuals that are furnished with one of a kind identifiers and
    the ability to exchange information over a system without requiring human -human
    or human–machine interaction. IoT is a coming of age revolution affecting millions
    of lives worldwide which aims at autonomously operating devices without human
    intervention while establishing the machine to machine (M2M) communication. The
    interconnection of objects at anytime, anyplace for anything by usage of any smart
    network has always been the vision of IoT [2]. The label “Internet of Things”
    was formulated in 1999 by Kevin Ashton and since then this ubiquitous connectivity
    network has paved its way into our day-to-day lives and have been vividly used
    in real world applications like defence, medicine, industry, agriculture, energy
    and for the making of smart cities, homes and devices. With the use of internet
    and artificial intelligence it is making our world smarter while minimizing the
    manual efforts and being more and more human-friendly. The fundamental idea of
    an IoT system is the trade of data between machines which are elicited by cutting
    edge technologies like WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks) and RFID (Radio Frequency
    Identification) with usage of sensing devices with effective decision making skills
    and intelligent algorithms after which an action is performed accordingly. IoT
    systems are deployed successfully by enabling telecommunication interfaces with
    the internet in devices like sensors and actuators with storage and processing
    sections for successful interactions between machines. With the comfort it offers,
    this new paradigm also comes with some privacy and security issues which needs
    to be rectified for its proper utilization and functioning [3]. The Internet of
    Things (IoT) forms a processing idea that portrays a future where regular physical
    items will be associated with the Internet and will be capable to recognize themselves
    to different devices. RFID which was first introduced in 1945 is a prerequisite
    of IoT. It is a programmed innovation which helps machines and digital devices
    to recognize objects, record metadata and control singular target through radio
    waves [4]. Normally, a RFID framework comprises of tags and readers [5]. The tag
    is a microchip associated with a receiving wire, which can be connected to any
    object as a unique identifier. With the utilization of radio-waves, there is a
    phase of communication between the RFID’s reader and its tag which helps in the
    autonomous identification and classification of the object. Other than RFID, there
    are varied types of technologies used in IoT like WSN, Electronic Product Code
    (EPC), Bar Code, ZigBee as well as Bluetooth which uses low energy source and
    its one of the most convenient and popular IoT enabling technology. Currently,
    there are about 25 billion devices interconnected by the IoT which would ragingly
    grow to about 60 billion by the year 2025. IoT forms a cyclic phenomenon which
    combines the usage of sensors to create a connection and sense the user and a
    network to communicate with a person as it further aggregates the standards and
    provides a machine with augmented intelligence which helps it to analyse, behave
    and act according to the situation. The action, creation, communication, aggregation
    and the analysis of a device are the combined functions which makes it interconnected
    to IoT by establishing an augmented intelligence for it and making it a Smart
    device. This IoT process operates in a cycle with everything interdependent on
    one another for its successful execution. Brief IoT Constituents elements are
    shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Constituent elements of IoT Full size image The motive
    of our research is to identify the breadth, depth and diversity of present research
    in IoT. As a result, enormous number of research publications in journals and
    conferences are found associated with IoT. To illustrate the ongoing research
    work, we filtered the number of publications from 2013 to 2018 through scopus
    database. Figure 2 displays the number of publications in emerging applications
    of IoT. It indicates a trend towards popular research in IoT. The explosive growth
    of IoT technology opens many engineering and scientific opportunities and problems.
    It calls for greater research efforts from various sectors like academic, industry,
    etc. The combined efforts of these sectors should necessarily advent new protocols,
    architectures, and services which are in dire needs to take up the challenges
    of IoT. The scopus data base contain large number of publications that use IoT
    technology for various applications. Figure 3 displays the distribution of articles
    by year wise. It is found from the Fig. 3 that the number of publications has
    increased over the recent years and the number rises almost exponentially from
    2013 to 2018. Fig. 2 Number of publications in IoT protocols, security and emerging
    applications Full size image Fig. 3 Distribution of articles by publication year
    wise Full size image Having recognized the advances in IoT technology and emerging
    applications, our motivation in this research review is to explore the benefits,
    disadvantages, opportunities, challenges present in IoT technology, protocols
    and its applications. In the past many studies were conducted to review the IoT.
    Benefits and challenges of IoT in agriculture has been presented by Elijah et
    al. [1]. This survey does not detail on the types of protocols and implementation
    challenges faced in agricultural domain. In an effort to understand the progress
    of IoT in industries, key enabling technologies for IoT applications in industry
    were discussed in [4]. But M2M has not been addressed in the survey. Lin et al.
    [6] overviewed IoT with respect to system architecture, technologies, and security
    and privacy issues. However, the technologies for important applications like
    healthcare, agriculture has not been addressed in this survey. Goudos et al. [7]
    reviewed IoT technology starting from physical layer to application layer for
    smart city, transportation and healthcare applications. However security aspects
    present in these IoT protocols has not been addressed. In [8] healthcare technologies
    and healthcare solutions were discussed. But complete end to end healthcare application
    solution and IoT life save tools has not been explored. Highlighted the achievements
    in realizing various aspects of smart cities were presented in [9]. Moreover this
    survey address smart health management in smart cities but smart structural health
    management which equally important in smart cities has not addressed. Table 1
    summarizes the survey efforts of above mentioned research works. Table 1 Comparison
    of past surveys Full size table Our survey is different from the above listed
    survey. We have selected large number of research works and this article basically
    outlines and gives an overview on the life-changing phenomenon of IoT and varied
    technologies, challenges and real-world applications adhered to it which has revolutionized
    our world with its raging outlook. The contributions of paper are summarized as
    follows. In particular, first this paper conduct a comprehensive overview of IoT
    Technology with respect to RFID, enabling wireless sensor network technologies,
    antennas for IoT technology. Particularly, the difference between Machine to Machine
    (M2M) and IoT is explored first. Second, comprehensive survey on emerging protocols
    and contributions from the past works along with limitations are explored. This
    helps to provide legacy solutions for existing standards to emerging technologies.
    IoT security issues are explored and then security issues involved in various
    applications are reviewed. Most importantly in-depth review of IoT life saver
    tools along with protocols, issues are presented. State of the art framework for
    several applications including Smart City, Agriculture, and Industry etc. from
    the conception phase to the deployment presenting their supported features and
    limitations are illustrated. Finally open issues, challenges and disadvantages
    of IoT related to the emerging applications scenarios are presented. The methodology
    of this survey is to illustrate the IoT technology, protocols, security issues
    and open issues for important applications of IoT. The paper is divided as follows,
    it presents various technologies used in IoT in Sect. 2. Section 3 provides review
    of IoT protocols and in Sect. 4 security issues are reviewed in detail. It explicates
    multiple IoT- based lifesaver tools in Sect. 5. Further, it discusses various
    real time applications in Sect. 6 while the disadvantages and eventual challenges
    are furthermore explored in Sect. 7. Finally Sect. 8 summarizes the research paper
    which concludes this paper. 2 Technology in IoT In IoT applications, it is mandatory
    to transmit the data generated by the devices or sources to the internet. Proving
    connectivity and coverage is a daunting task for IoT applications. The users or
    vendors always wanted to collect data and analyse it for further processing for
    better enhancement of their devices. It is necessary to properly advent new technologies
    for communicating and processing the data. Rather than going to other network,
    a better privileged network especially for its own applications would be a good
    choice. Nowadays, the industries are actively involved developing wired or wireless
    communication channels or protocols. But the cost and infrastructure development
    plays a vital role in developing technology for IoT. The technology embedded in
    IoT is shown in the Fig. 4. The brief description of each of these items are described
    next. Fig. 4 Technology embedded in IoT Full size image 2.1 RFID RFID mainly focusses
    on Near field communication and Radio-Frequency identification. In last 2 decades’
    different companies are desperately working on Internet of things. At the time
    of 2nd World War, Radio-Frequency identification originated. It was impressive
    around Second World War. Radio frequency identification was helpful to determine
    if whether the fighters were “friend or foe”. Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
    is the utilization and identification of radio waves and exploitation of the same
    to pursue and catch the data [10]. A tag can be chased, followed or pursued from
    up to a small distance and does not need to be inside direct viewable pathway
    for the information to be exploited by the pursuer. The main component of RFID
    is RFID tag. The transducer also plays a role of RFID tag. An antenna, a chip
    and some memory is comprised in this tag. The transducer includes transmitter
    and responder, and we can identify tags in two forms. The two forms are active
    and passive RFID. The Active and Passive RFID which are differentiated on the
    basis of power source. Active RFID frameworks utilize battery-controlled RFID
    tag that ceaselessly communicates their own particular signal. Active RFID tag
    is regularly utilized as “reference points” to precisely track the constant area
    of advantages or in rapid conditions. The read range of active RFID tag is much
    longer than uninvolved tags [11] the reason being the extra power given by the
    battery, however, they are more costly. Passive RFID frameworks utilize tags with
    no inward power source and are rather fuelled by the electromagnetic energy transmitted
    from an RFID per user [12]. These tags are further utilized for applications like
    to control, record following, race timing, brilliant marks, and the sky is the
    limit from there on. The lower value point per tag makes utilizing the inactive
    RFID frameworks more efficient for many such ventures. Electronic Product Code
    (EPC) is also used in RFID. EPC can be recorded on RFID tag for an improvement
    in barcode system. It generates the unique code number which specifies the product’s
    specification or information. In MIT University, at around 1999 Auto ID centre
    developed EPC. Some systems are developed with barcode. Its combination of bars
    spaces with the difference of some width, in 1995 for trademark the QR (quick
    response) created, for the very first time in Japan automotive industry matrix
    barcode designed which records the information related to products. It can read
    by camera or scanner. 2.2 RFID Antenna The RFID apparatus engenders the wave in
    both vertical and flat measurements. The field scope of the wave and furthermore
    its signal quality is in part controlled by the quantity of degrees. While the
    higher number of degrees implies a greater wave scope design, it eventually bring
    down the quality of the signal. By giving an empowering RF signal, a person can
    speak with a remotely found device that has no outside power source, for example,
    a battery. The RFID radio wires can be divided into two classes: the tag and the
    reader antenna. First tag antenna is described. It has a tendency to collect energy
    for turn it on the channel. It consists of a property which advances on the fact
    that the collection of energy is greater if the area of the respective tag antenna
    is larger and vice versa. Tag antenna can be produced using an assortment of materials.
    They can be printed, scratched, or stamped with conductive ink, or even vapor
    kept onto labels. The tag antenna not only transmits the wave conveying the data
    put away in the tag, yet in addition to that it also needs to get the wave from
    the person to supply vitality for the tag operation. Tag antenna ought to be little
    in size, minimal in effort, and simpler to manufacture for large-scale manufacturing.
    By and large, the tag reception apparatus ought to have omnidirectional radiation
    or hemispherical scope. For the most part, the impedance of the label chip isn’t
    50 ohm, and the radio wire ought to understand the conjugate match with the label
    chip straightforwardly, so as to supply the greatest energy to the label chip.
    Tag antenna apparatus might be a signal turn or numerous turns as appeared here.
    Like tag antenna, the reader antenna must also work properly. For changing from
    electric current into electromagnetic waves the reader antenna is used. Where
    into space, the tag antenna receives the waves and converts them back into electric
    current. Radio frequency identification uses different frequency for different
    purposes which are listed in Table 2. Table 2 Frequency ranges for RFID antenna
    Full size table 2.3 Problems with RFID Standards RFID Standards can be effectively
    disrupted. Since RFID frameworks influence utilization of the electromagnetic
    range (like Wi-Fi systems or cell phones), they are moderately simpler for utilizing
    energy at the correct frequency despite the fact that this would just be a burden
    for consumers in stores (longer holds up at the checkout). They could be deplorable
    in some different times and situations. RFID is used and progressively utilized
    in the likes of hospital facilities as well as in the military and defence field
    [13]. Common problems with RFID-Reader collision is the Tag collision. The first
    thought of the Auto-ID Centre depends on RFID tags and interesting recognizable
    proof by the Electronic Product Code (EPC) [14], however, this has developed into
    objects having an IP address. On another hand, the universe of the Semantic Web
    concentrates rather on making all things (not only those electronic, brilliant,
    or RFID-empowered) addressable by the current naming conventions, for example,
    URI. The coming generation of internet technology would be able to communicate
    virtually by using the Internet protocol vision 6(IPV6) as it contains large address
    space. For identify objects in our industry in logistic transportation by IPV6.
    2.4 Wireless Sensor Network The advancement of wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    was inspired by military applications, today, they comprise of appropriated free
    gadgets that utilizes the sensor to screen the physical conditions with their
    applications stretched out to the industrial infrastructure, robotization, wellbeing,
    activity, and numerous customer regions. Wireless sensor network is part of the
    IoT class. Reconfigurable homogeneous or heterogeneous network scenarios like
    automatic network management is the need of the hour for IoT [15]. For IoT and
    wireless sensor networks short range communication Bluetooth is most preferred.
    This is one of the effective wireless technologies which allows to the transfer
    the data in a short range around 10–100 m, between devices such as mobiles, PCs,
    cameras etc. and generally the communication speed is less than 1 Mbps. In 1994
    one mobile communication company invented this Bluetooth. It was created for personal
    area network, and later piconet was invented which was a set of 2–8 Bluetooth
    devices. When it comes to the enhancement of the features of wireless sensor network
    and IoT, the protocol which was created was named as ZigBee. It was founded in
    the year 2001. ZigBee has a flexible protocol design and is used in short transmission
    ranges. ZigBee covers the distance of 100 m and a bandwidth of 250 kbps. 2.5 Machine
    to Machine IoT and Machine to Machine (M2M) are often considering as identical
    but their lies a huge difference between them. IoT is also equally plays huge
    role in today’s integration of machine and man like M2M. The detailed difference
    between IoT and M2M is depicted in Table 3. Table 3 Difference between IoT and
    M2M Full size table 3 Protocols Used in IoT Many IoT standards are proposed to
    facilitate and simplify application programmers’ and service providers’ jobs.
    Different groups have been created to provide protocols in support of the IoT
    including efforts led by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF), EPC global, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    (IEEE) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [10]. IoT
    protocols are used based on the application area and not all protocols are used
    everywhere. In fact, most protocols are not used for WSN’s where the main idea
    is to have a protocol that can allow for energy efficient data transmission and
    communication between sensor nodes. These protocols are different and are varied
    by the layer in which they are used. Each layer in the OSI model uses different
    protocols to achieve a different purpose in an IoT enabled network. Application
    layer protocols range from Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) REST protocols
    to enable energy efficient communication between devices. Bluetooth Low-Energy
    (BLE) [19] can also be used to transfer data over short ranges. These protocols
    use a variety of Communication models and these protocols are used mainly for
    user-centric applications like Home Automation or for WSN’s where energy is scarce.
    A main challenge in IoT protocols are those used for messaging purposes [20].
    Messaging purposes can be used to communicate between devices and to send/receive
    messages between sensor nodes in a WSN. Many protocols have been developed over
    the years for messaging purposes but a single protocol has not met the needs and
    requirements for an IoT system. These protocols like MQTT, CoAP are mainly used
    in energy efficient networks and work based on different Communication models.
    There are various advantages and disadvantages to these protocols and each protocol
    can be applied in a different area. But, these protocols have not been combined
    and moreover, cannot be combined due to the difference in standards between them.
    If these protocols were combined in some way to reduce the shortcomings of each
    and account for the disadvantages each protocol faces, then we would have a protocol
    which can potentially satisfy the needs of an average IoT system. Protocols used
    frequently are the messaging protocols used for low power devices [21] like MQTT,
    CoAP and IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN). The focus
    of previous research works on MQTT and CoAP protocols along with limitations and
    gaps are given in Table 4. These protocols are frequently used in IoT networks
    for devices with low energy and bandwidth. With an increasing number of connected
    devices, IoT systems are expected to handle the communication between these devices
    [22]. Table 4 Comparative analysis of MQTT and CoAP protocols Full size table
    Therefore, state of the art systems are required to allow for these communications.
    Industrial IoT is one of the concepts that will rise in the next decade. The ability
    for devices to be connected in an industry is one of the main concepts in Industry
    4.0 [23]. Industry 4.0 is the next industrial revolution which involves automation
    and IoT as one of the main concepts. It aims at automating the entire manufacturing
    process with almost no human intervention. This leads to faster and more productive
    manufacturing with large volumes of products being manufactured every single day.
    One of the major risks in IoT protocols remains that of security. Next we discuss
    the challenges present in the IoT security. 4 Challenges in IoT Security As the
    basic principle of IoT involves connecting devices, it makes everything addressable
    and locatable which in turn makes our life easier [34]. However, making everything
    connected to internet opens the door for hackers. Without proper confidence about
    privacy and security, user will not be attracted towards IoT [3]. So, it must
    have a strong infrastructure dealing with security and some of the issues that
    IoT might face are listed below. The primary issue the IoT facing is unauthorized
    Access to RFID. The RFID tags can contain any sort of information and as RFID
    tag can be easily modified or read by the reader. This opens a whole bunch of
    threat for the user as the data can be easily accessed by a miscreant reader [35].
    Wireless sensor networks security breach sensors node in IoT are bidirectional.
    Acquisition of data is also possible other than transmission. In this scenario,
    some of the possible attacks include tampering where the data in the node can
    be extracted or altered. Next flooding creates a whole lot of problems in IoT.
    Flooding the name suggests, it explains when traffic amount is high and exhaustion
    of memory takes place. Sybil attack wherein multiple pseudo identities are claimed
    for a node in order for it to give big influence. Security issues from Android
    where once when we connect IoT to an android, unlike IOS android it is an open
    source network which means it can easily be discovered. Once the front end devices
    are compromised, the IoT network is exposed. Software updating problem is usually
    faced by the developers because of high cost and memory, they do not update their
    software and devices. Once the hackers discover the devices, they can be easily
    accessed. Cloud Computing in IoT is a big network that allows sharing of resources
    and some of the security threats faced by shared resources are listed below. Data
    loss happens when any miscreant user having unauthorized access can modify or
    delete the data. Cloud computing can also be used for controlling other devices,
    once the hackers get hold of an account it can upload certain software’s which
    will give him control of any devices that come in contact. The Man-in-the-middle
    (MITM) the hacker works as a third person and can intercept or alter any message.
    5 IoT Lifesaver Tools These are the tools that have proved to be saving a lot
    of lives related to the road safety as well as many other major issues. Bumblebee
    is an IoT system particularly aiming for road safety. Primarily, it autonomously
    detects the danger and communicates with the nearby cars to give way to the driver
    with reference to the issue. Also a message is sent to traffic control centre
    about the position and the threat related issues, it works on the priority system,
    i.e. in case of multiple threats or victims the one whose priority is high will
    be sent first. It will help in passing the way to ambulance, notifying people
    about any mad driver or thief and many more. HAPIfork is an electronic fork designed

    separate human from other living being is curiosity. We humans are curious and
    we question a lot which results in advancement in every field that connects or
    affects our life in any way. IoT which is also considered as fourth industrial
    revolution brings a whole lot of application and promises to reshape industries
    into next level. Some of the recent works in important areas of wellbeing of people
    are tabulated in the Table 5. Table 5 Review of some recent works in smart applications
    Full size table 6.1 Medical Field IoT health care is still considered as the sleepiest
    or least developed, researchers have shown that in coming years the giant will
    get awaken. It will not only be affecting companies but will also change the life
    of people. Some of the present applications in the medical field are listed below.
    Ultraviolet Radiation monitors the level of UV radiation in different areas and
    notifies the people about the area having high radiations [57]. Medical freezers
    monitors the things kept under it, for example, monitor the temperature of the
    medicines and adjusting its temperature accordingly. All detection tracks the
    activity of people with disabilities or old age people living independently. Sportsmen
    Care monitors the activity of a sportsman and notify when seeing any fall in performance
    and patients surveillance. To reduce the respiratory problems of citizens and
    emerging privacy issues while adopting smart health management was discussed [58].
    6.2 Industrial Control Indoor Air Quality monitors the amount of oxygen present
    in air as well as the presence of toxic gases. Ozone Presence monitors the presence
    of ozone in food industry while the process of drying meat. Safety systems are
    machines involving large blades or high-pressure compression are covered by curtains
    with sensors if worker hand by mistake enter the area the whole system will stop.
    RFID tags system are employed in assemble branch where the container containing
    part to be assembled next is indicated with the help of bulb over the container.
    These systems help to keep track whether the parts are assembled in the right
    order or not. Tracking is employed for the tracking of goods and updation with
    the real-time data. 6.3 Domestic and Home Automation With IoT being a hot topic
    and creating buss smart home is the most searched or user interested topic. The
    reason being the love and comfort of people towards their home and we all have
    experienced the irritation we feel after we are in bed to go to the switch and
    switch off the light. Well IoT solves this problem for you. Here are some IoT’s
    application aiming toward home automation. Intrusion Detection Systems detects
    the condition of the window and doors and violations to prevent the user from
    any intruders. Remote Control Appliances controls the appliances with sensors
    to save energy and accidents [59]. Temperature and music control can feed the
    data of temperature and music preference of the members and you just have to say
    play songs or make me comfortable or something and it is all set. Energy and Water
    Use monitors the daily consumption of water and energy and suggests different
    ways to save them. Art and Goods Preservation monitors the condition inside warehouses
    and museum and suggest ideal conditions for better preservation. 6.4 Smart Cities
    People continue to move towards cities the reason being good opportunities offered
    [60], this increases the population and in order to manage the increased population
    and the problems comes with that city needs to be smart. We all have experienced
    the irritation we feel when we spend hours waiting in jams [61]. The smell of
    improper disposal of waste in neighbourhood etc. All this problem will be solved
    with IoT. Some of the potential applications of IoT in smart cities are shown
    in the Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Applications of IoT in smart cities Full size image 6.5
    Security and Emergencies We see a lot of news reading about the people who suffered
    in emergencies condition what if someone notifies you before it actually happened,
    won’t it be nice? Well IoT will play the role of that someone in coming years.
    Here we discuss some of its application in securities and emergencies. Perimeter
    Access Control detects and controls the people activity inside an unauthorized
    and restricted area. Radiation Levels are generally used in nuclear power plants
    or station to monitor the level of radiation in order to notify as soon as there
    is a leakage in the plant. Explosive and Hazardous Gases detects the level of
    gas in a chemical industry and notify as soon as a leakage is detected. Earthquake
    People suffer a loss of life and money when an earthquake hits, the system cannot
    save your money but it can save your life, it notifies as soon as it detects the
    presence of earthquake and guides you the safest and quickest way to exit. Definitely
    IoT plays a vital role in controlling these applications. 6.6 Smart Agriculture
    With the continuous increase in the world population the production of the food
    has to be raised proportionally in order to provide basic food for each individual
    [62]. But from past years we have seen farmers committing suicide due to damage
    to their crop or loan. The government is doing everything in its power to help
    farmers. But with the help of IoT many problems can be solved. This is the main
    reason that’s is why the government is more interested in advancement of smart
    agriculture using IoT [1]. Summary of certain important research contributions
    are compared in Table 6. Moreover in the summary, key performance indicators for
    different IoT domains are presented. The key performance indicators are vital
    for designing, deploying and commissioning the applications of IoT. More importantly
    the key performance indicators are usually measured and used to quantify the performance
    across the IoT domains. Table 6 Comparison of some reviewed important research
    contributions Full size table Compost controls the level of temperature and humidity
    inside etc. to prevent any unwanted cause. Green Houses controls the climate condition
    in order to maximise the production. Meteorological Station Network studies or
    analyses the past atmospheric condition of whether to predict or forecast the
    future conditions. The security issues, protocols used and the enabling IoT technology
    for emerging application are tabulated in Table 7. Table 7 Illustration of IoT,
    protocol and security issue for emerging applications Full size table 7 Challenges
    and Future Scope of IoT Over the few decades, we have seen a lot of technical
    development, technologies change our lives. It has been responsible for making
    our lives full of resources available at our fingertip [65]. Out of the many technologies
    under development, IoT also known as M2M has successfully attracted a lot of audience
    towards it (here smart sensors collect real-time data and communicative with each
    other or with the internet to take necessary action), IoT being a technology offers
    both opportunities and challenges. M2M is generally broken down into four layers.
    First is sensor which collect real-time data and next the communication unit which
    is responsible for the transmission of data. The third computing unit is responsible
    for analysing the data and the service layer take necessary action after analysing
    the data [66]. This four components are essentially inherited in IoT also. The
    immediate important challenges IoT facing is listed in the Table 8. Table 8 The
    challenges faced by IoT Full size table But regardless of all the challenges faced,
    IoT is an innovation revolution with a predictive extravagant growth rate of 20.8
    billion by 2020, it interconnects variegated gadgets, systems and people with
    its pervasive internet networking. The upcoming research, developments and projects
    in the field of IoT would boost up the standard of human lives and bring about
    substantial changes in areas of industrial, medical, defence, agriculture, homes
    as well as corporate world and businesses. For example, in India, about 120 organizations
    and 70% of the new companies are putting forth IoT empowered arrangements. From
    2015 till now, around 60 million dollars has been devoted to resources into the
    IoT which has brought forth another method for working and living. It has changed
    the current market and business trends to more customer friendly and personalized
    services. With the incorporation of IoT- consumers, businesses and industries
    are booming together and contributing each other by refining the productivity
    as IoT. The IoT services have made everything more user friendly with prefixing
    “SMART” in every intricate essence of our lives like SMART wearables, automobiles,
    homes and cities with efficient energy and money saving. It is provided by a cheaper
    and a healthier environment to the users. IoT is a vast concept as it not only
    helps in the tangible growth of an individual but of a country as a whole as booming
    industries help in a nation’s economic growth. Moreover, advancements in healthcare
    services are cheaper, easier and patient-friendly, varied IoT defence schemes
    expands a country’s security and sustainability. Development of smart cities which
    includes controlling of traffic using IoT, concepts like SMART wastage management
    and also effective energy and resources savings. But IoT is currently suffering
    from certain implementation issues like security, data management etc. which must
    be ameliorated for its full-fledged expansion and growth in the future. Some of
    the open issues for emerging applications is listed in Table 9. Table 9 Some open
    issues for emerging applications of IoT Full size table Computational limitations,
    fog computing, security, deployment, scalability, signal acquisition and processing,
    memory management, interoperability and integration, bandwidth efficiency, energy
    saving, communication technology, coverage and protocols etc. are still open issues/areas
    in IoT technology for various applications of today’s world. 7.1 Disadvantages
    Though IoT is having a large scope in almost all areas of our day to day applications.
    There are some disadvantages which hinders further implementation of the IoT systems
    at a faster pace. The main disadvantages of the IoT are listed in Table 10. The
    internet of things makes the physical objects in the real environment to be seen
    in cyber globe and offers the formation of smart systems and applications. Table
    10 Disadvantages of IoT Full size table Networks of sensors, middlewares, digital
    communication and computing, protocols etc. led to expansion of interconnected
    devices. The advancement in communication, connection and integration helps to
    have lot of choices to choose devices and services. The variety of services and
    devices that provides similar functions lead to lookup and discovery. The discovery
    and categorization of similar devices and services causes the system to become
    more costlier and error prone. Addressing the disadvantages will allow next generation
    IoT to recognize and satisfy the information needs. 8 Conclusion In this review,
    the technological standard required for implementation of IoT is discussed. Moreover,
    basic communication entities and networks which support IoT are also reviewed
    in such a way to foresee the problems of ideal implementation of IoT. IoT is also
    pitted against M2M to illustrate the similarities and difference between the technologies.

    • DoS attack detection for IoT platforms. • AODE-based classification of network
    traffic. • Machine learning and applications for network security in IoT on 5G
    networks. Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have evolved to become an integral
    part of the contemporary Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The sensor node activities
    of both sensing phenomena in their immediate environments and reporting their
    findings to a centralized base station (BS) have remained a core platform to sustain
    heterogeneous service-centric applications. However, the adversarial threat to
    the sensors of the IoT paradigm remains significant. Denial of service (DoS) attacks,
    comprising a large volume of network packets, targeting a given sensor node(s)
    of the network, may cripple routine operations and cause catastrophic losses to
    emergency services. This paper presents an intelligent DoS detection framework
    comprising modules for data generation, feature ranking and generation, and training
    and testing. The proposed framework is experimentally tested under actual IoT
    attack scenarios, and the accuracy of the results is greater than that of traditional
    classification techniques. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Introduction A wireless sensor network (WSN) is defined as a network of interconnected
    sensors that constantly monitor their respective environments for phenomena, communicate
    their readings to peer sensor nodes and to a centralized base station (BS) for
    storage and processing, and inform relevant stakeholders in the event of the detection
    of an anomalous event. Minute sensor nodes deployed for these activities have
    limited computing, storage, and communication capabilities for carrying out their
    designated tasks [1], [2], [3], [4]. Historically, WSNs have played a vital role
    in supporting critical infrastructures. In legacy sensor networks, the sensor
    nodes communicated with a centralized BS, which would effectively be connected
    to emergency services, on stand by for mobilization in the event of an emergency
    event. For instance, the detection of unusually high temperatures in a bush region
    would be indicative of a likely fire in the area. Further investigation may be
    entailed, and a fire control crew may need to be mobilized to contain the threat
    posed by the fire [2], [4]. Recent and widespread adoption of Internet-connected
    devices that constitute the modern-day Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has taken
    sensor node application to a new dimension [3], [4]. Embedded IoT devices and
    wireless sensors comprise the lowest layer of the IoT paradigm. These devices
    are protocol-dependent and communicate with peer devices wirelessly, relying on
    standards such as ZigBee and 6LoWPAN. Embedded sensors may include those found
    in smart vehicles, road-side traffic controllers, smart home appliances (smart
    TVs, refrigerators, washing machines), smart bicycles, and eHealth devices, such
    as pace makers and insulin dispensers. Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to cyber manufacturing
    systems (CMSs) that comprise the Industry 4.0 paradigm [5], which is effectively
    as vulnerable to the adversarial threats as other IoT-based systems. We categorize
    the above sensors as smart IoT sensors, as they not only sense the environment
    but also perform intelligent processing of collected sensory data, participate
    in the transmission of the data to centralized data centers (e.g., Cloud), and
    respond to requests received from decision makers such as the BS. These sensor
    nodes are deployed at various locations of the IoT infrastructure for monitoring
    and reporting observed phenomena from their local environments [6], [7]. Based
    on the application categories specified by Libelium [8], sensor applications for
    contemporary applications include the following: 1. smart cities; 2. smart environments;
    3. smart water; 4. smart metering; 5. retail; 6. logistics; 7. industrial control;
    8. smart agriculture; 9. smart animal farming; 10. domestic and home automation;
    and 11. eHealth. A related enumeration of smart city services, smart grids, smart
    water management, and smart healthcare was presented in [9]. In general, an IoT
    sensor network architecture comprises data generators and data capturers, as shown
    in Fig. 1. Data generators are identified as individual IoT sensors of the network,
    which operate in the immediate environment, sensing their surroundings for phenomena
    such as temperature or pressure variations, and reporting the same to a centralized
    entity (in most cases, a higher performance node such as a BS). Data capturers
    are centralized sensor nodes within a cluster (region) of operation, that is,
    a cluster head (CH); responsible for the capture/aggregation and subsequent rendering
    of environmental readings to a powerful computing node of the IoT network, i.e.,
    the BS. Several CH nodes will be operational within a mid- to large-scale IoT
    network. Data capturers play a similar role to IoT middleware platforms, where
    they aggregate data from multiple sensors and route the data to various endpoints,
    such as the Cloud. The large number of connections from the IoT and the exchange
    of massive amounts of data from numerous IoT devices requires a fast and reliable
    data connection. The fifth generation (5G) network is poised to become a key technology
    enabler for the IoT to complement this explosive growth of connected devices [10].
    With the advent of the 5G infrastructure, the IoT middleware platforms will play
    a crucial role in providing necessary device abstractions and data management
    services. Download : Download high-res image (148KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. An IoT sensor network platform. The IoT sensor architecture suffers
    from several security threats that may affect the regular working of the network
    and the delivery of foolproof and resilient service to critical infrastructure
    [11]. Data generated from sensor nodes must be securely and promptly delivered
    to the data capturers and onwards to the centralized BSs. Security of these data
    in transit over the communication lines, as well as at rest within the various
    sensor nodes of the communication hierarchy, is paramount. • Data Integrity —
    An integrity violation in the IoT network is defined as a deliberate or accidental
    modification to the reading that is observed by a data generator. Such a violation
    of data integrity, which is invariably a matter of tampering with sensitive information,
    may occur at one or more locations of the network, including at the data generator,
    data capturer, BS, or during transit through the communication channels [12].
    • Data Confidentiality — Data generated by the sensor nodes must be protected
    against unwanted disclosure to the adversary. To maintain the confidentiality
    of sensor data, the following locations of data at rest and in transit are identified:
    data generator, data capturer, BS, and the communication links among these entities.
    Although, in principle, the encryption of all data is a solution, the unaltered
    application of standard encryption techniques, including Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
    (RSA), data encryption standard (DES), Blowfish, and ElGamal methods, are not
    entirely viable on resource-constrained sensor nodes. Consequently, data encryption
    must be lightweight as well as resilient against adversarial attacks [12]. • Data
    availability — Rogue sensor nodes, middleware devices or a compromised BSs may
    be programmed by the adversary class to carry out a denial of service (DoS) flooding
    attack against selective targets in the network, with the purpose of disrupting
    routine network operations and crippling critical sensor network services [9],
    [12]. As IoT networks start adopting 5G networks, the security challenges of IoT
    middleware or data capturers will increase drastically [13]. Although 5G networks
    will provide fast, reliable, high bandwidth, and location awareness to IoTs, there
    remain many unaddressed security concerns. In [13], [14], the authors highlight
    many possible attacks against the 5G IoT middleware platforms. Attacks, such as
    Man-in-The-Middle, message modification, authentication attacks, DoS attacks,
    replay attacks, and eavesdropping, will challenge the effective deployment of
    the IoT on a 5G network. With numerous connected devices and critical services
    depending on data generated from billions of end points, it is necessary to have
    an efficient and robust security mechanism to thwart any malicious attempts to
    disrupt services, especially DoS attacks. While conventional techniques of the
    statistical analysis of network traffic may be effective in detecting DoS attacks
    in sensor networks, the centralized analysis of fused data at the data capturer
    nodes facilitates more accurate identification of DoS network traffic. Naïve Bayes
    is a popular classifier that has been extensively used in various applications
    of data classification [15]. The fundamental basis of the Naïve Bayes classifier
    is the assumption that individual data attributes are independent of each other,
    so the accuracy of a Naïve Bayes classifier is questionable when the data attributes
    are interdependent. The averaged one-dependence estimator (A1DE) and the averaged
    two-dependence estimator (A2DE) are two such techniques proposed to address the
    attribute independence assumption of Naïve Bayes [15], [16]. In this paper, we
    present a dependence estimator-based scheme for DoS attack traffic classification
    in an IoT sensor network. The presented scheme is the first of its kind, where
    the deep analysis of IoT network traffic parameters is conducted to establish
    a relationship between the network traffic parameters and to identify the key
    IoT network traffic parameters upon which other parameters would depend. Through
    the establishment of such a relationship, the analysis of network traffic for
    malicious activity proves to be more accurate as well as efficient. The findings
    presented in this paper highlight the significance of the dependencies between
    the individual data attributes of network traffic and provide the quantification
    of the quality of solution proposed. In summary, the key contributions of this
    paper are as follows: • Adoption and redefinition of the averaged one-dependence
    and two-dependence (A1DE and A2DE) techniques for detecting DoS attacks in IoT
    networks. • Proposal of an integration of A1DE and A2DE through the introduction
    of MultiScheme and Voting schemes for DoS attack detection in IoT networks. •
    Performance evaluation of the proposed techniques for DoS attack detection in
    a real IoT network, i.e., measuring and reporting on the accuracies and computational
    times. This article is organized as follows: Section 2 of the paper provides a
    background on machine learning techniques for the IoT and its application to DoS
    attack detection for network security. In Section 3, we present the one-dependence
    estimator classifier. In Section 4, we present the network and attack model for
    an IoT network. Section 5 presents the averaged dependence estimator (ADE)-IoT
    attack detection framework. The experimental setup and results analysis are presented
    in Section 6. Finally, the article is concluded in Section 7. 2. Related work
    IoT security is a multifaceted challenge. As elaborated upon in [5], IoT manufacturers
    merely give consideration to security as a postproduction exercise. The limited
    resources available for data processing, storage, and communication encumber the
    deployment of robust data confidentiality techniques that require security keys
    of sufficient length to guarantee minimum security of data, in transit and at
    rest. While IoT communication protocols such as message queuing telemetry transport
    (MQTT) provide in-built support for transport layer security (TLS) comprising
    data confidentiality and integrity verification mechanisms, mechanisms to protect
    IoT devices from service flooding, i.e., DoS attacks, are absent. Edge computing
    is another paradigm shift that attempts to reduce the two-way flow of large volumes
    of data between tiny IoT sensors and centralized BSs and gateways through efficient
    in situ data processing [17], [18]. An intermediate edge layer facilitates the
    interaction between the IoT sensors and a centralized cloud, reducing the overall
    data volume of the network. However, the efficacy of such a layer to prevent DoS
    attacks is unaddressed in the literature. Data sensed by the sensor nodes from
    their respective environments are transmitted to centralized sensing nodes known
    as CHs or directly to the BS. The analysis of sensory data at these centralized
    nodes or BSs is imperative to facilitate decision-making. Several techniques exist
    in the literature for performing intelligent classification of data that flows
    through a network. Some of these are summarized as follows [17], [18], [19], [20].
    Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a supervised learning algorithm [16], [21] that
    uses a feed-forward structure for data classification. MLP neural networks are
    trained through the modification of the weights of neural network interconnections
    between the nodes of the different layers (input, output or hidden). These network
    weights are updated by using defined functions during the training period, such
    as the gradient-based optimization algorithm. Faraoun and Boukelif [16] proposed
    a hybrid method comprising k-means clustering and the MLP. Note that the proposed
    technique uses the k-means algorithm to group the input data into a number of
    clusters of a fixed size (based on the number of attacks provided in the KDD-99
    dataset). The distances between the centers of clusters and input data points
    are subsequently calculated, and only the most discriminating samples that cover
    the maximum region of each class are selected for the learning process. The selected
    samples are then presented to the MLP network for classification into four classes
    of attacks, namely, DoS, probing, user to root (U2R), and remote to user (R2L).
    An MLP for misuse detection in information and communication technologies (ICT)
    networks was proposed in two configurations by Cannady in [21]. The first configuration
    is a standalone system, and the second configuration uses a rule-based expert
    system. The proposed scheme uses nine traffic features as input to the MLP, i.e.,
    the input layer contains nine neurons. The MLP network consists of three layers:
    the input layer with nine neurons, the hidden layer, and the output layer with
    two neurons, with all layers being fully connected. A sigmoid function is used
    as a transfer function between the neurons. The author uses 10 K data points with
    a 9:1 split on training/testing. Although perceptrons are known to produce reliable
    results in classification, the proposed technique operates with low efficiency
    and will perform poorly for large datasets and under real-time constraints of
    an IoT environment. The C4.5 [22] is a decision tree-based classifier that generates
    a decision based on a certain sample of data. This algorithm is known to perform
    well even in the presence of incomplete data. To compare the proposed dependence
    estimator-based techniques in this paper with efficient classification algorithms,
    we employ a C4.5-based classifier for detecting DoS attack traffic in an IoT network.
    A self-organizing map (SOM) [23], [24] is an unsupervised learning algorithm to
    group similar data into clusters in the input space. This map is a data visualization
    technique that produces a low dimensional topological map to help people visually
    analyze data classes on smaller datasets rather through resource-intensive and
    slow processing techniques that operate on larger volume datasets. Once the SOM
    neural network is trained, the map converges to a stationary distribution and
    shows a clear separation between legitimate and attack traffic. The output neurons
    are considered as the counts for normal and attack traffic points. After building
    the map using the training data, future connections can be classified as normal
    or attack based on their location in the map. SOMs have limited numbers of neurons,
    generally in orders of tens, which is not enough for the analysis of large-volume
    network traffic. Kohonen self-organizing maps (KSOMs) address this limitation
    by producing topological maps representative of the input data according to the
    similarity in the data values [24]. The map represents the network traffic within
    a given cluster, which helps classify the data into normal or anomalous depending
    on the position of the best match cluster. However, the dependency among the features
    of network traffic is not established through an SOM, increasing the delays and
    reducing the efficiency. Bayesian integration does not suffer from overfitting
    problems [12], [15], [25], [26], [27]. Prior knowledge can be incorporated naturally,
    and all uncertainty is manipulated in a consistent manner. Moreover, it is possible
    to learn model structures and readily compare model classes. There are different
    classes of Bayesian network (BN) classifiers, including Naïve Bayes, tree-augmented
    Naïve Bayes networks (TANs), Bayesian network-augmented Naïve Bayes networks (BANs),
    Bayesian multinets, and general Bayesian networks (GBNs). Such networks have been
    extensively used in text categorization and spam detection. However, BNs suffer
    from assuming independence between various data attributes or features, which
    makes them less accurate. Many techniques have been proposed to solve this problem,
    including lazy Bayesian rule (LBR) and super-parent tree-augmented network (super-parent
    TAN). Although these techniques yield low errors in classification, they suffer
    from a high computational cost. A new approach, namely, the averaged dependence
    estimator (ADE), with accuracy and performance comparable to LBR and super-parent
    TAN, solved the problem of independence by averaging all constrained classes of
    classifiers. A1DE [12], [15], [27] are another class of BNs that incorporate the
    relationships between various data values in the dataset for classification. In
    [27], an A1DE-based intrusion detection system has been proposed for providing
    higher accuracy in the intrusion detection process. In [10], an A2DE-based scheme
    is presented wherein the dependency between two features of the dataset and the
    data sample label is established for classification. In addition to intelligent
    techniques for the analysis of network traffic, several techniques based on empirical
    traffic analysis and thresholds also exist in the literature. Some of these are
    as follows: • Volume-based detection techniques [28], [29], [30], [31]: A volume-based
    detection scheme is useful when identifying anomalies that cause large changes
    in the traffic volume. For example, in a flooding attack, aka DDoS attack, anomalies
    associated with large changes in the traffic volume can be flagged as an attack
    in progress. • Feature-based detection techniques [30], [31]: Such feature extraction
    uses the distributional changes in packet header details, such as IP addresses
    and port numbers, to detect anomalies. Feature-based detection techniques require
    header inspection of each packet, which is time consuming and not applicable for
    networks with real-time constraints. Lakhina et al. [30] proposed an anomaly detection
    method using traffic feature distributions in which they argue that the distributions
    of packet features, such as IP addresses and ports, are useful in detecting a
    wide range of anomalies in the network traffic. The authors stated that by using
    entropy along with traffic feature distribution, they can sensitively detect a
    wide range of anomalies, and it also helps in clustering the anomalies into different
    clusters. In their experiment, these researchers used network wide traffic (whole
    network traffic) as the data source, as it contains various types of normal and
    abnormal traffic. The authors noted that identifying the nature of anomalies in
    a large dataset is a challenging task, as the anomalies are a moving target. An
    anomaly detection system that depends on a predefined set of anomalies is inefficient
    because the anomalies vary constantly. These authors noted that most of the anomalies
    affect the distributional aspects of traffic features, such as IP addresses and
    port numbers. Thonnard and Dacier [31] proposed a clustering-based approach to
    detect attack patterns in Honeynet data. In their approach, these authors specifically
    use time signatures to cluster the Honeynet data. The time series is defined as
    a sequence of data points measured at successive times separated by uniform time
    intervals. In [32], the authors proposed considering an exponential moving average
    (EMA) statistic to be examined alongside entropy variations observed in IP addresses
    and packet arrival rates for a typical computer network topology comprising standard
    routers, switches, and intrusion detection systems. In contrast, our work focuses
    on detecting DoS attacks for IoT traffic in a network topology that comprises
    IoT devices interconnected through IoT networking devices communicating using
    IoT protocols such as MQTT. We adopt simple moving averages of the packet interarrival
    times and examine the packet and header field value distributions. The simple
    moving average calculation is performed through the implementation of a sliding
    window technique that captures the variation in packet interarrival times and
    variations observed when these times are compared to previous packet observations.
    This method also reduces the computational resource requirements associated with
    the computations of both the entropy and EMA. Other research works, such as those
    presented in [33], [34], [35], [36], present several DoS attack detection techniques
    for typical computer networks, not IoT-based networks. The main limitation of
    these methods is that the performance evaluation of the proposed techniques is
    reported for either datasets of standard (non-IoT) computer networks or synthetic
    datasets obtained through amalgamation of various data sources of such non-IoT
    networks. For IoT environments, the traffic dynamics and baselines are very different
    from legacy computer networks and therefore must be measured and considered for
    IoT attack detection. In our work, a physical IoT testbed is deployed to collect
    real IoT traffic, and the performance of our proposed attack detection scheme
    is compared with that of one other IoT-based dataset. Note that from the research
    above, a well-defined machine learning-based mechanism for detecting DoS attacks
    based on averaged feature dependence estimation is missing for IoT networks. This
    gap is acknowledged through our proposed technique, wherein we design and assess
    the performance of the proposed classification techniques, namely, MultiScheme
    and Voting, and compare it against the performance of the A1DE, A2DE, Naïve Bayes,
    Bayesian Network, C4.5, and MLP classifiers when tested for an IoT network of
    sensors. The results obtained through experiments showed promise in the efficacy
    of the proposed classifiers in securing IoT networks against DoS attacks. 3. The
    averaged dependence estimator Data classification is a critical component of network
    security. With a proper data classification mechanism in place, the network security
    scheme can accurately differentiate legitimate traffic from attack traffic and
    can be effective in protecting the network from malicious attacks. A data classifier
    operates through an assessment of individual features of a given data sample and
    by categorizing the sample into one of n predefined classes. An attribute of a
    given dataset is defined as a tuple, which is representative of one variable of
    the dataset. While several techniques exist for data classification, BNs are popular
    probability-based inferencing classifiers that establish relationships between
    the individual variables of the dataset, such as the IP address of a network packet
    and its category, legitimate or malicious. Like any classifier, a BN is initially
    trained on a range of data samples from the dataset and subsequently run on a
    set of data samples to test its efficacy in data sample classification. The super-parent
    one-dependence estimator (SPODE), a predecessor to the A1DE classifier, was an
    attempt to solve the attribute independence assumption of the Naïve Bayes classifier.
    However, the SPODE improved upon the shortcomings of the Naïve Bayes classifier
    by introducing a single dependence variable upon which all other variables of
    the dataset were assumed to be dependent. A1DEs [12], [15] are a probabilistic
    data classification technique based on the Naïve Bayes classifier that addresses
    the shortcoming of the SPODE classifier and yields more accurate results in the
    classification of datasets with nonindependent attributes. The technique establishes
    a dependency between the features of a given dataset, albeit at increased computation
    costs. For purposes of classifying IoT network traffic, the correlation between
    various data samples will be established based on two parameters, namely, the
    intersensor geographical spacing and the network packet timestamps. Two steps
    will comprise the data correlation and analysis procedure, namely, data feature
    ranking and reduction and intelligent data classification. The training phase
    of the A1DE classifier performs sequential iterations over the training dataset
    comprising k features to generate the following classifier parameters: 1. cfreq(y)
    : the number of data samples that belong to class y 2. afreq(k) : the number of
    times a given attribute bears a specific value for all k features 3. vfreq(x ):
    the number of times a given value, , is present in the entire dataset 4. freq(y,
    x , x ): the frequency of occurrence of two separate attributes and for the same
    data class y. The testing phase of the A1DE is where the trained classifier is
    introduced with a set of data samples and is required to determine the class based
    on the values of the above parameters, as defined and stored during the training
    phase. The classifier effectively determines the probability of a given data sample
    belonging to a given class, y, as follows: where m is the number of classes; k
    is the number of attributes; vfreq[x ] is the frequency of times a given attribute
    appears in the dataset; and is the attribute value at instance i. As seen from
    the above relationship established between a single dominant feature of the dataset
    and the other remaining features, the A1DE classifier is able to classify the
    testing dataset samples. The number of classes for the DoS classification technique,
    m, is equal to two, namely, legitimate and attack. The total number of attributes
    of the classifier, k, is equal to the number of selected features. The AnDE family
    of classifiers are n-dependence estimators that extend the Naïve Bayes and A1DE
    to higher levels of dependence. The A2DE classifier allows the establishment of
    a dependency between the class attribute and two other features [12], [15], [27].
    4. Network and attack models This section provides details for network and attack
    models, including our DoS detection architecture for IoT sensor networks. 4.1.
    Sensors with an IoT sensor network architecture Sensors are typically deployed
    in the environment for sensing and for reporting the sensory readings to a centralized
    BS. We consider IoT sensors to be operating within clusters to ensure that peer
    sensors of a given cluster are actively correlating their individual sensory readings
    for validation. Various factors affect the number of clusters and the number of
    sensors within each cluster of the IoT sensor network. By having multiple clusters
    in the network, the failure of individual sensors is tolerated more than if clusters
    were not present. Intracluster sensor nodes must be placed within proximity of
    each other so that they are able to communicate with each other. Each cluster
    of the network will also have a preconfigured CH that shall be responsible for
    data aggregation in the cluster and for communicating with the centralized BS.
    Through such a hierarchy of IoT sensors, they do not suffer from rapid battery
    exhaustion due to the effects of large-scale communication between the sensor
    nodes and the BS. Although it is not essential for operation of the IoT sensor
    network, it is advisable to have a CH bearing more computation/communication/energy
    resources than the regular sensors of the cluster. A data capturer sensor node,
    as shown in Fig. 2, is responsible for fusing the data obtained from the general
    sensors and then forwarding the data to the CHs. The sensory data will be hashed
    and stored in the sensor node for a period of time, i.e.,  , before it is encrypted
    and transmitted to the BS. The communication model for the sensor node-base station
    communication will be WiMAX/6LoWPAN or LTE, depending on the application domain.
    Data once received at the BS will be verified for integrity. In addition, the
    data will be checked for freshness before it is stored for further processing.
    At the BS, the mode of operation of the sensor reading analyzer will be multimodal,
    as the data being received at the BS will be from multiple CHs belonging to various
    clusters of sensors, which were originally deployed in the application’s environment.
    Data fusion is defined as the process of combining information from various sources.
    For our application, the input to the data fusion engine is from the numerous
    sensors that were deployed in the environment for monitoring. The benefits of
    data fusion are several; in particular, this process allows for a reduction in
    the dimensionality of data and for improved performance of the underlying communication
    network. Download : Download high-res image (108KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. A DoS attack scenario against a data capturer node. 4.2. DoS attack
    model A DoS attack is defined as an attack comprising a large volume of network
    traffic packets generated by a set of compromised or rogue sensory nodes, generated
    to overwhelm a data capturer node and to incapacitate it from further participation
    in the network operations (see also Fig. 2). As a result of this high volume of
    network packets, the victim node, the data capturer in this case, is overwhelmed
    and is unable to continue performing its sensory tasks, i.e., observing sensory
    phenomena and reporting to the centralized BS. A DoS attack against the data capturer
    can be catastrophic to the routine operations of the sensor network and may cause
    large-scale disruptions. The timely detection of a DoS attack against the data
    capturer is beneficial for mitigating the effects of the attack. The trained classifiers
    operate on the data capturer node and detect the large-volume DoS attack traffic
    intelligently while differentiating it from flash crowds, based on the data features
    tested, as specified during the classifier training phase (see Section 5). Due
    to the potential impact on the victim node, it is essential to detect DoS attacks
    in a timely manner without imposing excessive overhead and yielding low false
    alarms. For the experimental testbed, defined to comprise IoT sensors to act as
    data generators and Raspberry Pi nodes to act as data capturers, a DoS attack
    was defined to generate 13 K network traffic packets from a rogue IoT sensor node,
    with the intended destination being a victim Raspberry Pi data capturer node.
    The traffic generation was made to last for 7 s, which is high rate traffic with
    a long interval, in the context of resource-constrained IoT sensors. Download

    Proposed DoS attack detection framework. 5. ADE-IoT DoS detection framework The
    ADE-IoT attack detection framework (Fig. 3) comprises a packet capturer module
    responsible for capturing raw network traffic in the IoT network. The captured
    packets are subsequently preprocessed to extract TCP/IP packet header data and
    for statistical information acquired from collections of packet sequences of a
    given connection. Feature selection and generation are then performed on the preprocessed
    data to identify essential features for classifier training and to generate additional
    features based on statistical network information from the previous step. The
    dataset is then manually labeled ‘Normal’ and ‘Attack’, based on defined criteria,
    and the classifiers are trained on a percentage of the entire dataset. The performance
    of the classifier is then compared with those of other classifiers based on the
    outputs of the classification phase. 5.1. Dataset preparation and labeling As
    part of dataset generation, the application domains for the IoT sensors consist
    of temperature, motion, air quality, and gas analysis IoT sensors (see Table 1).
    The experimental testbed was developed to test the efficacy of a real-life IoT
    sensor network that is subject to a DoS attack (see Fig. 4). All physical IoT
    sensors are interfaced with two data capturers, namely, Raspberry Pi-3 and ESP8266
    (Wemos D1 Mini), through the GPIO (general purpose input output) pins. Python
    scripts running on Raspberry Pis and C code running on ESP8266 constantly performed
    data reads from the GPIO pins. The message queuing telemetry protocol (MQTT) was
    the deployed protocol to facilitate message exchange between the data capturers
    and the data generators. As mentioned in Section 2, MQTT has inherent provisions
    for TLS-level security; however, it is still not resilient to DoS attacks. A central
    MQTT broker machine does message routing between data producer and data consumer
    IoT sensor nodes. The attack test environment consisted of data generators, capturers,
    and a BS (Fig. 4). DoS attacks were carried out by selected generator nodes against
    the given data capturer. First, legitimate network traffic was collected using
    the TCPdump tool [37]; no attack traffic was generated. The second phase of experiments
    comprised attack traffic. The attack dataset consisted of flood attacks launched
    against the data capturer node. The dataset consisted of 100 sensors, of which
    50 sensors sent temperature (random) updates (data generators) each second and
    the remaining 50 received updates (data capturers). Table 1. Sensor applications.

    converter MCP3008 was used to convert to digital values The total number of IoT
    sensors deployed in the experimental setup was 16, and each sensor had variable
    message sending intervals and message formats. Two Wi-Fi routers were integrated
    into the platform to connect the data capturers (Raspberry Pis, ESP8266) and the
    Cloud (Broker servers). IoT devices were evenly distributed between the two Wi-Fi
    routers. A separate attacker node, analogous to a rogue sensor node of Fig. 2,
    was connected to the IoT network to launch the DoS attack. The packets, legitimate
    and attack, were captured at the broker server by the TCPdump tool. The DoS attack
    was launched in two phases, lasting 5 and 3 s. The HPING3 tool had also options
    to use spoofed source IP addresses when sending the SYNflood attack; however,
    this option was not selected, as testing spoofed attack packets is beyond the
    scope of the proposed scheme. The messages communicated between the data generators
    and capturers comprised a serial number for the message, a timestamp, and the
    temperature reading of the sensor. DoS Attack: The attack machine (Kali linux)
    was concealed behind the 192.168.56.1 IP address, through network address translation
    (NATing); the same machine was responsible for launching the DoS attack against
    the data capturer on port 1883. Using the Wireshark tool, relevant TCP and IP
    parameters were selected. The data were then exported in comma-separated value
    (CSV) format for labeling; legitimate traffic was marked with character ‘N’ and
    the DoS attack instances were marked as ‘S’. Download : Download high-res image
    (201KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Experimental testbed with
    4 sensor types subject to an adversarial DoS attack. A total of 365,016 data samples
    of legitimate network traffic and 256,324 samples of attack traffic comprise the
    dataset. 5.2. Feature selection/generation A feature selection and generation
    step was performed by analyzing the traffic captured at the data capturer nodes.
    The Wireshark network packet capture tool was deployed to prepare the dataset
    for training and testing the individual classifiers. The Wireshark tool extracts
    both numeric and nominal transmission control protocol (TCP) features. All nine
    network traffic attributes of the IoT testbed are listed in Table 2. To improve
    the classifier performance, feature ranking was conducted; feature ranking is
    known to reduce the errors caused by irrelevant or less valuable features. Note
    that we performed the intensive test among the state of the art feature selections,
    i.e., (1) chi-squared or CS ( ) (CS depends on the statistical test, which determines
    the independence of two events) which the events used in feature selection are
    the occurrence of the attribute and occurrence of the class; (2) info-gain (IG)
    (IG ranks the features based on the reduction in entropy when a particular feature
    is selected); and (3) gain-ratio (GR) (GR addresses the drawbacks in the info-gain
    technique, which ranks a feature higher with large variations). The gain-ratio
    technique effectively normalizes the information gain using the intrinsic value
    or information value of the feature. The performance of CS is superior, and thus,
    in this research, we adopt the CS ranking method. After ranking the features based
    on the chi-squared techniques defined above, in Table 3, we enumerate the five
    features that were selected for the attack detection framework. In addition, two
    statistical features, namely, the interarrival time and moving average, were added
    to the dataset to improve the accuracy of DoS attack detection. The interarrival
    time depicts the time lapse between two consecutive network traffic packets (i.e.,
    Time.Delta). The moving or rolling average of the interarrival times (i.e., Moving
    average) takes into account n previous observations (packets) for a given time
    window (W) and is calculated over a continuous series of observations, where an
    observation is defined as the feature extracted tuple of a data packet. The moving
    average also provides separation between the normal and attack traffic interarrival
    times by smoothing out short-time fluctuations over time. Note that the performance
    of the ranked features as well as the introduced twos will be addressed in the
    next section. Table 2. Feature set with attribute value and type. Feature name

    a 66% share of the preprocessed dataset was introduced to all the classifiers,
    namely, C4.5, MLP, Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network, A1DE, A2DE, MultiScheme, and
    Voting. The training phase for the A1DE and A2DE classifiers included the sequence
    of steps of the algorithm, as illustrated in Section 3. For the purposes of the
    experiments, the trained IoT classifier was deployed on the data capturer node
    and was designated the task to intelligently detect the large volume of DoS attack
    traffic while differentiating it from flash crowds based on the selected features,
    as specified during the classifier training phase. The MultiScheme (A1DE ＋ A2DE)
    operates by choosing the best classifier from the A1DE and A2DE classifiers by
    first identifying the training phase accuracy over the entire dataset and then
    deciding which classifier to adopt for the testing phase. The Voting (A1DE ＋ A2DE)
    scheme combines the outputs of the two selected classifiers, A1DE and A2DE by
    applying the average of probabilities combination rule [35]. If both classifiers
    generate the sample classification output for a given data sample, then the classifier
    outcome is accepted during testing, and if there is a difference between the two
    outcomes, then the result for deciding which classifier to proceed with for testing
    is randomly selected in serial order, i.e., the A1DE classifier output is given
    precedence over the A2DE classifier output. 6. Performance analysis The classification
    of the captured network traffic was carried out in the Weka Data Mining Software
    Environment [38]. For analysis, i.e., testing data packets on both ingress and
    egress channels of the network were presented to the classifiers. The performance
    of six classifiers, namely, A1DE, A2DE, Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Network, C4.5, and
    MLP, was compared. In addition, the performance of the MultiScheme and Voting-based
    techniques was also compared. The performance of the dependence estimator-based
    classifiers was not compared to the SOMs, as these are known to have sluggish
    training times, which make them ineffective for deployment on resource-constrained
    IoT sensor nodes. The key metric is the attack precision, i.e., accuracy, based
    on the confusion matrix [39] given predicted and actual values in terms of TP
    (true positive), FN (false negative), FP (false positive), and TN (true negative),
    used to illustrate the classification accuracy. In addition, for sensitivity analysis,
    we also provide the derived metrics as precision, recall, and F-score, as shown
    in the equations below. (1) (2) (3) (4) The classification experiment was conducted
    for 3 varying feature sets, namely, 5 features, 5 features ＋ interarrival time,
    and 5 features ＋ interarrival time ＋ moving average. In Table 4, the results obtained
    from the 5-feature classification experiment are illustrated. The MultiScheme
    classifier performance was at par with the A2DE classifier with an accuracy of
    0.9914. However, the time required for model building, i.e., training, was much
    higher for the MultiScheme at 10.24 s than the 3.02 s time for A2DE. The F-scores,
    defined as the mean of the precision and recall for the classifier, were found
    to accurately represent classifier performance in order of accuracy; A2DE, MultiScheme,
    A1DE, Voting, Naïve Bayesian Network, C4.5, MLP, and Naïve Bayes. A characteristic
    of DoS attacks is to flood the victim with large numbers of packets at a fast
    rate. The interarrival time of DoS attacks follows a Poison distribution, whereas
    the interarrival time of normal traffic follows a Gaussian distribution [34].
    This distinction between normal and attack traffic can be used to increase the
    detection accuracy of various classifiers. Further tests were run with the introduction
    of the interarrival_time feature, i.e., feature #6. The results obtained are illustrated
    in Table 5. The A2DE and the MultiScheme schemes were again performed at par with
    a yielded accuracy of 0.9959, albeit with the A2DE scheme outperforming the MultiScheme
    in terms of model building time, i.e., 5.99 vs. 15.83 s. The overall classification
    results reported in Tables 4 and 5 indicate a marginal increase in the performance
    of all the classifiers as well as the MultiScheme and Voting methods, with introduction
    of the interarrival feature (feature #6). The reason for such a mere marginal
    increase in performance is that the interarrival time between packets only depicts
    the change between two consecutive packets and does not represent the trend in
    network activity occurring during a DoS attack. To add this trend of network activity,
    a moving or rolling average of the interarrival times can be computed. The rolling
    or moving average takes the previous n observations (packets) for a given time
    window (W) into consideration to reflect the shifting trend in the observations
    associated with a DoS attack. Such a moving average can be calculated over a continuous
    series of observations, where an observation is defined as a feature extracted
    tuple of a data packet. The moving average also provides separation between the
    normal and attack traffic interarrival times by smoothing out short-term fluctuations
    in packet arrival intensities over a fixed window of time. To assess the impact
    of considering the moving average as a feature in detecting DoS attacks, a feature
    equating to the moving average of interarrival times with variable window sizes,
    starting with , is added as an additional feature to the dataset, the results
    presented in Table 6. For the 7-feature experiment, the A2DE and MultiScheme methods
    both performed at par, in terms of the accuracy and F-score, but with a slower
    model building time reported for MultiScheme. In addition, the MLP was found to
    perform well in the presence of the 7th feature in the dataset, yielding a classification
    accuracy of 0.9895. However, the excessively long model building time of the MLP
    classifier time, 296.99 s, makes it a sluggish classifier to adopt for real-time
    detection of DoS attacks in an IoT environment. The results also indicate that
    the performance of all the classifiers increased, especially the performance of
    the Naïve Bayes, C4.5, and MLP classifiers, which drastically increased when the
    moving average of interarrival time was included as a feature. To further analyze
    the impact of choosing various window sizes on the detection accuracy, varying
    window sizes (W) were tested for each individual classifier (Table 7). Table 4.

    Bayes, Naïve Bayesian Network, C4.5, and MLP drastically increased and matched
    the performance of A2DE and A1DE for . The impact of window sizes greater than
    10 and less than 500 was negligible on the detection accuracy of the individual
    classifiers. There was a marginal decrease in the classifier performance for .
    The reason for the detection accuracy of all the classifiers with the use of moving
    averages as an additional feature and with is that moving averages smoothen the
    short-term fluctuations in the packet arrival intensities and better represent
    a long-term trend in traffic flow, differentiating legitimate traffic from DoS
    attack traffic. These averages provide the necessary separation between normal
    and attack traffic because normal traffic has higher interarrival times than DoS
    attack traffic. Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 illustrate the comparison of interarrival
    times for normal and attack traffic for 100 observations, with no moving average,
    moving average with , and moving average with . The moving average with (Fig.
    7) shows the highest separation between normal and attack traffic compared to
    the separation with (Fig. 6) and no moving average (Fig. 5); thus, the detection
    accuracy of all the classifiers tested increases through the introduction of the
    W feature, clearly demarking legitimate traffic from DoS attack traffic. Although
    the performance of A2DE was the best among all classifiers for the IoT dataset
    that was tested, the MultiScheme and Voting schemes yield better performance for
    datasets that portray a narrow class variance between the two classes of data.
    Moreover, applications of IoT that rely on poor model building classifiers will
    benefit from the MultiScheme and Voting schemes, as the best model out of the
    choice of two will be selected as the classifier at time of testing. To confirm
    the superior performance of A2DE across a separately simulated IoT dataset, we
    tested the A1DE and A2DE implementations on the BoT–IOT dataset described in [40],
    which comprises 477 legitimate traffic samples and 3,668,045 attack samples. The
    data were captured from an IoT deployment in a laboratory environment and comprise
    both legitimate and malicious network traffic; the attacks included are DDoS,
    DoS, operating system and service scan, keylogging, and data exfiltration. A detailed
    description of the dataset is presented in [40]. Download : Download high-res

    traffic with for 100 observations. The performance of both the A1DE and A2DE classifiers
    was evaluated on a subset of the original data using a moving average window size
    of 10 and compared to the performance of a radial neural network (RNN) from [40].
    As is evident from Table 8, the A2DE classifier yielded the best attack detection
    values for two of the six attack types, namely, DoS-HTTP and DDoS-HTTP, and the
    performance across the remaining four attack types was comparable for A1DE and
    A2DE. However, the accuracy of the RNN was close to 98% for the HTTP DoS traffic,
    compared to a 99.8% accuracy for the dependence estimators; the HTTP traffic detection
    accuracy of the radial neural network was well below those of both A1DE and A2DE,
    but the accuracies were found to be similar for the four other attack categories.
    Our findings thus demonstrate the superiority of A2DE across both datasets, based
    on the reported accuracies (compare with Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7).
    7. Conclusion Service-centric WSNs hold promise for the future of the IoT paradigm.
    The underlying principles of data communication for sensor networks have evolved
    over time to include new standards. However, the adversarial threat to the availability
    of sensor resources still remains, with DoS attacks posing a threat to the routine
    operations of a sensor network, merely through large-volume network traffic generation
    targeting specific sensor nodes. In this paper, an ADE-based DoS attack detection
    scheme was presented for IoT sensors. The results showed a high accuracy for the
    A2DE and the MultiScheme classifiers for all feature sets tested. In addition,
    the variation in the feature W, window of packets, was found to have an impact
    on the performance of the individual classifiers as well as the MultiScheme and
    Voting classification techniques, with a providing the highest classification
    accuracies of all W values for the A2DE classifier. Note that although the performance
    of A2DE at DDoS detection in IoT is confirmed, different aspects still require
    intensive investigation, including heterogeneous traffic, scalability, traffic
    density and diversity, a variety of network topologies, and various classes of
    mining techniques for improving detection performance. All of these topics are
    left to future studies. Declaration of Competing Interest No author associated

    \ sector). Te insightful discussion based on the diﬀerent categories is also presented\
    \ in the paper. In particular, ﬁrst, we\nintroduce the IoT and IIoT and then discuss\
    \ the need for smart contracts in IoT and IIoT systems. Next, we concentrate on\
    \ the\nconvergence of blockchain and IoT with state-of-the-art research. In addition,\
    \ this article also provides the open and future\nresearch directions towards\
    \ this era with the highlighted observations.\n1. Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) consists of devices and machines\nequipped with networking capability\
    \ which can collect data\nfrom their environment via various sensors, share them\
    \ with\nother devices over the Internet, and carry out analysis (or\nact) on received\
    \ data automatically without requiring hu-\nman intervention [1, 2]. For example,\
    \ an IoT-based smart\nhome system can use sensors to detect when the electrical\n\
    appliances need to be turned on (or oﬀ) and do so auto-\nmatically, thereby conserving\
    \ energy and making life easier\nfor people. IoT has a huge range from sensors\
    \ and smart\nconsumer devices like smart television, wearable electronics\nto\
    \ human and animal implants (e.g., medical implants or\nidentiﬁcation), and tracking\
    \ chips for animals [3]. IoT has a\nvery wide range of applications starting from\
    \ home\nconsumer products, health, agriculture, energy, and trans-\nport to any\
    \ sector that can beneﬁt from integrating IoT. Te\nnumber of IoT devices is increasing\
    \ at an explosive rate, but\nmany challenges [4] exist with the same. IoT devices\
    \ usually\nhave limited processing capabilities and are vulnerable to\nsecurity\
    \ attacks [5]. Hence, security is an important aspect\nwhile designing the IoT-based\
    \ system.\nTe attacks in the IoT-based system are broadly classiﬁed\ninto four\
    \ major categories [6]. Te ﬁrst category is known as\nthe physical attack in which\
    \ the attacker is physically very\nclose to the network and tries to launch the\
    \ malicious\nfunctionality in the system. Tampering to the IoT device,\njamming\
    \ the radio frequency signals, side-channel attack,\nand malicious code injection\
    \ are the common forms of\nphysical attacks. To counter the physical attack, researchers\n\
    use the physical unclonable function (PUF) [7] for the\nHindawi\nSecurity and\
    \ Communication Networks\nVolume 2021, Article ID 7142048, 21 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7142048\n\
    authentication of IoT devices. In those systems, authenti-\ncation is mainly dependent\
    \ on the challenge-response\nmechanism. Te beauty of using the PUF is that it\
    \ is im-\npossible to clone the exact microstructure of the device. Te\nnetwork\
    \ attack is the second category of attack in which the\nattackers try to manipulate\
    \ the IoTnetwork. Te attacker can\nlaunch this attack without being close to the\
    \ network. Traﬃc\nanalysis attacks, RFID spooﬁng, Sybil attack, and man-in-\n\
    the-middle attack are based on the network attack. Te use\nof a secure hash function\
    \ and authentication technique can\nprevent this attack [8]. Te third and fourth\
    \ categories of\nattacks are known as software attacks and data attacks,\nrespectively.\
    \ In the software attack, the attacker launches the\nattack by considering the\
    \ advantages of software present in\nthe IoT system. In contrast, a data attack\
    \ involves data in-\nconsistency and unauthorized access to the data. Te\nblockchain-enabled\
    \ privacy-preserving technique eﬃciently\nprevents the data attacks [9].\nIndustrial\
    \ IoT (IIoT) refers to using IoT technology in\nindustries in order to boost productivity\
    \ and eﬃciency in\nmanufacturing and industrial processes [10]. IoT helps in-\n\
    dustries by improving data collection, machine-to-machine\ncoordination, monitoring\
    \ and maintenance of hardware,\nquality control, supply chain traceability, energy\
    \ manage-\nment, and overall cost reduction. Connecting everything to\nthe Internet\
    \ [11] oﬀers a great advantage; sensors can collect\nand harvest data and then\
    \ send them to the servers equipped\nwith high processing capabilities for further\
    \ analysis and\nmake decisions based on which they can then be enacted by\nother\
    \ IoT devices [12]. For example, a watering system for\ncrops can use moisture\
    \ sensors to collect data about soil\nmoisture, send them to a server to ﬁgure\
    \ out when and how\nmuch watering is needed, and automatically water the crops.\n\
    It can even receive information about weather from the\nInternet and make decision\
    \ based on it. Te blockchain is\none of the promising technologies that can solve\
    \ various\nissues (trust, adversary attack, etc.) existing in the IoT and\nIIoT-based\
    \ systems [13]. Blockchain technology involving\nsmart contracts has a wide range\
    \ of applications in the IoT\nand IIoT [14]. IoT is more consumer-oriented (i.e.,\
    \ focuses\non smart appliances which would be beneﬁcial to the end-\nusers), for\
    \ example, a smartwatch that records the pulse rate.\nBlockchain is a decentralized\
    \ peer-to-peer system and\ndistributed immutable ledger [15]. It is a chain of\
    \ blocks,\nwhere block is a piece of information that is made up of\ntransaction,\
    \ and it contains a timestamp, as well as hash of the\nprevious block which is\
    \ used to create the hash of the recent\nblock [16]. Te blockchain technology\
    \ is poised to innovate\nand transform a wide range of applications. It is a database\
    \ or\ndigital ledger of transactions. In traditional databases, cen-\ntralized\
    \ server is used to store the data where centralized\nauthority (as a trusted\
    \ one) deletes or updates the data,\nwhereas, under the blockchain mechanism,\
    \ data are shared\nacross a network of multiple computers (or nodes) which run\n\
    special software to ensure that all data remain identical [17].\nAs the information\
    \ is stored across various computers (or\nnodes) and all the information (blocks)\
    \ is linked with the\nprevious one, it is diﬃcult for the adversary to change\
    \ (or\ndelete) the information from a blockchain-based system and,\nsimultaneously,\
    \ the blockchain helps to securely store and\nvalidate sensitive information that\
    \ maintains the trust in the\ndecentralized network [18].\nSmart contracts are\
    \ an important feature of blockchain\ntechnology. Te Ethereum system uses the\
    \ smart contracts\nfor creating the immutable ledger of records. Smart con-\n\
    tracts are just like contracts in the real world [19]. Te only\ndiﬀerence is that\
    \ they are completely digital, which means\nthat there is an agreement between\
    \ two or more people in the\nform of computer code. It is a computer program that\
    \ is\nstored inside a blockchain that computers (or the nodes)\nexecute, and,\
    \ after execution, the ledger gets updated [20].\nSmart\ncontracts\nare\nself-executing\n\
    codes\nwhen\npre-\ndetermined terms and conditions are met and veriﬁed. As\nthey\
    \ are stored on a blockchain, they inherit some interesting\nproperties; for example,\
    \ they are immutable and distributed\n[21]. Figure 1 illustrates the integration\
    \ of blockchain with\nthe IoT-based system, where data owners send the collected\n\
    data from IoT devices to blockchain for storage, and data\nusers get the data\
    \ from blockchain under the required access\ncontrol mechanism.\nA lot of personal\
    \ information is stored by the devices\ngathered from diﬀerent IoT devices [11],\
    \ which needs to be\nsecure and can only be accessed by the owner and approved\n\
    and veriﬁed stakeholders. Te blockchain is one of the\nprobable solutions that\
    \ can assure integrity and security of\ndata and, with smart contracts, the owner\
    \ can control\nsharing of his data on his terms. Major advantages of\nblockchain\
    \ technology in IIoT are the decentralization,\nimmutable records, and nonrepudiation\
    \ of stored infor-\nmation [22]. Te general working mechanism of smart\ncontracts\
    \ with the IIoT-based system is depicted in Figure 2.\nTe smart contract executes\
    \ the data provided by the IIoT\ndevices and stores them to the blockchain.\n\
    1.1. Background Study of the Smart Contracts. Nick Szabo\nintroduced the smart\
    \ contracts concept in 1994. According\nto Nick Szabo, smart contracts are “a\
    \ computerized trans-\naction protocol which executes the term of contracts.”\
    \ As\nlong as the blockchain is concerned, smart contracts are a\npiece of code\
    \ or scripts (or programs) that store inside the\nblockchain [23]. Te scripts\
    \ are written in a high-level\nlanguage. Generally, smart contracts scripts are\
    \ “IF ...this\nTHEN...this” based statement. Smart contracts always ex-\necute\
    \ in a secure environment. Te closed environment\nprovides the correctness of\
    \ execution and integrity of code\nand data. Tese contracts also interact with\
    \ other contracts\nand other smart contract-based systems. Smart contracts\nmechanisms\
    \ for the blockchain-based system are generally\nbased on a deterministic state\
    \ machine model. Te ﬂow of\nsmart contracts cannot be nondeterministic. Te reason\
    \ is\nthat the nondeterministic model achieves the diﬀerent\noutput (or states)\
    \ for the same inputs, and if the system\nbehaves in a nondeterministic way, consensus\
    \ cannot be\nachieved. All the nodes in a network agree on contracts in\nthe smart\
    \ contract-based system, either in permissionless or\nin permissioned blockchain.\
    \ Tese contracts deﬁne a set of\nrules stored on all the nodes in the blockchain\
    \ network. In\n2\nSecurity and Communication Networks\nturn, blockchain nodes\
    \ execute these scripts to perform\ncertain activities or transactions in a network\
    \ [24]. Te\nsystematic architecture of state machine-based smart con-\ntract is\
    \ illustrated in Figure 3. In this directed graph, vertices\nrepresent the state,\
    \ and edges represent the transition from\none state to another. Te set of actions\
    \ (Authentication,\nNoAction, Violation, Permission, etc.) are used for transi-\n\
    tion from one state to another. For example, if the machine is\nin state 0 and\
    \ the action is Authentication, the machine\nautomatically moves from state 0\
    \ to state 1, and if it is in state\n1 and the action is Violation, the machine\
    \ automatically\nmoves to state 2, and so on.\nTe smart contracts are not developed\
    \ well initially due\nto the lack of relevant digital systems and theoretical\n\
    techniques. At that time, there are hardly any digital assets\navailable which\
    \ are directly manipulated by the contracts.\nTe limitation on computational law\
    \ is the second big\nchallenge associated with the contracts. Te computational\n\
    law requires the very eﬃcient execution of code, but fast\nprocessors’ unavailability\
    \ limits this process. Lastly, the lack\nof a creditable environment stagnates\
    \ the development of\nsmart contracts [25]. In the last few years, decentralized\n\
    blockchain platforms provided a secure and trusted envi-\nronment for the execution\
    \ of smart contracts. Te tech-\nnology is changing very rapidly; simultaneously,\
    \ the\nattackers are too smart as well. Concerning smart contracts,\nthe attackers\
    \ try to inject the vulnerabilities in the smart\ncontracts. In 2018, the MAIAN\
    \ tool was used by Nikolic et al.\n[26] to perform the security analysis in the\
    \ smart contracts.\nTey collected the 1million smart contracts for this, and the\n\
    result revealed that the 34200 smart contracts are vulnerable,\nwhere, on average,\
    \ each contract takes 10 seconds. Nowa-\ndays, many formal veriﬁcation tools are\
    \ available, which can\ncheck the smart contracts and ﬁnd out the bugs and errors\n\
    associated with the same. To check the vulnerability in smart\ncontracts code,\
    \ many researchers and coders use the Oyente\ntool. Tis tool generally captures\
    \ time-stamp dependence,\ntransaction ordering dependence, and reentrancy. When-\n\
    ever the smart contracts are checked using the Oyente tool,\nthe program variables\
    \ are replaced by the symbolic variables.\nDiﬀerent paths are examined and generate\
    \ the control ﬂow\ngraph of the contract byte code [27].\nTe beneﬁts of smart\
    \ contracts include the faster and\nmore accurate execution, cost reduction, and\
    \ trust. Due to\nData Storage\nIoT Environment\nData\nDevice\nregistration\nBlockchain\

    \ system.\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n3\ntheir unique features, many\
    \ applications use the smart\ncontracts according to their needs and requirements.\
    \ Te\ndiverse scope of the smart contracts includes the following:\n(1) In the\
    \ present time, the costly and risky settlement\nprocess hinders the eﬃciency\
    \ of transactions pro-\ncessed in the trade settlement system. Due to the\ninvolvement\
    \ of a number of sequential practices, the\nsettlement process is time-consuming\
    \ and ineﬀective.\nFor example, on average, more than 20 days are re-\nquired\
    \ to settle a leveraged loan. In this context, smart\ncontracts can play a signiﬁcant\
    \ role where the\ntransactions are not executed until the predeﬁned\nconditions\
    \ are met. Tey also reduce the risk and\ndecrease the operational cost and settlement\
    \ time [28].\n(2) Similar to the trade settlement, the current mortgage\nlending\
    \ relies on outdated processes and frame-\nworks. Te loan approvement requires\
    \ a lot of pa-\nperwork and involves many intermediaries (many\nbank employees\
    \ and third parties). Each ﬁnancial\ndocument is manually shared with multiple\
    \ de-\npartments, which needs to be signed and tracked by\nthe authorities [29].\
    \ Terefore, this whole process\nrequires a lot of human eﬀort and sometimes it\
    \ is\nvulnerable because of human mistakes. With the\nintegration of smart contracts,\
    \ the entire process can\nbe digitized and automated.\n(3) Te land registry process\
    \ involves the real-estate\nagents who examine the land documents such as\nbuyer\
    \ and seller agreement records and construction\ndata. Te involvement of the third\
    \ party and its\nmanual process lead to the alteration of land doc-\numents and,\
    \ consequentially, fraud. A lot of extra\nmoney is also paid to the third party\
    \ for the set-\ntlement of land. Smart contracts-enabled blockchain\nsystems can\
    \ solve the aforementioned problem,\nwhere the blockchain token contains the relevant\n\
    information of property such as buyer and seller ID\nand legal description [30].\n\
    (4) Te insurance industry faces various challenges such\nas high operational costs\
    \ and slow claim processing.\nTo further speed up the transaction, the insurance\n\
    sector can integrate the smart contracts and block-\nchain, where only a few seconds\
    \ are required to settle\nthe claims and transfer the funds from one party to\n\
    another [31]. Te IIoT devices play a crucial role for\nthe insurance industry,\
    \ where the smart sensors are\nplaced on the vehicle (or home) and transfer the\
    \ real-\ntime data to authorities. After verifying the user’s\ncredentials, the\
    \ smart contracts are automatically\ntriggered to settle the claim.\n1.2. Importance\
    \ of Smart Contracts in IIoT. Te smart con-\ntract executes automatically, independently,\
    \ and in a trans-\nparent manner (based on the agreement policies) and transfers\n\
    the ownership of the assets between the two parties without the\ninvolvement of\
    \ a trusted third party (TTP). Te detachment of\nTTP in the smart (digital) contracts\
    \ saves the extra money and\ntime that are associated with the physical contracts\
    \ [32]. Te\nkey advantage of smart contracts includes the automation,\ntransparency,\
    \ accuracy, enhanced security, and trust, and the\nvery brief description of the\
    \ same is discussed below.\nTe smart contract system creates an environment of\
    \ trust\nas the information and logic of the smart contracts are visible\nto all\
    \ the participants of the network (based on the permis-\nsioned and permissionless\
    \ network model). In the industrial\nIoT system, the participants are distributed\
    \ across the globe,\nand it is necessary for the industrial sectors to provide\
    \ full\ntransparency in the system [33]. Te smart contracts-based\nIIoTsystem\
    \ is the best option for achieving this. Te industrial\nsectors generally used\
    \ a third party that maintains a level of\nState\n0\nState\n1\nState\n2\nState\n\

    \ in the system. Due to the TTP, extra\ncosts occurred in the industrial sectors.\
    \ Te smart contract not\nonly removes the TTP but also provides trust in the global\n\
    trustless environment. Te adoption of smart contracts in the\nindustrial sector\
    \ provides more automation for the contracts.\nAlso. once a contract is deployed\
    \ over the blockchain network\n(under the assumption of the majority of consensus),\
    \ no one\ncan change it. Smart contracts provide more eﬃciency and\nspeed in the\
    \ system. By using smart contracts, processed\ntransactions per unit of time are\
    \ more than the traditional\ncontracts [34]. Te IIoTsector (such as healthcare)\
    \ generates a\nlarge volume of data; therefore, to process them, smart con-\n\
    tracts are the best-suited option for IIoT sectors.\n1.3. Contributions of the\
    \ Paper. Te objective of this paper is\nto illustrate how blockchain technology\
    \ solves the issues\nassociated with the IoT and IIoT system. Te primary\ncontributions\
    \ of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(1) A very brief introduction of IoT\
    \ and IIoT is ﬁrst\nprovided in the paper. Meanwhile, the various re-\nsearch\
    \ challenges associated with the IoT and IIoT\nare also outlined in the paper.\n\
    (2) Tis paper highlights the importance of smart\ncontracts in the IIoT sector.\n\
    (3) We classify the existing solutions into the three\nmajor categories, data\
    \ storage and management\ntechnique, industrial sector, and big data, cloud\n\
    computing,\nand\nnetwork\nsecurity\nmanagement\ntechnique, and discuss each of\
    \ them.\n(4) We provide a state-of-the-art comparison of dif-\nferent categories\
    \ of the presented solutions in a\ntabular form, concerning the technology used,\n\
    possible solutions, and the implementation remarks.\n(5) Based on our comprehensive\
    \ survey, this paper\nprovides the open research issues and our obser-\nvations\
    \ that can be useful for the development of\nblockchain-based IoT and IIoT systems.\n\
    1.4. Organization of the Paper. Te paper is organized as\nfollows: Section 1 introduces\
    \ our paper by describing the IoT\nand IIoTsystems, as well as the need for blockchain\
    \ in those\nsystems. Section 2 discusses the adoption of blockchain\ntechnology\
    \ in diﬀerent application areas including the\nhealthcare, supply chain system,\
    \ and IoT. Te state-of-the-\nart researches based on the diﬀerent categories are\
    \ presented\nin Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 elaborate the open research\nissues,\
    \ as well as our observations from the state-of-the-art\nresearch. Finally Section\
    \ 6 provides the conclusion of the\npaper with future research.\n2. Adoption of\
    \ Blockchain Technology in\nApplication Domains\nTe blockchain technology is applicable\
    \ in diﬀerent domains\nranging from health sector and supply chain management\n\
    system to IoT, smart and autonomous vehicles, and so forth.\nTis technology is\
    \ applicable to handling the various\nchallenges that are faced by the traditional\
    \ system; for ex-\nample, the functionality of the system depends on the trusted\n\
    third party, as well as many more.\n2.1. Health Sector. Due to the continuously\
    \ increasing world\npopulation, the health sector becomes one of the most\nimportant\
    \ social-economic problems. Te numbers of\nhospitals and resources in the hospitals\
    \ are very limited and,\nin some areas, there are no hospitals. Currently, wearable\n\
    health devices play an important role in remote patient’s\ntreatment. Tese devices\
    \ continuously measure the patient\nand collect the health data for the required\
    \ treatment. Te\nadvantage of this technique is that the healthcare team and\n\
    the doctors access the data remotely at any time. But the\nprivacy and security\
    \ of these wearable devices are a chal-\nlenging task. Incorporating the blockchain\
    \ technology in the\nhealth sector potentially overcomes few of the challenges\n\
    that are faced by this sector. In the continuation of it, the\nauthors in [35]\
    \ proposed a new model for monitoring re-\nmote patients using the patient agent-based\
    \ blockchain\nsystem. Te health-related data are collected by the wearable\nsensors\
    \ and transmitted to the patient agent that further\nbreaks the data into small\
    \ blocks before storing them in the\nblockchain network. Meanwhile Xia et al.\
    \ [36] suggested a\nblockchain-based secure data-sharing scheme for the private\n\
    health-data management system. Te suggested protocol\nused\nidentity-based authentication\n\
    and\nkey-agreement\nprotocol. To manage the individual health records and\nsupport\
    \ the secure sharing of patient’s data across the dif-\nferent hospitals, insurance\
    \ companies, and medical centers,\nthe blockchain-based solutions have been proposed\
    \ by the\nauthors [37]. Tis model guarantees the security and privacy\nof health\
    \ data. Furthermore, an attribute-based signature\nscheme to manage the decentralized\
    \ health records based on\nthe blockchain mechanism gas been proposed by Sun et\
    \ al.\n[38]. Tis scheme veriﬁes the authenticity of the health data\nand also\
    \ preserves the privacy of the health-data owner.\nGriggs et al. [39] suggested\
    \ that the smart contracts enabled\nthe permissioned blockchain platform to monitor\
    \ the re-\nmote patients. Te medical sensors collect the data and send\nthem to\
    \ the smart contracts for further analysis. Te PBFT\nconsensus mechanism is used\
    \ by this system for the block\nvalidation. Te patient-centric approach for sharing\
    \ medical\ninformation among the diﬀerent hospitals and research\ninstitutions\
    \ is proposed by the authors in [40]. Te privacy of\nthe patient’s medical data\
    \ is ensured by the system.\n2.2. Supply Chain Management. In the supply chain\
    \ man-\nagement system, a product consists of multiple parts that are\nprovided\
    \ by the diﬀerent manufacturers. In the entire\nprocess, if any manufacturer or\
    \ any other entity submits the\nlow-quality parts (or forged parts), then it is\
    \ quite expensive\nto detect the low-quality parts. Te integration of blockchain\n\
    with IoTsolves the above-mentioned issue. Te unique ID of\nevery part is attached\
    \ with the timestamp and stored in the\nblockchain network, which is traceable\
    \ at any time. In [41],\nthe authors adopted the blockchain mechanism for the\n\
    Security and Communication Networks\n5\nauthentication of every part that is provided\
    \ by the owner.\nMeanwhile, in [42], the authors integrate the blockchain\nwith\
    \ the IoT to trace the products. Tey used the Ethereum\nplatform for it. Te suggested\
    \ method achieves the data\nprovenance in the supply chain management system.\
    \ Te\nauthors in [43] showed that the integration of IoT with the\nblockchain\
    \ mechanism helps to reduce the cost and risk and\nfasten the supply chain process.\
    \ Moreover, to improve the\nquality and its services, machine learning and the\
    \ blockchain\nmechanism are combined in [44]. To provide the traceability\nsystem\
    \ for an agrifood supply chain, the authors in [45] used\nthe radio-frequency\
    \ identiﬁcation (RFID) with the block-\nchain mechanism. Te system provides transparency\
    \ and\nproduct traceability. Te double marginalization and in-\nformation asymmetry\
    \ are the problems associated with the\nsupply chain system. To solve this kind\
    \ of problems,\nNakasumi [46] proposed a solution based on the homo-\nmorphic\
    \ encryption method for the security and privacy of\nthe user’s data. In [47],\
    \ the authors proposed the blockchain-\nbased secured information-sharing scheme\
    \ for the supply\nchain system. Te two-phase validation protocol (transac-\ntion\
    \ and block validation) was designed by the authors to\nenhance the security of\
    \ the proposed system. To show\ntransparency in the supply chain system, smart\
    \ contracts\nwere designed and the Ethereum blockchain platform was\nused for\
    \ its evaluation.\n2.3. Internet of Tings (IoT). Generally, IoT devices are\n\
    data-centric devices where data are sent and uploaded by a\nhuge number of devices.\
    \ Both the device and data can be\ntargeted by the attackers. Te attacker sends\
    \ the falsiﬁed\ndata to the network. In the IoT-based system, data can be\npersonal\
    \ and sensitive. Terefore, the integrity and privacy\nof data are the top priority\
    \ for these systems. Blockchain is\nbelieved to solve this issue. Te characteristics\
    \ of block-\nchain attracted the attention of researchers. In the con-\ntinuation\
    \ of this, Gu et al. [48] suggested the malware\ndetection system based on the\
    \ consortium blockchain\nwhich is further based on the statistical analysis method.\n\
    In order to reduce the false-positive rate, they adopted the\nmultiple marking\
    \ function and fuzzy comparison method.\nFurther, a blockchain technology-based\
    \ ﬁrmware update\nmethodology was proposed by the authors in [49] for the\nprotection\
    \ of embedded devices in the IoT system. To\nmanage the IoT devices, the authors\
    \ in [22] suggested the\nblockchain technology-based access control system. Teir\n\
    system consists of a wireless sensor network, agent node,\nsmart\ncontracts,\n\
    management\nhub,\nmanagers,\nand\nblockchain network. Te system is scalable and\
    \ preserves\ntransparency. Te authors in [50] suggested the cloud\nblockchain\
    \ for the IoT system to manage the resource\nallocation scheme. But the disadvantage\
    \ of this scheme is\nthat the smart contracts for resource allocation are not\n\
    investigated. Te IoTis also applicable in the 5G era, where\nmillions of devices\
    \ are connected with each other. To solve\nthe privacy issue in the 5G environment,\
    \ Fan et al. [51]\nproposed the blockchain-based data-sharing and privacy-\npreserving\
    \ scheme.\n3. State-of-the-Art Research\nWith growing innovations and implementation\
    \ of IoT in\ndiﬀerent ﬁelds such as industries, health [52], supply chain\n[47],\
    \ and VANET [53], the huge volume of data is generated\nfrom the above application\
    \ areas, and it is continuously\ngrowing. Te state-of-the-art research is broadly\
    \ classiﬁed\ninto four major categories: data storage and management\ntechnique\
    \ (discussed in Subsection 3.1), industrial sectors\n(discussed in Subsection\
    \ 3.2), big data, cloud computing\ntechnique, and network security management\
    \ technique\n(discussed in Subsection 3.3), and the various techniques\nadopted\
    \ in the healthcare sector (discussed in Subsection\n3.4), which are shown in\
    \ Figure 4.\n3.1. Data Storage and Management Techniques. Te man-\nagement and\
    \ storage of these data for ensuring security,\nintegrity, traceability, and immutability\
    \ as well as the trusted\nexchange of data are of utmost importance in current\
    \ times\n[13]. Tese requirements of IIoT-based systems are easily\nmet by blockchain\
    \ technology. Blockchain technology can\nbe expensive due to the involvement of\
    \ multiple agents (or\nnodes), and it requires high processing and computational\n\
    power. Kurt Peker et al. [54] explored the cost of storing the\ncollected data\
    \ in blockchain for low computation power in\nterms of storage and processing.\
    \ Teir work presented that\noverwriting new data is more cost-eﬃcient than appending\n\
    new data. Tey also demonstrate that storing the data in one\nvariable within a\
    \ smart contract is more cost-eﬃcient than\nstoring the same in an array, but\
    \ the diﬀerence is insig-\nniﬁcant. Tis work provides an idea about how one can\n\
    reduce cost without compromising data storage in the\nblockchain.\nA huge amount\
    \ of data generated by the IoT devices is\ngenerally stored in a centralized cloud\
    \ system, but it requires\ntrust in the central authority, and there can exist\
    \ a single-\npoint-of-failure (SPOF) problem that aﬀects the function-\nality\
    \ of the whole network. Moreover, the data exchange\nbetween the two parties (or\
    \ nodes) takes place through the\nthird party. As a result, all the nodes must\
    \ trust the third\nparty. Manzoor et al. [55] proposed a framework with a\ndistributed\
    \ cloud server and blockchain-enabled smart\ncontact to ensure security and integrity\
    \ of data, and a proxy\nreencryption technique is used while exchanging the data.\n\
    Te distributed cloud solves the problem of centralized\ncloud and SPOF. Te smart\
    \ contract enables the dynamic\ndata exchange between the owner and the receiver\
    \ with some\npreagreed policies and rules to ensure fair, secure, and\ntrusted\
    \ exchange. Tese contracts are mined into blockchain\nfor immutability and traceability.\
    \ However, they utilized the\nelliptic curve cryptography- (ECC-) based implementation,\n\
    and the communication and computation costs are high in\ntheir method. In addition\
    \ to this, the authors also did not\npresent any security validation of the framework.\n\
    Pan et al. [56] proposed a framework called EdgeChain\nfor improving the scalability\
    \ of the centralized cloud by\ndeploying edge computing. Tey used a permissioned\n\
    blockchain that ensured only authorized nodes are part of\n6\nSecurity and Communication\
    \ Networks\nthe network. Te credit-based resource management scheme\n(resource\
    \ obtaining depending on rules, priorities, and past\nbehavior), along with the\
    \ smart contracts for monitoring,\ncontrolling, and regulating IoT devices behaviors\
    \ with de-\nﬁned rules, is used. It also keeps track of resource pool and\nresource\
    \ sharing. However, they utilized the centralized\ncloud server. As a result,\
    \ the functionality of the system\ndepends on the centralized cloud server, and\
    \ they did not\npay much attention to ensuring fair and trusted exchange of\n\
    resources. Tis framework is expensive as edge computing\nhas a complex infrastructure,\
    \ which raises the question of\nmaintenance. Te eﬃcient and frequent computing-re-\n\
    source trading for edge-assisted IoT is still an open issue.\nTe authors in [58]\
    \ focused on data provenance as it\nwould conﬁrm the authentication of data and\
    \ enable their\nreuse. Tere is a private blockchain with diﬀerent types of\nsmart\
    \ contracts, which guarantees provenance receipt to\nactual data in the cloud.\
    \ Te device registration contract\n(unique address), device provenance contract\
    \ (authenticating\ndevice), data provenance contract (data are hashed and stored\n\
    in blockchain along with a timestamp and public key), and\ntraﬃc provenance contract\
    \ (checking for valid data range,\nsampling interval, size of data for each sample,\
    \ data rate, and\nthe destination address) are used by them. All this interacts\n\
    with a centralized cloud server that stores the actual data,\nwhereas the blockchain\
    \ stores only the device metadata.\nFurthermore, their work also did not pay much\
    \ attention to\nfair and trusted data and the exchange between the owner and\n\
    requester as well as the centralized cloud server.\nTe work of Bahga and Madisetti\
    \ [57] was more inclined\ntowards IIoT resource management. Tey proposed a\nframework\
    \ called BPIIoT to provide trustworthy centralized\ncloud resources securely.\
    \ Te framework consisted of a\npublic blockchain in which each IoT device would\
    \ have an\naccount and wallet for easy data exchange. Te smart\ncontract (with\
    \ the rules and policies) eliminates third-party\ninvolvement. It also interacts\
    \ with the centralized cloud\nwhere the actual data is stored. Te blockchain keeps\
    \ track of\nBlockchain in IIoT\nData storage and\nmanagement\ntechniques\nIndustrial\

    \ machine maintenance. Once a smart contract is\nemployed and a transaction is\
    \ made, it is mined into the\nblockchain; therefore, it becomes immutable and\
    \ traceable.\nTe proposed work utilized the centralized cloud and has\nemployed\
    \ public blockchain.\nHuh et al. [11] worked on synchronization and com-\nmunication\
    \ of IoT devices when thousands of them are\nconnected to a network, thereby ensuring\
    \ scalability. Tey\nproposed building an IoT system using blockchain. All the\n\
    devices will be conﬁgured on the blockchain and smart\ncontracts will be used\
    \ for monitoring the behavior of the IoT\ndevices. Meter contract would record\
    \ the performance data\nof the IoT device and send them to the blockchain, whereas\n\
    policy contract states about the working of the devices and\nkey management technique\
    \ are used to keep public key and\nsignatures of the devices for device authentication.\
    \ Te\ndevices do not have large storage to store data, and, for doing\nthis, they\
    \ utilized the third party which would compromise\nthe security of the system.\
    \ For both large storage and se-\ncurity, the cost will be very high and infeasible\
    \ for small\ndevices. Tables 1 and 2 show the brief overview of diﬀerent\ndata\
    \ storage and management techniques used for IIoT-\nbased system.\nZareen et al.\
    \ [60] suggested the oﬀ-chain storage\nmechanism (i.e., IPFS) with the blockchain.\
    \ Te model\nutilizes the oﬀ-chain storage model for storing the IoT data\nand\
    \ node credentials. Moreover, the blockchain is used to\nstoring the hash that\
    \ the IPFS provides. A prototype for the\nservice model has been proposed between\
    \ the consumers\nand service providers to share the services. Additionally, the\n\
    secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) does the service veriﬁ-\ncation. In case of dispute\
    \ between the consumers and service\nproviders, a smart contract is designed to\
    \ resolve it. Simi-\nlarly, Na and Park [61] proposed a protocol named\nFusionChain,\
    \ which utilizes the IPFS to solve the storage\nissue faced by blockchain technology.\
    \ Teir mechanism\nadopts the practical byzantine fault tolerance consensus\nmechanism,\
    \ which does not have high computational power\nfor adding a new block in the\
    \ blockchain nodes. Moreover,\npublic key infrastructure-based encryption schemes\
    \ are used\nfor ensuring the security and privacy of IoT data. Teir\nexperimental\
    \ results show that the computational power\nrequired for creating a blockchain\
    \ is lower than those of the\ntraditional platforms such as bitcoin and Ethereum.\
    \ Te\npaper in [59] proposed an IIoTdata management framework\nbased on the blockchain\
    \ and IPFS. Te authors have sug-\ngested\nthe\nproof-of-concept-based\nimplementation\n\
    to\nachieve better security for IIoT data that further utilize the\nIOTA protocol\
    \ and IPFS. Te data-handling unit, IPFS,\nIOTA Tangle, and IIoTdata consumers\
    \ are the central unit of\ntheir system. In this paper, the authors only provide\
    \ the\ntheoretical analysis of the suggested protocol. Te authors in\n[62] suggested\
    \ a decentralized architecture to incorporate the\nchallenges faced by the smart\
    \ cities, which is further based on\nthe combination of IoT, smart contract, blockchain,\
    \ and IPFS.\nTe simulation of the proposed prototype is done using the\nGanache\
    \ CLI v6.9.1, Solidity v0.5.16, Truﬄe Suite v5.1.15,\nand Remix IDE. In this work,\
    \ the authors discuss the\nprototype model and the results obtained from their\
    \ simu-\nlations. However, they do not discuss the underlining work of\nthe prototype\
    \ model and cryptographic mechanism.\n3.2.IndustrialSectors. Wen et al. [63] proposed\
    \ an improved\nstructure of blockchain-based supply chain system (BSCS)\nwhich\
    \ ensures the security of data, transparency, and access\ncontrol policies in\
    \ the chain by setting access policies to\nsmart contracts. Te BSCS consists of\
    \ 3interdependent parts:\nsupply chain management, supply chain network structure,\n\
    and supply chain business process. In BSCS, attribute-based\nencryption (ABE)\
    \ is used as the supply chain network to\naddress data-sharing, information occlusion,\
    \ and lack of\nsupervision issues. Business processes are enabled by BSCS\nto\
    \ determine which core processes should be connected and\nintegrated into the\
    \ supply chain system by using smart\ncontracts. Te entities of the system may\
    \ interact with the\nnetwork without manual operations and eﬃciently carry out\n\
    the ﬂow of goods by using IIoTas the process interface at the\nboundary in the\
    \ blockchain. Early detection of SPOF issues\nin the network is also addressed.\n\
    Chen\net\nal.\n[64]\nproposed\na\nblockchain-enabled\nsearchable encryption scheme\
    \ for electronic health records\n(EHRs) sharing. It is a logical approach that\
    \ ensures data\nintegrity\nwithout\nadditional\nveriﬁcation,\nstandardized\nauditing\
    \ procedures, and some formalized contracts for\naccessing the data. Tis framework\
    \ securely facilitates data-\nsharing and provides much convenience to patients\
    \ and also\nallows information-sharing among researchers. It also\nsupports complex\
    \ queries by diﬀerent healthcare agents to\nrequest permission for accessing the\
    \ records. A smart\ncontract is used in the proposed work to trace rewards and\n\
    transaction fees and also ensures that the owner of the data is\npaid as long\
    \ as they reveal the transcript, which allows other\nusers to search the database.\
    \ Te EHRs are created by data\nowners (human or organization). Te data owner then\n\
    constructs the index through complex logic expressions and\ncreates a smart contract\
    \ to describe how one can search the\nindex and then it is stored in the blockchain\
    \ for the re-\nspective EHRs. Te symmetric encryption algorithm is used\nto encrypt\
    \ the EHRs and is stored in a cloud server. Te data\nowner authorizes the user\
    \ who needs the required EHR.\nHowever, this scheme lacks the eﬀective countermeasure\
    \ to\npunish the dishonest and malicious entity.\nCurbera et al. [65] focused\
    \ on the use of blockchain for\ndata exchange across the health ecosystem. Several\
    \ cases of\nhealthcare and life sciences are presented, including patient\nconsent,\
    \ outcome-based contracts, data exchange (related to\nthe health), next-generation\
    \ clinical trials, and payments and\nclaims, where, by the adoption of blockchain\
    \ technology,\ncurrent practices can be disrupted and transformed. Te\nauthors\
    \ proposed a blockchain-based architecture for pro-\nviding the secure services\
    \ for the above-mentioned use cases.\nDescribed architecture adds a layer of data\
    \ encryption, and\ndata access is restricted to authorized users only. Encryption\n\
    of data stored on the ledger is done with a data key, and only\nauthorized users\
    \ are given access to the decryption key. Te\ndecryption key will be expired or\
    \ will be no longer available\n8\nSecurity and Communication Networks\nto the\
    \ user, when the access is revoked. Hence, privacy and\nsecurity of data are achieved\
    \ to a greater extent. Moreover,\ntheir framework achieves scalability and data\
    \ integrity and\nprovides more ﬂexibility to the participating entities. Te\n\
    additional layer of encryption included in architecture adds\nto the overall latency\
    \ of chain code calls.\nTable 1: Comparison table based on diﬀerent parameters\

    9\nSuliman et al. [66] proposed a smart contracts-based\nblockchain solution to\
    \ monetize the IoT data systematically\nwith automated payment that does not involves\
    \ the third\nparty. Te proposed architectural design considers four\ncomponents,\
    \ each possessing Ethereum addresses: IoT de-\nvice, device owner, MQTT broker,\
    \ and customers. Fur-\nthermore, scripting of smart contracts is done using the\n\
    Ethereum blockchain. Te ether token (cryptocurrency) is\nused for payment purposes.\
    \ Te proposed system comprises\ncode (written in Solidity language), which is\
    \ used by device\nowners to set the rules, and conditions for automating the\n\
    sale of the data of IoTdevices owned by them. If the end-user\nwants to use the\
    \ data, they can interact and call the smart\ncontracts without the third party.\
    \ Furthermore, an MQTT\nbroker hosted in the cloud collects and aggregates the\
    \ data\ngenerated by IoT devices. It also authenticates valid cus-\ntomers through\
    \ the smart contracts. Te hosting in the cloud\nenvironment of the MQTT broker\
    \ provides scalability, re-\nliability, and accessibility to all the customers\
    \ with low\nlatency. A payment (ether) that is based on use time of the\ndevice\
    \ is directly deducted from customer balance upon\nsuccessful data access and\
    \ is sent to the IoT device owner.\nTe gas consumption (ether) when a smart contract\
    \ calls the\nfunction is paid by the customer. It is not debited from the\nfunds\
    \ within the smart contract.\nLombardi et al. [67] proposed a reliable, decentralized,\n\
    and cost-eﬀective infrastructure for trading energy, which\nwas further based\
    \ on smart contracts-enabled blockchain.\nHere, blockchain stores the energy transactions.\
    \ Block-\nchain and smart contracts-based architecture is presented\nfor transactive\
    \ grids, which oﬀers functionalities like\nmanaging energy trading policies, isolating\
    \ devices with\nknown vulnerabilities, carrying out energy auctions within\nthe\
    \ grid, and so forth. Security is improved in the presented\nwork. Presented architecture\

    \ Vangala et al. [69] presented the\ngeneralized architecture for smart agriculture\
    \ based on\nblockchain technology. In this paper, the authors discuss the\nessential\
    \ security requirements and the possible security\nthreats for developing the\
    \ smart agriculture system. After\nthis, they provide the crucial functionalities\
    \ and the various\nchallenges that arise when developing the blockchain-based\n\
    decentralized smart agriculture system. Te generalized\narchitecture of their\
    \ system uses the cloud servers to\nmaintain the full copy of the blockchain.\
    \ Moreover, the\nfuture research challenges and open issues are also presented\n\
    in the paper. Bera et al. [70] proposed an access control\nprotocol for the detection\
    \ and mitigation of unmanned\naerial vehicles using the private blockchain in\
    \ the Internet-\nof-drones (IoD) environment. In this work, the authenti-\ncated\
    \ transactions are collected by the ground station servers\nand a valid block\
    \ is created based on the practical Byzantine\nfault tolerance consensus algorithm.\
    \ Te Real-Or-Random\noracle security model, with the AVISPA as a formal security\n\
    validation tool, is used for formally analyzing the protocol.\nTe solution uses\
    \ elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), hash\nfunctions, and a symmetric-key encryption\
    \ algorithm to\nachieve mutual authentication between the drones and\nstation\
    \ servers and supports the session key agreement.\nFurthermore, the incorporation\
    \ of blockchain provides the\ndesired trust, decentralization of authenticated\
    \ transactions,\nand desired level of security for IoD. Similarly, a paper in\n\
    [71]\ndesigned\nan\naccess\ncontrol\nscheme\nnamed\nDBACP-IoTSG for the IoT-enabled\
    \ smart-grid system based\non blockchain technology. In this protocol, the sensitive\
    \ data\ncollected by the smart meters are sent to the service pro-\nviders through\
    \ public channels. To ensure the security of\ndata, cryptographic primitives such\
    \ as ECC and hash\nfunctions are used. After this, the service providers create\
    \ a\nvalid block based on the voting consensus mechanism. Te\nsecurity protocol\
    \ is veriﬁed informally and formally based\non the AVISPA validation tool, and\

    \ et al. studied the use of smart con-\ntracts for addressing these problems by\
    \ designing and\nevaluating the automated gasoline purchasing (AgasP) ap-\nplication.\
    \ Teir work shows that transparency is achieved,\nsince the transaction is done\
    \ via a smart contract. In ad-\ndition, longevity is ensured as the infrastructure\
    \ is com-\npletely distributed and depends on the infrastructure of\nEthereum\
    \ instead of a centralized entity. Te need for a\ntrusted third party for payment\
    \ is also eliminated as the\npayment is distributed via smart contract. All this\
    \ helped to\nreduce the fees paid by the gas station for a typical\ntransaction.\n\
    Because IoT data are inherently dynamic in nature, it is\nchallenging to ensure\
    \ data integrity for cloud-based IoT\napplications. Traditionally, the third party\
    \ is used for data\nintegrity veriﬁcation, which is not reliable. Liu et al. [73]\n\
    proposed a blockchain-based data integrity service framework\nfor IoT data. Teir\
    \ framework has four parts: data owner’s\napplication and consumer’s application,\
    \ blockchain, and\ncloud storage service. Te cloud is used to store the general\n\
    purpose data (data owners) and a peer-to-peer ﬁle system for\nsharing the data\
    \ between consumers and owners. Tey have\nonly implemented the fundamental functions\
    \ of their pro-\nposed protocols, and their test environment is of small scale.\n\
    Te authors in [81] presented an access control scheme\nfor the end-users based\
    \ on the blockchain mechanism in the\nIIoT environment which further provides\
    \ the data security\nand scalability to the system. In this protocol, the cipher-\n\
    policy attribute-based encryption scheme is used to encrypt\nthe data gathered\
    \ by the IoT smart devices, and then the\nencrypted data are forwarded to the\
    \ gateway nodes. Te\ngateway nodes create the partial blocks from the encrypted\n\
    data and hand them over to the cloud servers. After this, the\ncloud server forms\
    \ the full block based on the practical\nByzantine fault tolerance voting mechanism\
    \ and maintains\nthe peer-to-peer blockchain network. Te cipher-policy\nattribute\
    \ mechanism allows the end-user to access the blocks\nfrom the blockchain. Te\
    \ simulation result captures the\ncomputation costs for the varied numbers of\
    \ transactions in\na block. Son et al. [79] designed a secure authentication\n\
    protocol based on the blockchain for the telecare medical\ninformation system\
    \ which consists of an IoT-enabled\nwireless body area network. Te cipher text-policy\
    \ attribute-\nbased encryption scheme is used as an access control\nmechanism\
    \ to retrieve the data stored in the cloud server.\nTerefore, only the authentic\
    \ users can access the stored\ndata. In addition to that, the scheme integrates\
    \ the con-\nsortium blockchain (based on the proof-of-authority con-\nsensus mechanism)\
    \ maintained by the health centers and\nlocal hospitals, which ensures the integrity\
    \ of data and in-\ncreases the trust in the telecare medical information system.\n\
    Te simulation analysis of the protocol shows that it achieves\nthe desired security\
    \ for the system and resilience against\nvarious security attacks, such as session\
    \ key disclosure at-\ntacks and privileged-insider attacks.\nTe authors in [82]\
    \ created a cloud-based software-\ndeﬁned networking (SDN) framework which mainly\
    \ con-\nsists of IoT mobile nodes, blockchain as a controller, cloud\nserver,\
    \ investigator, and authentication server. Te mobile\nnodes encrypt the data packet\
    \ based on the elliptic curve\nintegrated encryption scheme and SHA-256 hashing\
    \ algo-\nrithm and transfer to the cloud servers. In this scheme, the\nSDN controller\
    \ maintains the blockchain (based on the\nproof-of-work consensus) to provide\
    \ the evidence prove-\nnance further. Te user registration and authentication,\
    \ data\nencryption and storage, evidence collection from block-\nchain, and mining\
    \ of evidence information are the main\nmodules of their proposed system. Wu et\
    \ al. [80] proposed a\nblockchain-enabled task oﬄoading mechanism by leverag-\n\
    ing the concept of edge and cloud computing paradigm. Te\nproposed mechanism addresses\
    \ the limited computational\ncapacity of IoT devices and high latency problems\
    \ when the\ngathered data are sent to edge or cloud servers through the\npublic\
    \ channel (an online mechanism). Te mobile edge\ncomputing paradigm solves the\
    \ latency problems, whereas\nmobile cloud computing servers solve the computational\n\
    problems of the traditional IoT-based system. Furthermore,\nto minimize the response\
    \ time and energy consumption of\ndevices, this mechanism uses the energy-eﬃcient\
    \ task oﬀ-\nloading algorithm, where the edge or cloud servers execute\nthis algorithm\
    \ depending on the application scenario, and\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique\
    \ is applied to reduce\nthe computational and communication cost incurred by the\n\
    diﬀerent applications.\n3.4. Healthcare Sector. Te healthcare sector is one of\
    \ the\npromising areas of IIoT application. Recently, we have ex-\nperienced a\
    \ health crisis due to the newly discovered\nCOVID-19 disease. Te disease not\
    \ only aﬀects human life\nbut also aﬀects the economy of the country and world\
    \ [83].\nAlthough the recent advancement in the ﬁeld of IoT and\nartiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) brings about opportunities to win\nthe battle against this disease, currently,\
    \ the internet-of-\nmedical-things (IoMT) devices provide medical facilities to\n\
    diﬀerent healthcare organizations because of the availability\nof various wearable\
    \ devices, biosensors, and wireless com-\nmunication technologies. However, the\
    \ IoMT system also\nfaces privacy and security vulnerabilities, and the blockchain\n\
    brings the hope that it can solve these problems. Dai et al.\n[84] studied the\
    \ integration of IoTtechnology in the medical\nsector and tried to provide a solution\
    \ for the various\nchallenges that arise due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Te\nproposed\
    \ solution captures the ﬁve diﬀerent perspectives of\nthis pandemic: the origin\
    \ of the pandemic, social distancing\nand quarantine people, hospital equipped\
    \ with the Internet\nof medical devices, patient data, and remote telemedicine\n\
    system. Te authors also discussed how the proposed\nmethodology ﬁghts against\
    \ this. However, the proposed\nsolution is only in early stage, and its actual\
    \ implementation\nstill needs to be investigated. Te authors in [85] proposed\
    \ a\nsolution for sharing the medical data based on the attribute-\nbased cryptosystem\
    \ and blockchain technology. Te medical\ndata are stored in the cloud servers\
    \ in this solution, whereas\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n15\nblockchain\
    \ stores the storage address and medical-related\ninformation to provide easy\
    \ access. Te attributed-based\nencryption and signature scheme provides the end-user’s\n\
    data privacy, access control, and authenticity. To reduce the\ncomputation overhead,\
    \ the cloud service does the decryption\non the partial medical data. As a result,\
    \ the overhead on the\nuser side decreases but simultaneously increases on the\n\
    server side and dependency on the third party.\nTe\npaper\nin\n[89]\nproposed\n\
    a\nprotocol\nnamed\nMEdge-Chain, which leverages the concept of edge com-\nputing\
    \ and blockchain for medical data exchange. Te au-\ntomated patient monitoring\
    \ scheme is deployed on the edge\nservers, which provides the remote monitoring\
    \ of patients\nand eﬃcient retrieval of medical data. However, the com-\nputational\
    \ and communication overhead increased while\nsharing the medical data with the\
    \ other health entities. To\nsolve this issue, the authors suggested a blockchain-enabled\n\
    optimization model. Te priority assignment model for the\nvarious categories of\
    \ medical data (i.e., emergency data,\npatient conﬁdential message, biosignals\
    \ features) is designed\nbased on the queuing model to eﬀectively manage the entire\n\
    health framework. Te healthcare data are complex and\nheterogeneous in nature.\
    \ Te authors in [86] presented the\nblockchain and cloud-based solution to manage\
    \ the Medi-\ncare data. Te domain experts, including the lab technician\nand doctors,\
    \ patients, and health insurance providers, are\nthe three main components of\
    \ this system. All these com-\nponents access and provide their data to the cloud\
    \ servers,\nﬁnally maintaining the blockchain. Te various crypto-\ngraphic primitives\
    \ are used in the solution to validate the\nuser. If an end-user or patient wants\
    \ to access or provide data\nto the blockchain, the request is sent to the blockchain,\n\
    maintained by the cloud servers. It veriﬁes the user, and,\nafter the veriﬁcation,\
    \ a new block is proposed based on the\ntransaction of the end-user. Once validation\
    \ of the block is\nsuccessful, it is added to the blockchain and notiﬁes the end-\n\
    user accordingly.\nTo provide security, conﬁdentiality, and integrity in the\n\
    electronic health record (EHR) system, Shahnaz et al. [87]\nproposed a solution\
    \ based on the blockchain. Te role-based\naccess policy scheme leverages that\
    \ only the trusted entities\nof the system can access the medical records. Here,\
    \ the\nauthors utilize the oﬀ-chain storage mechanism IPFS for\nstoring the records.\
    \ Te advantage of using IPFS is that the\nduplicated ﬁles are not allowed, and\
    \ the users keep only the\nhash of the ﬁle if they want to retrieve the ﬁle. Furthermore,\n\
    the smart contract for the patient record is used, which is\nwritten in the Solidity\
    \ programming language. Te proposed\nsolution provides the content-addressable\
    \ storage system,\nmedical record conﬁdentiality, and enhancing the system’s\n\
    scalability.\nTe\nexperimental\nresult\nshows\nthat\nthe\nthroughput of the system\
    \ increases as the users and load\n(request) increase in the system. Terefore,\
    \ the system can\nmaintain a linear relationship. Garg et al. [88] proposed a\n\
    blockchain-based authentication and key-agreement pro-\ntocol BAKMP-IoMT to provide\
    \ secure communication\nbetween the cloud and personal servers and between the\n\
    personal servers and medical devices in the IoMT envi-\nronment. Once secure communication\
    \ is established, the\nuser can access the required information from the cloud\n\
    server that maintains the blockchain network, which is\nfurther based on the voting-based\
    \ consensus mechanism. To\nreduce the computation cost, the solution only uses\
    \ the\ncryptographic hash and X-OR functions. Te AVISPA tool is\nused for the\
    \ simulation of protocol, and its formal analysis\nveriﬁes that the solution is\
    \ robust against the ephemeral\nsecret leakage attack, privileged-insider attack,\
    \ and so forth.\nTable 7 shows the brief overview of existing IoT-enabled\nhealthcare\
    \ sectors.\n4. Future Research Challenges\nTe integration of IoTand blockchain\
    \ brings about a variety\nof opportunities for the upcoming Industry 4.0 [90].\
    \ But,\nstill, there are a number of challenges that exist, which need\nto be\
    \ resolved before releasing the full blockchain-enabled\nIoT or IIoT system. Here,\
    \ we mentioned some of the im-\nportant open research challenges.\n4.1. Resource\
    \ Constraint Devices. Te devices that are used\nin the IoT and IIoT systems are\
    \ mostly resource-constraint.\nTese devices have limited capabilities such as\
    \ limited\nprocessing power and storage space. As a result, they are not\ndirectly\
    \ suitable to deploy over the blockchain network as\nhuge computational power\
    \ and storage space are required.\nIn addition, consensus algorithm such as proof\
    \ of work\nrequires the huge amount of energy and electricity for the\nmining\
    \ process [4]; therefore, the algorithm that is based on\nthis category (longest\
    \ chain rule) is not suitable for the\nresource-constrained system.\n4.2. Suitable\
    \ Incentive Mechanism for Blockchain-Enabled\nIoT\nSystem. Te\nincentive\nmechanism\n\
    is\nthe\ncore\nfunctionality of blockchain technology. Te incentive\nmechanism\
    \ based on the proof-of-work mechanism is not\nadoptable by the IoT system because\
    \ it requires much\ncomputational power to solve the puzzles. Also, the block\n\
    reward is halved after the mining of 210, 000 blocks [91].\nTerefore, considering\
    \ the incentive mechanism which is\nsuitable to the IoT or IIoT system is an open\
    \ research\nquestion for the researchers.\n4.3. Big Data Analytics Scheme. Te\
    \ IoT system is generally\nused for data-related applications, where the devices\
    \ gen-\nerate a huge amount of multimedia data [92]. Te generated\ndata are stored\
    \ in the cloud server in which the machine\nlearning algorithm does the data preprocessing,\
    \ data ex-\ntraction, and data analytics. Te average time taken by the\nalgorithm\
    \ varies from days to months. Moreover, privacy\nleakages, access control mechanisms,\
    \ and so forth are the\nmajor issues associated with this scheme.\n4.4. Scalability\
    \ of Blockchain-Enabled IoT System. Te scal-\nability of the current blockchain\
    \ mechanism also limits the\napplicability of IoT and IIoT systems. Te bitcoin\
    \ system has\nlow transaction throughput (5 to 7 transactions per second\nwhere\
    \ average block time is 10 minutes), whereas the average\n16\nSecurity and Communication\
    \ Networks\nblock time for Ethereum is 15 seconds [93]. On the other side\nof\
    \ the coin, IoT devices-based applications (such as smart\nhealthcare) generate\
    \ data very quickly. Terefore, the current\nplatforms are not directly suitable\
    \ for the IoT or IIoT system.\n4.5. Dynamic Security Framework. In the IoT system,\
    \ het-\nerogeneous devices are connected ranging from low-power\ndevices to high-power\
    \ servers. Terefore, a uniform solution\nmay not work for all blockchain-enabled\
    \ IoT systems.\nFurthermore, the security solution should consider the\nnature\
    \ of the resource-constrained IoT devices, and it also\nmeets the minimum security\
    \ solutions of the end customers\n(or users) [22]. Hence, the design of an adaptable\
    \ and dy-\nnamic security framework for the blockchain-enabled IoT\n(or IIoT)\
    \ system is a good research area.\n4.6. Security Vulnerability and Privacy Leakage.\
    \ Te adop-\ntion of blockchain technology in the ﬁeld of IoT surely\nimproves\
    \ the security of IoTsystems through encryption and\nhashing, which is the inherent\
    \ mechanism of blockchain.\nBut the devices are connected via the wireless communi-\n\
    cation system (mostly), and, due to the open wireless me-\ndium, they are suﬀering\
    \ from the security breaches such as\nreplying attack, eavesdropping, and jamming.\
    \ In addition to\nthis, the transactions in the blockchain system are done via\n\
    the account address (or IP address). Terefore, a certain level\nof anonymity is\
    \ also achieved. But this scheme does not\nprovide enough protection because it\
    \ is cracked via the\nmachine learning algorithm [94].\n4.7. Advance Smart Contract\
    \ System. Te traditional IoT\nsystem uses the centralized architecture, where\
    \ the IoTdevices\nsend data to the cloud server for processing. In return, the\n\
    cloud server does the task and sends it back to the IoTdevice.\nTe limited scalability\
    \ is the issue associated with the cen-\ntralized system. Tis platform is not\
    \ suitable for those sce-\nnarios (e.g., a smart hospitalization system with automated\n\
    payment), where the devices want to initiate the payments\nTable 7: Comparison\

    \ which allow the device\nto function autonomously and securely and further achieve\n\
    greater automation and cheaper transactions.\n4.8. Federated Learning for IoT.\
    \ Due to distributed and\nprivate datasets, the classical learning algorithm cannot\
    \ be\nused for the IIoT. Federated learning provides a solution\nwhere devices\
    \ perform the local training and send the result\nto the cloud for the global\
    \ model aggregation. Te key to\nusing federated learning is that migrating a massive\
    \ amount\nof data from the IoT device to a cloud or edge server is not\nrequired.\
    \ However, using federated learning for IoT-based\nsystems itself has various\
    \ challenges; for example, a secure\nencryption method is needed to send the learning\
    \ model\nparameters to other devices or servers. Moreover, to achieve\nbetter\
    \ learning, a set of IoT devices must connect with the\naggregation server under\
    \ the communication constraint.\nTis is the new research direction, and deep analysis\
    \ is\nrequired to integrate the blockchain-enabled federated\nlearning for resource-constrained\
    \ IoT devices [95].\n5. Our Observations\nTe upcoming Industry 4.0 connects the\
    \ latest technologies\nsuch as blockchain, machine learning, cloud computing,\
    \ and\nIoT for enhancing the productivity and eﬃciency of their\nsystems [96].\
    \ Among those, the incorporation of IoT and\nblockchain is the latest topic for\
    \ researchers. In this section,\nwe discuss our observation for the state-of-the-art\
    \ research,\nand that can increase the security and trust in the IoT (or\nIIoT)\
    \ system. Along with the incorporation of blockchain\nand IoT, researchers also\
    \ use artiﬁcial intelligence and\nmachine learning algorithm for enhancing the\
    \ eﬃciency of\nthe system. Te machine learning algorithm processes and\nclassiﬁes\
    \ the huge amount of data generated by the devices.\nAlthough only a few of the\
    \ research papers discuss the\nmachine learning algorithm in the IoTsystem, it\
    \ is also a new\nresearch direction that could increase the eﬃciency of the\n\
    IoT- (or IIoT-) based system. Te state-of-the-art research\nused simulators such\
    \ as Solidity and Remix IDE for simu-\nlating the smart contracts, and a few of\
    \ them also used IPFS\nfor storing the data in a distributed manner. Te hyperledger\n\
    fabric [97] is also a simulator where the researcher could\nincorporate the blockchain\
    \ and IoT. In addition to this,\nresearchers are focusing on an incentive mechanism\
    \ that is\nadaptable in nature for the resource-constrained IoTdevices,\nbecause\
    \ the existing mechanisms (e.g., those based on the\nPoW) are not inherently suited\
    \ for these devices.\n6. Concluding Remarks\nTe current internet-of-things- (IoT-)\
    \ enabled industrial\nsectors are facing many challenges (e.g., security and privacy\n\
    vulnerability, etc.), and blockchain technology brings hope\nthat it can resolve\
    \ the aforementioned issues without the\ntrusted third party (TTP). In this paper,\
    \ we have investigated\nthe need for blockchain in IoTand industrial IoT (IIoT)\
    \ and\nprovided\nstate-of-the-art\nresearch.\nTe\nstate-of-the-art\nresearch is\
    \ broadly classiﬁed into four major categories: data\nstorage and management technique,\
    \ industrial sectors, big\ndata, cloud computing, and network security technique,\
    \ and\nhealthcare sector. In addition to this, the paper presents a\nnumber of\
    \ future research challenges with observations that\ncan be useful for the research\
    \ community to proceed in the\nright direction.\nData Availability\nTe data are\

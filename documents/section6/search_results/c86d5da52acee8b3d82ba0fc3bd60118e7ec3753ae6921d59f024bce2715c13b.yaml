    \ which objects equipped with sensors, actuators, and processors\ncommunicate\
    \ with each other to serve a meaningful purpose. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art\
    \ methods, protocols, and\napplications in this new emerging area. This survey\
    \ paper proposes a novel taxonomy for IoT technologies, highlights some of\nthe\
    \ most important technologies, and profiles some applications that have the potential\
    \ to make a striking difference in human\nlife, especially for the differently\
    \ abled and the elderly. As compared to similar survey papers in the area, this\
    \ paper is far more\ncomprehensive in its coverage and exhaustively covers most\
    \ major technologies spanning from sensors to applications.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Today the Internet has become ubiquitous, has touched\nalmost every corner of\
    \ the globe, and is affecting human life in\nunimaginable ways. However, the journey\
    \ is far from over. We\nare now entering an era of even more pervasive connectivity\n\
    where a very wide variety of appliances will be connected to\nthe web. We are\
    \ entering an era of the “Internet of Things”\n(abbreviated as IoT). This term\
    \ has been defined by different\nauthors in many different ways. Let us look at\
    \ two of the most\npopular definitions. Vermesan et al. [1] define the Internet\n\
    of Things as simply an interaction between the physical and\ndigital worlds. The\
    \ digital world interacts with the physical\nworld using a plethora of sensors\
    \ and actuators. Another\ndefinition by Pe˜na-L´opez et al. [2] defines the Internet\
    \ of\nThings as a paradigm in which computing and networking\ncapabilities are\
    \ embedded in any kind of conceivable object.\nWe use these capabilities to query\
    \ the state of the object and to\nchange its state if possible. In common parlance,\
    \ the Internet\nof Things refers to a new kind of world where almost all\nthe\
    \ devices and appliances that we use are connected to a\nnetwork. We can use them\
    \ collaboratively to achieve complex\ntasks that require a high degree of intelligence.\n\
    For this intelligence and interconnection, IoT devices are\nequipped with embedded\
    \ sensors, actuators, processors, and\ntransceivers. IoT is not a single technology;\
    \ rather it is an\nagglomeration of various technologies that work together in\n\
    tandem.\nSensors and actuators are devices, which help in interact-\ning with\
    \ the physical environment. The data collected by the\nsensors has to be stored\
    \ and processed intelligently in order to\nderive useful inferences from it. Note\
    \ that we broadly define\nthe term sensor; a mobile phone or even a microwave\
    \ oven\ncan count as a sensor as long as it provides inputs about its\ncurrent\
    \ state (internal state + environment). An actuator is a\ndevice that is used\
    \ to effect a change in the environment such\nas the temperature controller of\
    \ an air conditioner.\nThe storage and processing of data can be done on the\n\
    edge of the network itself or in a remote server. If any prepro-\ncessing of data\
    \ is possible, then it is typically done at either\nthe sensor or some other proximate\
    \ device. The processed\ndata is then typically sent to a remote server. The storage\n\
    and processing capabilities of an IoT object are also restricted\nby the resources\
    \ available, which are often very constrained\ndue to limitations of size, energy,\
    \ power, and computational\ncapability. As a result the main research challenge\
    \ is to\nensure that we get the right kind of data at the desired level\nof accuracy.\
    \ Along with the challenges of data collection,\nand handling, there are challenges\
    \ in communication as\nwell. The communication between IoT devices is mainly\n\
    wireless because they are generally installed at geographically\ndispersed locations.\
    \ The wireless channels often have high\nHindawi\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ reliably\ncommunicating data without too many retransmissions is an\nimportant\
    \ problem and thus communication technologies\nare integral to the study of IoT\
    \ devices.\nNow, after processing the received data, some action\nneeds to be\
    \ taken on the basis of the derived inferences. The\nnature of actions can be\
    \ diverse. We can directly modify the\nphysical world through actuators. Or we\
    \ may do something\nvirtually. For example, we can send some information to other\n\
    smart things.\nThe process of effecting a change in the physical world\nis often\
    \ dependent on its state at that point of time. This\nis called context awareness.\
    \ Each action is taken keeping in\nconsideration the context because an application\
    \ can behave\ndifferently in different contexts. For example, a person may\nnot\
    \ like messages from his office to interrupt him when he is\non vacation.\nSensors,\
    \ actuators, compute servers, and the commu-\nnication network form the core infrastructure\
    \ of an IoT\nframework. However, there are many software aspects that\nneed to\
    \ be considered. First, we need a middleware that can\nbe used to connect and\
    \ manage all of these heterogeneous\ncomponents. We need a lot of standardization\
    \ to connect\nmany different devices. We shall discuss methods to exchange\ninformation\
    \ and prevailing standards in Section 7.\nThe Internet of Things finds various\
    \ applications in health\ncare, fitness, education, entertainment, social life,\
    \ energy\nconservation, environment monitoring, home automation,\nand transport\
    \ systems. We shall focus on these application\nareas in Section 9. We shall find\
    \ that, in all these application\nareas, IoT technologies have significantly been\
    \ able to reduce\nhuman effort and improve the quality of life.\n2. Architecture\
    \ of IoT\nThere is no single consensus on architecture for IoT, which\nis agreed\
    \ universally. Different architectures have been pro-\nposed by different researchers.\n\
    2.1. Three- and Five-Layer Architectures. The most basic\narchitecture is a three-layer\
    \ architecture [3–5] as shown in\nFigure 1. It was introduced in the early stages\
    \ of research in\nthis area. It has three layers, namely, the perception, network,\n\
    and application layers.\n(i) The perception layer is the physical layer, which\
    \ has\nsensors for sensing and gathering information about\nthe environment. It\
    \ senses some physical parameters\nor identifies other smart objects in the environment.\n\
    (ii) The network layer is responsible for connecting to\nother smart things, network\
    \ devices, and servers. Its\nfeatures are also used for transmitting and processing\n\
    sensor data.\n(iii) The application layer is responsible for delivering\napplication\
    \ specific services to the user. It defines\nvarious applications in which the\
    \ Internet of Things\ncan be deployed, for example, smart homes, smart\ncities,\
    \ and smart health.\nThe three-layer architecture defines the main idea of the\n\
    Internet of Things, but it is not sufficient for research on\nIoT because research\
    \ often focuses on finer aspects of the\nInternet of Things. That is why, we have\
    \ many more layered\narchitectures proposed in the literature. One is the five-\n\
    layer architecture, which additionally includes the processing\nand business layers\
    \ [3–6]. The five layers are perception,\ntransport, processing, application,\
    \ and business layers (see\nFigure 1). The role of the perception and application\
    \ layers\nis the same as the architecture with three layers. We outline\nthe function\
    \ of the remaining three layers.\n(i) The transport layer transfers the sensor\
    \ data from\nthe perception layer to the processing layer and vice\nversa through\
    \ networks such as wireless, 3G, LAN,\nBluetooth, RFID, and NFC.\n(ii) The processing\
    \ layer is also known as the middleware\nlayer. It stores, analyzes, and processes\
    \ huge amounts\nof data that comes from the transport layer. It can\nmanage and\
    \ provide a diverse set of services to the\nlower layers. It employs many technologies\
    \ such as\ndatabases, cloud computing, and big data processing\nmodules.\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n3\n(iii) The business layer manages\
    \ the whole IoT system,\nincluding applications, business and profit models,\n\
    and users’ privacy. The business layer is out of the\nscope of this paper. Hence,\
    \ we do not discuss it\nfurther.\nAnother architecture proposed by Ning and Wang\
    \ [7] is\ninspired by the layers of processing in the human brain. It\nis inspired\
    \ by the intelligence and ability of human beings\nto think, feel, remember, make\
    \ decisions, and react to the\nphysical environment. It is constituted of three\
    \ parts. First is\nthe human brain, which is analogous to the processing and\n\
    data management unit or the data center. Second is the spinal\ncord, which is\
    \ analogous to the distributed network of data\nprocessing nodes and smart gateways.\
    \ Third is the network\nof nerves, which corresponds to the networking components\n\
    and sensors.\n2.2. Cloud and Fog Based Architectures. Let us now discuss\ntwo\
    \ kinds of systems architectures: cloud and fog computing\n(see the reference\
    \ architectures in [8]). Note that this classifi-\ncation is different from the\
    \ classification in Section 2.1, which\nwas done on the basis of protocols.\n\
    In particular, we have been slightly vague about the nature\nof data generated\
    \ by IoT devices, and the nature of data\nprocessing. In some system architectures\
    \ the data processing\nis done in a large centralized fashion by cloud computers.\n\
    Such a cloud centric architecture keeps the cloud at the\ncenter, applications\
    \ above it, and the network of smart things\nbelow it [9]. Cloud computing is\
    \ given primacy because it\nprovides great flexibility and scalability. It offers\
    \ services such\nas the core infrastructure, platform, software, and storage.\n\
    Developers can provide their storage tools, software tools,\ndata mining, and\
    \ machine learning tools, and visualization\ntools through the cloud.\nLately,\
    \ there is a move towards another system archi-\ntecture, namely, fog computing\
    \ [10–12], where the sensors\nand network gateways do a part of the data processing\
    \ and\nanalytics. A fog architecture [13] presents a layered approach\nas shown\
    \ in Figure 2, which inserts monitoring, prepro-\ncessing, storage, and security\
    \ layers between the physical\nand transport layers. The monitoring layer monitors\
    \ power,\nresources, responses, and services. The preprocessing layer\nperforms\
    \ filtering, processing, and analytics of sensor data.\nThe temporary storage\
    \ layer provides storage functionalities\nsuch as data replication, distribution,\
    \ and storage. Finally, the\nsecurity layer performs encryption/decryption and\
    \ ensures\ndata integrity and privacy. Monitoring and preprocessing are\ndone\
    \ on the edge of the network before sending data to the\ncloud.\nOften the terms\
    \ “fog computing” and “edge computing”\nare used interchangeably. The latter term\
    \ predates the former\nand is construed to be more generic. Fog computing originally\n\
    termed by Cisco refers to smart gateways and smart sensors,\nwhereas edge computing\
    \ is slightly more penetrative in nature.\nThis paradigm envisions adding smart\
    \ data preprocessing\ncapabilities to physical devices such as motors, pumps,\
    \ or\nlights. The aim is to do as much of preprocessing of data\nas possible in\
    \ these devices, which are termed to be at the\nStorage layer \nPreprocessing\
    \ layer \nMonitoring layer \nPhysical layer\nSecurity layer\nTransport layer\n\
    Figure 2: Fog architecture of a smart IoT gateway.\nedge of the network. In terms\
    \ of the system architecture,\nthe architectural diagram is not appreciably different\
    \ from\nFigure 2. As a result, we do not describe edge computing\nseparately.\n\
    Finally, the distinction between protocol architectures\nand system architectures\
    \ is not very crisp. Often the protocols\nand the system are codesigned. We shall\
    \ use the generic 5-\nlayer IoT protocol stack (architectural diagram presented\
    \ in\nFigure 2) for both the fog and cloud architectures.\n2.3. Social IoT. Let\
    \ us now discuss a new paradigm: social IoT\n(SIoT). Here, we consider social\
    \ relationships between objects\nthe same way as humans form social relationships\
    \ (see [14]).\nHere are the three main facets of an SIoT system:\n(i) The SIoT\
    \ is navigable. We can start with one device\nand navigate through all the devices\
    \ that are con-\nnected to it. It is easy to discover new devices and\nservices\
    \ using such a social network of IoT devices.\n(ii) A need of trustworthiness\
    \ (strength of the relation-\nship) is present between devices (similar to friends\
    \ on\nFacebook).\n(iii) We can use models similar to studying human social\nnetworks\
    \ to also study the social networks of IoT\ndevices.\n2.3.1. Basic Components.\
    \ In a typical social IoT setting, we\ntreat the devices and services as bots\
    \ where they can set up\nrelationships between them and modify them over time.\
    \ This\nwill allow us to seamlessly let the devices cooperate among\neach other\
    \ and achieve a complex task.\nTo make such a model work, we need to have many\n\
    interoperating components. Let us look at some of the major\ncomponents in such\
    \ a system.\n(1) ID: we need a unique method of object identifica-\ntion. An ID\
    \ can be assigned to an object based on\ntraditional parameters such as the MAC\
    \ ID, IPv6\nID, a universal product code, or some other custom\nmethod.\n4\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(2) Metainformation: along with an ID,\
    \ we need some\nmetainformation about the device that describes its\nform and\
    \ operation. This is required to establish\nappropriate relationships with the\
    \ device and also\nappropriately place it in the universe of IoT devices.\n(3)\
    \ Security controls: this is similar to “friend list” set-\ntings on Facebook.\
    \ An owner of a device might place\nrestrictions on the kinds of devices that\
    \ can connect\nto it. These are typically referred to as owner controls.\n(4)\
    \ Service discovery: such kind of a system is like\na service cloud, where we\
    \ need to have dedicated\ndirectories that store details of devices providing\n\
    certain kinds of services. It becomes very important\nto keep these directories\
    \ up to date such that devices\ncan learn about other devices.\n(5) Relationship\
    \ management: this module manages rela-\ntionships with other devices. It also\
    \ stores the types\nof devices that a given device should try to connect\nwith\
    \ based on the type of services provided. For\nexample, it makes sense for a light\
    \ controller to make\na relationship with a light sensor.\n(6) Service composition:\
    \ this module takes the social IoT\nmodel to a new level. The ultimate goal of\
    \ having such\na system is to provide better integrated services to\nusers. For\
    \ example, if a person has a power sensor\nwith her air conditioner and this device\
    \ establishes\na relationship with an analytics engine, then it is\npossible for\
    \ the ensemble to yield a lot of data about\nthe usage patterns of the air conditioner.\
    \ If the social\nmodel is more expansive, and there are many more\ndevices, then\
    \ it is possible to compare the data with\nthe usage patterns of other users and\
    \ come up with\neven more meaningful data. For example, users can\nbe told that\
    \ they are the largest energy consumers in\ntheir community or among their Facebook\
    \ friends.\n2.3.2. Representative Architecture. Most architectures pro-\nposed\
    \ for the SIoT have a server side architecture as well.\nThe server connects to\
    \ all the interconnected components,\naggregates (composes) the services, and\
    \ acts as a single point\nof service for users.\nThe server side architecture\
    \ typically has three layers. The\nfirst is the base layer that contains a database\
    \ that stores details\nof all the devices, their attributes, metainformation,\
    \ and their\nrelationships. The second layer (Component layer) contains\ncode\
    \ to interact with the devices, query their status, and use\na subset of them\
    \ to effect a service. The topmost layer is the\napplication layer, which provides\
    \ services to the users.\nOn the device (object) side, we broadly have two layers.\n\
    The first is the object layer, which allows a device to connect to\nother devices,\
    \ talk to them (via standardized protocols), and\nexchange information. The object\
    \ layer passes information to\nthe social layer. The social layer manages the\
    \ execution of\nusers’ applications, executes queries, and interacts with the\n\
    application layer on the server.\n3. Taxonomy\nLet us now propose taxonomy for\
    \ research in IoT tech-\nnologies (see Figure 3). Our taxonomy is based on the\n\
    architectural elements of IoT as presented in Section 2.\nThe first architectural\
    \ component of IoT is the perception\nlayer. It collects data using sensors, which\
    \ are the most\nimportant drivers of the Internet of Things [15]. There are\n\
    various types of sensors used in diverse IoT applications.\nThe most generic sensor\
    \ available today is the smartphone.\nThe smartphone itself has many types of\
    \ sensors embedded\nin it [16] such as the location sensor (GPS), movement\nsensors\
    \ (accelerometer, gyroscope), camera, light sensor,\nmicrophone, proximity sensor,\
    \ and magnetometer. These are\nbeing heavily used in different IoT applications.\
    \ Many other\ntypes of sensors are beginning to be used such as sensors for\n\
    measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, medical param-\neters of the body,\
    \ chemical and biochemical substances, and\nneural signals. A class of sensors\
    \ that stand out is infrared\nsensors that predate smartphones. They are now being\
    \ used\nwidely in many IoT applications: IR cameras, motion detec-\ntors, measuring\
    \ the distance to nearby objects, presence of\nsmoke and gases, and as moisture\
    \ sensors. We shall discuss\nthe different types of sensors used in IoT applications\
    \ in\nSection 5.\nSubsequently, we shall discuss related work in data pre-\nprocessing.\
    \ Such applications (also known as fog comput-\ning applications) mainly filter\
    \ and summarize data before\nsending it on the network. Such units typically have\
    \ a little\namount of temporary storage, a small processing unit, and\nsome security\
    \ features.\nThe next architectural component that we shall discuss\nis communication.\
    \ We shall discuss related work (in Sec-\ntion 7) on different communication technologies\
    \ used for\nthe Internet of Things. Different entities communicate over\nthe network\
    \ [17–19] using a diverse set of protocols and\nstandards. The most common communication\
    \ technologies\nfor short range low power communication protocols are\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field\nCommunication). For the medium\
    \ range, they are Bluetooth,\nZigbee, and WiFi. Communication in the IoT world\
    \ requires\nspecial networking protocols and mechanisms. Therefore,\nnew mechanisms\
    \ and protocols have been proposed and\nimplemented for each layer of the networking\
    \ stack, accord-\ning to the requirements imposed by IoT devices.\nWe shall subsequently\
    \ look at two kinds of software com-\nponents: middleware and applications. The\
    \ middleware cre-\nates an abstraction for the programmer such that the details\n\
    of the hardware can be hidden. This enhances interoperability\nof smart things\
    \ and makes it easy to offer different kinds of\nservices [20]. There are many\
    \ commercial and open source\nofferings for providing middleware services to IoT\
    \ devices.\nSome examples are OpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], Hydra\n[23], FiWare\
    \ [24], and Oracle Fusion Middleware. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applications of\
    \ IoT in Section 9. We primarily\nfocus on home automation, ambient assisted living,\
    \ health\nand fitness, smart vehicular systems, smart cities, smart\nenvironments,\
    \ smart grids, social life, and entertainment.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of research in IoT technologies.\n4. Related Survey Papers\nOur taxonomy describes\
    \ the technologies in the IoT domain\nand is classified on the basis of architectural\
    \ layers. We\nhave tried to cover all subareas and recent technologies in\nour\
    \ taxonomy. There have been many survey papers on the\nInternet of Things in the\
    \ past. Table 1 shows how our survey\nis different from other highly cited surveys\
    \ in the literature.\nLet us first consider our novel contributions. Our paper\n\
    looks at each and every layer in the IoT stack, and as a\nresult the presentation\
    \ is also far more balanced. A novel\naddition in our survey is that we have discussed\
    \ different IoT\narchitectures. This has not been discussed in prior surveys on\n\
    the Internet of Things. The architecture section also considers\nnewer paradigms\
    \ such as fog computing, which have also\nhitherto not been considered. Moreover,\
    \ our survey nicely\ncategorizes technologies based on the architectural layer\n\
    that they belong to. We have also thoroughly categorized\nthe network layer and\
    \ tried to consolidate almost all the\ntechnologies that are used in IoT systems.\
    \ Such kind of a\nthorough categorization and presentation of technologies is\n\
    novel to the best of our knowledge.\nAlong with these novel contributions our\
    \ survey is far\nmore comprehensive, detailed, and exhaustive as compared\nto\
    \ other surveys in the area. Most of the other surveys look\nat only one or two\
    \ types of sensors, whereas we describe\n9 types of sensors with many examples.\
    \ Other surveys\nare also fairly restricted when they discuss communication\n\
    technologies and applications. We have discussed many types\nof middleware technologies\
    \ as well. Prior works have not\ngiven middleware technologies this level of attention.\
    \ We\ncover 10 communication technologies in detail and consider\na large variety\
    \ of applications encompassing smart homes,\nhealth care, logistics, transport,\
    \ agriculture, environment,\nsmart cities, and green energy. No other survey in\
    \ this area\nprofiles so many technologies, applications, and use cases.\n5. Sensors\
    \ and Actuators\nAll IoT applications need to have one or more sensors to\ncollect\
    \ data from the environment. Sensors are essential\ncomponents of smart objects.\
    \ One of the most important\naspects of the Internet of Things is context awareness,\
    \ which\nis not possible without sensor technology. IoT sensors are\nmostly small\
    \ in size, have low cost, and consume less power.\nThey are constrained by factors\
    \ such as battery capacity and\nease of deployment. Schmidt and Van Laerhoven\
    \ [25] provide\nan overview of various types of sensors used for building\nsmart\
    \ applications.\n5.1. Mobile Phone Based Sensors. First of all, let us look at\n\
    the mobile phone, which is ubiquitous and has many types\nof sensors embedded\
    \ in it. In specific, the smartphone is\na very handy and user friendly device\
    \ that has a host of\nbuilt in communication and data processing features. With\n\
    the increasing popularity of smartphones among people,\nresearchers are showing\
    \ interest in building smart IoT solu-\ntions using smartphones because of the\
    \ embedded sensors\n[16, 26]. Some additional sensors can also be used depending\n\

    \ can be built on the\nsmartphone that uses sensor data to produce meaningful\n\
    results. Some of the sensors inside a modern smartphone are\nas follows.\n(1)\
    \ The accelerometer senses the motion and acceleration\nof a mobile phone. It\
    \ typically measures changes in\nvelocity of the smartphone in three dimensions.\
    \ There\nare many types of accelerometers [27].\nIn a mechanical accelerometer,\
    \ we have a seismic\nmass in a housing, which is tied to the housing\nwith a spring.\
    \ The mass takes time to move and is\nleft behind as the housing moves, so the\
    \ force in\nthe spring can be correlated with the acceleration.\nIn a capacitive\
    \ accelerometer, capacitive plates are\nused with the same setup. With a change\
    \ in velocity,\nthe mass pushes the capacitive plates together, thus\nchanging\
    \ the capacitance. The rate of change of\ncapacitance is then converted into acceleration.\
    \ In\na piezoelectric accelerometer, piezoelectric crystals\nare used, which when\
    \ squeezed generate an electric\nvoltage. The changes in voltage can be translated\
    \ into\nacceleration.\nThe data patterns captured by the accelerometer can\nbe\
    \ used to detect physical activities of the user such as\nrunning, walking, and\
    \ bicycling.\n(2) The gyroscope detects the orientation of the phone\nvery precisely.\
    \ Orientation is measured using capac-\nitive changes when a seismic mass moves\
    \ in a partic-\nular direction.\n(3) The camera and microphone are very powerful\
    \ sen-\nsors since they capture visual and audio information,\nwhich can then\
    \ be analyzed and processed to detect\nvarious types of contextual information.\
    \ For example,\nwe can infer a user’s current environment and the\ninteractions\
    \ that she is having. To make sense of the\naudio data, technologies such as voice\
    \ recognition\nand acoustic features can be exploited.\n(4) The magnetometer detects\
    \ magnetic fields. This can\nbe used as a digital compass and in applications\
    \ to\ndetect the presence of metals.\n(5) The GPS (Global Positioning System)\
    \ detects the\nlocation of the phone, which is one of the most\nimportant pieces\
    \ of contextual information for smart\napplications. The location is detected\
    \ using the prin-\nciple of trilateration [28]. The distance is measured\nfrom\
    \ three or more satellites (or mobile phone towers\nin the case of A-GPS) and\
    \ coordinates are computed.\n(6) The light sensor detects the intensity of ambient\
    \ light.\nIt can be used for setting the brightness of the screen\nand other applications\
    \ in which some action is to be\ntaken depending on the intensity of ambient light.\
    \ For\nexample, we can control the lights in a room.\n(7) The proximity sensor\
    \ uses an infrared (IR) LED,\nwhich emits IR rays. These rays bounce back when\n\
    they strike some object. Based on the difference in\ntime, we can calculate the\
    \ distance. In this way, the\ndistance to different objects from the phone can\
    \ be\nmeasured. For example, we can use it to determine\nwhen the phone is close\
    \ to the face while talking. It\ncan also be used in applications in which we\
    \ have\nto trigger some event when an object approaches the\nphone.\n(8) Some\
    \ smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S4 also\nhave a thermometer, barometer,\
    \ and humidity sensor\nto measure the temperature, atmospheric pressure,\nand\
    \ humidity, respectively.\nWe have studied many smart applications that use sensor\n\
    data collected from smartphones. For example, activity detec-\ntion [29] is achieved\
    \ by applying machine learning algorithms\nto the data collected by smartphone\
    \ sensors. It detects activi-\nties such as running, going up and down stairs,\
    \ walking, driv-\ning, and cycling. The application is trained with patterns of\n\
    data using data sets recorded by sensors when these activities\nare being performed.\n\
    Many health and fitness applications are being built to\nkeep track of a person’s\
    \ health continuously using smart-\nphones. They keep track of users’ physical\
    \ activities, diet,\nexercises, and lifestyle to determine the fitness level and\n\
    give suggestions to the user accordingly. Wang et al. [30]\ndescribe a mobile\
    \ application that is based completely on a\nsmartphone. They use it to assess\
    \ the overall mental health\nand performance of a college student. To track the\
    \ location\nand activities in which the student is involved, activity\nrecognition\
    \ (accelerometer) and GPS data are used. To keep\na check on how much the student\
    \ sleeps, the accelerometer\nand light sensors are used. For social life and conversations,\n\
    audio data from a microphone is used. The application also\nconducts quick questionnaires\
    \ with the students to know\nabout their mood. All this data can be used to assess\
    \ the stress\nlevels, social life, behavior, and exercise patterns of a student.\n\
    Another application by McClernon and Choudhury [31]\ndetects when the user is\
    \ going to smoke using context\ninformation such as the presence of other smokers,\
    \ location,\nand associated activities. The sensors provide information\nrelated\
    \ to the user’s movement, location, visual images, and\nsurrounding sounds. To\
    \ summarize smartphone sensors are\nbeing used to study different kinds of human\
    \ behavior (see\n[32]) and to improve the quality of human life.\n5.2. Medical\
    \ Sensors. The Internet of Things can be really\nbeneficial for health care applications.\
    \ We can use sensors,\nwhich can measure and monitor various medical parameters\n\
    in the human body [33]. These applications can aim at\nmonitoring a patient’s\
    \ health when they are not in hospital or\nwhen they are alone. Subsequently,\
    \ they can provide real time\nfeedback to the doctor, relatives, or the patient.\
    \ McGrath and\nScanaill [34] have described in detail the different sensors that\n\
    can be worn on the body for monitoring a person’s health.\nThere are many wearable\
    \ sensing devices available in the\nmarket. They are equipped with medical sensors\
    \ that are\ncapable of measuring different parameters such as the heart\nrate,\
    \ pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration\nrate, and blood glucose\
    \ levels [35]. These wearables include\n8\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nFigure 4: Smart watches and fitness trackers (source:https://www\n\
    .pebble.com/ and http://www.fitbit.com/).\nFigure 5: Embedded skin patches (source:\
    \ MC10 Electronics).\nsmart watches, wristbands, monitoring patches, and smart\n\
    textiles.\nMoreover, smart watches and fitness trackers are becom-\ning fairly\
    \ popular in the market as companies such as Apple,\nSamsung, and Sony are coming\
    \ up with very innovative\nfeatures. For example, a smart watch includes features\
    \ such\nas connectivity with a smartphone, sensors such as an\naccelerometer,\
    \ and a heart rate monitor (see Figure 4).\nAnother novel IoT device, which has\
    \ a lot of promise are\nmonitoring patches that are pasted on the skin. Monitoring\n\
    patches are like tattoos. They are stretchable and disposable\nand are very cheap.\
    \ These patches are supposed to be worn\nby the patient for a few days to monitor\
    \ a vital health\nparameter continuously [15]. All the electronic components\n\
    are embedded in these rubbery structures. They can even\ntransmit the sensed data\
    \ wirelessly. Just like a tattoo, these\npatches can be applied on the skin as\
    \ shown in Figure 5.\nOne of the most common applications of such patches is to\n\
    monitor blood pressure.\nA very important consideration here is the context [34].\n\
    The data collected by the medical sensors must be combined\nwith contextual information\
    \ such as physical activity. For\nexample, the heart rate depends on the context.\
    \ It increases\nwhen we exercise. In that case, we cannot infer abnormal\nheart\
    \ rate. Therefore, we need to combine data from different\nsensors for making\
    \ the correct inference.\nFigure 6: Brain sensing headband with embedded neurosensors\n\
    (source: http://www.choosemuse.com/).\n5.3. Neural Sensors. Today, it is possible\
    \ to understand\nneural signals in the brain, infer the state of the brain, and\n\
    train it for better attention and focus. This is known as\nneurofeedback [36]\
    \ (see Figure 6). The technology used for\nreading brain signals is called EEG\
    \ (Electroencephalography)\nor a brain computer interface. The neurons inside\
    \ the brain\ncommunicate electronically and create an electric field, which\n\
    can be measured from outside in terms of frequencies. Brain\nwaves can be categorized\
    \ into alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and\ndelta waves depending upon the frequency.\n\
    Based on the type of wave, it can be inferred whether\nthe brain is calm or wandering\
    \ in thoughts. This type of\nneurofeedback can be obtained in real time and can\
    \ be used\nto train the brain to focus, pay better attention towards things,\n\
    manage stress, and have better mental well-being.\n5.4. Environmental and Chemical\
    \ Sensors. Environmental\nsensors are used to sense parameters in the physical\
    \ environ-\nment such as temperature, humidity, pressure, water pollu-\ntion,\
    \ and air pollution. Parameters such as the temperature\nand pressure can be measured\
    \ with a thermometer and\nbarometer. Air quality can be measured with sensors,\
    \ which\nsense the presence of gases and other particulate matter in the\nair\
    \ (refer to Sekhar et al. [37] for more details).\nChemical sensors are used to\
    \ detect chemical and bio-\nchemical substances. These sensors consist of a recognition\n\
    element and a transducer. The electronic nose (e-nose) and\nelectronic tongue\
    \ (e-tongue) are technologies that can be\nused to sense chemicals on the basis\
    \ of odor and taste,\nrespectively [38]. The e-nose and e-tongue consist of an\
    \ array\nof chemical sensors coupled with advance pattern recognition\nsoftware.\
    \ The sensors inside the e-nose and e-tongue produce\ncomplex data, which is then\
    \ analyzed through pattern recog-\nnition to identify the stimulus.\nThese sensors\
    \ can be used in monitoring the pollution\nlevel in smart cities [39], keeping\
    \ a check on food quality\nin smart kitchens, testing food, and agricultural products\
    \ in\nsupply chain applications.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\
    9\n5.5. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is an iden-\ntification technology\
    \ in which an RFID tag (a small chip with\nan antenna) carries data, which is\
    \ read by a RFID reader. The\ntag transmits the data stored in it via radio waves.\
    \ It is similar\nto bar code technology. But unlike a traditional bar code, it\n\
    does not require line of sight communication between the tag\nand the reader and\
    \ can identify itself from a distance even\nwithout a human operator. The range\
    \ of RFID varies with the\nfrequency. It can go up to hundreds of meters.\nRFID\
    \ tags are of two types: active and passive. Active tags\nhave a power source\
    \ and passive tags do not have any power\nsource. Passive tags draw power from\
    \ the electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by the reader and are thus cheap and have\
    \ a\nlong lifetime [40, 41].\nThere are two types of RFID technologies: near and\
    \ far\n[40]. A near RFID reader uses a coil through which we pass\nalternating\
    \ current and generate a magnetic field. The tag has\na smaller coil, which generates\
    \ a potential due to the ambient\nchanges in the magnetic field. This voltage\
    \ is then coupled\nwith a capacitor to accumulate a charge, which then powers\n\
    up the tag chip. The tag can then produce a small magnetic\nfield that encodes\
    \ the signal to be transmitted, and this can\nbe picked up by the reader.\nIn\
    \ far RFID, there is a dipole antenna in the reader, which\npropagates EM waves.\
    \ The tag also has a dipole antenna on\nwhich an alternating potential difference\
    \ appears and it is\npowered up. It can then use this power to transmit messages.\n\
    RFID technology is being used in various applications\nsuch as supply chain management,\
    \ access control, identity\nauthentication, and object tracking. The RFID tag\
    \ is attached\nto the object to be tracked and the reader detects and records\n\
    its presence when the object passes by it. In this manner,\nobject movement can\
    \ be tracked and RFID can serve as a\nsearch engine for smart things.\nFor access\
    \ control, an RFID tag is attached to the\nauthorized object. For example, small\
    \ chips are glued to the\nfront of vehicles. When the car reaches a barricade\
    \ on which\nthere is a reader, it reads the tag data and decides whether it\n\
    is an authorized car. If yes, it opens automatically. RFID cards\nare issued to\
    \ the people, who can then be identified by a RFID\nreader and given access accordingly.\n\
    The low level data collected from the RFID tags can be\ntransformed into higher\
    \ level insights in IoT applications\n[42]. There are many user level tools available,\
    \ in which all the\ndata collected by particular RFID readers and data associated\n\
    with the RFID tags can be managed. The high level data can\nbe used to draw inferences\
    \ and take further action.\n5.6. Actuators. Let us look at some examples of actuators\
    \ that\nare used in the Internet of Things. An actuator is a device,\nwhich can\
    \ effect a change in the environment by converting\nelectrical energy into some\
    \ form of useful energy. Some\nexamples are heating or cooling elements, speakers,\
    \ lights,\ndisplays, and motors.\nThe actuators, which induce motion, can be classified\
    \ into\nthree categories, namely, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic\nactuators\
    \ depending on their operation. Hydraulic actuators\nfacilitate mechanical motion\
    \ using fluid or hydraulic power.\nPneumatic actuators use the pressure of compressed\
    \ air and\nelectrical ones use electrical energy.\nAs an example, we can consider\
    \ a smart home system,\nwhich consists of many sensors and actuators. The actuators\n\
    are used to lock/unlock the doors, switch on/off the lights or\nother electrical\
    \ appliances, alert users of any threats through\nalarms or notifications, and\
    \ control the temperature of a\nhome (via a thermostat).\nA sophisticated example\
    \ of an actuator used in IoT is\na digital finger, which is used to turn on/off\
    \ the switches\n(or anything which requires small motion) and is controlled\n\
    wirelessly.\n6. Preprocessing\nAs smart things collect huge amount of sensor data,\
    \ compute\nand storage resources are required to analyze, store, and\nprocess\
    \ this data. The most common compute and storage\nresources are cloud based because\
    \ the cloud offers massive\ndata handling, scalability, and flexibility. But this\
    \ will not be\nsufficient to meet the requirements of many IoT applications\n\
    because of the following reasons [43].\n(1) Mobility: most of the smart devices\
    \ are mobile. Their\nchanging location makes it difficult to communicate\nwith\
    \ the cloud data center because of changing net-\nwork conditions across different\
    \ locations.\n(2) Reliable and real time actuation: communicating with\nthe cloud\
    \ and getting back responses takes time.\nLatency sensitive applications, which\
    \ need real time\nresponses, may not be feasible with this model. Also,\nthe communication\
    \ may be lossy due to wireless links,\nwhich can lead to unreliable data.\n(3)\
    \ Scalability: more devices means more requests to the\ncloud, thereby increasing\
    \ the latency.\n(4) Power constraints: communication consumes a lot of\npower,\
    \ and IoT devices are battery powered. They\nthus cannot afford to communicate\
    \ all the time.\nTo solve the problem of mobility, researchers have pro-\nposed\
    \ mobile cloud computing (MCC) [44]. But there are\nstill problems associated\
    \ with latency and power. MCC also\nsuffers from mobility problems such as frequently\
    \ changing\nnetwork conditions due to which problems such as signal\nfading and\
    \ service degradation arise.\nAs a solution to these problems, we can bring some\n\
    compute and storage resources to the edge of the network\ninstead of relying on\
    \ the cloud for everything. This concept\nis known as fog computing [11, 45] (also\
    \ see Section 2.2).\nThe fog can be viewed as a cloud, which is close to the\n\
    ground. Data can be stored, processed, filtered, and analyzed\non the edge of\
    \ the network before sending it to the cloud\nthrough expensive communication\
    \ media. The fog and cloud\nparadigms go together. Both of them are required for\
    \ the\noptimal performance of IoT applications. A smart gateway\n[13] can be employed\
    \ between underlying networks and the\ncloud to realize fog computing as shown\
    \ in Figure 7.\nThe features of fog computing [11] are as follows:\n(1) Low latency:\
    \ less time is required to access computing\nand storage resources on fog nodes\
    \ (smart gateways).\n10\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nSmart\
    \ devices\nSmart gateway\nLocal real time analysis \npreprocessing\nﬁltering\n\
    Cloud data center \nGlobal data analytics\nstorage\ndata\ndata\nFigure 7: Smart\
    \ gateway for preprocessing.\n(2) Location awareness: as the fog is located on\
    \ the edge\nof the network, it is aware of the location of the\napplications and\
    \ their context. This is beneficial as\ncontext awareness is an important feature\
    \ of IoT\napplications.\n(3) Distributed nodes: fog nodes are distributed unlike\n\
    centralized cloud nodes. Multiple fog nodes need to\nbe deployed in distributed\
    \ geographical areas in order\nto provide services to mobile devices in those\
    \ areas.\nFor example, in vehicular networks, deploying fog\nnodes at highways\
    \ can provide low latency data/video\nstreaming to vehicles.\n(4) Mobility: the\
    \ fog supports mobility as smart devices\ncan directly communicate with smart\
    \ gateways\npresent in their proximity.\n(5) Real time response: fog nodes can\
    \ give an immediate\nresponse unlike the cloud, which has a much greater\nlatency.\n\
    (6) Interaction with the cloud: fog nodes can further\ninteract with the cloud\
    \ and communicate only that\ndata, which is required to be sent to the cloud.\n\
    The tasks performed by a smart gateway [46] are col-\nlecting sensor data, preprocessing\
    \ and filtering collected\ndata, providing compute, storage and networking services\n\
    to IoT devices, communicating with the cloud and sending\nonly necessary data,\
    \ monitoring power consumption of IoT\ndevices, monitoring activities and services\
    \ of IoT devices, and\nensuring security and privacy of data. Some applications\
    \ of\nfog computing are as follows [10, 11]:\n(1) Smart vehicular networks: smart\
    \ traffic lights are\ndeployed as smart gateways to locally detect pedes-\ntrians\
    \ and vehicles through sensors, calculate their\ndistance and speed, and finally\
    \ infer traffic conditions.\nThis is used to warn oncoming vehicles. These sensors\n\
    also interact with neighboring smart traffic lights\nto perform traffic management\
    \ tasks. For example,\nif sensors detect an approaching ambulance, they\ncan change\
    \ the traffic lights to let the ambulance\npass first and also inform other lights\
    \ to do so. The\ndata collected by these smart traffic lights are locally\nanalyzed\
    \ in real time to serve real time needs of traffic\nmanagement. Further, data\
    \ from multiple gateways\nis combined and sent to the cloud for further global\n\
    analysis of traffic in the city.\n(2) Smart grid: the smart electrical grid facilitates\
    \ load\nbalancing of energy on the basis of usage and avail-\nability. This is\
    \ done in order to switch automatically\nto alternative sources of energy such\
    \ as solar and\nwind power. This balancing can be done at the edge\nof the network\
    \ using smart meters or microgrids\nconnected by smart gateways. These gateways\
    \ can\nanalyze and process data. They can then project future\nenergy demand,\
    \ calculate the availability and price of\npower, and supply power from both conventional\
    \ and\nalternative sources to consumers.\n7. Communication\nAs the Internet of\
    \ Things is growing very rapidly, there are a\nlarge number of heterogeneous smart\
    \ devices connecting to\nthe Internet. IoT devices are battery powered, with minimal\n\
    compute and storage resources. Because of their constrained\nnature, there are\
    \ various communication challenges involved,\nwhich are as follows [19]:\n(1)\
    \ Addressing and identification: since millions of smart\nthings will be connected\
    \ to the Internet, they will\nhave to be identified through a unique address,\
    \ on the\nbasis of which they communicate with each other. For\nthis, we need\
    \ a large addressing space, and a unique\naddress for each smart object.\n(2)\
    \ Low power communication: communication of data\nbetween devices is a power consuming\
    \ task, specially,\nwireless communication. Therefore, we need a solu-\ntion that\
    \ facilitates communication with low power\nconsumption.\n(3) Routing protocols\
    \ with low memory requirement and\nefficient communication patterns.\n(4) High\
    \ speed and nonlossy communication.\n(5) Mobility of smart things.\nIoT devices\
    \ typically connect to the Internet through\nthe IP (Internet Protocol) stack.\
    \ This stack is very complex\nand demands a large amount of power and memory from\n\
    the connecting devices. The IoT devices can also connect\nlocally through non-IP\
    \ networks, which consume less power,\nand connect to the Internet via a smart\
    \ gateway. Non-IP\ncommunication channels such as Bluetooth, RFID, and NFC\nare\
    \ fairly popular but are limited in their range (up to a\nfew meters). Therefore,\
    \ their applications are limited to small\npersonal area networks. Personal area\
    \ networks (PAN) are\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n11\nbeing\
    \ widely used in IoT applications such as wearables\nconnected to smartphones.\
    \ For increasing the range of such\nlocal networks, there was a need to modify\
    \ the IP stack so as to\nfacilitate low power communication using the IP stack.\
    \ One\nof the solutions is 6LoWPAN, which incorporates IPv6 with\nlow power personal\
    \ area networks. The range of a PAN with\n6LoWPAN is similar to local area networks,\
    \ and the power\nconsumption is much lower.\nThe leading communication technologies\
    \ used in the IoT\nworld are IEEE 802.15.4, low power WiFi, 6LoWPAN, RFID,\nNFC,\
    \ Sigfox, LoraWAN, and other proprietary protocols for\nwireless networks.\n7.1.\
    \ Near Field Communication (NFC). Near Field Communi-\ncation [47–49] is a very\
    \ short range wireless communication\ntechnology, through which mobile devices\
    \ can interact with\neach other over a distance of few centimeters only. All types\
    \ of\ndata can be transferred between two NFC enabled devices in\nseconds by bringing\
    \ them close to each other. This technology\nis based on RFID. It uses variations\
    \ in the magnetic field\nto communicate data between two NFC enabled devices.\n\
    NFC operates over a frequency band of 13.56 MHz, which is\nthe same as high frequency\
    \ RFID. There are two modes of\noperation: active and passive. In the active mode,\
    \ both the\ndevices generate magnetic fields, while in the passive mode,\nonly\
    \ one device generates the field and the other uses load\nmodulation to transfer\
    \ the data. The passive mode is useful in\nbattery powered devices to optimize\
    \ energy use. One benefit\nof the requirement of close proximity between devices\
    \ is that\nit is useful for secure transactions such as payments. Finally,\nnote\
    \ that NFC can be used for two-way communication\nunlike RFID. Consequently, almost\
    \ all smartphones in the\nmarket today are NFC enabled.\n7.2. Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) Based on IP for Smart\nObjects. Many times, data from a single\
    \ sensor is not useful\nin monitoring large areas and complex activities. Different\n\
    sensor nodes need to interact with each other wirelessly. The\ndisadvantage of\
    \ non-IP technologies such as RFID, NFC,\nand Bluetooth is that their range is\
    \ very small. So, they\ncannot be used in many applications, where a large area\
    \ needs\nto be monitored through many sensor nodes deployed in\ndiverse locations.\
    \ A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists\nof tens to thousands of sensor nodes\
    \ connected using wireless\ntechnologies. They collect data about the environment\
    \ and\ncommunicate it to gateway devices that relay the information\nto the cloud\
    \ over the Internet. The communication between\nnodes in a WSN may be direct or\
    \ multihop. The sensor nodes\nare of a constrained nature, but gateway nodes have\
    \ suffi-\ncient power and processing resources. The popular network\ntopologies\
    \ used in a WSN are a star, a mesh, and a hybrid\nnetwork. Most of the communication\
    \ in WSN is based on the\nIEEE 802.15.4 standard (discussed in Section 7.3). There\
    \ are\nclearly a lot of protocols that can be used in IoT scenarios.\nLet us discuss\
    \ the design of a typical IoT network protocol\nstack with the most popular alternatives.\n\
    7.3. IoT Network Protocol Stack. The Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF) has\
    \ developed alternative protocols for\ncommunication between IoT devices using\
    \ IP because IP is a\nflexible and reliable standard [50, 51]. The Internet Protocol\n\
    for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance has published various\nwhite papers describing\
    \ alternative protocols and standards\nfor the layers of the IP stack and an additional\
    \ adaptation\nlayer, which is used for communication [51–54] between\nsmart objects.\n\
    (1) Physical and MAC Layer (IEEE 802.15.4). The IEEE\n802.15.4 protocol is designed\
    \ for enabling communication\nbetween compact and inexpensive low power embedded\n\
    devices that need a long battery life. It defines standards and\nprotocols for\
    \ the physical and link (MAC) layer of the IP\nstack. It supports low power communication\
    \ along with low\ncost and short range communication. In the case of such\nresource\
    \ constrained environments, we need a small frame\nsize, low bandwidth, and low\
    \ transmit power.\nTransmission requires very little power (maximum one\nmilliwatt),\
    \ which is only one percent of that used in WiFi or\ncellular networks. This limits\
    \ the range of communication.\nBecause of the limited range, the devices have\
    \ to operate\ncooperatively in order to enable multihop routing over\nlonger distances.\
    \ As a result, the packet size is limited to\n127 bytes only, and the rate of\
    \ communication is limited to\n250 kbps. The coding scheme in IEEE 802.15.4 has\
    \ built in\nredundancy, which makes the communication robust, allows\nus to detect\
    \ losses, and enables the retransmission of lost\npackets. The protocol also supports\
    \ short 16-bit link addresses\nto decrease the size of the header, communication\
    \ overheads,\nand memory requirements [55].\nReaders can refer to the survey by\
    \ Vasseur et al. [54]\nfor more information on different physical and link layer\n\
    technologies for communication between smart objects.\n(2) Adaptation Layer. IPv6\
    \ is considered the best protocol for\ncommunication in the IoT domain because\
    \ of its scalability\nand stability. Such bulky IP protocols were initially not\n\
    thought to be suitable for communication in scenarios with\nlow power wireless\
    \ links such as IEEE 802.15.4.\n6LoWPAN, an acronym for IPv6 over low power wireless\n\
    personal area networks, is a very popular standard for\nwireless communication.\
    \ It enables communication using\nIPv6 over the IEEE 802.15.4 [52] protocol. This\
    \ standard\ndefines an adaptation layer between the 802.15.4 link layer\nand the\
    \ transport layer. 6LoWPAN devices can communicate\nwith all other IP based devices\
    \ on the Internet. The choice\nof IPv6 is because of the large addressing space\
    \ available\nin IPv6. 6LoWPAN networks connect to the Internet via a\ngateway\
    \ (WiFi or Ethernet), which also has protocol support\nfor conversion between\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 as today’s deployed\nInternet is mostly IPv4. IPv6 headers are\
    \ not small enough\nto fit within the small 127 byte MTU of the 802.15.4 standard.\n\
    Hence, squeezing and fragmenting the packets to carry\nonly the essential information\
    \ is an optimization that the\nadaptation layer performs.\nSpecifically, the adaptation\
    \ layer performs the following\nthree optimizations in order to reduce communication\
    \ over-\nhead [55]:\n12\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(i) Header\
    \ compression 6loWPAN defines header com-\npression of IPv6 packets for decreasing\
    \ the overhead\nof IPv6. Some of the fields are deleted because they\ncan be derived\
    \ from link level information or can be\nshared across packets.\n(ii) Fragmentation:\
    \ the minimum MTU size (maximum\ntransmission unit) of IPv6 is 1280 bytes. On\
    \ the other\nhand, the maximum size of a frame in IEEE 802.15.4\nis 127 bytes.\
    \ Therefore, we need to fragment the IPv6\npacket. This is done by the adaptation\
    \ layer.\n(iii) Link layer forwarding 6LoWPAN also supports mesh\nunder routing,\
    \ which is done at the link layer using\nlink level short addresses instead of\
    \ in the network\nlayer. This feature can be used to communicate within\na 6LoWPAN\
    \ network.\n(3) Network Layer. The network layer is responsible for\nrouting the\
    \ packets received from the transport layer. The\nIETF Routing over Low Power\
    \ and Lossy Networks (ROLL)\nworking group has developed a routing protocol (RPL)\
    \ for\nLow Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [53].\nFor such networks, RPL is an\
    \ open routing protocol,\nbased on distance vectors. It describes how a destination\n\
    oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) is built with\nthe nodes after they exchange\
    \ distance vectors. A set of\nconstraints and an objective function is used to\
    \ build the\ngraph with the best path [53]. The objective function and\nconstraints\
    \ may differ with respect to their requirements. For\nexample, constraints can\
    \ be to avoid battery powered nodes\nor to prefer encrypted links. The objective\
    \ function can aim\nto minimize the latency or the expected number of packets\n\
    that need to be sent.\nThe making of this graph starts from the root node. The\n\
    root starts sending messages to neighboring nodes, which\nthen process the message\
    \ and decide whether to join or not\ndepending upon the constraints and the objective\
    \ function.\nSubsequently, they forward the message to their neighbors.\nIn this\
    \ manner, the message travels till the leaf nodes and a\ngraph is formed. Now\
    \ all the nodes in the graph can send\npackets upwards hop by hop to the root.\
    \ We can realize a point\nto point routing algorithm as follows. We send packets\
    \ to a\ncommon ancestor, from which it travels downwards (towards\nleaves) to\
    \ reach the destination.\nTo manage the memory requirements of nodes, nodes are\n\
    classified into storing and nonstoring nodes depending upon\ntheir ability to\
    \ store routing information. When nodes are in a\nnonstoring mode and a downward\
    \ path is being constructed,\nthe route information is attached to the incoming\
    \ message\nand forwarded further till the root. The root receives the\nwhole path\
    \ in the message and sends a data packet along with\nthe path message to the destination\
    \ hop by hop. But there is\na trade-off here because nonstoring nodes need more\
    \ power\nand bandwidth to send additional route information as they\ndo not have\
    \ the memory to store routing tables.\n(4) Transport Layer. TCP is not a good\
    \ option for communi-\ncation in low power environments as it has a large overhead\n\
    owing to the fact that it is a connection oriented protocol.\nTherefore, UDP is\
    \ preferred because it is a connectionless\nprotocol and has low overhead.\n(5)\
    \ Application Layer. The application layer is responsible for\ndata formatting\
    \ and presentation. The application layer in\nthe Internet is typically based\
    \ on HTTP. However, HTTP is\nnot suitable in resource constrained environments\
    \ because\nit is fairly verbose in nature and thus incurs a large parsing\noverhead.\
    \ Many alternate protocols have been developed for\nIoT environments such as CoAP\
    \ (Constrained Application\nProtocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport).\n\
    (a) Constrained Application Protocol: CoAP can be\nthought of as an alternative\
    \ to HTTP. It is used\nin most IoT applications [56, 57]. Unlike HTTP, it\nincorporates\
    \ optimizations for constrained applica-\ntion environments [50]. It uses the\
    \ EXI (Efficient\nXML Interchanges) data format, which is a binary\ndata format\
    \ and is far more efficient in terms of\nspace as compared to plain text HTML/XML.\
    \ Other\nsupported features are built in header compression,\nresource discovery,\
    \ autoconfiguration, asynchronous\nmessage exchange, congestion control, and support\n\
    for multicast messages. There are four types of mes-\nsages in CoAP: nonconfirmable,\
    \ confirmable, reset\n(nack), and acknowledgement. For reliable transmis-\nsion\
    \ over UDP, confirmable messages are used [58].\nThe response can be piggybacked\
    \ in the acknowledge-\nment itself. Furthermore, it uses DTLS (Datagram\nTransport\
    \ Layer Security) for security purposes.\n(b) Message Queue Telemetry Transport:\
    \ MQTT is a\npublish/subscribe protocol that runs over TCP. It was\ndeveloped\
    \ by IBM [59] primarily as a client/server\nprotocol. The clients are publishers/subscribers\
    \ and\nthe server acts as a broker to which clients connect\nthrough TCP. Clients\
    \ can publish or subscribe to a\ntopic. This communication takes place through\
    \ the\nbroker whose job is to coordinate subscriptions and\nalso authenticate\
    \ the client for security. MQTT is\na lightweight protocol, which makes it suitable\
    \ for\nIoT applications. But because of the fact that it runs\nover TCP, it cannot\
    \ be used with all types of IoT\napplications. Moreover, it uses text for topic\
    \ names,\nwhich increases its overhead.\nMQTT-S/MQTT-SN is an extension of MQTT\
    \ [60],\nwhich is designed for low power and low cost devices. It is\nbased on\
    \ MQTT but has some optimizations for WSNs as\nfollows [61]. The topic names are\
    \ replaced by topic IDs, which\nreduce the overheads of transmission. Topics do\
    \ not need\nregistration as they are preregistered. Messages are also split\n\
    so that only the necessary information is sent. Further, for\npower conservation,\
    \ there is an offline procedure for clients\nwho are in a sleep state. Messages\
    \ can be buffered and later\nread by clients when they wake up. Clients connect\
    \ to the\nbroker through a gateway device, which resides within the\nsensor network\
    \ and connects to the broker.\n7.4. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Bluetooth Low\
    \ Energy, also\nknown as “Bluetooth Smart,” was developed by the Bluetooth\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n13\nSpecial Interest Group. It has a\
    \ relatively shorter range and\nconsumes lower energy as compared to competing\
    \ protocols.\nThe BLE protocol stack is similar to the stack used in classic\n\
    Bluetooth technology. It has two parts: controller and host.\nThe physical and\
    \ link layer are implemented in the controller.\nThe controller is typically a\
    \ SOC (System on Chip) with a\nradio. The functionalities of upper layers are\
    \ included in the\nhost [62]. BLE is not compatible with classic Bluetooth. Let\n\
    us look at the differences between classic Bluetooth and BLE\n[63, 64].\nThe main\
    \ difference is that BLE does not support data\nstreaming. Instead, it supports\
    \ quick transfer of small packets\nof data (packet size is small) with a data\
    \ rate of 1 Mbps.\nThere are two types of devices in BLE: master and slave.\n\
    The master acts as a central device that can connect to various\nslaves. Let us\
    \ consider an IoT scenario where a phone or PC\nserve as the master and mobile\
    \ devices such as a thermostat,\nfitness tracker, smart watch, or any monitoring\
    \ device act\nas slaves. In such cases, slaves must be very power efficient.\n\
    Therefore, to save energy, slaves are by default in sleep mode\nand wake up periodically\
    \ to receive packets from the master.\nIn classic Bluetooth, the connection is\
    \ on all the time even\nif no data transfer is going on. Additionally, it supports\
    \ 79\ndata channels (1 MHz channel bandwidth) and a data rate\nof 1 million symbols/s,\
    \ whereas, BLE supports 40 channels\nwith 2 MHz channel bandwidth (double of classic\
    \ Bluetooth)\nand 1 million symbols/s data rate. BLE supports low duty\ncycle\
    \ requirements as its packet size is small and the time\ntaken to transmit the\
    \ smallest packet is as small as 80 \U0001D707s. The\nBLE protocol stack supports\
    \ IP based communication also.\nAn experiment conducted by Siekkinen et al. [65]\
    \ recorded\nthe number of bytes transferred per Joule to show that BLE\nconsumes\
    \ far less energy as compared to competing protocols\nsuch as Zigbee. The energy\
    \ efficiency of BLE is 2.5 times better\nthan Zigbee.\n7.5. Low Power WiFi. The\
    \ WiFi alliance has recently devel-\noped “WiFi HaLow,” which is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11ah\nstandard. It consumes lower power than a traditional WiFi\ndevice\
    \ and also has a longer range. This is why this protocol\nis suitable for Internet\
    \ of Things applications. The range of\nWiFi HaLow is nearly twice that of traditional\
    \ WiFi.\nLike other WiFi devices, devices supporting WiFi HaLow\nalso support\
    \ IP connectivity, which is important for IoT\napplications. Let us look at the\
    \ specifications of the IEEE\n802.11ah standard [66, 67]. This standard was developed\
    \ to\ndeal with wireless sensor network scenarios, where devices\nare energy constrained\
    \ and require relatively long range\ncommunication. IEEE 802.11ah operates in\
    \ the sub-gigahertz\nband (900 MHz). Because of the relatively lower frequency,\n\
    the range is longer since higher frequency waves suffer from\nhigher attenuation.\
    \ We can extend the range (currently 1 km)\nby lowering the frequency further;\
    \ however, the data rate\nwill also be lower and thus the tradeoff is not justified.\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah is also designed to support large star shaped\nnetworks, where a\
    \ lot of stations are connected to a single\naccess point.\n7.6. Zigbee. It is\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.15.4 communication\nprotocol standard and is used for\
    \ personal area networks\nor PANs [68]. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has low power\n\
    MAC and physical layers and has already been explained\nin Section 7.3. Zigbee\
    \ was developed by the Zigbee alliance,\nwhich works for reliable, low energy,\
    \ and cheap communi-\ncation solutions. The range of Zigbee device communication\n\
    is very small (10–100 meters). The details of the network and\napplication layers\
    \ are also specified by the Zigbee standard.\nUnlike BLE, the network layer here\
    \ provides for multihop\nrouting.\nThere are three types of devices in a Zigbee\
    \ network:\nFFD (Fully Functional Device), RFD (Reduced Functional\nDevice), and\
    \ one Zigbee coordinator. A FFD node can addi-\ntionally act as a router. Zigbee\
    \ supports star, tree, and mesh\ntopologies. The routing scheme depends on the\
    \ topology.\nOther features of Zigbee are discovery and maintenance of\nroutes,\
    \ support for nodes joining/leaving the network, short\n16-bit addresses, and\
    \ multihop routing.\nThe framework for communication and distributed appli-\n\
    cation development is provided by the application layer.\nThe application layer\
    \ consists of Application Objects (APO),\nApplication Sublayer (APS), and a Zigbee\
    \ Device Object\n(ZDO). APOs are spread over the network nodes. These are\npieces\
    \ of software, which control some underlying device\nhardware (examples: switch\
    \ and transducer). The device and\nnetwork management services are provided by\
    \ the ZDO,\nwhich are then used by the APOs. Data transfer services\nare provided\
    \ by the Application Sublayer to the APOs and\nZDO. It is responsible for secure\
    \ communication between the\nApplication Objects. These features can be used to\
    \ create a\nlarge distributed application.\n7.7. Integration of RFID and WSN.\
    \ RFID and wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) are both important technologies in\
    \ the IoT\ndomain. RFID can only be used for object identification, but\nWSNs\
    \ serve a far greater purpose. The two are very different\nbut merging them has\
    \ many advantages. The following\ncomponents can be added to RFID to enhance its\
    \ usability:\n(a) Sensing capabilities\n(b) Multihop communication\n(c) Intelligence\n\
    RFID is inexpensive and uses very little power. That is\nwhy its integration with\
    \ WSN is very useful. The integration\nis possible in the following ways [69,\
    \ 70]:\n(a) Integration of RFID tags with sensors: RFID tags\nwith sensing capabilities\
    \ are called sensor tags. These\nsensor tags sense data from the environment and\n\
    then the RFID reader can read this sensed data from\nthe tag. In such cases, simple\
    \ RFID protocols are\nused, where there is only single hop communication.\nRFID\
    \ sensing technologies can be further classified\non the basis of the power requirement\
    \ of sensor tags as\nexplained earlier in the section on RFIDs (active and\npassive)\
    \ (see Section 5.5).\n14\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(b)\
    \ Integration of RFID tags with WSN nodes: the com-\nmunication capabilities of\
    \ sensor tags are limited to a\nsingle hop. To extend its capabilities, the sensor\
    \ tag is\nequipped with a wireless transceiver, little bit of Flash\nmemory, and\
    \ computational capabilities such that it\ncan initiate communication with other\
    \ nodes and\nwireless devices. The nodes can in this fashion be used\nto form\
    \ a wireless mesh network. In such networks,\nsensor tags can communicate with\
    \ each other over a\nlarge range (via intermediate hops). With additional\nprocessing\
    \ capabilities at a node, we can reduce the\nnet amount of data communicated and\
    \ thus increase\nthe power efficiency of the WSN.\n(c) Integration of RFID readers\
    \ with WSN nodes: this\ntype of integration is also done to increase the range\n\
    of RFID tag readers. The readers are equipped with\nwireless transceivers and\
    \ microcontrollers so that\nthey can communicate with each other and therefore,\n\
    the tag data can reach a reader, which is not in the\nrange of that tag. It takes\
    \ advantage of multihop\ncommunication of wireless sensor network devices.\nThe\
    \ data from all the RFID readers in the network\nultimately reaches a central\
    \ gateway or base station\nthat processes the data or sends it to a remote server.\n\
    These kinds of integrated solutions have many applica-\ntions in a diverse set\
    \ of domains such as security, healthcare,\nand manufacturing.\n7.8. Low Power\
    \ Wide-Area-Networks (LPWAN). Let us now\ndiscuss a protocol for long range communication\
    \ in power\nconstrained devices. The LPWAN class of protocols is low bit-\nrate\
    \ communication technologies for such IoT scenarios.\nLet us now discuss some\
    \ of the most common technolo-\ngies in this area.\nNarrow band IoT: it is a technology\
    \ made for a large\nnumber of devices that are energy constrained. It is\nthus\
    \ necessary to reduce the bit rate. This protocol\ncan be deployed with both the\
    \ cellular phone GSM\nand LTE spectra. The downlink speeds vary between\n40 kbps\
    \ (LTE M2) and 10 Mbps (LTE category 1).\nSigfox: it is one more protocol that\
    \ uses narrow band\ncommunication (≈10 MHz). It uses free sections of\nthe radio\
    \ spectrum (ISM band) to transmit its data.\nInstead of 4G networks, Sigfox focuses\
    \ on using\nvery long waves. Thus, the range can increase to a\n1000 kms. Because\
    \ of this the energy for transmission\nis significantly lower (<0.1%) than contemporary\
    \ cell\nphones.\nAgain the cost is bandwidth. It can only transmit\n12 bytes per\
    \ message, and a device is limited to 140\nmessages per day. This is reasonable\
    \ for many kinds of\napplications: submarine applications, sending control\n(emergency)\
    \ codes, geolocation, monitoring remote\nlocations, and medical applications.\n\
    Weightless: it uses a differential binary phase shift\nkeying based method to\
    \ transmit narrow band sig-\nnals. To avoid interference, the protocol hops across\n\
    frequency bands (instead of using CSMA). It sup-\nports cryptographic encryption\
    \ and mobility. Along\nwith frequency hopping, two additional mechanisms\nare\
    \ used to reduce collisions. The downlink service\nuses time division multiple\
    \ access (TDMA) and the\nuplink service uses multiple subchannels that are first\n\
    allocated to transmitting nodes by contacting a cen-\ntral server. Some applications\
    \ include smart meters,\nvehicle tracking, health monitoring, and industrial\n\
    machine monitoring.\nNeul: this protocol operates in the sub-1 GHz band.\nIt uses\
    \ small chunks of the TV whitespace spectrum\nto create low cost and low power\
    \ networks with very\nhigh scalability. It has a 10 km range and uses the\nWeightless\
    \ protocol for communication.\nLoRaWAN: this protocol is similar to Sigfox. It\
    \ targets\nwide area network applications and is designed to be\na low power protocol.\
    \ Its data rates can vary from\n0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, and it can be used within\
    \ an\nurban or a suburban environment (2–5 kms range\nin a crowded urban area).\
    \ It was designed to serve\nas a standard for long range IoT protocols. It thus\n\
    has features to support multitenancy, enable multiple\napplications, and include\
    \ several different network\ndomains.\n7.9. Lightweight Application Layer Protocols.\
    \ Along with\nphysical and MAC layer protocols, we also need application\nlayer\
    \ protocols for IoT networks. These lightweight protocols\nneed to be able to\
    \ carry application messages, while simulta-\nneously reducing power as far as\
    \ possible.\nOMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) is one such protocol.\nIt defines the\
    \ communication protocol between a server and\na device. The devices often have\
    \ limited capabilities and are\nthus referred to as constrained devices. The main\
    \ aims of the\nOMA protocol are as follows:\n(1) Remote device management.\n(2)\
    \ Transferring service data/information between differ-\nent nodes in the LWM2M\
    \ network.\nAll the protocols in this class treat all the network\nresources as\
    \ objects. Such resources can be created, deleted,\nand remotely configured. These\
    \ devices have their unique\nlimitations and can use different kinds of protocols\
    \ for\ninternally representing information. The LWM2M protocol\nabstracts all\
    \ of this away and provides a convenient interface\nto send messages between a\
    \ generic LWM2M server and a\ndistributed set of LWM2M clients.\nThis protocol\
    \ is often used along with CoAP (Constrained\nApplication Protocol). It is an\
    \ application layer protocol\nthat allows constrained nodes such as sensor motes\
    \ or small\nembedded devices to communicate across the Internet. CoAP\nseamlessly\
    \ integrates with HTTP, yet it provides additional\nfacilities such as support\
    \ for multicast operations. It is ideally\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\n15\nsuited for small devices because of its low overhead and\n\
    parsing complexity and reliance on UDP rather than TCP.\n8. Middleware\nUbiquitous\
    \ computing is the core of the Internet of Things,\nwhich means incorporating\
    \ computing and connectivity in\nall the things around us. Interoperability of\
    \ such heteroge-\nneous devices needs well-defined standards. But standard-\n\
    ization is difficult because of the varied requirements of\ndifferent applications\
    \ and devices. For such heterogeneous\napplications, the solution is to have a\
    \ middleware platform,\nwhich will abstract the details of the things for applications.\n\
    That is, it will hide the details of the smart things. It\nshould act as a software\
    \ bridge between the things and the\napplications. It needs to provide the required\
    \ services to the\napplication developers [20] so that they can focus more on\n\
    the requirements of applications rather than on interacting\nwith the baseline\
    \ hardware. To summarize, the middleware\nabstracts the hardware and provides\
    \ an Application Program-\nming Interface (API) for communication, data management,\n\
    computation, security, and privacy.\nThe challenges, which are addressed by any\
    \ IoT middle-\nware, are as follows: [20, 71, 72].\n(1) Interoperability and programming\
    \ abstractions: for\nfacilitating collaboration and information exchange\nbetween\
    \ heterogeneous devices, different types of\nthings can interact with each other\
    \ easily with the help\nof middleware services. Interoperability is of three\n\
    types: network, semantic, and syntactic. Network\ninteroperability deals with\
    \ heterogeneous interface\nprotocols for communication between devices. It\ninsulates\
    \ the applications from the intricacies of\ndifferent protocols. Syntactic interoperability\
    \ ensures\nthat applications are oblivious of different formats,\nstructures,\
    \ and encoding of data. Semantic interop-\nerability deals with abstracting the\
    \ meaning of data\nwithin a particular domain. It is loosely inspired by\nthe\
    \ semantic web.\n(2) Device discovery and management: this feature\nenables the\
    \ devices to be aware of all other devices\nin the neighborhood and the services\
    \ provided by\nthem. In the Internet of Things, the infrastructure is\nmostly\
    \ dynamic. The devices have to announce their\npresence and the services they\
    \ provide. The solution\nneeds to be scalable because the devices in an IoT\n\
    network can increase. Most solutions in this domain\nare loosely inspired by semantic\
    \ web technologies.\nThe middleware provides APIs to list the IoT devices,\ntheir\
    \ services, and capabilities. In addition, typically\nAPIs are provided to discover\
    \ devices based on their\ncapabilities. Finally, any IoT middleware needs to\n\
    perform load balancing, manage devices based on\ntheir levels of battery power,\
    \ and report problems in\ndevices to the users.\n(3) Scalability: a large number\
    \ of devices are expected to\ncommunicate in an IoT setup. Moreover, IoT appli-\n\
    cations need to scale due to ever increasing require-\nments. This should be managed\
    \ by the middleware\nby making required changes when the infrastructure\nscales.\n\
    (4) Big data and analytics: IoT sensors typically collect\na huge amount of data.\
    \ It is necessary to analyze\nall of this data in great detail. As a result a\
    \ lot of\nbig data algorithms are used to analyze IoT data.\nMoreover, it is possible\
    \ that due to the flimsy nature\nof the network some of the data collected might\
    \ be\nincomplete. It is necessary to take this into account\nand extrapolate data\
    \ by using sophisticated machine\nlearning algorithms.\n(5) Security and privacy:\
    \ IoT applications are mostly\nrelated to someone’s personal life or an industry.\n\
    Security and privacy issues need to be addressed in\nall such environments. The\
    \ middleware should have\nbuilt in mechanisms to address such issues, along with\n\
    user authentication, and the implementation of access\ncontrol.\n(6) Cloud services:\
    \ the cloud is an important part of an\nIoT deployment. Most of the sensor data\
    \ is analyzed\nand stored in a centralized cloud. It is necessary for\nIoT middleware\
    \ to seamlessly run on different types\nof clouds and to enable users to leverage\
    \ the cloud\nto get better insights from the data collected by the\nsensors.\n\
    (7) Context detection: the data collected from the sensors\nneeds to be used to\
    \ extract the context by applying\nvarious types of algorithms. The context can\
    \ subse-\nquently be used for providing sophisticated services\nto users.\nThere\
    \ are many middleware solutions available for the\nInternet of Things, which address\
    \ one or more of the\naforementioned issues. All of them support interoperabil-\n\
    ity and abstraction, which is the foremost requirement of\nmiddleware. Some examples\
    \ are Oracle’s Fusion Middleware,\nOpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], and Hydra [23].\
    \ Middle-\nwares can be classified as follows on the basis of their design\n[72]:\n\
    (1) Event based: here, all the components interact with\neach other through events.\
    \ Each event has a type and\nsome parameters. Events are generated by producers\n\
    and received by the consumers. This can be viewed\nas a publish/subscribe architecture,\
    \ where entities can\nsubscribe for some event types and get notified for\nthose\
    \ events.\n(2) Service oriented: service oriented middlewares are\nbased on Service\
    \ Oriented Architectures (SOA), in\nwhich we have independent modules that provide\
    \ ser-\nvices through accessible interfaces. A service oriented\nmiddleware views\
    \ resources as service providers.\nIt abstracts the underlying resources through\
    \ a set\nof services that are used by applications. There is\n16\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\na service repository, where services are published\n\
    by providers. The consumers can discover services\nfrom the repository and then\
    \ bind with the provider\nto access the service. Service oriented middleware\n\
    must have runtime support for advertising services\nby providers and support for\
    \ discovering and using\nservices by consumers.\nHYDRA [23] is a service oriented\
    \ middleware. It\nincorporates many software components, which are\nused in handling\
    \ various tasks required for the devel-\nopment of intelligent applications. Hydra\
    \ also pro-\nvides semantic interoperability using semantic web\ntechnologies.\
    \ It supports dynamic reconfiguration\nand self-management.\n(3) Database oriented:\
    \ in this approach, the network\nof IoT devices is considered as a virtual relational\n\
    database system. The database can then be queried\nby the applications using a\
    \ query language. There\nare easy to use interfaces for extracting data from\n\
    the database. This approach has issues with scaling\nbecause of its centralized\
    \ model.\n(4) Semantic: semantic middleware focuses on the inter-\noperation of\
    \ different types of devices, which commu-\nnicate using different formats of\
    \ data. It incorporates\ndevices with different data formats and ontologies and\n\
    ties all of them together in a common framework.\nThe framework is used for exchanging\
    \ data between\ndiverse types of devices. For a common semantic for-\nmat, we\
    \ need to have \U0001D441 adapters for communication\nbetween \U0001D441 devices\
    \ because; for each device, we need\nadapters to map \U0001D441 standards to one\
    \ abstract standard\n[73]. In such a semantic middleware [74], a semantic\nlayer\
    \ is introduced, in which there is a mapping from\neach resource to a software\
    \ layer for that resource.\nThe software layers then communicate with each\nother\
    \ using a mutually intelligible language (based\non the semantic web). This technique\
    \ allows multiple\nphysical resources to communicate even though they\ndo not\
    \ implement or understand the same protocols.\n(5) Application specific: this\
    \ type of middleware is used\nspecifically for an application domain for which\
    \ it\nis developed because the whole architecture of this\nmiddleware software\
    \ is fine-tuned on the basis of\nrequirements of the application. The application\
    \ and\nmiddleware are tightly coupled. These are not general\npurpose solutions.\n\
    8.1. Popular IoT Middleware\n8.1.1. FiWare. FiWare is a very popular IoT middleware\n\
    framework that is promoted by the EU. It has been designed\nkeeping smart cities,\
    \ logistics, and shop floor analytics in\nmind. FiWare contains a large body of\
    \ code, reusable mod-\nules, and APIs that have been contributed by thousands\
    \ of\nFiWare developers. Any application developer can take a\nsubset of these\
    \ components and build his/her IoT application.\nA typical IoT application has\
    \ many producers of data\n(sensors), a set of servers to process the data, and\
    \ a set\nof actuators. FiWare refers to the information collected by\nsensors\
    \ as context information. It defines generic REST APIs\nto capture the context\
    \ from different scenarios. All the context\ninformation is sent to a dedicated\
    \ service called a context\nbroker. FiWare provides APIs to store the context\
    \ and also\nquery it. Moreover, any application can register itself as a\ncontext\
    \ consumer, and it can request the context broker for\ninformation. It also supports\
    \ the publish-subscribe paradigm.\nSubsequently, the context can be supplied to\
    \ systems using\ncontext adapters whose main role is to transform the data (the\n\
    context) based on the requirements of the destination nodes.\nMoreover, FiWare\
    \ defines a set of SNMP APIs via which we\ncan control the behavior of IoT devices\
    \ and also configure\nthem.\nThe target applications are provided APIs to analyze,\n\
    query, and mine the information that is collected from the\ncontext broker. Additionally,\
    \ with advanced visualization\nAPIs, it is possible to create and deploy feature\
    \ rich applica-\ntions very quickly.\n8.1.2. OpenIoT. OpenIoT is another popular\
    \ open source\ninitiative. It has 7 different components. At the lowest level,\n\
    we have a physical plane. It collects data from IoT devices\nand also does some\
    \ preprocessing of data. It has different\nAPIs to interface with different types\
    \ of physical nodes and\nget information from them.\nThe next plane is the virtualized\
    \ plane, which has 3\ncomponents. We first have the scheduler, which manages the\n\
    streams of data generated by devices. It primarily assigns\nthem to resources\
    \ and takes care of their QoS requirements.\nThe data storage component manages\
    \ the storage and archival\nof data streams. Finally, the service delivery component\n\
    processes the streams. It has several roles. It combines\ndata streams, preprocesses\
    \ them, and tracks some statistics\nassociated with these streams such as the\
    \ number of unique\nrequests or the size of each request.\nThe uppermost layer,\
    \ that is, the application layer, also\nhas 3 components: request definition,\
    \ request presentation,\nand configuration. The request definition component helps\n\
    us create requests to be sent to the IoT sensors and storage\nlayers. It can be\
    \ used to fetch and query data. The request\npresentation component creates mashups\
    \ of data by issuing\ndifferent queries to the storage layer, and finally the\
    \ configu-\nration component helps us configure the IoT devices.\n9. Applications\
    \ of IoT\nThere are a diverse set of areas in which intelligent applica-\ntions\
    \ have been developed. All of these applications are not\nyet readily available;\
    \ however, preliminary research indicates\nthe potential of IoT in improving the\
    \ quality of life in our soci-\nety. Some uses of IoT applications are in home\
    \ automation,\nfitness tracking, health monitoring, environment protection,\n\
    smart cities, and industrial settings.\n9.1. Home Automation. Smart homes are\
    \ becoming more\npopular today because of two reasons. First, the sensor\nand\
    \ actuation technologies along with wireless sensor net-\nworks have significantly\
    \ matured. Second, people today trust\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\

    \ diagram of a smart home system.\ntechnology to address their concerns about\
    \ their quality of\nlife and security of their homes (see Figure 8).\nIn smart\
    \ homes, various sensors are deployed, which\nprovide intelligent and automated\
    \ services to the user. They\nhelp in automating daily tasks and help in maintaining\
    \ a\nroutine for individuals who tend to be forgetful. They help\nin energy conservation\
    \ by turning off lights and electronic\ngadgets automatically. We typically use\
    \ motion sensors for\nthis purpose. Motion sensors can be additionally used for\n\
    security also.\nFor example, the project, MavHome [75], provides an\nintelligent\
    \ agent, which uses various prediction algorithms\nfor doing automated tasks in\
    \ response to user triggered events\nand adapts itself to the routines of the\
    \ inhabitants. Predic-\ntion algorithms are used to predict the sequence of events\n\
    [76] in a home. A sequence matching algorithm maintains\nsequences of events in\
    \ a queue and also stores their frequency.\nThen a prediction is made using the\
    \ match length and\nfrequency. Other algorithms used by similar applications use\n\
    compression based prediction and Markov models.\nEnergy conservation in smart\
    \ homes [77] is typically\nachieved through sensors and context awareness. The\
    \ sen-\nsors collect data from the environment (light, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ gas, and fire events). This data from heterogeneous\nsensors is fed to a context\
    \ aggregator, which forwards the\ncollected data to the context aware service\
    \ engine. This engine\nselects services based on the context. For example, an\
    \ appli-\ncation can automatically turn on the AC when the humidity\nrises. Or,\
    \ when there is a gas leak, it can turn all the lights off.\nSmart home applications\
    \ are really beneficial for the\nelderly and differently abled. Their health is\
    \ monitored and\nrelatives are informed immediately in case of emergencies.\n\
    Floors are equipped with pressure sensors, which track the\nmovement of an individual\
    \ across the smart home and also\nhelp in detecting if a person has fallen down.\
    \ In smart homes,\nCCTV cameras can be used to record events of interest. These\n\
    can then be used for feature extraction to find out what is\ngoing on.\nIn specific,\
    \ fall detection applications in smart environ-\nments [78–80] are useful for\
    \ detecting if elderly people have\nfallen down. Yu et al. [80] use computer vision\
    \ based tech-\nniques for analyzing postures of the human body. Sixsmith\net al.\
    \ [79] used low cost infrared sensor array technology,\nwhich can provide information\
    \ such as the location, size,\nand velocity of a target object. It detects dynamics\
    \ of a fall\nby analyzing the motion patterns and also detects inactivity\nand\
    \ compares it with activity in the past. Neural networks\nare employed and sample\
    \ data is provided to the system for\nvarious types of falls. Many smartphone\
    \ based applications\nare also available, which detect a fall on the basis of\
    \ readings\nfrom the accelerometer and gyroscope data.\nThere are many challenges\
    \ and issues with regard to smart\nhome applications [81]. The most important\
    \ is security and\nprivacy [82] since all the data about the events taking place\
    \ in\nthe home is being recorded. If the security and trustworthi-\nness of the\
    \ system are not guaranteed, an intruder may attack\nthe system and may make the\
    \ system behave maliciously.\nSmart home systems are supposed to notify the owners\
    \ in case\nthey detect such abnormalities. This is possible using AI and\nmachine\
    \ learning algorithms, and researchers have already\nstarted working in this direction\
    \ [83]. Reliability is also an\nissue since there is no system administrator to\
    \ monitor the\nsystem.\n9.2. Smart Cities\n9.2.1. Smart Transport. Smart transport\
    \ applications can\nmanage daily traffic in cities using sensors and intelligent\n\
    information processing systems. The main aim of intelligent\ntransport systems\
    \ is to minimize traffic congestion, ensure\n18\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nDatacenter\nGateway\nSend status to cloud\nabout availability\n\
    Search for nearest\navailable parking\nParking space with sensors\nFigure 9: Block\
    \ diagram of a smart parking system.\neasy and hassle-free parking, and avoid\
    \ accidents by prop-\nerly routing traffic and spotting drunk drivers. The sensor\n\
    technologies governing these types of applications are GPS\nsensors for location,\
    \ accelerometers for speed, gyroscopes for\ndirection, RFIDs for vehicle identification,\
    \ infrared sensors\nfor counting passengers and vehicles, and cameras for record-\n\
    ing vehicle movement and traffic. There are many types of\napplications in this\
    \ area (refer to [84]):\n(1) Traffic surveillance and management applications:\n\
    vehicles are connected by a network to each other,\nthe cloud, and to a host of\
    \ IoT devices such as GPS\nsensors, RFID devices, and cameras. These devices\n\
    can estimate traffic conditions in different parts of the\ncity. Custom applications\
    \ can analyze traffic patterns\nso that future traffic conditions can be estimated.\
    \ Yu et\nal. [85] implement a vehicle tracking system for traffic\nsurveillance\
    \ using video sequences captured on the\nroads.\nTraffic congestion detection\
    \ can also be implemented\nusing smartphone sensors such as accelerometers\n[86]\
    \ and GPS sensors. These applications can detect\nmovement patterns of the vehicle\
    \ while the user is\ndriving. Such kind of information is already being\ncollected\
    \ by Google maps and users are using it to\nroute around potentially congested\
    \ areas of the city.\n(2) Applications to ensure safety: smart transport does\n\
    not only imply managing traffic conditions. It also\nincludes safety of people\
    \ travelling in their vehicles,\nwhich up till now was mainly in the hands of\
    \ drivers.\nThere are many IoT applications developed to help\ndrivers become\
    \ safer drivers. Such applications mon-\nitor driving behavior of drivers and\
    \ help them drive\nsafely by detecting when they are feeling drowsy or\ntired\
    \ and helping them to cope with it or suggesting\nrest [87, 88]. Technologies\
    \ used in such applications\nare face detection, eye movement detection, and\n\
    pressure detection on the steering (to measure the\ngrip of the driver’s hands\
    \ on the steering).\nA smartphone application, which estimates the\ndriver’s driving\
    \ behavior using smartphone sensors\nsuch as the accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS,\
    \ and cam-\nera, has been proposed by Eren et al. [89]. It can\ndecide whether\
    \ the driving is safe or rash by analyzing\nthe sensor data.\n(3) Intelligent\
    \ parking management (see Figure 9): in a\nsmart transportation system, parking\
    \ is completely\nhassle free as one can easily check on the Internet to\nfind\
    \ out which parking lot has free spaces. Such lots\nuse sensors to detect if the\
    \ slots are free or occupied by\nvehicles. This data is then uploaded to a central\
    \ server.\n(4) Smart traffic lights: traffic lights equipped with sens-\ning,\
    \ processing, and communication capabilities are\ncalled smart traffic lights.\
    \ These lights sense the\ntraffic congestion at the intersection and the amount\n\
    of traffic going each way. This information can be\nanalyzed and then sent to\
    \ neighboring traffic lights\nor a central controller. It is possible to use this\n\
    information creatively. For example, in an emergency\nsituation the traffic lights\
    \ can preferentially give way\nto an ambulance. When the smart traffic light senses\n\
    an ambulance coming, it clears the path for it and\nalso informs neighboring lights\
    \ about it. Technologies\nused in these lights are cameras, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, and data analysis modules. Such systems\nhave already been deployed\
    \ in Rio De Janeiro.\n(5) Accident detection applications: a smartphone appli-\n\
    cation designed by White et al. [90] detects the occur-\nrence of an accident\
    \ with the help of an accelerometer\nand acoustic data. It immediately sends this\
    \ informa-\ntion along with the location to the nearest hospital.\nJournal of\
    \ Electrical and Computer Engineering\n19\nSome additional situational information\
    \ such as on-\nsite photographs is also sent so that the first respon-\nders know\
    \ about the whole scenario and the degree of\nmedical help that is required.\n\
    9.2.2. Smart Water Systems. Given the prevailing amount of\nwater scarcity in\
    \ most parts of the world, it is very important\nto manage our water resources\
    \ efficiently. As a result most\ncities are opting for smart solutions that place\
    \ a lot of meters\non water supply lines and storm drains. A good reference\n\
    in this area is the paper by Hauber-Davidson and Idris [91].\nThey describe various\
    \ designs for smart water meters. These\nmeters can be used to measure the degree\
    \ of water inflow and\noutflow and to identify possible leaks. Smart water metering\n\
    systems are also used in conjunction with data from weather\nsatellites and river\
    \ water sensors. They can also help us predict\nflooding.\n9.2.3. Examples of\
    \ Smart Cities. Barcelona and Stockholm\nstand out in the list of smart cities.\
    \ Barcelona has a CityOS\nproject, where it aims to create a single virtualized\
    \ OS for\nall the smart devices and services offered within the city.\nBarcelona\
    \ has mainly focused on smart transportation (as\ndiscussed in Section 9.2.1)\
    \ and smart water. Smart transporta-\ntion is implemented using a network of sensors,\
    \ centralized\nanalysis, and smart traffic lights. On similar lines Barcelona\n\
    has sensors on most of its storm drains, water storage tanks,\nand water supply\
    \ lines. This information is integrated with\nweather and usage information. The\
    \ result of all of this is\na centralized water planning strategy. The city is\
    \ able to\nestimate the water requirements in terms of domestic usage\nand industrial\
    \ usage and for activities such as landscaping and\ngardening.\nStockholm started\
    \ way back in 1994, and its first step in\nthis direction was to install an extensive\
    \ fiber optic system.\nSubsequently, the city added thousands of sensors for smart\n\
    traffic and smart water management applications. Stockholm\nwas one of the first\
    \ cities to implement congestion charging.\nUsers were charged money, when they\
    \ drove into congested\nareas. This was enabled by smart traffic technologies.\
    \ Since\nthe city has a solid network backbone, it is very easy to\ndeploy sensors\
    \ and applications. For example, recently the\ncity created a smart parking system,\
    \ where it is possible to\neasily locate parking spots nearby. Parking lots have\
    \ sensors,\nwhich let a server know about their usage. Once a driver\nqueries\
    \ the server with her/his GPS location, she/he is guided\nto the nearest parking\
    \ lot with free slots. Similar innovations\nhave taken place in the city’s smart\
    \ buildings, snow clearance,\nand political announcement systems.\n9.3. Social\
    \ Life and Entertainment. Social life and entertain-\nment play an important role\
    \ in an individual’s life. Many\napplications have been developed, which keep\
    \ track of such\nhuman activities. The term “opportunistic IoT” [92] refers\n\
    to information sharing among opportunistic devices (devices\nthat seek to make\
    \ contact with other devices) based on\nmovement and availability of contacts\
    \ in the vicinity. Personal\ndevices such as tablets, wearables, and mobile phones\
    \ have\nsensing and short range communication capabilities. People\ncan find and\
    \ interact with each other when there is a common\npurpose.\nCircle Sense [93]\
    \ is an application, which detects social\nactivities of a person with the help\
    \ of various types of sensor\ndata. It identifies the social circle of a person\
    \ by analyzing\nthe patterns of social activities and the people present in\n\
    those activities. Various types of social activities and the set\nof people participating\
    \ in those activities are identified. It\nuses location sensors to find out where\
    \ the person is and\nuses Bluetooth for searching people around her. The system\n\
    has built in machine learning algorithms, and it gradually\nimproves its behavior\
    \ with learning.\nAffective computing [94] is a technology, which recog-\nnizes,\
    \ understands, stimulates, and responds to the emotions\nof human beings. There\
    \ are many parameters, which are\nconsidered while dealing with human affects\
    \ such as facial\nexpressions, speech, body gestures, hand movements, and\nsleep\
    \ patterns. These are analyzed to figure out how a person\nis feeling. The utterance\
    \ of emotional keywords is identified\nby voice recognition and the quality of\
    \ voice by looking at\nacoustic features of speech.\nOne of the applications of\
    \ affective computing is Camy,\nan artificial pet dog [95], which is designed\
    \ to interact with\nhuman beings and show affection and emotions. Many sen-\n\
    sors and actuators are embedded in it. It provides emotional\nsupport to the owner,\
    \ encourages playful and active behavior,\nrecognizes its owner, and shows love\
    \ for her and increases\nthe owner’s communication with other people. Based on\
    \ the\nowner’s mood, Camy interacts with the owner and gives her\nsuggestions.\n\
    Logmusic [96] is an entertainment application, which\nrecommends music on the\
    \ basis of the context, such as the\nweather, temperature, time, and location.\n\
    9.4. Health and Fitness. IoT appliances have proven really\nbeneficial in the\
    \ health and wellness domains. Many wearable\ndevices are being developed, which\
    \ monitor a person’s health\ncondition (see Figure 10).\nHealth applications make\
    \ independent living possible for\nthe elderly and patients with serious health\
    \ conditions. Cur-\nrently, IoT sensors are being used to continuously monitor\n\
    and record their health conditions and transmit warnings in\ncase any abnormal\
    \ indicators are found. If there is a minor\nproblem, the IoT application itself\
    \ may suggest a prescription\nto the patient.\nIoT applications can be used in\
    \ creating an Electronic\nHealth Record (EHR), which is a record of all the medical\n\
    details of a person. It is maintained by the health system. An\nEHR can be used\
    \ to record allergies, surges in blood sugar\nand blood pressure.\nStress recognition\
    \ applications are also fairly popular\n[97]. They can be realized using smartphone\
    \ sensors. Wang\net al. describe an application [30], which measures the stress\n\
    level of a college student and is installed on the student’s\nsmartphone. It senses\
    \ the locations the student visits during\nthe whole day, the amount of physical\
    \ activity, amount of\nsleep and rest, and her/his interaction and relationships\
    \ with\nother people (audio data and calls). In addition, it also\nconducts surveys\
    \ with the student by randomly popping up\n20\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of a smart healthcare system.\na question in the smartphone. Using all of this\
    \ data and\nanalyzing it intelligently, the level of stress and academic\nperformance\
    \ can be measured.\nIn the fitness sector, we have applications that monitor\n\
    how fit we are based on our daily activity level. Smartphone\naccelerometer data\
    \ can be used for activity detection by\napplying complex algorithms. For example,\
    \ we can measure\nthe number of steps taken and the amount of exercise done\n\
    by using fitness trackers. Fitness trackers are available in the\nmarket as wearables\
    \ to monitor the fitness level of an indi-\nvidual. In addition, gym apparatus\
    \ can be fitted with sensors\nto count the number of times an exercise is performed.\
    \ For\nexample, a smart mat [98] can count the number of exercise\nsteps performed\
    \ on it. This is implemented using pressure\nsensors on the mat and then by analyzing\
    \ the patterns of\npressure, and the shape of the contact area.\n9.5. Smart Environment\
    \ and Agriculture. Environmental\nparameters such as temperature and humidity\
    \ are important\nfor agricultural production. Sensors are used by farmers in\n\
    the field to measure such parameters and this data can be\nused for efficient\
    \ production. One application is automated\nirrigation according to weather conditions.\n\
    Production using greenhouses [99] is one of the main\napplications of IoT in agriculture.\
    \ Environmental parameters\nmeasured in terms of temperature, soil information,\
    \ and\nhumidity are measured in real time and sent to a server for\nanalysis.\
    \ The results are then used to improve crop quality and\nyield.\nPesticide residues\
    \ in crop production are detected using\nan Acetylcholinesterase biosensor [100].\
    \ This data is saved\nand analyzed for extracting useful information such as the\n\
    sample size, time, location, and amount of residues. We can\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\n21\nthus maintain the quality of the crop. Moreover,\
    \ a QR code\ncan be used to uniquely identify a carton of farm produce.\nConsumers\
    \ can scan the QR code and check the amount\nof pesticides in it (via a centralized\
    \ database) online before\nbuying.\nAir pollution is an important concern today\
    \ because it is\nchanging the climate of the earth and degrading air quality.\n\
    Vehicles cause a lot of air pollution. An IoT application\nproposed by Manna et\
    \ al. [39] monitors air pollution on the\nroads. It also tracks vehicles that\
    \ cause an undue amount of\npollution. Electrochemical toxic gas sensors can also\
    \ be used\nto measure air pollution. Vehicles are identified by RFID tags.\nRFID\
    \ readers are placed on both sides of the road along with\nthe gas sensors. With\
    \ this approach it is possible to identify\nand take action against polluting\
    \ vehicles.\n9.6. Supply Chain and Logistics. IoT tries to simplify real\nworld\
    \ processes in business and information systems [101].\nThe goods in the supply\
    \ chain can be tracked easily from\nthe place of manufacture to the final places\
    \ of distribution\nusing sensor technologies such as RFID and NFC. Real\ntime\
    \ information is recorded and analyzed for tracking.\nInformation about the quality\
    \ and usability of the product can\nalso be saved in RFID tags attached with the\
    \ shipments.\nBo and Guangwen [102] explain an information transmis-\nsion system\
    \ for supply chain management, which is based\non the Internet of Things. RFID\
    \ tags uniquely identify a\nproduct automatically and a product information network\n\
    is created to transmit this information in real time along\nwith location information.\
    \ This system helps in automatic\ncollection and analysis of all the information\
    \ related to supply\nchain management, which may help examine past demand\nand\
    \ come up with a forecast of future demand. Supply chain\ncomponents can get access\
    \ to real time data and all of this\ninformation can be analyzed to get useful\
    \ insights. This will\nin the long run improve the performance of supply chain\n\
    systems.\n9.7. Energy Conservation. The smart grid is information and\ncommunication\
    \ technology enabled modern electricity gen-\neration, transmission, distribution,\
    \ and consumption system\n[103].\nTo make electric power generation, transmission,\
    \ and\ndistribution smart, the concept of smart grids adds intel-\nligence at\
    \ each step and also allows the two-way flow of\npower (back from the consumer\
    \ to the supplier). This can\nsave a lot of energy and help consumers better understand\n\
    the flow of power and dynamic pricing. In a smart grid,\npower generation is distributed.\
    \ There are sensors deployed\nthroughout the system to monitor everything. It\
    \ is actually a\ndistributed network of microgrids [104]. Microgrids generate\n\
    power to meet demands of local sites and transmit back\nthe surplus energy to\
    \ the central grid. Microgrids can also\ndemand energy from the central grid in\
    \ case of a shortfall.\nTwo-way flow of power also benefits consumers, who are\n\
    also using their own generated energy occasionally (say, solar,\nor wind power);\
    \ the surplus power can be transmitted back so\nthat it is not wasted. The user\
    \ will also get paid for that power.\nSome of the IoT applications in a smart\
    \ grid are online\nmonitoring of transmission lines for disaster prevention and\n\
    efficient use of power in smart homes by having a smart meter\nfor monitoring\
    \ energy consumption [105].\nSmart meters read and analyze consumption patterns\
    \ of\npower at regular and peak load times. This information is\nthen sent to\
    \ the server and also made available to the user. The\ngeneration is then set\
    \ according to the consumption patterns.\nIn addition, the user can adjust her/his\
    \ use so as to reduce\ncosts. Smart power appliances can leverage this information\n\
    and operate when the prices are low.\n10. Design Considerations in an IoT System\n\
    Now, that we have profiled most of the IoT technologies, let\nus look at some\
    \ of the design considerations for designing a\npractical IoT network.\nThe first\
    \ consideration is the design of the sensors. Even\nthough there might not be\
    \ much of a choice regarding\nthe sensors, there is definitely a lot of choice\
    \ regarding\nthe processing and networking capabilities that are bundled\nalong\
    \ with the sensors. Our choices range from small sub-\nmW boards meant for sensor\
    \ motes to Arduino or Atom\nboards that consume 300–500 mW of power. This choice\n\
    depends on the degree of analytics and data preprocessing\nthat we want to perform\
    \ at the sensor itself. Secondly, there\nis an issue of logistics also. To create\
    \ a sub-mW board, we\nneed board design expertise, and this might not be readily\n\
    available. Hence, it might be advisable to bundle a sensor with\ncommercially\
    \ available embedded processor kits.\nThe next important consideration is communication.\
    \ In\nIoT nodes, power is the most dominant issue. The power\nrequired to transmit\
    \ and receive messages is a major fraction\nof the overall power, and as a result\
    \ a choice of the networking\ntechnology is vital. The important factors that\
    \ we need\nto consider are the distance between the sender and the\nreceiver,\
    \ the nature of obstacles, signal distortion, ambient\nnoise, and governmental\
    \ regulations. Based on these key\nfactors, we need to choose a given wireless\
    \ networking\nprotocol. For example, if we just need to communicate\ninside a\
    \ small building, we can use Zigbee, whereas if we\nneed communication in a smart\
    \ city, we should choose\nSigfox or LoraWAN. In addition, often there are significant\n\
    constraints on the frequency and the power that can be spent\nin transmission.\
    \ These limitations are mainly imposed by\ngovernment agencies. An apt decision\
    \ needs to be made by\ntaking all of these factors into account.\nLet us then\
    \ come to the middleware. The first choice that\nneeds to be made is to choose\
    \ between an open source mid-\ndleware such as FiWare or a proprietary solution.\
    \ There are\npros and cons of both. It is true that open source middleware\nis\
    \ in theory more flexible; however, they may have limited\nsupport for IoT devices.\
    \ We ideally want a middleware\nsolution to interoperate with all kinds of communication\n\
    protocols and devices; however, that might not be the case.\nHence, if we need\
    \ strict compatibility with certain devices and\nprotocols, a proprietary solution\
    \ is better. Nevertheless, open\nsource offerings have cost advantages and are\
    \ sometimes\neasier to deploy. We also need to choose the communication\n22\n\
    Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nprotocol and ensure that it is\
    \ compatible with the firewalls\nin the organizations involved. In general choosing\
    \ a protocol\nbased on HTTP is the best from this point of view. We also\nneed\
    \ to choose between TCP and UDP. UDP is always better\nfrom the point of view\
    \ of power consumption. Along with\nthese considerations, we also need to look\
    \ at options to store\nsensor data streams, querying languages, and support for\n\
    generating dynamic alerts.\nFinally, let us consider the application layer. Most\
    \ IoT\nframeworks provide significant amount of support for cre-\nating the application\
    \ layer. This includes data mining, data\nprocessing, and visualization APIs.\
    \ Creating mashups and\ndashboards of data is nowadays very easy to do given the\n\
    extensive support provided by IoT frameworks. Nevertheless,\nhere the tradeoff\
    \ is between the features provided and the\nresources that are required. We do\
    \ not need a very heavy\nframework if we do not desire a lot of features. This\
    \ call needs\nto be taken by the application developers.\n11. Conclusion\nIn this\
    \ survey paper we presented a survey of the current\ntechnologies used in the\
    \ IoT domain as of 2016. Currently,\nthis field is in a very nascent stage. The\
    \ technologies in\nthe core infrastructure layers are showing signs of maturity.\n\
    However, a lot more needs to happen in the areas of IoT\napplications and communication\
    \ technologies. These fields\nwill definitely mature and impact human life in\
    \ inconceivable\nways over the next decade.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors\

    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of
    ThingsSmart homeHolistic frameworkSmart grid 1. Introduction With the expected
    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”
    “Smart Home” “Smart Grid” 919 Query 2 “Wireless Sensor Network” “Home Automation”

    Home” “Smart Grid” 1050 Query 6 “IoT” “Home Automation” “Smart Grid” 747 Only
    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution

    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave

    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave

    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities

    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability

    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    Internet of things (IoT) is a promising technology which provides efficient and
    reliable solutions towards the modernization of several domains. IoT based solutions
    are being developed to automatically maintain and monitor agricultural farms with
    minimal human involvement. The article presents many aspects of technologies involved
    in the domain of IoT in agriculture. It explains the major components of IoT based
    smart farming. A rigorous discussion on network technologies used in IoT based
    agriculture has been presented, that involves network architecture and layers,
    network topologies used, and protocols. Furthermore, the connection of IoT based
    agriculture systems with relevant technologies including cloud computing, big
    data storage and analytics has also been presented. In addition, security issues
    in IoT agriculture have been highlighted. A list of smart phone based and sensor
    based applications developed for different aspects of farm management has also
    been presented. Lastly, the regulations and policies made by several countries
    to standardize IoT based agriculture have been presented along with few available
    success stories. In the end, some open research issues and challenges in IoT agriculture
    field have been presented. Topic: New Technologies for Smart Farming 4.0: Research

    IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and its relevant
    market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration of multiple
    devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal and external
    states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT has become the
    megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the whole business
    spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity of end devices,
    system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple applications
    such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic congestion
    industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work has been
    done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming solutions
    [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by examining
    multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with the advancement
    of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists and technologists
    are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer are facing such as
    shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues [6], [7]. State-of-the-art
    IoT technologies have detected all these issues and provide solutions to increase
    productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made on wireless sensors networks
    enable us to collect data from sensing devices and send it to the main servers
    [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information about different environmental
    condition to monitor the whole system properly. Monitoring the environmental conditions
    or crop productivity is not only the factor for the evaluation of crop but there
    are many other factors which effect the crops’ productivity, e.g. field management,
    soil and crop monitoring, movement of an unwanted object, attacks of wild animals,
    and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover, IoT provides a well-organized scheduling
    of restricted resources which makes sure that the best use of IoT enhances the
    productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram showing the agricultural trends
    which provide easy and cost effective interactions through a secure and unblemished
    connectivity across individual Greenhouse, Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring.
    Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks using the wireless devices enable real
    time crop and animal monitoring. The figure shows that two sensor kits (Libelium
    Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit)
    have been implemented which monitor the soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature,
    humidity, productivity, and air flow. While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal
    health, fertility, feeding, ruminating and resting. The agricultural servers,
    gateways, and agriculture database play an important role to store agriculture
    records and provide on demand agricultural services to authorized users. FIGURE
    1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole, in agriculture field there are multiple
    applications, protocols and prototypes. IoT agriculture research trends include
    network platform, network architecture, applications, security, and challenges
    among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many countries and organizations over globe
    different IoT policies and guidelines have been implemented in agriculture field.
    However in IoT agricultural environment a reasonable amount of work has been done
    and there is a need of thorough study on IoT in agriculture context to understand
    the current research status. To transform agriculture technologies via IoT innovation
    this paper analyzes various issues and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research
    as a contribution following IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature:
    Present major components of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies
    in Section II. Section III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture
    of IoT that involves network architecture and layers, network topologies used;
    and devices and protocols used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains
    and relevant smart phone and sensor based applications have been discussed in
    Section IV. The security and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been
    discussed in Section V. The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI
    that provides the details related to top technology industries investing in this
    area. The IoT agricultural policies made by different countries for the standardization
    of IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section VII. This section also
    presents few success stories in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges
    to improve IoT based agricultural technologies from many aspects have been presented
    in Section VIII. SECTION II. Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT
    Based Smart Farming A. Major Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart
    farming consist of four major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major
    components of IoT based smart farming. Show All These four major components are
    physical structure, data acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The
    physical structure is the most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid
    any unwanted happening. Whole system is designed in such a way which controls
    the sensors, actuators, and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil
    sensing, temperature sensing, weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing.
    Similarly devices perform many control functions like, node discovery, device
    identification and naming services etc. All these functions are performed by any
    device or sensor which is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling
    operation is performed by any remote device or a computer which is connected through
    the Internet. Data Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely:
    IoT data acquisition and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition
    component consists of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT), Websocket, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can
    be used for the implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data
    acquisition ZigBee, WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS
    protocols have been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are
    image or video processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining
    as shown in Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be
    added that may work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists
    of two main features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves
    three main application in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field
    Monitoring, and Green house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock
    via multiple sensors which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like
    temperature, heart rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications
    intend to report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature,
    humidity, gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring
    [12], [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Metrics Abstract: Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) require
    latency-aware computation for real-time application processing. In IoT environments,
    connected things generate a huge amount of data, which are generally referred
    to as big data. Data generated from IoT devices are generally processed in a cloud
    infrastructure because of the on-demand services and scalability features of the
    cloud computing paradigm. However, processing IoT application requests on the
    cloud exclusively is not an efficient solution for some IoT applications, especially
    time-sensitive ones. To address this issue, Fog computing, which resides in between
    cloud and IoT devices, was proposed. In general, in the Fog computing environment,
    IoT devices are connected to Fog devices. These Fog devices are located in close
    proximity to users and are responsible for intermediate computation and storage.
    One of the key challenges in running IoT applications in a Fog computing environment
    are resource allocation and task scheduling. Fog computing research is still in
    its infancy, and taxonomy-based investigation into the requirements of Fog infrastructure,
    platform, and applications mapped to current research is still required. This
    survey will help the industry and research community synthesize and identify the
    requirements for Fog computing. This paper starts with an overview of Fog computing
    in which the definition of Fog computing, research trends, and the technical differences
    between Fog and cloud are reviewed. Then, we investigate numerous proposed Fog
    computing architectures and describe the components of these architectures in
    detail. From this, the role of each component will be defined, which will help
    in the deployment of Fog computing. Next, a taxonomy of Fog computing is proposed
    by considering the requirements of the Fog computing paradigm. We also discuss
    existing research works and gaps in resource allocation and scheduling, fault
    tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microser... (Show More) Taxonomy of

    Individuals and organizations are increasingly becoming dependent on computers
    and smart devices to deal with daily tasks. These devices are generating data
    via various sensors and applications. As a result, organizations are generating
    and storing huge amounts of data on a regular basis [1]. After the proliferation
    of IoT, data generated by sensors has increased enormously. With this sudden increase
    in the volume of data being produced and inability of conventional databases to
    process various forms of structured and unstructured data, big data analytics
    has attained great attention in recent years. Every organization is now prioritizing
    the analysis of collected data to extract useful insights in order to make important
    decisions [2]. Nowadays, organizations need a dynamic IT infrastructure because
    of the shift to cloud computing due to its accessibility, scalability, and pay-per-use
    features. The most common services provided by the cloud are known as Software
    as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service
    (IaaS), all of which are heading towards Anything as a Service (XaaS) [3]. However,
    data generated from billions of sensors, referred to as big data, cannot be transferred
    and processed in the cloud. In addition, some IoT applications need to be processed
    faster than the cloud’s current capability. This problem can be solved by using
    the Fog computing paradigm, which harnesses the processing power of devices located
    near users (idle computing power) to support utilization of storage, processing,
    and networking at the edge [4]. Fog computing is a decentralized computing concept,
    which does not exclusively rely on any central component like cloud computing
    [5], [6]. It is able to overcome the high latency problem of the cloud by using
    idle resources of various devices near users. However, Fog computing relies on
    the cloud to do complex processing. Unlike cloud computing, Fog computing is a
    decentralized computing concept, where the many devices around us, which have
    computation capacity, are utilized. Currently, even a low- specification smartphone
    has processing capacity, sometimes with multiple cores. Hence, many devices like
    smartphones, switches, routers, base stations, and other network management devices
    equipped with processing power and storage capacity can act as Fog devices. The
    resources of these devices are idle outside of peak hours. Many research issues
    relating to Fog computing are emerging due to its ubiquitous connectivity and
    heterogeneous organization. In the Fog computing paradigm, key issues are the
    requirements and the deployment of Fog computing environment. This is because
    the devices that exist in Fog environments are heterogeneous: therefore, the question
    that arises is how will Fog computing tackle the new challenges of resource management
    and failure handling in such a heterogeneous environment? Hence, it is necessary
    to investigate the very basic requirements for all other related aspects such
    as deployment issues, simulations, resource management, fault tolerance, and services.
    Several reviews [5], [7]–[12] have been done on Fog computing. Here, we present
    the focus and survey domains of these review works in brief. Similar concepts
    of Fog computing, definitions, application scenarios, and numerous issues are
    described by one study [7]. Hu et al. [8] presented the hierarchical architecture
    of Fog computing and technologies like computing, communication, and storage technologies,
    namely resource management, security, and privacy protection that support Fog
    deployment and application. Baccarelli et al. [9] surveyed Fog computing and the
    Internet of Everything (IoE) with an integrated point of view of Fog computing
    and IoE. Varshney and Simmhan [10] reviewed various dimensions of application
    characteristics, system architecture, and platform abstractions of edge, Fog,
    and cloud ecosystems. Perera et al. [11] reviewed the Fog computing domain from
    the platform perspectives of developers and end users towards building a sustainable
    sensing infrastructure for smart city applications. Mahmud et al. [5] presented
    a taxonomy of Fog computing according to the identified challenges and its key
    features. The proposed taxonomy provides a classification of the existing works
    in Fog computing. Mouradian et al. [12] reviewed Fog architecture and algorithms
    based on six different evaluation criteria, namely heterogeneity, QoS management,
    scalability, mobility, federation, and interoperability. However, none of the
    studies had investigated taxonomy based on the requirements of infrastructure,
    platform, and application in Fog computing. Moreover, none of them comprehensively
    investigated fault tolerance, resource management, or microservices in Fog computing.
    We consider the aforementioned current issues and discuss these extensively and
    also highlight how cloud computing-related solutions could be employed in the
    Fog in some cases. The contributions of this review work can be summarized as
    follows: Present the research trends in Fog computing by investigating the number
    of published research works and search occurrences in Google Scholar. Review of
    several Fog computing architectures and presentation of a detailed architecture,
    as most of the previous researchers only presented high-level architecture. Present
    a taxonomy by considering the requirements of infrastructure, platform, and application
    in the Fog computing paradigm. Identify Fog computing research gaps in resource
    allocation and scheduling, fault tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microservices.
    Address the limitations of current research works and some open issues in infrastructure,
    platform, and applications. From this survey, the industry and research community
    will be able to gain insight into the requirements for building a Fog computing
    environment with a better understanding of resource management in the Fog. The
    remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II surveys definitions
    and research trends in Fog computing. A technical comparison between Fog and cloud
    paradigms presents in section III. Section IV discusses computing paradigms similar
    to Fog computing. Section V presents related works on Fog computing architecture
    and discusses the components of the Fog computing architecture. Section VI shows
    the taxonomy of Fog computing by reviewing its requirements. Section VII presents
    various application dimension of Fog computing. Section VIII discusses current
    state-of-the-art Fog computing technology. Section IX presents open issues and
    future research direction. Section X concludes the paper. SECTION II. Overview
    of Fog Computing The term ‘Fog computing’ was proposed in 2012 by researchers
    from Cisco Systems [13]. Processing application logic and data at the edge is
    not a new concept. The concept of Edge computation emerged around the 2000s [14],
    [15] and another similar concept, cloudlets, was introduced in 2009 [16]. Both
    Cloudlets and Fog computing are the advancements of a similar concept, which revolves
    around processing at the edge level. While cloudlets are applied in the mobile
    network, Fog computing is applied to connected things such as IoT, which plays
    into the concept of IoT [17]. Fog is both a virtualized and non-virtualized computing
    paradigm that provides networking, storage, and computation services amid cloud
    servers and IoT devices [4], [13]. However, these services are not completely
    located at the network edge. The Fog is a distributed computing approach that
    mainly focuses on facilitating applications, which require low latency services
    [18], Fog computing also supports non-latency aware services. It is obvious that
    using idle computation resources near the users will improve overall service performance,
    if the volume of processing were not that high. A huge number of heterogeneous
    nodes will be connected to the Fog. These nodes include sensors and actuators
    among others [13]. Computation is performed in Fog devices when necessary and
    storage facilities are also available for a short period of time, at least in
    most Fog devices. Time-sensitive computation in the Fog is done without the involvement
    of third parties, and in most cases, is done by the Fog processing devices. According
    to Yi et al. [7], the Fog computing paradigm supports the running of new services
    or basic network functions and applications in a sandboxed environment similar
    to cloudlets. However, the subject is still a research challenge because the question
    of how the Fog will provide these service still remains. In addition, will the
    Fog have cloud service providers or will it be like a single entity as a whole?
    Figure 1 shows a basic model of Fog Computing. Fog devices, Fog servers, and gateways
    are the basic computation components in the Fog environment. Any device that has
    computation, networking, and storage capabilities can act as a Fog device. These
    devices include set-top boxes, switches, routers, base stations, proxy servers
    or any other computing device. Fog servers that manage several Fog devices and
    Fog gateways are responsible for translation services between heterogeneous devices
    in the Fog computing environment. Fog gateways also provide translation services
    between IoT, Fog, and cloud layers. New challenges in this emerging computing
    paradigm have emerged in the past couple of years. FIGURE 1. A model of Fog computing.
    Show All In this section, we discuss the various definitions of Fog computing
    and define Fog computing from our point of view. In addition, we discuss and analyze
    research trends in Fog computing. Finally, we compare the technical differences
    between Fog computing and cloud computing. A. Definition of Fog Computing Fog
    computing is a distributed computing paradigm where processing is done at the
    edge of the network with seamless integration of the cloud infrastructure. It
    enables a computing facility for IoT environments or other latency sensitive application
    environments. It is estimated that about 50 billion “things” will be connected
    to the Internet by 2020 [19]. Transferring all data from all connected devices
    for processing on the cloud will need massive amounts of bandwidth and storage.
    All devices are not connected to the controller via IP but connected by some other
    IoT industrial protocols. Because of this, a translation process is also needed
    for the processing or storing of information from IoT devices. Various researchers
    have defined Fog computing in different ways. Some examples are as follows: “Fog
    computing is a highly virtualized platform that provides compute, storage, and
    networking services between IoT devices and traditional cloud computing data centers,
    typically, but not exclusively located at the edge of network.” [13] “Fog computing
    is a scenario where a huge number of heterogeneous (wireless and sometimes autonomous)
    ubiquitous and decentralised devices communicate and potentially cooperate among
    them and with the network to perform storage and processing tasks without the
    intervention of third parties. These tasks can be for supporting basic network
    functions or new services and applications that run in a sandboxed environment.
    Users leasing part of their devices to host these services get incentives for
    doing so.” [20] “The term Fog computing or Edge Computing means that rather than
    hosting and working from a centralized cloud, Fog systems operate on network ends.
    It is a term for placing some processes and resources at the edge of the cloud,
    instead of establishing channels for cloud storage and utilization.” [21] The
    first definition of Fog computing was presented by Bonomi et al. [13], where they
    addressed the computing paradigm as a highly virtualized platform. However, some
    IoT devices such as smartphones are not virtualized but could also be a part of
    the Fog infrastructure, as some processing could still be done. According to Cisco
    [22], the Fog computing paradigm provides an ideal place to analyze most data
    near the devices that produce and act on that data instantaneously. The Fog is
    located near things that are able to process and act on the data generated. The
    devices that are within the Fog environment are known as Fog devices. These nodes
    can be deployed at any place with a connectivity to the network: on the power
    pole, on the factory floor, alongside the road, alongside the railway line, in
    a vehicle, inside a shopping mall, on an oil rig, etc. A device that has processing,
    storage, memory, and network capability can act as a Fog device. Although the
    Fog extends the cloud, technically it resides in between the cloud and IoT devices
    and handles processing and storage tasks in close proximity to the user. Yi et
    al. [7] stated that the definition given by Vaquero and Rodero-Merino [20] is
    debatable and a definition that can distinguish clearly between Fog computing
    and other related computing paradigms is still required. The definition given
    by IBM [21] represents Edge and Fog computing as the same computing paradigm.
    According to Shi et al. [23], Fog computing focuses more on the infrastructure
    side while edge computing focuses more on the things’ side. Furthermore, Edge
    computing is not spontaneously associated with any cloud-based services such as
    SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS [5]. In brief, Table 1 summarizes Fog definitions provided
    by various research works. TABLE 1 Summary of Fog Computing Definitions Considering
    the above definitions, we define Fog computing as follows: Fog computing is a
    distributed computing platform where most of the processing will be done by virtualized
    and non-virtualized end or edge devices. It is also associated with the cloud
    for non-latency-aware processing and long-term storage of useful data by residing
    in between users and the cloud. In our definition, we considered all devices with
    computing and storage capacity as Fog devices and also more precisely identified
    the role of the cloud in the Fog computing environment. B. Fog Computing Research
    Trends Growing attention towards processing data closer to the users has been
    observed among industries and the academia in the past few years. Handling IoT-generated
    data at the edge level will help improve overall processing time. In this section,
    we investigate Fog and other related technological trends for the past few years
    in the research community. According to the Gartner hype cycle, in July 2017 [24],
    the peak emerging technology is the smart home, which would perform better with
    the incorporation of the Fog computing environment. A Hype Cycle [24] represents
    common patterns of new trending technologies. Fog computing can also enable latency-aware
    smart home services in a more efficient and convenient way, especially for emergency
    response smart home applications. According to the Gartner hype cycle demonstration,
    some other influencing technologies include virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles,
    IoT platforms, smart robots, edge computing, and smart workspaces, which are required
    to support latency-aware applications. All these mentioned technologies could
    benefit from the support of the Fog computing paradigm due to latency sensitiveness,
    connectivity to the cloud, and edge-level data processing capability. Except for
    the autonomous vehicle technology, all other aforementioned technologies will
    reach the market adoption threshold in the next 10 years. Besides the hype cycle
    analysis, we analyzed the search occurrence of Fog and other related technologies
    in Google Scholar. In addition, the number of papers available in different digital
    libraries related to the Fog was also analyzed. Google Scholar search occurrences
    of various similar technologies to Fog were investigated in the past few years,
    as presented in Figure 2. According to the data, edge computing is the topmost
    searched item in Google Scholar compared to other similar technologies. However,
    the search trend decreased by more than three times in the past eight years for
    edge computing. Mobile cloud computing and mobile edge computing are the other
    two top-searched computing paradigm after edge computing. The lowest trend observed
    was for dew computing and Fog dew computing. While the trend for edge computing
    is decreasing, Fog computing related to scholarly searches is increasing year
    by year, and has increased by 2.5 times from 2010 to 2017. This shows that Fog
    computing is the fastest growing research area in academia and will have a great
    impact on the industry as well. FIGURE 2. Search occurrence of similar technologies
    like the Fog in Google Scholar. Show All Fog computing topic search in the Web
    of Science shows that the number of scholarly articles has more than doubled between
    2015 and 2016, as per Figure 3. The first paper with ‘Fog computing’ in its title
    was published in 2012. Since then, about 564 journal and conference articles have
    been published on this topic in the four major digital libraries (Web of Science,
    Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and ACM), as presented in Figure 4. Cloud computing
    first emerged in 2008 [25]. This shows that Fog computing publications have dramatically
    increased, as no study in this area was seen in the couple of years following
    the introduction of cloud computing research in 2008 (see Figure 5). FIGURE 3.
    No. of Fog computing-related papers in the Web of Science (as Feb 2018). Show
    All FIGURE 4. Number of publications with ”Fog computing” in the title in the
    four major digital libraries. Show All FIGURE 5. Published articles with the title
    cloud computing in the Web of Science. Show All From our observation, it is obvious
    that the interest in Fog computing research is rapidly increasing. Idle resources
    in the form of devices near users can be utilized within the Fog computing concept.
    Thus, a clear direction to market the adoption and technological development of
    Fog deployment has emerged. SECTION III. Difference Between Fog and Cloud Computing
    Paradigm Fog computing architectures are based on Fog clusters where multiple
    Fog devices participate to cooperate with the processing. On the other hand, datacenters
    are the main physical components of clouds. Because of this, cloud computing has
    high operational costs and energy consumption. By comparison, energy consumption
    and operation costs in the Fog computing paradigm is low. The Fog is located closer
    to the user, so the distance between users and Fog devices could be one or a few
    hops, which is also agreed by Hu et al. [8]. However, according to Mahmud et al.
    [26], the distance between users to the Fog is one or two hops. Again, Luan et
    al. [27] argued that the distance should be one hop with wireless connectivity.
    Yet, all agreed with the distance between the users to the cloud, which is a multi-hop
    distance. Due to the distance, communication latency for the cloud is always high
    compared to the Fog. The cloud is a more centralized approach while the Fog is
    a more distributed approach based on geographical orchestration [26]. Real-time
    Interaction is not possible for the cloud due to its high latency, but this problem
    can be easily resolved by Fog computing. On the other hand, the rate of failure
    in the Fog is high because of wireless connectivity, decentralized management,
    and power failure [26], [28]–[30]. Most devices in Fog environments will be connected
    wirelessly since smart gadgets and handheld devices will be participating in Fog
    systems [31]. These devices, and other network management devices, are mostly
    decentralized. These devices could fail when software is not managed correctly.
    Users may not be aware of malicious software that could lead to device failure.
    Moreover, Fog processing could fail in other cases as well, for example, each
    Fog device is responsible for performing its own application processing. So, the
    IoT application processing in a Fog device always takes second priority. If the
    Fog device is fully utilized by the application of the device itself, then it
    will fail to do any Fog processing. Hence, the scheduling of applications and
    resources in the Fog is more complex. In addition, failure handling in the Fog
    is competitive because of power failure, which is only an issue because the devices
    run on battery power. Altogether, Table 2 shows the technical differences between
    the cloud and the Fog. TABLE 2 Technical Difference Between Fog and Cloud Definitely,
    it cannot be said that the Fog can replace the cloud. We cannot even conclude
    that the Fog is better than the cloud either, both contribute differently via
    fulfilling different perspectives and requirements. SECTION IV. Related Paradigms
    and Technologies Fog computing uses computing resources near underlying networks,
    located between the traditional cloud and edge devices, to provide better and
    faster application processing and services [13]. Several similar computing paradigms
    exist besides Fog computing such as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile-Edge
    Computing (MEC), Edge Computing, Dew Computing, and Fog-dew computing. In cloud
    computing, all IoT devices are directly connected to the cloud and computation
    totally depends on the cloud. However, all the above similar technologies do not
    exclusively depend on the cloud, but depend on some intermediate devices for computation;
    some of them do not even require a connection to the cloud. Figure 6 shows the
    high-level architecture of these technologies. FIGURE 6. High level architecture
    of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Edge Computing (EC),
    Dew Computing (DC), Fog Computing (FC) and Fog Dew Computing (FDC). Show All A.
    Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) Remote execution of offloaded mobile services is
    done with the support of MCC near end users [32], [33]. MCC overcomes the computational,
    energy, and storage resource limitation of smart mobile devices. Generally, a
    lightweight cloud server (cloudlet) is placed at the edge of the network [34]
    to overcome these issues. MCC is a mobile computing technology, which provides
    unrestricted functionality, mobility, and storage facility through heterogeneous
    network connectivity. This technology also provides unified elastic computing
    resources by following the pay-per-use model. It also provides access to data,
    application, and cloud via the Internet for mobile users. It is expected that
    this technology will be applied in education, urban and rural development, healthcare,
    and more realistic social networking in the future [32]. Nowadays, many computation-intensive
    applications are widely available, such as Augmented Reality, computer vision
    and graphics, speech recognition, machine learning, planning and decision-making,
    and natural language processing applications. However, simply designing powerful
    mobile devices will not meet the requirements for these applications [33]. Rather,
    the applications require edge processing as well as collaboration with the cloud
    for complex processing. Thus, mobile computing demands fundamental changes to
    cloud computing, for example, a low-latency middle tier, programming models to
    enable seamless remote execution, basic mobile cloud services such as presence
    services, cloud infrastructure optimization for mobile applications, memcache
    services, and so on [33]. The convergence of mobile cloud computing is predicated
    on a reliable, end-to-end network, and high bandwidth, which isdifficult to guarantee
    in harsh environments. One of the solutions to this deep-rooted problem is the
    VM-based cloudlets located at a closer location to the mobile device [34]. B.
    Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) MEC proposes the co-location of computing and storage
    resources at the base stations of cellular networks [35]. MEC could either be
    connected or disconnected to cloud datacenters in a remote location. Hence, MEC
    supports two- or three-tier hierarchical application deployments along with end
    mobile devices [36]. In a MEC ecosystem, a new device called the MEC server needs
    to be deployed near base station towers to provide processing and storage capabilities
    at the edge. Four participants are involved in this computing paradigm, which
    are the mobile end users, network operators, Internet infrastructure provider
    (InPs),and application service provider. Mobile end users are the main consumer
    of the system and request their service via user equipment (UE). Network operators
    manage and maintain the operation of base stations, mobile core network, and MEC
    servers. InPs maintain Internet connectivity and routers. Application service
    providers host the application services in the content delivery networks (CDN)
    or within a data centers. Processing of requests from the UE will search out the
    closest MEC. The MEC server is capable of processing user request instead of forwarding
    it to remote Internet services. In a case where it is not possible to process
    or complete a request at the MEC sever; the request will be forwarded to remote
    CDNs or data centers [35]. According to Klas [36], MEC is the evolution of mobile
    base stations. It is a natural development. It is a collaborative deployment of
    telecommunication and IT networking. This computing paradigm enables new vertical
    business segments and services to individual end users and enterprise consumers.
    Various services could be delivered through this computing paradigm including
    IoT, location services, augmented reality, caching service, video analytics, and
    local content distribution. It can deliver real-time low-latency access of local
    content or by caching content at the MEC server. However, the main limitation
    of this system is the installation of the MEC server, which is specifically dedicated
    to MEC services. Scaling is another big issue with the increase in resource demand
    over time. C. Edge Computing Edge devices or edge servers provide computation
    facilities in Edge computing. In general, edge computing does not spontaneously
    associate with any types of cloud-based services and concentrates more on the
    IoT device side [23]. One study defined the edge as any network or computing resource
    near the path between cloud data centers and data sources [23]. Any smart device
    or sensor could have data sources but the edge is different. For example, a cloudlet
    and a micro datacenter is the edge of the mobile application and cloud, whereas
    the IoT gateway is the edge between IoT sensors and cloud. Similarly, if a cloud
    application is running on a smartphone, then the smartphone is the edge of the
    application and the cloud [37]. The main motivation of edge computing is that
    the computation should be done at a closer location to the data sources. In the
    edge computing concept, things are not only consuming data but also produce data
    by taking part in processing. Edge devices can perform computation task from the
    cloud besides requesting services and content. Data storage, computing offloading,
    processing, and caching will be done by an edge node. The edge device is also
    capable of distributing requests and providing service on behalf of the cloud
    to the users. In such scenarios, edge devices need to be well designed to meet
    privacy requirements, reliability measures, and security concerns [23]. D. Dew
    Computing (DC) In the current computing hierarchy, Dew Computing [38] is situated
    at the ground level of the cloud and Fog computing environment [39]. DC goes beyond
    the concept of service, storage, and network, to a sub-platform, which is based
    on a microservice concept for which its computing hierarchy is vertically distributed
    [39]. The DC approach facilitates resources such as sensors, tablets, and smartphones
    that are seamlessly connected to a network. Because of this, DC covers a wide
    range of ad-hoc-based networking technologies [39]. Skala et al. [39] argued that
    DC is much more useful in everyday life compared to Fog computing. Fog supports
    IoT-based applications, which demand less latency and real-time capability and
    a dynamic network configuration while DC is microservice concept and thus is not
    dependent on any centralized device, server, or cloud. They provide an example
    in which DC could be integrated into a smart traffic control system, where data
    collection and processing units will be located in between the traffic signals.
    These units generate a collective overview of the current traffic conditions.
    In such a way, a car with low fuel will be notified before entering heavy congestion,
    or a hybrid car will be informed of switching to conventional fuel before approaching
    the congestion. As a result, cars with less fuel will be rescued from unwanted
    situations and hybrid cars could reduce exhaust smoke densities significantly.
    Although the concept is microservice-based, the processing is completed in Fog
    devices. In the Fog computing concept, it is not crucial that applications must
    be dependent on the cloud or require the storing of results in the cloud. On the
    other hand, if such traffic processing information were stored, it would help
    strategic decision-making to improve traffic management. Dew computing is an emerging
    research area and its goal is to use the full potential of cloud and local resources
    [40]. E. Fog-Dew Computing In the architecture of Fog-dew computing, IoT devices
    need not have an active Internet connection while being connected to the community
    server. The community server will interact with the cloud and is responsible for
    providing services to the IoT devices [41]. Cloud computing always needs an Internet
    connection, which is the main drawback of the cloud. While the cloud is unable
    to serve users without an Internet connection, Fog-dew computing facilitates offline
    services without an Internet connection. However, there are some exceptions. For
    example, the navigation app, Waze, allows users to navigate offline. This feature
    was also recently added to Google Maps. In this case, a map information file for
    a specific area is downloaded to the user device and allows users to navigate
    during an offline state. Another example is Google Drive and Dropbox, where users
    can delete, create, and update files and folders in offline mode and then sync
    once the device is connected to the Internet. However, these services are not
    purely offline-we may not rely on the Internet directly but we cannot completely
    ignore Internet connection. The situation becomes more complex when a single user
    uses multiple offline devices alongside the complexity that arises in a multiuser
    environment. Such situations could be mitigated with the help of Fog-dew computing.
    In summary, in the Fog computing paradigm, IoT devices are connected to the cloud
    via Fog devices. Fog devices are connected to the cloud through the core network.
    Fog computing is a combination of MEC and MCC [7] but the main goal of all Fog-related
    paradigms is to perform processing at the edge. These related paradigms differ
    from each other based on Internet and cloud connectivity. Also, the amount of
    processing that needs to be done at the edge differs based on service requirements.
    Furthermore, the type of devices that will be used for computation and storage
    purposes is also another issue. In summary, Table 3 shows the characteristics
    of the above-discussed related computing paradigms along with the Fog computing
    paradigm. TABLE 3 Summary of Similar Technologies Like Fog SECTION V. Architecture
    of Fog Computing For market adoption and deployment, Fog computing must have a
    standard architecture. There is no available standard architecture to date. However,
    many research works have presented Fog computing architectures. In this section,
    we firstly discuss the high-level architecture of Fog computing. Furthermore,
    we summarize some proposed architectures for Fog computing. Finally, we present
    a detailed architecture for Fog computing with a comprehensive description of
    each component of the architecture. A. High-Level Architecture of Fog Computing
    In high-level architecture, the Fog computing paradigm has three different layers,
    as shown in Figure 7. The most important layer is the Fog layer. This layer consists
    of all intermediate computing devices. Traditional virtualization technologies
    can be used at this plane, similar to the cloud. However, considering the resource
    availability, employing container-based virtualization is more appropriate. This
    layer accumulates sensor-generated data from the IoT layer and sends an actuation-related
    request after processing. Although it seems that the big data problem is solved
    by processing generated data at the edge level, billions of devices will create
    big data issue. In fact, it is possible to employ small- and medium-scale big
    data processing at this level. Many research works have been undertaken to process
    big data in the Fog plane [47]–[53]. FIGURE 7. High level Fog computing architecture.
    Show All The bottommost layer is the IoT plane, which consists of all connected
    devices. The devices on this plane perform the sensing and actuation process.
    For time-sensitive applications, processing should be done on the Fog plane exclusively
    while the cloud can perform other processing that is not time-sensitive. However,
    the Fog layer will manage what needs to be sent to the cloud and what should not.
    The users are able to get services from both the Fog and cloud based on their
    request. However, the cloud plane will manage complex processing and storage.
    B. Various Proposed Architectures for Fog Computing Layered representation is
    the best way to represent Fog architecture. Many works have been done to quantify
    the layer-based concept of Fog architecture [4], [27], [54]–[58]. From our review,
    we found that researchers have proposed three [27], [56]–[58], four [55], five
    [4], and six [54] layers in the Fog architecture. Everyone has their own justifications
    for their claims. If we ignored the user plane, it is obvious that Fog architecture
    could be defined as three different levels from the high level. As we proceed
    to the more implementation-type level, the number of layers in the architecture
    would vary, giving rise to five [4] and six [54] levels in the Fog computing layer.
    Aazam and Huh [54] presented six different layers based on specific tasks. On
    the other hand, Dastjerdi et al. [4] defined five different layers based on network
    perspective. Other high-level architectures in Fog computing were also presented
    by various researchers including the hierarchical Fog architecture [59], [60],
    OpenFog architecture [61], Fog network architecture [62], Fog architecture for
    Internet of energy [9], Fog computing Architecture based on nervous system [63],
    and IFCIoT architecture [64]. After reviewing the literature stated above, we
    define the components of Fog computing architecture, which is presented in the
    following subsection. C. Components of Fog Computing Architecture Fog computing
    architecture consists of several layers. Each layer and its components are shown
    in Figure 8. In this subsection, we discuss various components of the Fog computing
    architecture. The components are divided into several groups based on their functionality,
    which is defined as the layer. These functionalities will enable IoT devices to
    communicate with various Fog devices, servers, gateways, and the cloud. A detailed
    explanation of each layer is given below, where a smart transportation use case
    is considered in the explanation. FIGURE 8. Components of Fog computing architecture.
    Show All 1) Physical Layer The basic data source for Fog computing is the various
    forms of data emitted by the sensors [57]. These data could be generated from
    smart devices, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, smart homes, the CCTV surveillance
    system, traffic monitoring system, self-driving vehicles, and so on. For instance,
    if we wanted to implement a smart traffic management and monitoring system, we
    need to get updated traffic conditions of all roads from various sensors, roadside
    devices, and cameras, which will help manage traffic signals. It is also necessary
    to predict future traffic demand by collecting data from various GPS sensors.
    Besides physical sensors, the role of virtual sensors is also important [54],
    if a road accident occurred, it would not be possible to decide using just a single
    sensor whether the road should be blocked or traffic should keep going. The road
    might have one or more lanes- one lane may be affected by this occurrence while
    another lane could enable the traffic flow to continue, but the traffic handling
    capacity will be decreased due to this occurrence. In this case, a virtual sensor
    might help obtain an immediate decision on road conditions, traffic multiplexing,
    and traffic rerouting. Hence, the physical layer consists of physical and virtual
    sensors, where any data generation device could fall into any of these groups.
    2) Fog Device, Server, and Gateway Layer The Fog device, Fog server, or Fog gateway
    could be a standalone device or an IoT device [57], [59], [62]. However, it is
    obvious that the Fog server should have a higher configuration than the Fog device
    and gateway since it manages several Fog devices. Various factors are involved
    so that the Fog server can run. These include its role, hardware configuration,
    connectivity, number of devices it can manage, and so on. Whether the Fog server
    is distinct or part of an IoT device is defined by its role. A group of physical
    and virtual sensors will be connected to a Fog device. Similarly, a group of Fog
    devices will be connected to a Fog server. In this context, the Fog server should
    have higher processing and storage capacity compared to the Fog device. A specific
    cluster of Fog devices, which are connected to the same server, can communicate
    with each other when required. In the smart transportation use case, some application
    processing might depend on other Fog clusters. For example, if an application
    needed to find a fuel-efficient route, it might need information about other sensor
    clusters or Fog device clusters. To reach an appropriate decision, processing
    needs to be done in multiple Fog devices and servers. The Fog server and device
    layer are responsible for managing and maintaining information on hardware configuration,
    storage configuration, and connectivity of device and servers. This layer also
    manages the computation requirements requested by various applications. Computation
    requirements depend on data flow and the total number of IoT devices connected
    to the Fog device, as well as the total number of Fog devices connected to the
    Fog server. The communication between several Fog servers is maintained by this
    layer. For example, a Cisco IOx-supported 800 series router can be used as a Fog
    device and Cisco Fog data service devices can be used as the Fog server [65],
    [66]. 3) Monitoring Layer The monitoring layer always keeps track of the system
    performance and resources [54], services, and responses. System monitoring components
    help choose the appropriate resources during operation. Various applications run
    in smart transportation system scenarios. Therefore, it is obvious that a situation
    could arise when resource availability will be negative for computation or storage
    on a Fog device. A similar case could happen to the Fog server. To tackle these
    kinds of situations, the Fog device and servers will seek help from other peers.
    Thus, the system monitoring component will help decide such things efficiently.
    The resource demand component monitors current resource demand and can predict
    future demand for resources based on current resource usage and user activities.
    In this way, the system will be able to deal with any awkward situations where
    resource outage might occur. Performance prediction monitors can predict Fog computing
    performance based on system load and resource availability. This component is
    required to maintain appropriate QoS requirements in service level agreements.
    If SLA violation occurs frequently, then the cost of the system for the provider
    will be increased because of the penalty. Although performance prediction cannot
    eliminate this issue completely, it will be able to minimize overall SLA violation
    by predicting the performance and usage of the system. 4) Pre and Post-Processing
    Layer This layer contains multiple components, which specifically work on basic
    and advanced data analysis. At this level, acquired data are analyzed and filtered,
    and data trimming and reconstruction are also done when necessary. After processing
    the data, the data flow component decides whether the data needs to be stored
    locally or should be sent to the cloud for long-term storage [59]. The main challenge
    in Fog computing is to process data at the edge and minimize the volume of data
    that needs to be stored; this phenomenon is referred to as stream processing.
    In the smart transportation system use case, data will be generated from many
    sensors. These generated data will be analyzed and filtered in real time to get
    insight into the generated data. All generated data might not have any use. In
    some cases, it would not even be a good idea to store all generated data. As an
    example, if data is generated from a sensor each second, the mean value of data
    within a minute or within an hour may be stored depending on application requirements.
    Data can be trimmed in this way and a vast amount of storage space can be saved.
    In another case, if the difference among data values in some period of time is
    not that big, but might affect performance, then less numbers of reading within
    a minute can be taken. In such a way, it will be possible to filter a vast amount
    of generated data. Although the accuracy may not be 100%, application requirements
    might still be fulfilled to some extent. Data reconstruction is one of the components
    of this layer. This module takes care of faulty and incomplete data generated
    by the sensors. Similarly, if one or more sensors fail during operation, this
    component will reconstruct the data based on the data generation pattern to prevent
    interruption or any other application failure. 5) Storage Layer The storage module
    is responsible for storing data through storage virtualization. The data backup
    component ensures availability of data and mitigates the loss of data. In the
    storage virtualization concept, a pool of storage devices connected by a network
    acts as a single storage device, which is easier to manage and maintain. One of
    the key benefits of storage virtualization is to provide enterprise-class functionality
    using less-expensive storage or commodity hardware. Thus, the storage layer facilitates
    storage virtualization in order to minimize the complexity of the storage system.
    In a system, storage might fail at any point during system operation [67]. Therefore,
    it is crucial to backup important data to mitigate any unwanted situations. The
    data backup module in this layer takes care of periodic or customized data backup
    schemes. 6) Resource Management Layer The components in this layer maintain the
    allocation of resources, and scheduling, and deal with energy saving issues. The
    reliability component maintains the reliability of application scheduling and
    resource allocation. Scalability ensures the scalability of Fog resources during
    peak hours where resource demand is high. The cloud deals with horizontal scalability
    while Fog computing aims to provide both horizontal and vertical scalability [9].
    There are many distributed system resources for network, processing, and storage.
    This is a critical issue for distributed resources, which use application processing.
    Thus, resource allocation, deallocation, and reallocation will happen in which
    the resource allocation component manages and maintains resource allocation related
    issues. Another vital issue is that many applications will run in the Fog computing
    environment simultaneously. Hence, proper scheduling of these applications is
    required. The application scheduling component takes care of these applications
    based on various objectives. This layer also has energy saving components, which
    manage resources in an energy-efficient manner. Energy efficiency also positively
    affects the environment and helps minimize operational cost. Reliability components
    handle the requirement for the reliability of a system based on various reliability
    measures and metrics. Fog computing is a complex system that needs to take care
    of all IoT devices, Fog devices, and the cloud. Therefore, a device or connection
    might fail at any level, so reliability management is an important issue. 7) Security
    Layer All security-related issues such as encryption of communications and secure
    data storage will be maintained by the components in this layer, which also preserve
    the privacy of Fog users. Fog computing is intended to be deployed as a form of
    utility computing like cloud computing. However, in the cloud computing concept,
    the user connects to the cloud for services, but in the Fog computing concept
    the user will connect to the Fog infrastructure for the services while the Fog
    middleware will manage and maintain communications with the cloud. Hence, a user
    intending to connect to a service must be authorized by the provider. Therefore,
    the authentication component in the security layer processes authentication requests
    from users, so they can connect to the Fog computing service environment [27].
    To maintain security, it is crucial to maintain encryption between communications,
    so that security breaches by outsiders will not occur. The encryption component
    encrypts all connections from and to IoT devices and to the cloud. Fog computing
    components are mostly connected via a wireless connection, so security concerns
    are crucial. Some services in a smart city or smart house privacy are also an
    issue because of the involvement of user-related data in these types of systems.
    The Fog computing paradigm should not disclose user information without their
    consent. In the current age, the majority of users normally accept the security
    policy of the provider without reading it. Thus, special consideration of privacy
    should be undertaken for such services that involve user-related critical information.
    8) Application Layer Although the Fog was developed to serve IoT applications
    [58], several other applications based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and CDN
    also support Fog computing. Any application that has latency-aware characteristics
    will be able to take advantage of Fog computing. This includes any type of utility-based
    service that could fit within Fog computing by providing better service quality
    and cost-effectiveness. For example, Augmented Reality-based applications should
    adopt Fog computing because of its nature. It is clear that Augmented Reality
    will transform the modern world in the near future. The needs of real-time processing
    for Augmented Reality applications can be addressed by Fog computing, which can
    maintain continuous improvement of Augmented Reality-related services. SECTION
    VI. Taxonomy of Fog Computing The Fog computing taxonomy is presented in Figure
    9. This taxonomy is derived by considering existing literature and the overall
    viewpoint on Fog computing. The proposed taxonomy focuses on the requirements
    perspective for infrastructure, platform, and application. FIGURE 9. Taxonomy
    of Fog computing based on the requirements of infrastructure, platform, and applications.
    Show All Firstly, by considering infrastructure, we identify infrastructure and
    network requirements, and the types of devices in a Fog computing environment.
    Secondly, for platform resource allocation and scheduling, security and privacy
    concern, service requirements, management, and multitenancy were determined. Finally,
    we defined application requirements, user requirements, and application modeling
    taxonomy for Fog computing. This taxonomy will help the research community and
    enterprises to gain better understanding and insight into the real-world deployment
    of Fog computing requirements, architecture, and devices. Figure 9 shows the taxonomy
    of Fog computing. A detailed description of each branch of the taxonomy is presented
    in this section. A. Infrastructure Fog computing infrastructure requirements depend
    on the network, devices, and their requirements. All Fog devices, network devices,
    and gateways existing in the Fog environment that participates in computation
    are also part of the Fog infrastructure. Infrastructure denotes the physical components
    of the Fog environment. 1) Infrastructure Requirements The many connected tiny
    devices are the primary elements in a Fog computing environment. These devices
    are located everywhere and help to connect all things around us. It is estimated
    that the world will see 50 billion handheld devices by 2020. Beside these devices,
    a huge number of sensors and actuators will also be put in place. Therefore, a
    proper infrastructural facility is needed to support this vast computing environment
    [20]. An example of how the number of sensors is increasing day by day is given
    in The Economist report titled, “Augmented Business”, which describes the implant
    sensors on cattle ears that could help to monitor their activity, health, and
    movements. This could help increase overall productivity. The implant of sensors
    affixed in one cow produces about 200 MB of information in a year. In another
    example, with sensor technology, Rolls-Royce is able to forecast when engines
    will more likely fail. From such a prediction, customers can plan engine changes.
    Heidelberger Druckmaschinen has huge printing presses equipped with more than
    1,000 sensors. These are the examples of distinct uses of sensors in specific
    domains. However, this phenomenon will change completely when the distinct parts
    are connected to generate more efficient and effective decisions. Therefore, the
    Fog infrastructure must have the capability to provide physical resources for
    computation, networking, storage, and memory to achieve efficient Fog computing
    services. 2) Network Requirements The network is one of the key bottlenecks in
    the Fog computing environment, where billions of connected devices generate and
    consume data at the edge of the network [68]. Most of the sensing and actuating
    devices require low bandwidth but a higher number of devices will be connected
    at the same time. Therefore, existing network connection technologies like LAN,
    MAN, WAN, or PAN need to be investigated further and amendments will be needed
    to cope with the Fog computing environment to facilitate countless IoT devices.
    Network operators are increasingly investing in new wireless access technology
    research because of the number of devices per user is increasing day by day. For
    instance, in the cellular mobile network, base stations have a limited number
    of link points [20]. As the number of things increase, these stations will need
    to support increasing numbers of devices. Fog devices must act as a router for
    neighboring IoT devices and as a primary processing unit for IoT application in
    the Fog environment. Each Fog device should have a resilient connectivity to the
    lower and upper layer devices. Mobile ad-hoc networks could act as a basis for
    the Fog network because of their mobility and lower cost feature [20]. Hence,
    connection and mobility are the main requirements for the Fog network. 3) Fog
    Devices Fog computing is basically intended to support IoT-related technologies
    to perform processing at the edge level. Mine projects [69], [70] at the middle
    of the sea, airline fleets or a ship [70] can be equipped with a huge number of
    sensors, so it is impossible to send and store all generated data in real-time
    into the cloud. Some intermediate computation, processing, and services will be
    done by Fog computing devices. Thus, the Fog layer must have sensor management
    devices, Fog processing, and storage devices and Fog gateway devices. All of these
    devices will work collaboratively to manage and perform tasks in the Fog plane.
    Here, we discuss the devices that are needed for Fog computing deployment. a:
    IoT Devices IoT devices are the devices that have sensing and actuating capability.
    A sensor is able to sense the environment, while an actuator acts on it when necessary.
    One of the most common types of sensor in IoT devices is the temperature sensor.
    The temperature sensor has various functions depending on different domains such
    as at home, in factories, and in the agriculture field. This sensor is also used
    to sense the temperature of soil, water, and plants in order to take proper action
    needed to improve service outcome. Another type of useful sensor is the pressure
    sensor, used especially in agriculture, smart vehicles, and aircrafts. Sensors
    are also used to estimate the volume of water used by the agricultural sector
    for cultivation and other uses. Surprisingly, a huge percentage of this water
    is wasted due to leaky irrigation systems and inefficient use of fresh water.
    Efficient use of the pressure sensor will help solve this problem. The pressure
    sensor is able to determine the flow of water and reduce water waste. The pressure
    sensor is also used in smart vehicles to determine the forces acting on it, and
    in aircrafts to determine altitude. Different groups of sensors are used for different
    IoT environments. For example, in healthcare, the most-used sensors are chemical,
    IR, pressure, and temperature sensors as well as other biosensors. On the other
    hand, in a smartphone, the most-used sensors are the gyroscope, GPS, and proximity
    sensors. One of the applications of the proximity sensor is to determine the presence
    of ear to dim or turn off the phone backlight to improve battery efficiency. This
    sensor is also used to monitor parking space since it can determine the presence
    of an object without touching it. It can also be used in a wide temperature range
    and is not affected by color. Its detection process also is not effected by dirt,
    oil, or water. There are many other sensors out there that enable IoT, which include
    GPS sensors, water quality sensors, level sensors, chemical/gas sensors, smoke
    sensors, IR sensors, humidity sensors, sound and vibration sensors, motion sensors,
    acceleration sensors, and machine vision sensors. There are five main types of
    actuators-magnetic or thermal, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical.
    The actuator has a controlling or moving mechanism, a motor, which acts on various
    inputs. The raw application data comes from various sensors like speed sensors,
    cameras, temperature sensors, vehicle monitoring sensors, or GPS sensors. A typical
    sensor generates 10 data samples every second [71]. Sensors convert environmental
    variables such as smoke, heat, light, temperature, humidity, sound, and so on
    into electrical signals. These sensors are varied and can be micro-electro-mechanical
    systems (MEMS)-based, CMOS-based or LED sensors. Communication among sensors could
    be done by ZigBee, Bluetooth, Z-Wave or 6LoWPAN standards for short distance communication
    [72]. There is a necessity for communication among sensors in some cases where
    one sensing output is dependent on other collective sensor outputs. These sensors
    will be connected to Fog devices through wireless connections. However, Fog devices
    collect and process data based on application requirements. Some example of research
    works based on sensors can be improved by taking advantage of Fog computing. Aziz
    et al. [73] proposed a real-time health monitoring system using particular sensors
    in which the proposed architecture was based on GSM and GPS technologies. The
    system specifically monitors the body temperature and blood pressure of patients.
    The study used an Arduino microcontroller, dfrobot GPS/GPRS/GSM module v3.0.3,
    a heartbeat pulse sensor, and a lilypad temperature sensor for hardware implementation.
    In another study, a web-based application was developed for doctors and nurses
    with SMS functionality, which will be used as an emergency case. The system is
    able to generate GPS location, body temperature, and blood pressure. Butt et al.
    [74] investigated wearable technology such as SensHand, Gloves-based system, electromyography-based
    and hybrid systems, leap motion, and smartwatches. The development of these kinds
    of technology must be integrated with the smart home system and Fog-like architecture
    in order to deal with emergency situations. Some devices such as the smartphone
    can be considered as both an IoT and Fog device. In the same way, if some sensors
    and actuators were installed in the Raspberry Pi, the device could also act as
    both an IoT and Fog device. b: Fog Processing Devices Any device that has computing
    capability, storage, and network connectivity can act as a Fog processing device.
    It could be a network controller, switch, router, server, or a video surveillance
    camera. A Cisco 800 series router can be used as a Fog device where the IoT application
    can be run on the device and the device supporting Cisco IOx. To date, only Cisco
    800 series routers are supporting IOx with Linux kernel with virtualization support
    [44]. Most of these devices have a 266-400 MHz MPC8272 processor with 16 KB Cache,
    64 MB random access memory and 20 MB processor board flash memory. The user can
    host an application on these routers. These routers have two cores-Cisco IOS runs
    on one core and another core is used for running IOx services. Another type of
    Fog processing device is the Fog server. A Fog server can control several Fog
    devices in a specific domain. Cisco offers two flavors of Fog computing server
    deployment. One is the Cisco Fog Director, which can be deployed on any type of
    server with Cisco-recommended server specifications [66]. Another example of a
    Fog device manufactured by Cisco is the Fog data services, which are specifically
    designed for IoT [65]. However, Cisco Fog data services can only be deployed on
    Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers. Both will act as Fog servers; however, Cisco
    Fog data services are especially designed for an IoT environment. However, various
    organizations and bodies need to work beyond the proprietary solutions for fast
    technological advancement and technology adoption with a limited budget. Fog devices
    and Fog servers should be deployed in such a way that any type of network management
    device with storage and processing capability can act as a Fog device. Similarly,
    the usual type of server must be able to act as a Fog server. This could be an
    ordinary PC since Fog is not dedicated to performing very complex processing.
    However, further investigation is necessary to explore the minimum system requirement
    for a device that can act as a Fog device or Fog server. Connectivity between
    Fog devices and Fog servers will be via Ethernet or wireless or a serial connection
    in some cases. As an example, Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers, which are generally
    used as Fog servers, are connected to the network via Ethernet. On the other hand,
    Cisco 800 series routers are connected via serial ports that support Fog computation.
    c: Gateway Devices for Fog Many hardware boards are currently available in the
    market including Arduino Yun, Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black, Arduino
    + Shields, Netduino, Tessel 2, and so on. These boards are currently used as IoT
    and gateway devices and can also be used as Fog gateway devices and as Fog devices.
    These boards have a built-in processor, wired and wireless adapter, and a USB
    port. Fog computing supports device heterogeneity, where a gateway could also
    be a part of the Fog computing environment. Constant et al. [75] developed a Fog
    gateway using Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi. Their proposed Fog gateway integrated
    the data conditioning process, smart analytics, intelligent filtering, and transfer
    to the cloud, which needs long-term storage and temporal variability monitoring.
    The IoT gateway supports various data types and communication protocols between
    devices and sensors. It also unifies the data format from various sensors. Current
    IoT gateways provide a solution for communication and do not support fully automatic
    configurations of newly added IoT devices [76]. Guoqiang et al. [77] proposed
    a smart IoT gateway with three key benefits. The proposed gateway has a unified
    external interface and pluggable architecture. It has a flexible protocol to translate
    various sensor data into a uniform format. The study designed a customized device
    with a Samsung S5PV210 mobile application processor as its gateway. However, this
    gateway did not have any fault tolerance or security features. B. Platform The
    platform manages applications and infrastructure in the Fog environment. It takes
    care of resource allocation, scheduling, fault tolerance, multi-tenancy, security,
    and privacy in Fog computing. Based on the taxonomy of the Fog, we discuss the
    requirements of the platform for Fog computing in this section. 1) Resource Allocation
    and Scheduling Heterogeneous devices are the main challenges in developing proper
    resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog. If we wanted to use the computation
    power of idle devices, we need to schedule tasks on these devices efficiently.
    Otherwise, IoT application processing in the Fog will face complex issues, which
    will hinder the fulfillment of the latency awareness goal. Two of the key requirements
    for resource allocation and scheduling are availability and efficiency. Resources
    in the Fog are not dedicated, and thus availability should be ensured. On the
    other hand, lack of efficient resource allocation and scheduling might lead to
    unwanted delays in the overall processing. 2) Service Requirements Fog services
    can be defined as single or multiple user requests, where the user will constantly
    be updated of the outcome of the service until he or she has a subscription to
    that service. This means that the service outcome will not be fixed and will keep
    changing until the end of the service. The Fog device and Fog server perform the
    intermediate processing, which occurs in between user request and service output.
    The Fog server may communicate with the cloud for processing and information retrieval
    when necessary. For instance, if we considered selecting the best path based on
    real-time traffic in a smart transportation system, the Fog service will keep
    updating on the best path until the end of the journey. In this case, we need
    to take into account mitigation of fault, service quality, network latency, and
    power consumption in order to maintain the standard of the service. a: Fault Tolerance
    Fault tolerance allows a system to keep performing even when a part of the system
    has failed. This failure might be software failure, hardware failure, or network
    failure. The solution for fault tolerance will result in a fully operational system
    where the system will continue its operation with a lower capability instead of
    shutting down totally [78]. Fault tolerance is mostly investigated in the cloud
    [79]–[89]. However, it is necessary to investigate fault tolerance in the Fog
    as well. Although many research works have addressed the need to explore fault
    tolerance issues [5], [9], [64] in Fog computing, none have actually investigated
    the issue. We discuss in more detail the issue of fault tolerance in Section VIII-B.
    b: Quality of Service (QoS) QoS is an important service requirement for Fog computing,
    which is based on reliability, network delay, throughput, and energy consumption.
    Besides these, resource management, power-consumption model, scheduling policy,
    and power failure handling are also important to ensure QoS. If some sensors fail
    for any reason, the accuracy of the outcome or action could be affected. Fog is
    intended to work with latency-sensitive systems; hence, it should maintain high
    reliability with a strict QoS assurance. Otherwise, the latency awareness criteria
    will not be fulfilled. Madsen et al. [90] suggested that the availability of different
    methodologies and algorithms work with the reliability of network connectivity
    and information, to ensure accuracy, which is crucial for building Fog computing-based
    projects. 3) Security and Privacy In this technological era, people are inevitably
    sharing personal information when using different applications and web services.
    Our personal information is no longer personal; it now belongs to many tech giants
    because we are using their free services on a regular basis [91]. A simple example
    is that if anyone used an Android phone without any security settings, the built-in
    Android OS will automatically run GPS and map services, for which it can collect
    all location-related activities about the user. Therefore, information about when
    and which country a user has visited, where a user has dined in, which route a
    user uses for going to the office, home, and so on will be made available to these
    companies. However, these tech giants might argue that they do not disclose our
    data to others, as they can only see our data in our timeline only. However, a
    recent Facebook incident fails to convince us of the honesty of these tech giants
    [92]. The Fog computing paradigm is completely distributed and not intended to
    be centrally managed most of the time. Sensitive data might be processed in an
    intermediate device when the application does not have full control of the device.
    On the other hand, the user will not have full control over the Fog applications.
    Users will require more protective and innovative ways to retain their privacy
    and protect it from any potential and very harmful entities [20]. Similarly, Fog
    application providers also need to develop security to protect their application
    from unwanted data theft. Three different types of security need to be ensured:
    network connection security, data security, and user privacy. Network connection
    security and data security are applicable from both the user and provider perspectives.
    Moreover, user privacy is also important because Fog processing is carried out
    on user data in most cases. 4) Multi-Tenancy Multiple tenants for the same services
    with an isolated runtime for each tenant are referred to as multi-tenancy service.
    Multi-tenancy is important for Fog because of the limited resources in a Fog environment.
    By enabling multi-tenancy, one instance will run in a Fog device and will serve
    multiple tenants (users). Multi-tenancy could be container-based or could be the
    usual virtualization-based. Container-based virtualization is a more lightweight
    and powerful virtualization solution, which the Fog can adopt, to provide the
    fastest processing solution. Container-based virtualization does not need to emulate
    the operating system to facilitate virtualization; thus, it will be easier to
    manage and migrate. Multi-tenancy is a requirement for the platform, and needs
    to be defined before deployment. Multi-tenancy may incur performance degradation
    and security issues [29]; thus, adequate and secure isolation is needed. 5) Management
    The management of the Fog can be centralized or decentralized. Since the devices
    in a Fog environment belong to different domains, centralized management is not
    always possible. Alternatively, processing of IoT applications will be done in
    different Fog clusters, so management will follow a distributed nature in this
    case. In summary, the management of the platform in a Fog must be defined. In
    the case of decentralized management, similar processes must be deployed for different
    Fog devices to handle management issues. C. Application Applications have to fulfill
    certain requirements to execute in a Fog environment. Here, we discuss the features
    required by the applications for execution. 1) Application Requirements a: Scalability
    The number of IoT devices are increasing very swiftly day by day all over the
    world, which raises a new issue of scalability. Thus, we need to deal with the
    scaling of devices and services in the Fog computing environment. Dependency on
    cloud computing has been observed for IoT application processing by many research
    works, where trillions of IoT devices are involved, such as that of Li et al.
    [93]. However, implementation of the whole application in the cloud in such an
    environment where IoT devices are generating a huge amount of data is neither
    feasible nor efficient. IoT devices are not only stationary but also mobile in
    most cases. Hence, maintaining frequently changing device states and availability
    in the cloud is not an easy task. Also, with the growing number of IoT devices,
    it would be more critical for IoT applications to query and select IoT devices
    [59]. The Fog computing system must be an autonomous system where application
    execution by the participating device will be done automatically including scalability.
    b: Heterogeneity For any IoT system, the heterogeneous device is a fundamental
    characteristic where device heterogeneity co-exists at any level in the Fog computing
    paradigm. Abstraction of device complexity is also required to some extent. Device
    heterogeneity does not only refer to the diversity of services and protocols,
    but also the assortment of horizontal and vertical levels of the Fog architecture
    [59]. To address this heterogeneity, Giang et al. [59], classified three types
    of Fog devices: compute, input/output (IO), and edge nodes. Edge nodes are the
    sensors and the actuators, IO nodes are the resource-limited devices mostly responsible
    for brokering communications, and computing nodes offer computing facilities.
    Of the three types of nodes, IO and compute nodes are mostly dynamic and customizable
    or programmable as required. It is possible to implement all three nodes in a
    single device based on its capability and design goal. The smart gateway is an
    example of such implementation. In order to use the capability of various types
    of devices in an IoT environment, it is obvious that the application must be designed
    in such a way that it might be able to perform its task execution on multiple
    devices regardless of its capacity and location. More precisely, the application
    should able to use maximum available computation resources through middleware.
    c: Interaction Timeliness The perception-action (PA) cycle is the basic function
    of a nervous system, which maintains circular flow between sensory organisms and
    its actions towards the functionality of that sensing. The PA cycle is also a
    characteristic of IoT applications, where the cloud and Fog infrastructure satisfies
    timeliness requirements and application logic for communication. Giang et al.
    [59] identified four interaction models for the PA cycle in a Fog environment.
    Examples of these models are: (i) in a local network, communication between devices,
    which is considered as an immediate cycle action, (ii) interaction with the cloud
    from a device of a local network, which is generally for time-insensitive actions,
    (iii) an interaction generated by the cloud to a device in a local network, which
    requires semi-immediate actions, and (iv) communication among IoT-related applications
    in the cloud. However, their work considered the role of the Fog server, which
    manages and maintains several Fog devices in a specific cluster. On the other
    hand, PA interaction can be divided into immediate, semi-immediate, and delayed
    action to leverage IoT application requirements more efficiently. Delayed action
    can be performed on the type of processing that does not have any timeliness issues
    and could be processed by the cloud infrastructure. d: Mobility Device mobility
    is a natural probability and is one of the key requirements for implementing an
    IoT platform [59]. From the Fog perspective, it is not only the edge devices that
    will be mobile but also computing and storage devices in the Fog layer. Managing
    mobile devices in two different planes and syncing them with each other is challenging.
    To ensure resource availability and successful task completion, task distribution,
    duplication, and migration is required. This mechanism is already considered in
    the cloud but there is a need to reinvestigate them by considering mobility [94].
    2) User Requirements User requirements can be changed by various constraints.
    First of all, a user may want to complete the submitted task within a specific
    time binding, which is referred to as the deadline. Secondly, the user may set
    some constraints for the budget. Thirdly, in the case of some users, they may
    not care about the budget but the response time is of utmost importance. Fourthly,
    some users may want tolerable accuracy. This means that the user may not seek
    accurate results but rather fast results that could be provided with some reasonable
    errors. Aazam and Huh [54] suggested that pre-allocation and prediction of resources
    rely on user behavior and the probability of future utilization of resources.
    Dastjerdi et al. [4], [95] stated that edge devices perform optimization by considering
    user behavior and network condition. 3) Application Modeling Two types of application
    modeling are possible by considering the requirements of applications in the Fog.
    Most IoT devices generate tuples periodically, which can be considered as a stream.
    These streams need to be processed in real time to get accurate results. Alternatively,
    the application that does the processing based on previously stored sets of data
    could include microservice-based applications. The advantage of microservice is
    that it can bind all functionality and required libraries in a single service,
    which can run above the microservice controller without dependency. Hence, application
    modeling in Fog could be stream-based or microservice-based. SECTION VII. Dimension
    of Fog Computing-Based Applications Several applications require a Fog computing
    infrastructure to provide smooth services. These include smart transportation
    systems, Augmented and Virtual reality, healthcare, video streaming, smart homes,
    and smart cities. Requirements of platform and applications are also needed in
    order to provide services. In this section, we discuss some research works, which
    specifically address the application of Fog computing. We evaluate each work based
    on their contribution on the Fog infrastructure, platform, and applications as
    defined in our taxonomy. It is obvious that all three kinds of services are interrelated.
    However, each researcher only focused on one or more of these aspects. Mapping
    related works with our proposed taxonomy will help in finding the research gaps
    in Fog computing applications. A. Smart Transportation System Several research
    works have been carried out on smart transportation systems that use Fog computing.
    In this section we discuss a few works that have been done on the Fog-based smart
    transportation system and then identify key issues that need to be addressed.
    Truong et al. [96] pproposed a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANETs) architecture
    called Fog Software Defined Networking (FSDN), which combines SDN and Fog together
    to provide a better solution. As SDN has programmability, flexibility, global
    knowledge, and scalability features and Fog has location awareness and time sensitivity,
    the combination of these two will leverage on the key challenges in VANETs. The
    proposed system is able to augment communication among vehicles, infrastructure,
    and base stations via centralized control, besides reducing latency and optimizing
    the utilization of resources. However, the central SDN controller of the proposed
    system is where the bottleneck of the proposed system occurs. The system is focused
    on infrastructure and network requirements. The Fog controller is used for service
    implementation. The work did not focus on platform and application requirements.
    Investigation of VANETs in Fog has also been done in Giang et al. [97], where
    they explored how smart transportation applications (VANETs) are developed using
    the Fog Computing approach. Driving vehicles in an urban area requires immediate
    decision on various activities such as route changing, lane change, slowing down
    speed, looking at obstacles, and so on. Hence, applications need to gather all
    related details to act on these activities. The authors discussed Fog-based smart
    transportation application requirements such as programming abstraction and application
    models. The work explored application modeling but not other application aspects
    nor infrastructure or platform. B. Vehicles as Fog Infrastructure Hou et al. [98]
    proposed the idea of Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC), which will use the vehicle
    as an infrastructure for computation and communication. The VFC architecture utilizes
    vehicle computation resources by providing service to the edge devices located
    near them. It will aggregate abundant resources of each moving car by which service
    quality can be enhanced. Using quantitative analysis on different scenarios, they
    discovered an interesting relationship among connectivity, mobility, communication
    capability, and parking behavior. These four characteristics help us understand
    resource utilization of vehicle resources, which will help achieve better utilization
    of unused resources. C. Augmented and Virtual Reality Augmented Reality applications
    are extremely time sensitive; a small delay can lead to serious errors in user
    experience. Thus, Fog computing-based solutions will have great potential in this
    domain [4]. These statements are also applicable for connected Virtual Reality
    (VR) or VR-based games. Zao et al. [99] proposed an augmented brain computer interaction
    game, which utilized the Fog and cloud infrastructure. The Fog performed real-time
    analysis such as signal processing that needs to classify the brain state and
    other analyses such as model classification updated from the cloud. However, their
    work only focused on the Fog infrastructure but neglected most aspects regarding
    platform and application. D. Healthcare The Fog computing approach also enables
    real-time sensor-based healthcare services. Rahmani et al. [100] proposed a Fog-assisted
    system architecture for the healthcare system. A smart e-health gateway is the
    key component of this architecture, which will process the generated data from
    the sensors and generate an Early Warning Score (EWS) to notify for any medical
    emergency. They considered many aspects of our taxonomy; but it is necessary to
    investigate each aspect extensively, which this study did not. Another Fog-based
    healthcare architecture was proposed by Mahmud et al. [26]. Their work mainly
    focused on network delay, power consumption, and communication optimization in
    Fog-based healthcare service. However, platform, application, and user requirements
    were not investigated. E. Smart City Smart city-related applications need to process
    sensor data on a real-time basis, where Fog computing can play a major role. Giordano
    et al. [101] proposed a Rainbow architecture, which supports various applications
    in a smart city. The proposed Rainbow framework evaluated three smart city applications
    including noise pollution mapping, urban drainage networks, and smart street.
    The work proposed a distributed agent-based approach in the intermediate layer
    in between the physical infrastructure and cloud. However, the work did not focused
    on application and platform aspects except for application modeling. Table 4 shows
    a summary of the above-discussed Fog-based applications mapped to our proposed
    taxonomy. In summary, it can be concluded that most of the works have focused
    on infrastructure and application modeling. There is a research gap on application-
    and platform-related aspects, which need to be explored further. TABLE 4 Evaluation
    of Existing Works on Fog Applications SECTION VIII. State-of-the-Art Fog Computing
    In this section, we focus on some existing research works on Fog computing. We
    discuss research works from four different research areas of Fog computing. These
    areas are resource allocation and scheduling, failure handling, simulation tools,
    and microservices. A. Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Computing Fog
    computing is fast evolving and growing rapidly due to its edge-level computation
    and heterogeneous nature. In this section, we present several research works,
    which have been done in the past couple of years. We also summarize the presented
    research works with a comparative discussion to address research gaps in this
    area. Most of the reviewed works are related to resource allocation and scheduling
    in the cloud and Fog environment. However, some works have only been done in the
    Fog environment. 1) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for Fog-Cloud Environment
    Alsaar et al. [102] proposed resource allocation methods for a collaborative platform
    composed of Fog and cloud paradigms. Their proposed algorithm is grounded on linearized
    decision tree rules by considering three different conditions for managing user
    request and for balancing workload. The conditions are VM capacity, completion
    time, and service size. Each condition has two branches: the VM capacity branches
    out to enough or not enough; the completion time consists of now or later, and
    the service size is divided into small or large. In some cases, this includes
    services in the queue, which will be represented with yes or no. They utilized
    1/m/m/1, with (1)/ representing cloud broker, /(m) for many paths, /(m) for many
    Fog brokers, and /(1) for IoT device users. Using this method, the total overhead
    for big data processing in the system was reduced. In their work, the availability
    of cloud servers and the Fog was guaranteed and a fast response time to satisfy
    QoS was achieved. The SLA for users was also different, where shared and reserved
    resource was provided. However, availability and QoS were not studied extensively.
    Deng et al. [103] presented a framework for workload allocation in the cloud and
    Fog environment to examine power consumption-delay trade-off issues. They defined
    the workload allocation problem into primary and sub-problems, which can be solved
    via related sub-systems. They employed a Hungarian algorithm and Generalized Benders
    Decomposition (GBD) algorithm to solve the problem. Numerical and simulation results
    were presented to prove that the Fog is a complement to the cloud. However, the
    complex nature of workload and resource was not studied in their work. Brogi et
    al. [104] prototyped a tool known as ‘FogTorch ∏ ’ which is capable of fulfilling
    hardware, software, and QoS requirements before deploying a composite application
    in the Fog infrastructure. The proposed tool manipulates Monte Carlo simulations
    and only considers communication link QoS. Resource consumption and QoS assurance
    terms were undertaken for classifying the eligibility of deployments. The proposed
    algorithm was based on the preprocessing phase and backtracking search phase.
    To find eligible deployment, the preprocessing used input from results derived
    by the backtracking search algorithm. However, availability and latency are more
    important in the Fog environment compared to resource consumption and communication
    links. In order to ensure efficient use of resources and network infrastructure
    in the Fog and cloud environment, Taneja and Davy [105] proposed a Module Mapping
    Algorithm, which efficiently deploys IoT Application Modules in the composite
    Fog-Cloud Infrastructure. They employed lower-bound searches and compared function
    algorithms to find an eligible network node in the Fog and cloud. The Module Mapping
    algorithm returned a map with nodes, which are appropriate for completing the
    computation operation. If the application requires faster processing, the application
    will be deployed close to the source device. However, the work considered CPU,
    RAM, and bandwidth to find the best resources. In such a case, the cloud resource
    will always be the best resource, so it will be necessary to consider other parameters
    such as response time and availability of the specified resources. Yin et al.
    [52] studied a Fog-assisted big data streaming scenario, where Fog devices are
    responsible for preprocessing raw data for applications hosted in the cloud using
    the unused resources of Fog devices. In their work, the software-defined network
    (SDN) controller continuously adjusted the volume of data to be sent to the Fog
    device for pre-processing. The collaborative computation problem was defined as
    a social welfare maximization problem and a hybrid alternating direction method
    of multiplier (H-ADMM) algorithm was proposed to minimize computation burden via
    the dynamic distribution of Fog devices, cloud, and SDN using message exchanging.
    The formulation of social welfare maximization problem determined the size of
    data that will be assigned to a Fog device. During the formulation, loss of information
    value by preprocessing and the operation cost of the Fog and cloud were considered.
    The work completely depended on the cloud for post-processing, but pre- and post-processing
    could have been done in the Fog to support time-sensitive real-time applications.
    Aazam et al. [106] proposed a dynamic resource estimation algorithm by integrating
    the historical record of cloud service customer (CSC) in a Fog environment based
    on the relinquish probability. The minimum relinquish probability value is 0.1
    and this value will be increased based on the history of the user. However, for
    fair resource estimation, the relinquish probability will be 0.3 for new customers.
    For existing and returning customers, the characteristics of the customer are
    known, so the probability value can be calculated easily. In this way, resource
    underutilization could be minimized and the chances of profit loss will be low.
    2) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for a Fog Environment A resource allocation
    strategy based on priced timed Petri nets (PTPNs) was proposed by Ni et al. [107]
    for Fog computing. The main idea of this work is that the user can choose the
    satisfying resources autonomously from a pre-allocated resource group. With credibility
    evaluation for both users and Fog infrastructure, their proposed strategy comprehensively
    considers the cost for time and price to complete the tasks. The user that has
    a high credit limit will be able to allocate highly reliable resources to complete
    their tasks. Due to the dynamic nature of creditability of users and resources,
    there will be some deviation in calculating them properly. To maintain QoS, the
    resources will be ordered according to their processing capacity and divided into
    several groups. Moreover, users with similar credibility will be assigned to several
    groups. Pooranian et al. [108] proposed a simple algorithm to find an optimal
    solution for resource allocation. They considered the problem as a bin packing
    penalty aware problem where servers are bins and VMs are the pack. Based on idle
    energy, maximum frequency, and maximum energy, each server will be palatalized
    and rewarded. The method will calculate how many VMs could be allocated in t time
    slot on a server. The VMs will be served based on their frequency and time limitations.
    As a consequence of penalty, a server will be punished in the form of being banned
    from use for a few iterations. Once the server passes the iteration freeze, it
    will return to the stream to perform further computation. The penalty and reward
    methods are applied to minimize exponentially increasing energy consumption. Sun
    and Zhang [63] proposed a crowd-funding algorithm for a Fog environment, integrating
    idle resources in the local network. An incentive mechanism was used to encourage
    resource owners to participate in the computation and enthusiastically perform
    their tasks. Through the comprehensive reward and punishment mechanism, it is
    ensured that the participant will positively perform the tasks. This work is similar
    to the above-described literature proposed by Pooranian et al. [108]. However,
    in this case, the reward and punishment go to the participant rather than the
    physical server. 3) Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Based
    on the related research on resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog, a summary
    is presented in Table 5. From this table, we can see that most of the researchers
    have focused on resource allocation in the Fog. More research works are therefore
    required to investigate resource sharing and workload allocation. Also, further
    investigation is needed to address energy-efficiency, load balancing, SLA, and
    QoS in the Fog. We identified two major issues in Fog computing research. Firstly,
    researchers tend to use a synthetic workload to validate their methods and algorithms.
    Secondly, most of the researchers used cloud-based simulations, which are not
    that convincing because the Fog is more heterogeneous and dynamic in nature. Thus,
    further investigation into workload generation and simulations in the Fog need
    to be undertaken. TABLE 5 Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling Research
    in Fog B. Fault Tolerance in Fog Computing The Fog computing paradigm is a highly
    distributed heterogeneous platform where the probability of device failure is
    very high compared to the cloud. Since the Fog is evolving, no study has yet been
    done on fault tolerance in Fog computing. However, fault tolerance has been mostly
    studied in the cloud computing paradigm. Often, fault tolerance is measured by
    availability. In the cloud, faults are handled by proactive fault tolerance and
    reactive fault tolerance techniques at either the workflow level or task level.
    Reactive fault tolerance techniques are used to reduce the impact of failures
    on a system when the failures have actually occurred. Techniques based on this
    policy are job migration, checkpoint/restart, replication, rollback and recovery,
    task resubmission, user-defined exception handling, and workflow rescue. Proactive
    fault tolerance predicts the faults pro-actively and replaces the suspected components
    with other working components; thus, avoiding recovery from faults and errors.
    Proactive Fault Tolerance uses self-healing, preemptive migration, and software
    rejuvenation, which are the few proactive fault tolerance techniques in the cloud.
    According to Sharma et al. [110], the causes of failure in the cloud varies, and
    include software and hardware failure, service failure, overflow failure, power
    outage, outdated systems, network failure, cyber attacks, and human errors. It
    is crucial to handle faults in Fog computing for which the fault needs to be considered
    at every step, not only for processing but also for the transmit-and-receive process
    [111]. In this section, we discuss some existing research works on fault tolerance
    in cloud computing. We specifically focus on resource and task failure mechanisms.
    Then, we summarize the existing works and present a research direction for failure
    handling in Fog computing. Jiang and Hsu [112] proposed a two-level standby design
    for handling server failure in the cloud system. In their proposed system, cold
    and warm standby of the system is made available. Once any server fails, the warm
    standby system will replace the failed server and the failed server will be sent
    to the repair house. After repairing, the system will be placed in the cold standby
    group. The systems in the cold standby group are in a completely switched off
    mode. The work proposed a model to determine the necessary number of cold and
    warm standby systems in the cloud. However, this type of hardware failure handling
    is not suitable for the Fog because most of the time Fog computing devices will
    not be under the property of the Fog provider. Hence, task migration is the best
    solution for hardware failure and this should be reactive in most cases, except
    where the Fog device belongs to the provider. Latiff et al. [113] proposed a cloud-scheduling
    scheme based on a check-pointed league championship algorithm. They employed a
    task migration method for independent task execution failure. In their proposed
    method, the system state will be saved periodically by check-pointing, so the
    task need not start from the beginning once it fails. When the task fails, it
    will be assigned to an underloaded VM and the league championship algorithm will
    be employed to schedule the failed tasks. Wu et al. [114] proposed a fault tolerance
    technique using migration to the cloud. The failure handling method is proactive,
    which always monitors the host and continuously tries to predict the chances of
    failure. If the prediction becomes true, the system will look up other available
    resources and then migration will be performed. The proposed method will monitor
    CPU temperature, memory usage, and CPU fan speed, etc. To employ such a technique
    in Fog computing, further investigation is needed because the types of device
    in Fog are diverse. A combined method of check-pointing and migration-based proactive
    failure handling was proposed by Egwutuoha et al. [115] for HPC and cloud. In
    the proposed method, the authors used a Lm-sensors open source software tool for
    computer health monitoring. From the monitoring data, they defined rule-based
    monitoring depending on temperature, fan speed, voltage, and processor utilization
    to predict failure. The rules are denoted as 1, 2, and 3, representing normal,
    warning, and critical state, respectively. They employed three different policies
    for migration. The first depends on the necessity lease additional node. The second
    removes the node, which is unhealthy based on the state. In the third, the critical
    state publishes to the head node. Finally, the system administrator is notified
    for further action. This type of approach might increase the overhead in the Fog;
    however, further exploration is essential. A recent study shows that proactive
    fault tolerance is the best solution for the cloud compared to redundant solutions
    [88]. However, failure prediction accuracy is the key factor for these kinds of
    solutions. Their work considered software, hardware, and unstable behavior to
    predict the failure of the infrastructure. More specifically, they defined failure
    based on an error formula err=(ActualTime−PredictedTime)/ActualTime×100% , which
    was derived from [118] and [119]. A combination of the proactive and reactive
    method was applied by Gao et al. [118] to handle task failure in the cloud environment.
    The crash detection method and replication factor were proposed in this work to
    handle failures. Table 6 shows a summary of the investigated literature on fault
    tolerance in the cloud. TABLE 6 Summary of Investigated Fault Tolerance Literature
    in Cloud Because of its unstable nature of failure and heterogeneous characteristics,
    the hybrid failure handling method is more appropriate for the Fog computing environment.
    C. Simulation Tools for Fog Computing Simulation and modeling in Fog computing
    are still in their infancy. However, a few research works have been done on Fog
    computing simulation, which are focused on some specific aspect of Fog computing.
    Aazam and Huh [54] focused on resource prediction and pricing in Fog computing.
    The Proposed Fog-based resource management model is able to estimate the required
    resources based on the probability of user behavior of future resource use. Validation
    and performance evaluation was done using simulation. However, they did not consider
    service heterogeneity, QoS, or device mobility factors. Another work proposed
    by Dastjerdi et al. [4] focused on dag of the query for incident detection in
    a smart city use case. Both of these works used CloudSim [119] to validate their
    method along with an experimental evaluation. The first toolkit for Fog simulation
    was developed by Gupta et al. [120], known as iFogSim. The toolkit is used for
    the simulation and modeling of IoT resource management techniques in the Fog and
    edge computing paradigms. The most challenging problem is the design of resource
    management techniques, which determine analytic application distribution among
    edge devices, which will improve the throughput and reduce latency. The proposed
    simulator is capable of measuring the impact of resource management techniques
    in terms of network congestion, latency, cost, and energy consumption. The simulator
    was validated using two use cases and the authors also proposed a Fog computing
    environment architecture. Challenges in Fog computing deployment are include incorporating
    Fog with Emerging Technologies such as 5G Technologies [121], Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV), and Software-defined Networking (SDN). In this case, a simulator
    with container, SDN, and NFV support is crucial. Table 7 presents the key features
    of these two simulators that are mostly used by various researchers for Fog computing
    simulation. These two simulation tools did not focus on network parameters such
    as bandwidth distribution of the link and round-trip delay of the various media.
    These two parameters heavily affect the simulation results where minimization
    of latency is the key goal in a Fog computing environment. Secondly, both tools
    did not consider container-based virtualization. In a Fog computing environment,
    there are many devices that will participate in computation, where hypervisor-based
    virtualization is nearly impossible to implement due to the lower memory and processing
    power of these devices. TABLE 7 Simulation Tools Used for Fog Simulation and Their
    Key Features D. Fog-Based Micro Services A microservice is an independent process
    and Software-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that interacts by message passing. The
    SOA of microservice does not hinder or favor any specific programming model. It
    provides design and implementation guidelines for distributed applications to
    partition each component independently. Each of the components addresses a specific
    functionality. The functionality of the components can be accessed by message
    passing and is possible to implement in any mainstream programming language internally.
    In this way, this principle helps developers and project managers to develop each
    module independently and test it with a few related functions. Some microservices,
    also known as high-level microservices, are mainly responsible for coordination
    with other microservices [124]. The organizational approach of microservices accelerates
    the development cycle, nourishes ownership, encourages innovation, improves scalability,
    and enhances the maintainability of software applications. Using this approach,
    software becomes a small independent service and interacts over unambiguous APIs.
    These services are preserved via self-contained small teams [125]. The agility
    and independent distributed nature of microservice deployment makes it a good
    solution for Fog-based IoT application development. Independent processes and
    interaction via message passing features has made microservices more convenient
    for IoT applications. In the Fog, there is a limitation of resources, so developing
    microservices in the Fog will minimize the growing complexity of the big system
    by dividing it into a set of small independent services. Microservice is taking
    modularity to a subsequent level by incorporating high cohesion and loose coupling
    of distributed systems. 1) Current Research Aspects of Microservice Recently,
    microservice-based applications have started gaining popularity [124]. Fog-based
    microservices have not been investigated extensively; hence, it is an open research
    area. However, some research works have been done in this emerging research area,
    with most of the efforts being related to IoT. Butzin et al. [126] investigated
    the use of microservices in IoT and claimed that the architectural goal of IoT
    and microservices are similar. However, they actually have different features
    in terms of various aspects. First of all, microservice has a self-containment
    feature where all dependencies and libraries are packed with the application in
    a single image. On the other hand, for IoT, all libraries are not generally wrapped
    with the application. However, both use similar types of virtualization and web
    protocols. Microservice also has a continuous integration and delivery feature
    while in IoT these are not available or only partly exist. Vresk and Čavrak [127]
    proposed a microservice-based middleware for IoT to support device heterogeneity,
    various communication protocols, and services. They presented a data model and
    address model for microservice-based IoT. Brito et al. [128] proposed a service
    orchestration architecture for Fog using microservices. The authors defined the
    resource manager as a microservice. Khazaei et al. [129] proposed a generic programmable
    self-managing microservice-based platform for IoT. In the platform, microservices
    will exist in all layers in a cascading manner and an autonomic management system
    will scale the microservice. A similar type of IoT framework was proposed by Sun
    et al. [130]. In their architecture of nine components, all are microservices
    except for the core service. The work proved that microservices are far better
    than the monolithic approach in terms of scalability, flexibility, and platform
    independence. However, still, microservice-based IoT architecture suffers from
    various issues such as faults in the network, network delay, message serialization,
    cooperative transaction processing, and other distributed computing scenarios.
    Li et al. [131] proposed a cooperative-based model specifically for smart sensing
    devices; it is possible to enhance the performance of such a service by undertaking
    a micro-service based concept. Krivic et al. [132] proposed a management solution
    for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) device communication in an IoT system using collaborative
    microservice. They argued that microservices could act as the agent in an agent-based
    system since each microservice is responsible for performing a specific task and
    acts collaboratively to achieve the system goal. Container-based virtualization
    is the best solution for deploying microservices since the container supports
    OS virtualization and packs all dependencies in a single image. A container is
    able to manage physical hardware resource needed by an application with its OS
    kernel utilities [133]. 2) Microservices and IoT Applications Many research works
    have suggested Fog-based processing for IoT applications in smart transportation
    systems [96]–[98], Augmented and Virtual Reality [99], [134], [135], and healthcare
    [26], [136], [137]. Fog computing is also suitable for video streaming, smart
    homes, smart cities, and CDN. The common characteristics of these applications
    are time-sensitiveness, which make Fog computing a promising emerging computing
    paradigm. The main drawback of the Fog, however, is resource limitation and failure.
    Thus, using microservices for Fog-based IoT applications will minimize these drawbacks.
    Microservices are standalone, lightweight, and easily deliverable. To mitigate
    resource limitation, the microservice-based container is the best solution so
    far. In the same way, it will also minimize the cost of failure by deploying the
    application immediately. Many open research issues can be addressed by implementing
    Fog-based micro services; these include service management, scheduling, monitoring,
    fault tolerance, security, and privacy. E. Fog Based Mobile Computing The number
    of smartphone and mobile device users in urban areas as well as in rural areas
    is increasing day by day. As a result, mobile users are now requesting high-volume
    content collaboratively. Providing service for all requested contents in an area
    where mobile users are densely populated is a really challenging task for service
    providers [138]. The high number of concurrent content requests will only make
    the situation worse. One of the best solutions to cope with this problem is to
    offload content near the users, so that the users could get better service. This
    content offloading process can be supported by mobile Fog computing. In mobile
    Fog computing, content will be offloaded to the Fog device, which is located closer
    to the users. However, content management in Fog nodes is a current research issue.
    Depending on the demand of the contents, offloading should be distributed on the
    Fog nodes. Constant monitoring and efficient cache management is crucial to deal
    with resource-limited Fog nodes. A few research works have been done on mobile
    Fog computing. This section chronologically discusses the research works that
    have been done in this particular research area in the past couple of years. Hong
    et al. [94] proposed a high-level programming model that supports large-scale
    geospatially distributed time-sensitive applications. The proposed Mobile Fog
    programming model has two design goals. The initial goal is to provide a simplified
    application development for an enormous number of heterogenous devices, which
    are distributed in a wide area. The next goal is the dynamic scaling of resources
    based on resource demand. They developed an API for their programming model and
    evaluated it using two application models: vehicle tracking using a camera and
    traffic monitoring using a Mobility-driven distributed Complex Event Processing
    (MCEP) system. However, they did not focus on process placement or process migration.
    Shi et al. [139] proposed a P2P inspired communication model between the mobile
    device cloud and mobile nodes to share resources and computation task among mobile
    devices. In their work, they utilized a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    for implementing microservices. This work introduced the M2M approach in Fog computing
    while the classical Fog is actually hierarchy based. Content offloading in the
    mobile Fog was investigated by Khan et al. [138]. They defined mobile Fog as co-located
    self-organizing mobile nodes, which offer distributed resources at the edge. The
    aim of this work was to collaborate nodes for content caching, which will maximize
    the availability of the content and minimize operational cost. The proposed coalition
    game helps find the best co-located candidates near the users for sharing storage
    and self-organizing. Wang et al. [140] proposed a three-layer hierarchy framework
    using a Fog structure to bridge the communication between WSNs and the cloud.
    They designed a routing algorithm for bridging communication by considering the
    number of hops and energy consumption. They defined the Fog node as a sink, which
    will transfer data from sensor to the cloud. The proposed framework consists of
    routing layer, Fog layer, and sink layer. In the Fog layer, a sink acts as the
    Fog nodes as well to minimize transmission delay. However, there is a lack of
    security and privacy concern being addressed in mobile Fog computing. Roman et
    al. [141] addressed security and privacy for all edge-level computing. This included
    a usual thread in a network system mobile Fog that requires extra measures of
    authentication, trust, access control, protocol, and network security. SECTION
    IX. Open Issues and Future Research Directions A. Infrastructure-Related Issues
    The Fog is an evolving technology, expanding in such a way that it needs to reach
    market adoption to support all kinds of time-sensitive applications. The Fog has
    become an enactment of research efforts by various academies and industries. One
    of the key initiatives is the Open Fog Consortium (OpenFog), which was founded
    by the ARM, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University in November
    2015 [31]. Foxconn, General Electric, Hitachi, Sakura Internet, ShanghaiTech University,
    and ZTE are the contributing members of this nonprofit consortium. They are accelerating
    digital innovation with the blending of 5G wireless technology, IoT, and embedded
    AI by providing open interoperable architecture. However, many open challenges
    exist for this sprout-level computing paradigm. In this section, we discuss the
    research challenges and address the future directions for Fog computing research.
    Figure 10 shows some important research issues in Fog computing. FIGURE 10. Fog
    computing research issues. Show All 1) Deployment Issues From the deployment viewpoint,
    OpenFog is defined as an N-tier environment. However, the excessive increase in
    number of levels in the Fog layer might cause latency problems in the newly emerging
    Fog computing paradigm. Therefore, the number of tiers based on the use case must
    be determined. Deployment decisions will be undertaken based on requirements such
    as type and amount of task that will be done by each tier, total number of sensors,
    Fog device capability, in between the latency and reliability of Fog devices.
    Still, it is necessary to investigate how these requirements will be fulfilled.
    Application and resource scaling is also an important issue during deployment.
    Based on the requirement of the application and resource, scaling and shrinking
    without interrupting current services could be undertaken. In this regard, placement
    might also affect Fog deployment. 2) Standard Architecture for Fog Computing Up
    until now, there has been no defined standard architecture for Fog computing.
    The OpenFog consortium released two versions of the Fog architecture in February
    2016 [61] and February 2017 [142]. Their first draft was an initial overview of
    the Fog architecture. In their second draft, the Fog architecture was discussed
    in more detail. In their proposed architecture, they considered many key aspects
    of Fog architecture including performance, manageability, security, data analytics,
    and control. However, further research needs to be undertaken to explore and gain
    deeper insight into each layer with proper validation. 3) Interoperability and
    Federation of Fog Because of the Fog, users are able to process their request
    near them, which will minimize latency. However, what will happen if an increasing
    number of multiple latency-aware applications requests are sent in one shot to
    the Fog device and the Fog device is unable to handle that many requests? Will
    it be passed to the cloud for processing? If it is passed to the cloud, then latency
    requirements will not be satisfied. Thus, interoperability and federation among
    Fog clusters and Fog servers are necessary. Hence, if a Fog device is fully utilized,
    it will send requests to peer Fog devices or Fog servers for processing instead
    of sending them to the cloud. B. Platform-Related Issues 1) Resource Management
    Resources are most dynamic and heterogeneous in a Fog environment because of the
    diversity of devices and their available resources. All devices known as Fog devices
    are responsible for performing the computation of their own application. For example,
    a computer that relies on office staff to perform some ordinary email and documentation
    works might be a part of the Fog and might also act as a Fog device. In such a
    case, the amount of resources available for Fog computation is dynamic but predictable
    via the analysis of the long-term activity of its resources. This prediction is
    necessary because once the Fog task execution starts, and over a period of time,
    the status of the resources might change due to the request by the application
    for which the device is responsible for. If we compared this to the cloud, it
    is possible to know how much resources are currently available and whether or
    not they are exclusively used for cloud-based application requests. However, the
    Fog aims to use idle resources available on any Fog device with Fog computation
    always taking second priority. Hence, resource allocation and scheduling in the
    Fog is more challenging than traditional resource allocation and scheduling in
    the cloud. 2) Failure Management Fog device failure probability is always high
    because the devices are distributed and the management of Fog devices is not central.
    Hence, the devices could fail for many reasons; this could be due to hardware
    failure, software failure, or because of user activity. Besides these problems,
    some other reasons include connectivity, mobility, and power source, which also
    play a big role. Most of the devices in a Fog environment might be connected via
    wireless connections; it is obvious that wireless connections are not always reliable.
    The majority of devices that are connected via wireless are mobile, so these devices
    could change location to different clusters frequently. One other characteristic
    of these devices is that they are battery powered and might fail anytime. Hence,
    dealing with the complex nature of failure is very difficult. Also, it is necessary
    to ensure SLA by defining QoS parameters. So, the question is: What are the SLAs
    and how should they be defined? Also: What QoS parameters must be considered,
    so that the consumer and providers can retain a win-win situation? 3) Communication
    Between Different Layers The Fog should ensure uninterrupted connection with the
    devices to ensure application requirements of time-sensitive applications are
    met. If the application were to control an autonomous car or drone and if it were
    responsible for emergency surveillance, then failure in connectivity might cause
    serious harm. Even if connectivity to the cloud fails, the Fog still needs to
    ensure continuous connectivity. Thus, cross-layer connectivity among IoT devices,
    Fog, and cloud are of the utmost importance. The connection type and protocols
    used by IoT devices and Fog devices might be different. Therefore, how these issues
    will be handled is an important research issue. 4) User Participation Management
    Efficient Fog service management depends on the participation of users in Fog
    computation. However, how can user participation be managed? How do we deploy
    minimum resources in the case where no one wants to participate? We need to address
    these problems clearly with a feasible solution. One of the methods to increase
    user participation is through incentive and reward-based policies. With such policies,
    any user that participates in Fog computation will benefit. Even a user, who participates
    to complete his own request, will be rewarded by getting some discount based on
    his participation. However, this area needs to be addressed because the overall
    success of Fog computation depends on the participation of Fog devices, which
    are owned by various people and organizations. 5) Security and Privacy Fog devices
    are managed by different operators based on their location and ownership. Nobody
    would want to contribute to Fog computation if device control were compromised.
    Thus, how the security of a participant device will be maintained if the device
    were to take part in Fog computation is a big question. Another key security issue
    for this scenario is participant user data security. A participant device might
    have critical information. How will safety be guaranteed in such a case? On the
    other hand, critical data might be processed in a device, which is owned by a
    black hat hacker. How will safety and privacy be ensured then? Security issues
    also exist during cross-layer communication. Similar to the distributed nature
    of the Fog, security management should also be distributed, which will not be
    dependent on any central component. C. Application-Related Issues 1) Application
    Service Management Billions of IoT devices will be handled by the Fog paradigm,
    which will handle time-sensitive and time-insensitive applications. The degree
    of service, availability, and quality is most diverse in the Fog. Hence, service
    management is a typical issue for the entire Fog realm. Services should be microservice-based,
    so that agility and management issues can be handled properly. Further research
    is necessary to explore the possibility of Fog-based solutions. 2) Application
    Modeling Modeling Fog applications is complex because the application should collect
    data from different IoT devices, which use different protocols and sets of codes.
    Thus, it is challenging to model generic applications, which can be deployed with
    minimal effort. To solve this issue, a standard form of communication protocol
    is necessary, so that the modeled application can communicate and work with different
    types of IoT devices. SECTION X. Conclusion The Fog computing paradigm is currently
    in its infancy, so an extensive investigation is required for this emerging technology.
    In this survey, we presented and discussed the overview, architecture, state-of-the-art
    and other similar technologies in Fog computing. Based on the literature, we derived
    a taxonomy for Fog computing by analyzing the requirement of Fog infrastructure,
    platform, and applications. We also covered resource allocation and scheduling,
    fault tolerance, simulation tools, and microservices in Fog computing. Finally,
    we presented some challenging and open research issues. We strongly believe that
    this comprehensive survey will bring to light IoT application execution for a
    Fog computing environment as well as point towards the direction for current and
    future research in this rapidly growing research area. In this way, this computing
    paradigm, which is still immature, will be propelled towards achieving market
    adoption in the near future. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to sincerely

    of a physical asset enabled through data and simulators for real-time prediction,
    optimization, monitoring, controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances
    in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big

    there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only
    in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how
    we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental
    barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this

    Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have become two
    of the most trending and disruptive technologies. Blockchain technology has the
    ability to automate payment in cryptocurrency and to provide access to a shared
    ledger of data, transactions, and logs in a decentralized, secure, and trusted
    manner. Also with smart contracts, blockchain has the ability to govern interactions
    among participants with no intermediary or a trusted third party. AI, on the other
    hand, offers intelligence and decision-making capabilities for machines similar
    to humans. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on blockchain applications
    for AI. We review the literature, tabulate, and summarize the emerging blockchain
    applications, platforms, and protocols specifically targeting AI area. We also
    identify and discuss open research challenges of utilizing blockchain technologies
    for AI. An overview of AI systems and features in relation to blockchain and IoT-enabled

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Blockchain is one the most hyped innovations
    these days, and it has been gaining a lot of traction as a horizontal technology
    to be widely adopted in various fields [1]–[3]. Since its inception in 2008, blockchain
    continued to emerge as a disruptive innovation that will revolutionize the way
    we interact, automate payments, trace and track transactions [4]. Blockchain can
    be highly cost effective in eliminating the need for a centralized authority to
    govern and verify interactions and transactions among several participants. In
    blockchain, every transaction is cryptographically signed and verified by all
    mining nodes which hold a replica of the entire ledger which contains chained
    blocks of all transactions. This creates a secure, synchronized and shared timestamped
    records that cannot be altered [5]. Another prominent field that is gaining huge
    traction is artificial intelligence(AI) which allows a machine to have cognitive
    functions to learn, infer, and adapt based on data it collects. Recent market
    research predicts that AI market will grow up to 13 trillion US dollars by the
    year 2030. The massive production and generation of data by sensing systems, IoT
    devices, social media, and web applications have contributed to the rise of AI
    [6]. Such data can be utilized by various machine learning and deep learning techniques
    [7] to perform variety of analytics. To date, the majority of machine learning
    and deep learning methods of AI rely on a centralized model for training in which
    a group of servers run a specific model against training and validating datasets
    and many organizations like Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon manage the huge
    volumes of data to make informed decisions [8]. However, the centralized nature
    of AI may lead to the possibility of data tampering, as data can be subject to
    hacking and manipulation as it is managed and stored in centralized manner [9].
    Moreover, the data provenance and authenticity of the sources generating the data
    are not guaranteed [10]. This may lead to AI decision outcomes that can be highly
    erroneous, risky, and dangerous. The concept of decentralized AI has been recently
    emerging. Decentralized AI is basically a combination of AI and blockchain [8].
    The decentralized AI enables to process and perform analytics or decision making
    on trusted, digitally signed, and secure shared data that has been transacted
    and stored on the blockchain, in a distributed and decentralized fashion, without
    Trusted Third Parties or intermediaries [8], [9]. AI is known to work with huge
    volumes of data, and blockchain has now been foreseen as a trusted platform to
    store such data. The feature of blockchain smart contracts gives the ability to
    program the blockchain to govern transactions among participants involved in decision
    making or generating and accessing the data [11]. Smart contract-based autonomous
    systems and machines can learn and adapt to changes over time, and make trusted
    and accurate decision outcomes that are verified and validated by all mining nodes
    of the blockchain. Such decisions cannot be refuted, and can be traced, tracked
    and verified by all participating entities. AI techniques that utilize blockchain
    can offer decentralized learning to facilitate a trust and secure sharing of knowledge
    and decision outcomes across a large number of autonomous agents, which can contribute,
    coordinate, and vote on further decisions [12], [13]. To date, the literature
    lacks comprehensive reviews and studies on the role that blockchain plays in the
    context of AI. Existing literature reveals that researchers studied blockchain
    and AI in isolation, and their applications in various vertical domains and businesses
    [14]–[27]. A couple of studies discussed the integration of AI and blockchain,
    and the implications of such integration on the way we live, work, interact, and
    transact [9], [28]. The primary contributions of this paper can be summarized
    as follows: We give an overview of blockchain basics and key features and how
    these features can be leveraged for AI. We discuss how the integration of AI and
    blockchain can help in developing a new ecosystem of decentralized economy. In
    addition, we outline the key benefits brought by this integration. We present
    a detailed taxonomy of blockchain platforms, architecture and infrastructure types,
    and consensus protocols, along with existing decentralized AI applications. We
    report and discuss multiple practical use cases of AI applications and implementations
    utilizing blockchain in different vertical domains. We identify and outline open
    research challenges in adopting and leveraging blockchain features for future
    AI applications. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses
    the background of blockchain and AI technologies and how blockchain helps in transforming
    existing AI techniques. Section III presents the detailed taxonomy and Section
    IV describes blockchain applications for AI. Various open research challenges
    and issues are categorized in Section V. Section VI concludes the paper. SECTION
    II. Background In this section, we give an overview of blockchain and AI and discuss
    how blockchain technology can be leveraged to transform, in many radical ways,
    AI and its applications. A. Blockchain Blockchain is a distributed, open source,
    immutable, public digital ledger which is distributed among networked peers [4].
    Fundamentally, blockchain is a chain of blocks that make up the ledger. This ledger
    holds a permanent record of transactions and interactions that took place among
    participants accessing the distributed and decentralized blockchain network [11].
    Each block contains the details of the transaction and the asset exchanges (i.e.,
    Ether or Bitcoin) that took place between the users [4], [11]. Smart Contracts
    are codes that can be executed by the blockchain mining nodes. A smart contract
    is a self-executing code that can verify the enforcement of predefined terms and
    conditions [29]. Instead of validating digital currencies, as in Bitcoin, the
    blockchain mining nodes execute, verify and store data in blocks. A smart contract
    is triggered by consigning a transaction to its Ethereum address and executing
    it depending on the input given for that transaction. Ethereum is a blockchain
    based open source distributed platform that enables to program smart contracts
    [11]. Ethereum uses Ether as a currency for making payments for the transactions
    carried out on the Ethereum blockchain. Each participant in the Ethereum network
    is identified uniquely by an Ethereum Address (EA). Conventional blockchain is
    a very expensive medium for storing large amounts of data. For example, storing
    large files or documents on Bitcoin blockchain is very expensive as the size limit
    per block is limited to one megabyte [35]. To solve this problem, a decentralized
    storage medium is used for storing such data and hashes of the data are linked
    with the blockchain blocks or used within the blockchain smart contract code.
    Among the popular decentralized storage technologies are the Interplanetary File
    System (IPFS) [35], Swarm [36], Filecoin [37], BigChainDB [38], Storj [39], and
    many others. IPFS is a peer-to-peer, distributed and decentralized file system
    that is connected across nodes of computers that share a common file system [35].
    It is content-addressable, which means that the contents of IPFS can be accessed
    using IPFS hash addresses. Moreover, this file system becomes indisputable, since
    it works similar to the blockchain network by having a list of nodes, and does
    not allow any tampering of files. Therefore, providing high throughput and content-addressed
    block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. In addition, due to its
    decentralized nature, there is not a single point of failure i.e., if one device
    gets disconnected, the file can still be accessed [35]. B. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) The field of AI research defines itself as the study of “intelligent agents,”
    i.e., any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
    its chance of success at some goal [40]. Most AI systems in development today
    are typically specialized expert systems that use a database of knowledge to make
    decisions. However, many researchers are working to build AI systems that can
    apply truly intelligent decision making processes to a restricted set of problems,
    some of which may positively impact our daily lives. Table 1 shows few emerging
    trends in AI applications such as explainable AI [9], [30], digital twins [31],
    automated machine learning [32], hybrid learning models [33], and lean and augmented
    data learning [34], and the perceived benefits of using blockchain technologies.
    By integrating AI and blockchain technologies, decentralized AI applications and
    algorithms can be developed, with access to an identical view of a secure, trusted,
    shared platform of data, logs, knowledge, and decisions. Such platform can also
    be used to host a trusted trail of all records taken by AI algorithms before,
    during, and after the learning and decision making process [19]. TABLE 1 Latest
    Trends in AI Applications and Benefits of Using Blockchain FIGURE 1. An overview
    of AI systems and features in relation to blockchain and IoT-enabled ecosystems.
    Show All C. How Blockchain Can Transform AI Many shortcomings of AI and blockchain
    can be addressed effectively by combining both technological eco-systems [19],
    [41]. AI algorithms rely on data or information to learn, infer, and make final
    decisions. The machine learning algorithms work better when data are collected
    from a data repository or a platform that is reliable, secure, trusted, and credible.
    Blockchain serves as a distributed ledger on which data can be stored and transacted
    in a way that is cryptographically signed, validated, and agreed on by all mining
    nodes. Blockchain data are stored with high integrity and resiliency, and cannot
    be tampered with. When smart contracts are used for machine learning algorithms
    to make decisions and perform analytics, the outcome of these decisions can be
    trusted and undisputed. The consolidation of AI and blockchain can create secure,
    immutable, decentralized system for the highly sensitive information that AI-driven
    systems must collect, store, and utilize [41]. This concept results in significant
    improvements to secure the data and information in various fields, including medical,
    personal, banking and financial, trading, and legal data. Figure 1 shows that
    AI can benefit from the availability of many blockchain platforms for executing
    machine learning algorithms and tracing data that are stored on decentralized
    P2P storage systems. These data are typically originated by smart connected products
    that include variety of sources such as IoT devices, swarm robots, smart cities,
    buildings, and vehicles. The features and services of the cloud can be also harnessed
    for off-chain machine learning analytics and intelligent decision making, and
    for data visualization. Some of the significant features (as listed in Table 2)
    of leveraging blockchain for AI can be summarized as follows: Enhanced Data Security.
    Information held within blockchain is highly secure. Blockchains are very well
    known for storing sensitive and personal data in a disk-less environment. Blockchain
    databases hold data that are digitally signed, which means only the “respective
    private keys” must be kept secure [42]. This allows AI algorithms to work on secure
    data, and thereby ensuring more trusted and credible decision outcomes. Improved
    Trust on Robotic Decisions. Any decision made by AI agents becomes dysfunctional
    when it is difficult for consumers or users to understand and trust. Blockchain
    is well known for recording transactions in decentralized ledgers on a point-by-point
    basis, making it easier to accept and trust the decisions made, with confidence
    that the records have not been tampered with, during the human-involved auditing
    process [42]. Recording the decision making process of an AI system on a blockchain
    would increase transparency and it would gain public trust to understand the robotic
    decisions [43]. The need for a third party auditor can be eliminated in a swarm
    robotic ecosystem, where the consensus in the swarm can be achieved through an
    absolutely decentralized approach [42]–[44]. Collective Decision Making. In a
    robotic swarm ecosystem, all the agents need to work in coordination to achieve
    the swarm goal [44]–[46]. The decentralized and distributed decision-making algorithms
    have been adopted in many robotic applications, without the need for a central
    authority. Robots take decisions by voting and outcomes are determined by majority
    rules. Each robot can cast its vote in the form of a transaction, where blockchain
    is public for all robots which can be utilized for verification of voting results.
    This process is repeated by all robots until the swarm comes to a decisive conclusion.
    Decentralized Intelligence. For taking smart high level decisions which involve
    multiple agents to perform different subtasks that have access to the common training
    data (e.g., in case of supervised learning), different individual cybersecurity
    AI agents can be combined to provide fully coordinated security across the underlying
    networks and to solve scheduling issues [45], [47]. High Efficiency. Multiuser
    business processes, which involve multiple stakeholders such as individual users,
    business firms, and governmental organizations, are inherently inefficient due
    to multiparty authorization of business transactions. The integration of AI and
    blockchain technologies enables intelligent Decentralized Autonomous Agents (or
    DAOs) for automatic and fast validation of data/value/asset transfers among different
    stakeholders [48]. TABLE 2 Key Features and Benefits of Blockchain Integration
    With AI SECTION III. Taxonomy This section presents a detailed taxonomic discussion
    of key concepts to enable blockchain technologies for AI applications. Figure
    2 shows the classification tree of existing works found in the literature which
    we categorized in terms of decentralization of AI methodologies and operations,
    blockchain infrastructure and types, and the underlying consensus protocols utilized
    for distributed decentralized transaction validations across underlying networks.
    FIGURE 2. Taxonomy of blockchain for AI. Show All A. Decentralized AI Applications
    AI applications operate autonomously in order to perform informed decisions by
    executing different planning, search, optimization, learning, knowledge discovery,
    and knowledge management strategies. However, the decentralization of AI operations
    is a complex and challenging task. 1) Autonomic Computing One of the key goals
    of AI applications is to enable fully (or partially) autonomous operations whereby
    multiple intelligent agents (i.e., small computer programs) perceive their constituent
    environments, preserve their internal states, and perform specified actions accordingly
    [49]. In order to operate autonomously, modern computing systems need to handle
    massive heterogeneity at all verticals including data sources, devices, data processing
    systems, data storage systems, and application interfaces, to name a few. The
    enablement of multiagent systems at all verticals does not only facilitate the
    handling of heterogeneity but it also helps in establishing inter-layer and intralayer
    operability across entire systems [50]. The blockchain architecture can play a
    vital role by ensuring operational decentralization and keeping permanent footprints
    of interactions between users, data, applications, devices, and systems which
    leads toward the development of fully decentralized autonomous systems. 2) Optimization
    Finding a set of best solutions from all possible solutions is one of the main
    features of AI-enabled applications and systems [51]. Modern AI applications and
    systems operate in various environments including pervasive and ubiquitous environments
    (e.g., edge computing systems), resource-constrained environments (e.g., mobile
    devices/systems), geographically bounded systems (e.g., personal area networks,
    wireless local area networks, etc.), and centralized massively parallel and distributed
    computing systems (e.g., cloud computing systems) [52]. Based upon application-level
    and system-level objectives, the optimization strategies work in constrained or
    unconstrained environments [53]. These strategies facilitate finding best solutions
    such as selecting most relevant data sources in pervasive environments, best candidate
    edge or cloud servers for data and application processing, or enabling the resource-efficient
    data management in large-scale distributed computing environments. Current optimization
    strategies are executed with centralized control considering system-wide/application-wide
    optimization objectives which results in extraneous and irrelevant data processing
    and inferior system/application performance [54]. The enablement of decentralized
    optimization strategies using blockchain opens a new window of research and development
    opportunities. The decentralized optimization leads to increased system performance
    by processing highly relevant data. The decentralized optimization is also beneficial
    when multiple strategies with different optimization objectives need to be run
    simultaneously across applications and systems. 3) Planning AI applications and
    systems execute planning strategies in order to collaborate with other applications
    and systems and solve complex problems in new environments. Planning strategies
    help in operational efficiency and resilience of AI applications and systems by
    taking current input state and executing different logic and rule-based algorithms
    to reach predefined goals [55]. Currently, the centralized planning is complicated
    and time consuming task; therefore, blockchain based decentralized AI planning
    strategies are needed to offer more robust strategies with permanent tracking
    and provenance history. The blockchain is also useful for devising critical and
    immutable plans for strategic applications and mission critical systems. 4) Knowledge
    Discovery and Knowledge Management Modern AI applications handle large amounts
    of data streams and require support for centralized big data processing systems.
    The centralized knowledge discovery and knowledge management benefits the provisioning
    of application-wide and system-wide intelligence, however, the applications enable
    customized knowledge patterns for specific groups of users, applications, devices,
    and systems [56]. The decentralization of knowledge discovery processes and decentralized
    knowledge management is envisaged to provide personalized knowledge patterns considering
    the needs of all stakeholders in the system. In addition, the blockchain technologies
    can facilitate in secure and traceable knowledge transfer among different stakeholders
    in AI applications and systems. 5) Perception Intelligent agents and bots in AI
    applications and systems continuously collect, interpret, select, and organize
    data from their ambient environments using centralized perception strategies which
    results in monolithic data collection [57]. The decentralized perception strategies
    can facilitate the collection of data from different views. The blockchain based
    decentralization facilitates tracing the perception trajectories, secure transfer
    of collected data, and immutable data storage. The decentralized perception strategies
    are useful because the applications and systems do not need to collect the data
    streams for successful and high quality perceptions repeatedly. Considering the
    permanent nature of blockchain, only the footprints of successful perceptions
    should be stored on blockchain. 6) Learning The learning algorithms stay at the
    heart of AI applications in order to enable automation and knowledge discovery
    processes. Learning algorithms vary in terms of supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised,
    ensemble, reinforcement, transfer, and deep learning models. These learning models
    solve different machine learning problems from classification to clustering and
    regression analysis to frequent pattern mining. Conventional learning models are
    trained and deployed using centralized infrastructure to achieve global intelligence.
    The decentralized learning models can help in achieving highly distributed and
    autonomous learning systems that support fully coordinated local intelligence
    across all verticals in modern AI systems [58], [59]. In addition, the blockchain
    enables immutable and highly secure versioning of learning models by maintaining
    provenance and historical aspects of data. However, considering the permanent
    nature of smart contracts, learning models need to be trained and tested well
    prior to deployment on blockchain. 7) Search AI applications need to operate in
    large and sparse search spaces (i.e., big datasets or multivariable high dimensional
    datastreams); therefore, efficient search strategies become the essence of AI
    technologies. The search strategies are designed by considering different factors
    such as completeness, complexity (i.e., time and space), and optimality. These
    strategies generally operate on nonlinear data structures such as trees and graphs
    whereby the algorithms start their expansion from an initial state and gradually
    expand until finding the required variable or completing the traversals in whole
    search spaces. Normally, search strategies are implemented using large-scale centralized
    and distributed infrastructure in order to maximize the operational efficiency
    [60]. However, their implementation using decentralized infrastructure needs careful
    investigation. It is envisaged that instead of deploying core search strategies,
    blockchains and decentralized infrastructure should be used to permanently and
    securely store successful search traces and traversal paths which could provide
    optimal search solutions of similar operations in the future. 8) Reasoning Logic
    programming is an essential component of AI applications that allows to develop
    inductive or deductive reasoning rules to reach decisions. The centralized reasoning
    in AI applications leads toward generalized global behavior across all application
    components [61]. To handle this issue, blockchain based distributed reasoning
    strategies are envisaged to facilitate the development of personalized reasoning
    strategies which could be more beneficial during perception, learning, and model
    deployment. In addition, smart contract based decentralized distributed reasoning
    on blockchain ensures the availability of unforgettable reasoning processes which
    may help in future executions of similar reasoning strategies. B. Decentralized
    AI Operations AI Applications generally handle large amounts of data for better
    and versatile decision making. However, centralized data storage using clouds,
    data centers, and clusters, becomes a major bottleneck for developing highly secure
    and privacy preserving AI applications. In addition, learning model development
    and deployment become tedious in some situations. Table 3 shows comparisons of
    some recent blockchain implementations that could potentially be adopted for AI
    applications. TABLE 3 Key Features and Benefits of Blockchain Platforms 1) Decentralized
    Storage The centralized data storage becomes highly susceptible in terms of privacy
    and security when it involves personal and sensitive data about users, locations,
    activities, health records, and financial information. In addition, large-scale
    data collection exposes the scaling and capacity related issues of centralized
    infrastructure where AI applications need to process, transform, and store big
    datasets. Blockchain-based decentralized storage infrastructure facilitate in
    cryptographically secure data storage across the participating networks [38],
    [62]–[64]. In these systems, each node keeps a client-centric (a client could
    be a user, application, or node performing transactions on the blockchain) publicly
    encrypted copy of whole database in order to ensure data availability for desired
    clients. The respective clients can mine and use their own data whenever needed.
    Sharding and Swarming are core solutions for decentralized storage [65]–[67].
    Sharding is the process of creating logical partitions of databases whereby each
    partition is assigned a unique key which is used to access it. The shards are
    further grouped together and their collected storage is supported by a group of
    nodes in the network in the form of swarms. Swarms reduce latency in AI applications
    by enabling parallel data access from multiple nodes in the network. In addition,
    scalability and reliability of storage increases because of geographically distributed
    multiparty decentralized storage systems. A few emerging decentralized data storage
    systems include Storj, Swarm, Sia, FileCoin, and IPFS which are further reviewed
    later in Section IV-A. 2) Data Management In addition to efficient decentralized
    storage, AI applications need to manage the data such that highly relevant, accurate,
    and complete datasets are collected from reliable data sources. Traditionally,
    AI applications run centralized data management schemes which execute across all
    the nodes in the underlying network [68]. These strategies include data filtration,
    data segmentation, context-aware data storage and routing in underlying networks,
    temporal data management and intelligent data management schemes. Considering
    decentralized storage networks and immutability constraints in blockchains, centralized
    data management becomes hugely inefficient because it will not only increase data
    duplication in case of minor changes in the data but it will also need to transfer
    similar datasets repeatedly. In case of big datasets, this massive data transfer
    will lead toward quick bandwidth overloading and increased backhaul network traffic;
    therefore, decentralized data management becomes essential for blockchain based
    AI applications. The decentralized data management schemes are envisaged to be
    deployed at node levels in the network considering temporal and spatial attributes
    in the data. In addition, the decentralized data management schemes can put the
    metadata on the blockchain in order to maintain security and provenance of the
    data. The actual data could be stored in traditional large-scale storage systems
    such as cloud data centers and clusters. In the case of client-centric small datasets,
    the metadata and actual data are stored on the blockchain and data are managed
    across the network using token-based incentives for nodes storing different shards
    or participating in the swarms. 3) Learning Model Development Learning plays key
    role in AI applications to understand the environment from current data and perform
    informed decision making based on new data. Normally, learning models are trained
    and tested before actual deployment in the real systems. The centralized training
    is costly because the models need to learn from the whole datasets and tend to
    be prone to overfitting (i.e., produce outputs based on memorized data), however,
    modern AI applications need to handle continuously evolving data streams. The
    decentralization of learning model development process is a feasible approach
    in order to develop resource-efficient learning models for client applications
    [58]. Decentralized learning algorithms take the input datasets from relevant
    swarms and shards and produce highly personalized learning models for each client.
    In addition, blockchain technologies can facilitate the maintenance of provenance
    of data as well as immutable history of learning models which may evolve over
    a certain period of time. Further the decentralized learning models could become
    benchmark for similar clients in the blockchain network where the users do not
    need to train the model from scratch, rather, they can incrementally build their
    own models by tuning and training new models. Once trained efficiently, the learning
    models could be tested using multiple smart contracts in decentralized applications.
    4) Model Deployment The real performance of a trained model is assessed after
    deployment in production environments. However, the model deployment is a frequent
    and iterative process whereby developers need to continuously improve the models
    and correct the biases (i.e., producing a specific set of decisions by ignoring
    rest of possible decisions) in order to produce highly effective and informed
    decisions. The model deployment in centralized systems is a straightforward iterative
    process, however, it becomes challenging when deployed in decentralized systems
    [69]. Smart contract based model deployment addresses these challenges by permanently
    recording the changes and maintaining the immutable versioning of different models.
    In addition, model sharing between different AI applications becomes secure and
    more trustworthy since the developers can track the provenance and all footprints
    of any specific version of a model. C. Blockchain Types for AI Applications Blockchain
    technologies are categorized as permissioned (i.e., only authorized users can
    access the blockchain applications in private, consortium, or cloud based settings)
    or permissionless (i.e., publicly accessible for all users via the Internet) systems.
    1) Public Public blockchains are known to be permissionless systems where users
    can download the blockchain code into their own systems, modify it, and use it
    according to their own requirements [4], [11]. In addition, public blockchains
    are easily accessible and open for read and write operations by all participants
    on the network. Due to their openness, user identities and transactional privacy
    information on these blockchain are managed using anonymous and pseudonymous data
    on the network. Also, these public blockchains use complex protocols for security
    and consensus mechanisms. The asset and data transfer at these blockchains use
    native tokens (i.e., cryptocurrencies or value pointers) for each public blockchain.
    Public blockchains are widely adopted due to their massive decentralization and
    openness, however, the participants (i.e., users/validators) on these blockchains
    are always unidentified. Hence, these blockchains are always prone to malicious
    security attacks which can result in massive value and data theft. Public blockchains
    need consensus of at least 51% validators and use complex mathematics to break
    security codes which result in large energy consumption and are also prone to
    attack in case the attackers gain control on 51% validators on the network. The
    transaction approval time on public blockchains is relatively longer when compared
    with private and consortium blockchains. Typically, a transaction on public blockchain
    is approved in 10 minutes or more but this approval time depends on the number
    of participants on the network and the mathematical complexity of employed consensus
    algorithms. 2) Private A private blockchain is managed by a single organization.
    Unlike public blockchains, the private blockchains are designed as permissioned
    systems where users and participants in the systems are pre-approved for read/write
    operations and are always known within the network [87]. Private blockchains are
    comparatively faster due to known identities of validators and pre-approved participants
    in the network; therefore, it requires less complex mathematical operations to
    validate transactions on the network. In addition, private blockchains can transfer
    any kind of indigenous data, values, and assets within the network. The approval
    of transactions and asset transfers are managed using voting or multiparty consensus
    algorithms which consume low energy and enable fast transactions. The transaction
    approval time on private blockchains usually remains lower than one second. 3)
    Consortium Consortium blockchains (also known as federated blockchains) are operated
    by a group of organizations. The groups are usually formed based on the mutual
    interests of participating organizations [88]. Different groups such as banks,
    governmental organizations, and private blockchain companies offer different types
    of federated blockchains. Like private blockchains, consortium blockchains operate
    as permissioned systems, however, few participants can perform both read and write
    operations on the blockchain. Usually, all the participants on the network can
    read the data on the blockchain, however, a few authorized and trusted users can
    write the data on the blockchain. The consortium blockchains are comparatively
    faster than public blockchains because the participants are always pre-approved
    with known identities. In addition, these blockchains consume less energy because
    of voting based or multiparty approval based consensus protocols. A typical transaction
    on federated blockchains gets approval within one second. 4) Blockchain-as-a-Service
    (BaaS) Cloud service providers are focusing on blockchain technologies due to
    massive adoption and acceptance by governments and large enterprises. Major cloud
    vendors like Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are enabling their environments to develop
    and test blockchain services for their customers [89], [90]. The emergence of
    BaaS is envisaged to benefit both private and consortium blockchain companies
    whereby their major focus remains on value addition through application development,
    testing, and deployment without considering underlying network, storage, and computational
    infrastructure. The enablement of BaaS not only leads toward new cross-industry
    public-private consortia but it also helps in leveraging new business opportunities
    and business-customer interaction models. Developers are also empowered with single-click
    provisioning of BaaS services in order to write the smart contracts. Since the
    major cloud vendors already offer a large plethora of cloud services for AI applications,
    the integration of BaaS with AI services is opening a new world of opportunities
    for application developers. D. Decentralized Infrastructure for AI Applications
    Traditionally blockchain architectures were designed as linear infrastructure
    based on the combination of linked list data structures and hashing strategies.
    However, nonlinear infrastructure based on graph theory and queuing information
    models are also emerging to cater the needs of real-time applications and handle
    big data. 1) Linear Infrastructure The single chain based blockchain architectures
    grow linearly whereby new blocks are appended at the end of the chain. Early decentralized
    systems operate on single chains, however, these systems have multiple issues.
    Single chains scale up slowly and compromise the real-time performance of decentralized
    applications [4], [11]. In addition, separate single chains are required for each
    business scenario therefore value, information, and asset exchange in multiple
    chains is impossible. Single chain blockchains for AI applications can be used
    for single task AI applications performing search, optimization, and learning,
    or operating autonomously in homogeneous environments. Single chain based blockchains
    could be more useful when, instead of executing the AI applications using smart
    contracts, only the performance histories need to be stored permanently. For example,
    how a deep learning model is producing accurate results when applied to the diagnosis
    of liver cancer in radiology applications. Another example could be the successful
    search footprints of remote industrial robots. Since AI applications usually operate
    in unconstrained environments therefore putting whole AI application components
    on blockchain is not a feasible choice. 2) Nonlinear Infrastructure Nonlinear
    blockchain architectures are implemented in the form of multichain architectures
    whereby blockchain topologies are used in the form of parent-child chains, main-side
    chains, and parallel chains [91]. The multi-chain architectures are not only scalable
    for real-time performance but also support diverse business scenarios and cross-chain
    value transfers. In multi-chain architecture one or more chains keep information
    about other chains and serve(s) as main chain. Rest of the chains serve as side,
    child, or parallel chains. The child and side chains normally operate similarly,
    however, in child chains, the business scenarios are tightly linked with parent
    chains but side chains can totally operate independently from main chains. The
    parallel chains operate independently from other chains. The value transfer between
    different chains is performed using “pegging” approach where a two-way peg process
    is executed for bidirectional value transfer at a fixed exchange rate between
    chains. The exchange value is represented by native coins or tokens in the blockchain.
    The detailed discussion on nonlinear blockchains is presented in following studies
    for interested readers [71]. Nonlinear blockchains for AI applications facilitate
    the execution of multiple interrelated or independent AI tasks in the decentralized
    applications. In addition, the scalability features allow to execute AI applications
    in both development and deployment phases in parallel. AI components in production
    environment are deployed on the main/parent chain while the training and testing
    applications are deployed on the testnets or side chains. Nonlinear architectures
    also benefit emerging applications such as those using reinforcement and adaptive
    learning algorithms where the main applications need to continuously update their
    performance by retraining the learning models. In this case, learning models are
    developed on side chains and deployed on main chains. E. The Role of Consensus
    Protocols for AI Applications This subsection presents common consensus protocols
    and how they can impact the performance of AI applications on blockchain. Table
    4 shows different implementations of these protocols. TABLE 4 Consensus Protocols
    Used by Blockchain Platforms 1) Proof or Work (PoW) PoW is the pioneer consensus
    protocol proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous founder of cryptoccurency
    and decentralized distributed ledger technologies. Popular public blockchain systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, validate transactions after participation of at
    least 51% nodes on the underlying network using PoW consensus protocol [4], [11].
    Since the validating nodes operate anonymously and in large quantity, these nodes
    need to mine the blocks by solving a complex and random mathematical problem and
    break the hash code to read the transactions on the blockchain. The successful
    nodes transmit the solution on peer-to-peer network to receive the rewards. New
    transactions and data are permanently added to the blockchain when 51% nodes on
    the network successfully solve the mathematical problem. Although PoW proved to
    be highly adopted consensus protocol, in large networks it consumes gigantic amount
    of energy and increases delay in transaction approvals. AI applications have high
    frequency of write operations because the intelligent algorithms continuously
    update the decision structures for informed decisions. Therefore, PoW protocols
    become performance bottleneck in real-time AI applications. In addition, 51% attack
    on the underlying network can compromise the security of AI applications. 2) Proof
    of Stake (PoS) PoS based consensus protocols solve the high energy consumption
    issue of PoW [92]. The PoS protocols work by defining big stakeholders on the
    blockchain network and allowing them to create new blocks. These protocols select
    the validators based on different criteria (i.e., random validators, delegated
    validators, high frequency transacting validators, or validators holding coins
    for longer period). PoS proved to be energy-efficient when compared with PoW and
    it also indirectly solves the security problem by stopping the anonymous validators
    and allowing only those validators who own the native currency of the blockchains.
    However, the validators have nothing to lose on the blockchain if they do not
    validate the transactions; therefore, it may cause delay while creating new blocks.
    PoS could be useful for delay-tolerant AI applications but these protocols are
    not suitable when AI applications need to handle streaming data, detect changes,
    and performed real-time informed decisions. 3) Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
    BFT is the majority voting algorithm that rules out validations from malicious
    nodes on the blockchain network [81]. The malicious nodes are already part of
    the blockchain but contain malicious intent code that can directly/indirectly
    lead to incorrect validations and corrupt the data stored on the blockchain. Since
    all nodes are part of blockchain networks, it becomes challenging for BFT protocol
    to find these malicious nodes. Although its implementation is difficult, BFT algorithms
    are historically used in critical systems such as airplane engine systems, large-scale
    sensory systems, and nuclear systems. Different variants of BFT protocols are
    used. Simple BFT handles fault tolerance as long as at least two-third non-faulty
    nodes are present on the network. Other BFT algorithms handle the fault tolerance
    by enforcing digital signatures and restricting communications between peer nodes
    on the network. Considering successful implementations of BFT algorithms in critical
    systems, BFT based consensus could become handy for AI applications. 4) Proof
    of Activity (PoAc) The PoAc protocol is a hybrid of PoW and PoS. This protocol
    initially works on empty blockchains using PoW algorithm and solves the 51% attack
    problem [93]. Initially, PoAc protocol solves complex mathematical problems and
    the validators start receiving the rewards which increases their stake on blockchains.
    The protocol then enables PoS algorithm for validators having acceptable stake
    on the blockchain. PoAc has been proven to be efficient in terms of security,
    storage, and network communication. Therefore, it could become handy for AI applications
    requiring less data availability and more security. 5) Proof of Burn (PoB) The
    PoB protocol allows the validators only if they spend their coins by sending to
    a public, verifiable, unspendable, and invalid address. Once the users burn their
    coins, they are immediately allowed to create new blocks and get rewarded [94].
    PoB benefits the users by allowing them to invest initially and create their stake
    on the blockchain and become authorized validators. It also solves the energy
    consumption problem of PoW. In addition, coin burning strategy reduces the number
    of coins on the blockchain; therefore, coin value increases gradually. Coin burning
    also benefits in balancing the number of coins on the blockchain, spending unsold
    coins, and paying for transaction fees on the network. AI applications can harness
    PoB protocols if they want to incentivize the users in order to maintain the value
    of underlying decisions. For example, the applications which need to maintain
    a specific level of accuracy, a certain number of clusters, or minimum number
    of objects to be found, can burn the learning models and search trees in order
    to maintain the value across the blockchain. 6) Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) Instead
    of engaging all users in the validation process, PoET protocols find a leader
    who can create new blocks on the chain. A PoET protocol works by associating a
    random timer with each node on the network and the node with minimum expiry is
    selected as the leader [95]. The leader node creates the new blocks and transmits
    its signature to the whole network. A PoET protocol continuously executes the
    random leader selection algorithm and finds new leaders all the time. It also
    enables to find malicious users in case the same nodes are selected as leaders
    or the minimum timer value is frequently assigned to specific nodes. PoET solves
    the energy consumption problem of PoW but due to random timer assignment, AI applications
    could become slow since the system needs to wait until the expiry of time. PoET
    could be useful when used with delay-tolerant applications. 7) Proof of Capacity
    (PoC) Traditional PoW algorithms become computationally intensive because they
    need to find random nonce values in order to unlock the blocks. The PoC protocol,
    also known as proof of space, works as an alternative protocol by discovering
    the hard drive space on the nodes of the blockchain network [96]. Instead of random
    generation, it stores all possible nonce values on hard drive and finds the matching
    nonce-hash pairs to unlock the blocks. Using PoC, the nodes with large disk space
    get more stake with high probability. 8) Proof of Authority (PoA) PoA solves high
    energy consumption issue of PoW. PoA protocols also solve the problem of dependency
    in PoS whereby validators must have monetary stake on the blockchain. A PoA protocol
    works by delegating authoritative control to specific nodes that collectively
    form the consensus based on majority votes to create new blocks on the network
    [100]. PoA is proved to be energy efficient and minimal delay consensus protocol
    but it is more suitable for private networks in order to delegate the validation
    authority to legitimate stakeholders. Therefore, blockchain implementers must
    consider legal identity of validators, a well-defined eligibility criteria to
    act as validator, and a universal eligibility criteria for all stakeholders to
    act as validators. Despite their energy efficiency and cost effectiveness, the
    security threats to PoA always remain high due to security attacks on validators
    who can potentially become a source of attack across the network. However, PoA
    could be used as an alternate consensus protocol for those AI applications that
    are deployed on private or consortium networks since all the validators are known
    across the system. 9) Proof of Importance (PoI) PoI protocols are similar to their
    PoA counterpart whereby validating nodes are ranked considering frequency of successful
    validations. The validators with high frequency get more importance on the blockchain
    and their approved transactions or blocks over-weigh other validators on the network
    because PoI sets the minimum threshold that must be met by nodes for successful
    validations [101]. Since the importance of validators is established considering
    their previous successful validations, a PoI protocol ensures high trust between
    participating nodes. Therefore, this protocol can be useful for AI applications
    on public blockchains. However, in private and consortium networks, PoI can lead
    to serious conflicts among stakeholders because important stakeholders can potentially
    monopolize the whole network. Although we discussed the major implementations,
    a thorough study of literature reveals that there are many other consensus protocols
    that could be potentially used for AI applications. Since these studies are relevantly
    either new or not widely accepted yet, we do not discuss these works in this paper.
    Interested readers may explore Proof of Luck [102], Proof of Exercise [103], Proof
    of Ownership [104], Proof of Vote [105], and Proof of Retrievability [106] for
    further discussions on consensus protocols. SECTION IV. Blockchain-Enabled AI
    Applications In this section, we describe works reported in the literature on
    how blockchain can be leveraged in AI to improve the reliability, security, transparency,
    trust, and management of data and algorithms in AI applications. A. Decentralized
    Data Storage and Management With AI The combination of AI and blockchain technologies
    has paved the way for many stable systems that support the interaction of multiple
    agents; therefore, providing an excellent platform for safe and secure data management,
    storage and transfer. Some of the key systems that utilize this combination are
    discussed in this subsection. A decentralized, multiagent approach for vehicle
    routing in a large-scale dynamic environment is proposed in [107] and [108]. This
    approach is based on environment-centric coordination mechanism, inspired by ant
    colonies. The authors propose an approach where intelligent agents scrutinize
    the environment on behalf of vehicles and forecast a congestion. This anticipatory
    vehicle information is collected and distributed in a decentralized fashion. This
    approach fits the distributed nature of the traffic domain and ensures that scalability
    requirements are more easily met when compared to centralized systems. This approach
    can route vehicles more efficiently by using forecast information; thus, avoiding
    congested routes and providing better guidance in rerouting. Further, the experimental
    results of this decentralized approach indicate a performance improvement of 35%
    in terms of speed; therefore, helping drivers reach their destinations faster
    [107], [108]. The intelligent approach utilized by multiple agents in a decentralized
    environment guarantees to not only avoid existing congestions but also to prevent
    congestions in the near future. The combination of AI and blockchain technology
    adds progressive value to biomedical research and healthcare sector [109]. The
    authors present a novel, decentralized model to assess the value of time and the
    combined value of personal data in an AI-moderated healthcare data exchange on
    the blockchain. An overview of AI and blockchain technologies is presented in
    this paper which may be used to accelerate biomedical analysis, improve predictive
    analysis techniques and empower patients with new tools to manage and control
    their own data and help them monetize their exclusive personal data with incentive
    benefits to undergo perpetual monitoring of their health. An AI-blockchain based
    system can dramatically simplify data acquisition. They allow the user to upload
    her/his data directly to the system and grants permission to use her/his data
    if it were bought through the system using transparent pricing formula determined
    by a data value model and it guarantees fair tracking of all data usage activities.
    Mamoshina et al. [109] discuss various promising machine learning techniques in
    practice and in development that include capsule networks, recursive cortical
    networks, and many other advances that are being made in symbolic learning and
    natural language processing. However, techniques such as transfer learning, recurrent
    neural networks, and generative adversarial networks are building up acceptance
    to be applied to the blockchain based decentralized personal data marketplaces.
    The integrated features of these technologies can play a significant role in healthcare
    assistance too. Socially assistive robots can be employed in elderly care assistance
    as discussed in [110]. As there is an increasing demand for elder care and a shortage
    of professional caregivers, socially assistive robots are one of the most promising
    technologies that can act as a communication interface and identify the needs
    of the elderly or seriously ill patients. These robots aim to create a positive
    user experience, motivate the patients and to improve the quality of life by assisting
    the patients in regular exercise, reduce stress levels and for personal caregiving
    [110]. Though AI techniques are efficient classifying and analyzing large datasets
    in the healthcare sector with the availability of huge volumes of raw medical
    data from the sensors of connected IoT devices, there are severe issues of integrity
    in terms of data collection and storage [43]. Also, it is a jeopardy to trust
    a robotic agents’ decision or activity in the medical field where all medical
    records need to be accurate and tamper-proof during a critical decision-making
    process. However, the combination of blockchain and AI technology could personalize
    medicine, quadrate treatments and health recommendations based on a patient’s
    medical history, genetic lineage, stress levels, geography, atmospheric conditions,
    past medical conditions and aid in improving trust on robotic decisions. The information
    can be securely stored on a distributed, decentralized and immutable patient record,
    as well as a graph-based relationship database, can be formulated [43] for storing
    unstructured data and the relationships amongst the data. Figure 3 presents an
    outline of the combined features of AI and blockchain technologies for the medical
    field which include various stages such as diagnosis, analytics, critical decision
    making and validation of medical test reports, etc. FIGURE 3. Collective intelligence
    for decentralized healthcare. Show All Machine learning algorithms can use the
    graph database to extract data, classify patterns and predict future prescriptions.
    Bayesian network, a graph database built on relationships of cause and effect,
    is an example of machine learning algorithms that use graph data to compute latent
    variables [43]. The vitality of a Bayesian network lies in its capability to regulate
    probabilities and predictions. When applied to health data, it can make effective
    predictions between unrelated data. The relationship of all entities in the healthcare
    graph database (such as physicians, specialists, medical researchers, drug manufacturers,
    patients, etc. and their activities which include treatment methods, prescriptions,
    and intake of drugs by patients) can be recorded on the immutable transaction
    log. The importance of handling vast volumes of data, exponential increase in
    computing power, and tremendous growth in people’s acceptance of connected applications
    and systems to register actions have become top priorities in AI and machine learning
    research [111]. Since artificial neural networks require large sets of data and
    high computing power for training purposes, a significant amount of resources
    to create powerful data centers to acquire large datasets have become essential
    [40], [112]. Woods [111] emphasizes the importance of combining AI techniques
    and blockchain infrastructure to tackle the security threats faced by the Internet,
    where bots-bots and human-bots interactions have increased, as 52% of the web
    traffic is generated by bots. Due to increased bot traffic, it is estimated that
    in the near future the bot-bot communications will outpace the human-bot interactions.
    Bots will need to be able to query each other for identification and then look
    up the history of the data and ratings before interactions. During an audit process,
    the query information and data can be stored on blockchain and a higher level
    of transparency and security can be achieved [111]. The integration of blockchain
    and machine learning technologies is a stronger combination that provides an immutable,
    strong consensus mechanism, ultra-secure decentralized, self-sovereign identity
    which has the stupendous potential to rebalance and improve machine learning algorithms.
    B. Decentralized Infrastructure for AI Blockchain infrastructure introduced three
    new characteristics to the traditional distributed architectures which include
    decentralized and shared control, immutable audit trails, and native asset exchanges
    [11]. Combined with AI techniques, this infrastructure provides users with qualitatively
    new data models, shared control of AI training data and models, and leads to improved
    trustworthiness on data. AI requires huge data, which is provided by blockchain,
    to produce better data models. This subsection discusses existing decentralized
    infrastructure and frameworks for AI applications. An open source platform that
    incentivizes individuals to build a distributed and decentralized AI agents thereby
    creating a synergy between distributed AI and decentralized blockchain is carried
    out by ChainIntel [113]. ChainIntel is aimed to deploy and use AI models in decentralized
    applications (DApps). This platform aims to reinforce and consign the execution
    of AI models to various parts of the network, enabling scalable, robust and smart
    applications. ChainIntel is currently working to allow distributed AI model execution,
    where some parts of a deep neural network run on local devices and other parts
    run on a set of active nodes in the ChainIntel P2P network [113]. This work aims
    to incorporate various AI features into decentralized applications such as facial
    recognition, speech and image recognition, semantic analysis, disparity identification,
    smart homes, smart cities and countless more domains. Decentralized networks such
    as Ethereum and IPFS can handle the huge computational resources and data storage
    respectively, thereby providing a high level of privacy and tamper-proof records
    [44], [113]. This open-source decentralized AI platform aims to phase out monopolization
    of AI services provided by big companies in which the miner-nodes should be optimized
    to solve a huge number of matrix computations and directs it to be effectively
    decentralized. The energy-based infrastructure can reap huge benediction by combining
    the AI and blockchain technologies and their features. Mylrea and Gourisetti [114]
    have explored how blockchain technology could possibly modernize and automate
    energy and IoT infrastructure toward a stable system. The author highlights how
    AI enabled blockchain solutions can assist in increasing cyber resilience and
    augmenting the exchange of energy resources in a distributed environment by using
    encryption techniques and by automating the transaction. Mylrea and Gourisetti
    [114] discuss how AI-enabled blockchain solutions can help to analyze huge datasets
    gathered from numerous platforms such as frequency and load changes, industrial
    control anomalies and frequency changes, and classify the datasets into weighted
    relationships, which can be tracked and automated with the help of blockchain
    technology. Artificial neural networks are being employed to analyze and understand
    the data patterns whereas blockchain based smart contracts can be exercised to
    secure the energy data and its transactions on the decentralized network. An overall
    vision for transforming the energy market and utility industries with blockchain,
    robotics, and AI techniques is presented in Figure 4. A key-less signature blockchain
    infrastructure (KSBI) is highlighted in this work, as KSBI differs from PoW and
    retains integrity of original data and its ability to scale to industrial applications
    to add one trillion data items to the blockchain each second, and to verify the
    data item from the blockchain within the next second [114]. Optimization and security
    issues in the energy grid can be resolved and improved by blockchain by providing
    a verifiable distributed ledger which helps in improving transparency and integrity
    in the energy delivery sector [114]. If implemented successfully, this approach
    can replace traditional energy meters with a dynamic and decentralized distributed
    ledger. This disruptive combination may endow stakeholders and investors in renewable
    energy infrastructure with the power to vote, efficiently automate the energy-bidding
    auction, and monitor and deliver services based on the agreements made on smart
    contracts in a transparent and distributed environment [114]. Yu et al. [115]
    designed a high-performance blockchain platform for smart devices. This platform
    enables a stable connection between devices through the node-to-node mapping mechanism
    using technologies such as distributed network architecture, intelligent devices
    node mapping, as well as PBFT-DPOC consensus algorithm. Yu et al. [115] propose
    a new Delegated Proof of Contribution (DPOC) algorithm to facilitate any node
    to run as a Block Producer (BP). In this method, all the candidates need to contribute
    their own hardware infrastructure which includes computing power, storage, and
    bandwidth, such that all nodes take part in the voting process. The final ranking
    is determined by votes and miner’s weight-sum seniority ranking. During this voting
    process, many super-nodes and substitute nodes are generated. The super-nodes
    reach consensus by generating blocks through the PBFT algorithm [115] and each
    block has the digital signature of remaining BP nodes. If a node is found to be
    dishonest or inactive in the network during the block verification process, it
    is blacklisted and replaced with a substitute node. This platform tested the transaction
    throughput and system delay of the intelligent device blockchain and compared
    it with the performance of public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum [115].
    The experimental results showed that the intelligent device blockchain has higher
    transaction throughput and lower transaction latency than that of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum and provided higher efficiency. FIGURE 4. Future energy industry leveraging
    capabilities of blockchain and AI. Show All C. Decentralized AI Applications Decentralized
    Intelligence and collective decision making can play the main role in identifying
    the malicious behavior of byzantine robots. Byzantine robots are those that exhibit
    malicious or faulty behavior arbitrarily in a swarm environment. Strobel et al.
    [46] propose a proof of concept for handling security issues in swarm robotic
    ecosystems using the blockchain technology. This approach utilizes the decentralized
    nature of smart contracts to build a secure swarm systematization mechanism to
    analyze and exclude the byzantine members from the swarm. This scheme was designed
    analogous to classical approaches and the behavior of robots is determined by
    a probabilistic finite state machine which consists of two phases i.e., exploration
    state and dissemination state [46]. Each robot in the swarm saves a copy of safety
    measurement on the blockchain for identifying byzantine robots. The blockchain
    based approach creates a number of voting transactions sent by the robots to their
    neighbors in the swarm and all these votes get stored in the blockchain. This
    approach proved that a blockchain based swarm ecosystem preserves the integrity
    of the transactions and provides a direct interface for securely storing the record
    of events in a decentralized log [46]. This approach also demonstrated that the
    transactions can be verified even if some of the swarm members are lost or leave
    the swarm. In the blockchain based network, keys that are publicly available are
    the foremost available information for an agent to transfer information in a secure
    manner [114]. With respect to swarm robots, a robot can send information to a
    specific robot and only a robot that possesses a matching private key will be
    able to read the message; hence, the possibility of a data breach can be prevented.
    Digital cryptography of the blockchain ensures that the robots are allowed to
    use their private keys for encrypting a message. The other robots can then decrypt
    the message by using the public key of the sender [114]. Digital signature cryptography
    can ensure the information origin authentication and entity authentication between
    different robots in a swarm and improve the security during information exchanges.
    An analysis of a decentralized intelligent transportation system with distributed
    intelligence based on classification techniques is discussed in [108]. Researchers
    conducted an exploratory study on a fully distributed architecture to enable cooperative
    sensing and management in an intelligent transportation system [108]. This proposed
    system envelops the process of capturing and managing the road data, thereby enabling
    services to improve the efficiency of transportation systems. The main contribution
    of this work comprises of two real-world scenarios related to the prediction of
    traffic data. The first one being able of detecting traffic congestions and the
    second one for predicting the pollution level using C4.5 classification technique.
    The AI techniques embedded within the decentralized system help to predict and
    respond to critical incidents and events that may occur in a dynamic transportation
    environment and provide a befitting solution in a timely manner [108]. The reference
    architecture of the proposed system makes use of a data distribution platform
    and collaborative learning nodes connected through gateways to different subsystems
    to analyze the best traffic routes and to deal with congestion problems. In this
    work, the prediction of traffic congestion and other anomalies are performed using
    C4.5 classification technique which is used to generate decision trees from a
    set of training data a framework named ’KEEL’ has been used for providing basic
    parametrization which is well known to handle continuous attribute value ranges,
    to prune the result decision trees, and to predict traffic congestion and pollution
    in a city. Osaba et al. [108] have performed the experiments based on real-world
    situations, with traffic congestion prediction in Lisbon, Portugal and the prediction
    of pollution in Pisa, Italy. A complete operation of this collaborative learning
    unit in a real scenario is showcased with a web application which was simulated
    in a laboratory. Intelligent Precision farming can utilize the emerging technologies
    and decentralized business models to tackle the challenges faced by the agricultural
    sector. The lack of food security has affected 925 million people worldwide, including
    42.2 million in the United States alone [116]. With the advent of applied science,
    IoT technology has gained acceptance across various industries. But due to the
    their constrained resources, underdeveloped standards, and absence of security
    in design and development of their software components, IoT devices remain insecure
    when connected in a distributed environment and abstain to provide a robust structure
    [117]. From an agricultural production perspective, IoT sensors, AI agents and
    blockchain technology can be conjointly implemented for crop/variety selection,
    irrigation method selection, reduce costs, predict yield, monitor crop health,
    improve yield, improve crop quality, predict input side demands and output aggregation
    needs leading to optimization of the supply chain and to enhance profits of all
    stakeholders involved in the agricultural production sector. IoT sensors can be
    installed in farming fields to capture data and send information in order to optimize
    production. These IoT sensors can monitor the nutrient levels in soil and the
    images captured by sensors can help in monitoring the growth of crops periodically
    [116]. AI agents, on the other hand, can augment IoT devices to improve the agro-supply
    chain process via predictive analytics, which helps farmers to grow crops according
    to historical weather patterns in any specific region and monitor the crop growth
    with real-time data. Figure 5 shows the benefits and features of combining AI,
    IoT and blockchain technologies. Blockchain ensures that everyone involved in
    the network has access to all transactions; hence, reducing the time spent on
    logistics of agricultural commodity trading and also reducing food safety contingency
    [116]. An intelligent data-driven decision can assist farmers and stakeholders
    in making optimum decisions for farming plans to be customized for each farmer
    based on weather, soil, pest, and crop data on a real-time basis. FIGURE 5. Intelligent
    precision farming with blockchain. Show All Another prominent field to benefit
    from bringing together blockchain technology and AI is the supply chain industry.
    When incorporated together, both these technologies have the potential to remodel
    the entire process into an ’autonomous’ supply chain system [118]. Blockchain
    based research for supply chain industry concentrated on proof of concept experimental
    systems employing a decentralized application platform [118]. Most of the work
    in the literature was based on post supply chain management for the detection
    of counterfeited products as well as for the proof of delivery of these products
    that may involve multiple transporters. Applying AI techniques to the blockchain-based
    business transaction flows can assist to refine the supply chain by automating
    the entire process [118]. AI platforms, when consolidated with blockchain, can
    capture data from point of sale systems, history of purchase information, identify
    data patterns and perform a predictive analysis which includes predicting future
    demand, predicting sales patterns, identifying potential issues in advance, optimizing
    routes to reach the destination, and handling network traffic. When unified with
    blockchain technology and modern cryptography, federated learning can be used
    to improve the privacy of users’ data by ensuring that data are never stored in
    the cloud [119]. Snips AIR is an AI-powered voice platform that takes advantage
    of blockchain technology to ensure that users’ data are safe. While existing AI-powered
    voice assistants are pragmatic, there is a potential risk of placing the user’s
    personal data at risk, as the conversations with the voice assistants are stored
    in the cloud. The technology behind Amazon Echo and Google Home is AI-powered
    and it stores the history of users’ commands and conversations to respond in a
    smarter way for future commands [119]. Snips AIR ensures that all the personal
    details of a user remain well within the walls of connected homes instead of storing
    it on the cloud and that no one has the access to user’s data. The environs of
    Snips incentivizes the users using tokens to store their encrypted data to its
    blockchain based system [119]. Further, the data are aggregated by application
    developers, as the AI training is done on the blockchain network following the
    concept of decentralized learning. Thereby, users need not have to reveal their
    personal data or trade-off their privacy. Snips AIR is aimed to be delivered by
    2019 for consumers and it can be an alternative to Siri, an intelligent assistant
    that offers an easier way to get things done on IOS applications and stores the
    conversation data on the cloud [119] and assures that users’ data are never at
    risk. Robotic agents triggered by AI algorithms have been widely used to explore
    the deep seabed to find mineral resources, archeological findings or to access
    the underwater treasures in order to claim ownership or discovery rights by individuals
    or organizations. These algorithms and techniques assist the swarm to identify
    obstacles, gather and analyze information on ocean currents, and traverse via
    the most efficient path to reach the goal thereby saving energy. Ferrer [44] and
    Brambilla et al. [45] outline the nature of swarm robots to purview the objective
    and to record the key information about the discovery such as the location of
    the discovered object, time, date, etc. However, the swarm may not always be monitored.
    Any malicious attacker may gain access to freely observe and tamper with the emergent
    behavior of the swarm, as the swarm ecosystem is designed to expedite autonomously
    [120]. However, when swarm agents are powered with blockchain, it can record the
    discovery documents mechanized with cryptographic techniques such as hashing and
    time-stamping. The documents’ hash can be included on the blockchain based smart
    contracts and the discovery report itself can be securely stored in a decentralized
    file system, such as the IPFS. Figure 6 shows how blockchain technology helps
    to secure the discovery report generated by ocean exploration robots on the IPFS
    and records its hash on the immutable smart contract. This hash will represent
    the exact content of the document and can be encoded into the decentralized network
    without the document’s content being exposed [35], [44]. The hash of the document
    provides a secure, immutable and time stamped function about the recordings of
    various events during the discovery process and when a specific attestation took
    place following the consensus received from all active participants during a transaction
    in a particular time period. Proof of existence and Proof of discovery can be
    fortified by re-computing the hash and by comparing it with the original document
    hash stored in the blockchain based smart contract. This technique can be further
    explored to be implemented in various applications such as landmine detection,
    disaster relief missions, and military rescue operations which have precarious
    challenges for humans to work. FIGURE 6. Blockhain-based unmanned intelligent
    ocean bed exploration. Show All Unsupervised machine learning algorithms and techniques
    have been extensively used for medical image analysis to achieve a high level
    of accuracy [121]. This approach is proved to improve detection of nodules, classification,
    and sizing, while also reducing false-positive rates in abnormality detection
    [122]. However, cross-institutional sharing of sensitive medical data and records
    becomes a complex pursuit with the potential to improve the techniques for clinical
    effectiveness and patient’s privacy [43], [123]. In a patient-clinic ecosystem,
    there is a primary need for developing a robust system where data owners share
    their information in a secure environment and trust the decisions deduced by the
    AI agents. With the expeditious advancement in computational power and machine
    learning algorithms, blockchain technology can help facilitate a mechanism to
    compensate an AI service provider for the development and execution of novel machine
    learning algorithms [122]. Machine learning algorithms consume a considerable
    amount of time to diagnose a particular health condition by speculating on a radiology
    image or CT scan for instance. Peterson et al. [122] recommend that, by utilizing
    blockchain technology, the AI service provider can publish the diagnostic report
    images containing information about a single diagnostic service performed for
    a patient on the blockchain. Further, the AI service provider who develops the
    machine learning algorithms can be allowed to execute their algorithms over the
    images and publish the AI diagnosis output on the blockchain. By doing so, the
    radiologists at the clinic could compare his or her diagnoses with the result
    published on the blockchain [122]. The AI service providers can be incentivized
    only when the diagnosis results match with that of the diagnosis of the radiologists.
    As the service providers are incentivized for every accurate diagnosis, they are
    bound to improve the definiteness of their machine learning algorithms. Thereby,
    blockchain implements an invincible record of the complete diagnosis reports of
    both AI service providers and hospitals. AI techniques and deep learning algorithms
    extract high-level, complex abstractions as data representations through a hierarchical
    learning process [124], uses data sciences and analytics which can be used to
    deduce the next course of actions of the treatment by evaluating outcomes and
    blockchain can hold the record to improve healthcare services. Recently, the banking
    industry has started investing in a wide range set of projects and start-ups providing
    blockchain based solutions as this technology provides a high level of safety
    for storing and transmitting data, distributed and transparent network infrastructure,
    decentralization and low cost of operations [125]. Banks have increased conducting
    tests of decentralized asset technology and implementing blockchain in the business
    process. As blockchain itself holds an immutable ledger that records all transactions
    in the chain, if a large number of transactions are being processed by the network,
    a huge volume of data gets collected and AI techniques can be used to process
    and classify the data. Telcoin [125] is a new cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum
    blockchain which will be distributed and accepted by telecom operators, enabling
    financial payments, remittances, credit, and various financial services on the
    blockchain. Telcoin suggests that the combined features of blockchain and machine
    learning can contribute to various applications like anticipating money laundering
    as AI is better in pattern classification and detection of irregularities in large
    amounts of data can be handled with blockchain technology. Figure 7 presents a
    model of AI and blockchain technology that can be used in the banking and finance
    institutions. Another remarkable outcome of combining both technologies is the
    handling of a fluctuating range of cryptocurrencies where AI techniques can help
    reduce the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies [125]. Xiong et al. [126] developed
    a neural network model that harnesses the potential of deep learning financial
    time series in the presence of strong noise which proved that, with huge volumes
    of datasets, AI techniques perform better than other traditional models. Machine
    learning techniques can analyze the price and details of various stock exchanges
    and predict the future forecasts accurately and decentralized contracts can be
    used to freeze the price of currency for a fixed amount of time [125]. FIGURE
    7. Combining AI and blockchain for banking and finance. Show All The property
    Management Sector has begun to explore and apprehend the collective potential
    of blockchain and AI [127]. These technologies can create boundaries by breaking
    the monopolistic power of firms and hotels using blockchain. Problems faced by
    the property management sector such as inventory management can be managed by
    blockchain and details on bed stock and hotel capacity can be managed by learning
    techniques of AI. The Dutch land registry department is considering to consolidate
    AI and blockchain technology into the real estate industry [128]. The land registry
    department envisions that these new technologies when allied can improve the legal
    dependence and patronage of business to create a stable process. The Dutch government
    has already been involved in utilizing the revolutionary benefits of blockchain
    in various fields such as financing, supply chain, and logistics industry [129].
    This organization now aims to implement the inherent benefits of combining both
    technologies where implementation of AI is aimed to constitute self-learning systems
    which can predict the outcome whilst blockchain technology can be used for handling
    and managing huge volumes of data resources saved and produced by the land registry
    department [128]. Another remarkable pursuit in the property sector is the acceptance
    of these technologies by the government of Singapore in a program called ’Smart
    Nation,’ which attempts to diminish the paramountcy of sellers over investors
    and buyers [129]. This is an $73 million worth project that endows the private
    sectors to test all their new innovations and solutions which includes technology
    and building management in the real estate sector. With big data, property investors
    and developers can predict the trends of real estate and merchandise movements.
    AI techniques can be used for comparative market analysis which helps users to
    get a thorough knowledge of the investment and blockchain technology-based smart
    contracts can help in minimizing the transmission process and improving the transparency
    of payments, thereby saving millions of dollars for investors [129]. To this point,
    we discussed early implementations of decentralized AI applications in various
    sectors. However, persistent efforts are still needed in order to fully enable
    decentralized AI. Considering the limitations in current implementations and our
    vision of enabling fully decentralized AI applications and systems, in the next
    section we discuss the major open research challenges in this important research
    area. SECTION V. Open Research Challenges In this section, we discuss and highlight
    to-date challenges for combining AI and blockchain technologies. Some of the foreseeable
    challenges related to the unification and integration of both technologies are
    listed below: Privacy. Public blockchain ledgers enable secure and authentic data
    processing, however, collected data are publically accessible and available for
    all readers. This can be a point of privacy evasion and concern. In addition,
    pervasive sensing systems in IoT continuously collect consumers’ personal and
    sensitive data and putting this data on open ledgers could lead towards privacy
    issues. Using private blockchain ledgers, the data privacy could be ensured by
    enabling encryption and allowing controlled access of the ledgers. However, such
    private blockchain platforms will limit the access and exposure of the large amount
    of data that can be necessary for AI to process and preform accurate and correct
    decision making and analytics. Scalability and Side Chains. Scalability is one
    of the major concerns for today’s blockchain platform. For cryptocurrency blockchain
    platforms, bitcoin blockchain can perform an average of 4 transactions per seconds,
    while Ethereum can perform an average of 12 transactions per second. Such performance
    is really unacceptable when compared with Facebook which handles millions of transactions
    every second including likes, posts, and comments. Side chains (known also as
    side channels) are used to accelerate the performance of blockchains, in which
    transactions are settled between parties in a quick manner outside the main chain,
    and settled only once per day on the main chain [91]. Many new emerging types
    of blockchains improve significantly the consensus algorithms of mining nodes.
    For example, platforms like Algorand and IoTA can provide substantially better
    performance than that of Ethereum and Hyperledger blockchains [130], [131]. However,
    more work is still needed to improve the scalability to be comparable to that
    of Facebook and its likes. Blockchain Security. The decentralized power found
    in blockchain can suffer from abuses and misuses. Though blockchain provides robust
    schemes for securing IoT and predictive analysis, the blockchain systems are vulnerable
    to cyber-attacks as that of 51% attack [26]. The consensus mechanism depending
    upon the hashing power of the miner can be compromised, in which the decentralized
    platform becomes centralized around a few mining farms that control consensus
    and settlement finality. This security problem is more evident in public blockchains
    such as Ethereum and bitcoin. Private blockchain platforms suffer less from this
    problem, as consensus protocols are predefined among parties. Furthermore, the
    execution environment of the mining nodes is not protected, especially for private
    blockchain platforms with a few mining nodes as that of Hyperledger, in which
    the execution outcomes can be tampered with. To remedy this problem, newly emerging
    blockchain platforms are equipped with hardware to offer execution in a Trusted
    Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX [132]. Smart Contracts Vulnerabilities
    and Deterministic Execution. It is crucial to ensure that the implementation of
    a smart contract is free of bugs and vulnerabilities and secure against attacks.
    It is important to safeguard the code and the information on the network, as they
    may be vulnerable to attacks. For example, the smart contract for the DAO which
    was built on the Ethereum platform had serious code vulnerability and was hacked
    in 2016. This resulted in a loss of 3.6 million Ethers. There is a definite need
    for blockchain engineering, addressing this issue posed by smart contract programming
    and other applications running on blockchain [133]. The vulnerability issues are
    due to poor and negligent programming practices in the languages used to write
    the smart contracts code (as that of Solidity and Chaincode). Testing smart contracts
    for vulnerabilities has become of a critical importance, and some tools have been
    developed to assess the security state of a smart contract code [134]–[136]. Furthermore,
    as of today, the execution outcomes of smart contracts are all deterministic and
    cannot be probabilistic. This can pose a key challenge for decentralized AI in
    which AI and machine learning-based decision making algorithms get executed as
    smart contracts by the mining nodes, in which the execution outcome are not usually
    deterministic, but rather random, unpredictable and most often approximate. This
    entails a novel solution to deal with approximate computation and to devise consensus
    protocols for mining nodes for agreeing on results with a particular degree of
    certainty, accuracy, or precision, and with data input that might be highly fluctuating
    as that of IoT and sensory readings. Trusted Oracles Smart contracts are designed
    to be invoked by external events or outside functions invoked by blockchain participants.
    Smart contracts are not designed to automatically trigger events, or initiate
    retrieval of data on their own. In other words, the contracts cannot pull data
    from the outside world. Data and events have to be pushed to the contracts. To
    remedy such shortcomings, trusted oracles (which are basically trusted external
    parties or nodes) are being proposed as alternatives, and used to push events
    and data to the smart contracts. Oracles add a level of complexity and insecurity
    for ensuring and managing trust, in which a completely decentralized system becomes
    centralized around a group of oracles that must be trusted. Voting among trusted
    oracles is typically employed to reach consensus [137]. AI-specific Emerging Consensus
    Protocols. Existing consensus protocols considers network and middleware layers
    of blockchain systems by enabling different proof of X protocols (as discussed
    in section III-E). A large plethora of research opportunities are available for
    future researchers to explore if the application level consensus protocols could
    be designed considering proofs based on quality of learning models, efficient
    search strategies, quality and provenance of data, and quality of optimization.
    Fog Computing Paradigm. Fog computing is a newly emerging computing paradigm that
    allows for localized computing and storage close to the source of data being generated
    by customers or IoT devices. Fog nodes are typically used to augment the long
    delay incurred by computing and storage at the cloud environment. Fog nodes can
    be thought of as a local small-scale cloud. In the context of AI and blockchain,
    future fog nodes have to be equipped with AI and machine learning capabilities
    as well as enabled with blockchain interface, whereby localized management, access,
    and control of data are performed by the fog nodes. Lack of Standards, Interoperability,
    and Regulations. To date, blockchain technology standards are yet to be devised.
    Work is in progress by IEEE, NIST, ITU, and many standards bodies to put forward
    standards for blockchain interoperability, governance, integration, and architecture
    [138], [139]. Moreover, at local and global level, governmental and institutional
    guidelines, rules, laws, regulations, and policies need to put in place for blockchain
    deployment, arbitration, and dispute handling, in the context of AI applications
    and especially for public blockchain transactions involving financing and automated
    payments using cryptocurrencies. This entails research directed at devising models
    and proof of concepts that can play a key role in defining the right set of technical
    standards for blockchain architectural models, services, deployment and interoperability.
    Quantum Computing. It is envisaged that future quantum computing will have the
    ability to break public key encryption in which private keys can be determined.
    Current blockchain relies on digital signatures which use public key encryption.
    Many experts believe that quantum computing may render the underlying security
    of blockchain breakable by the year 2027 [140], [141]. This entails serious research
    on quantum-safe and secure blockchain that withstand such breakability, and still
    guarantees high performance and scalability. Also this entails sound migration
    plans and interoperability with quantum-resilient blockchain platforms. Governance.
    Deploying, constructing, and managing a blockchain platform among different participants
    and stakeholders is a tedious task. Even with a private of consortium blockchain,
    serious issues arise related to the type of blockchain to deploy (e.g., Hyperledger
    or Ethereum), who administers and troubleshoots the blockchain, the deployment
    location of the blockchain nodes, who writes the smart contracts, settlement of
    disputes, selection of trusted oracles, mechanisms for off-chain activities, deployment
    of side channels, regulations and standards to comply with, and many others. This
    entails research targeted at devising sound governance models. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    In this paper, we surveyed and reviewed the current state-of-the-art related to
    the use and applicability of blockchain features for AI. We gave an overview of
    blockchain and decentralized storage on how blockchain technology can enhance
    and solve key issues related to AI. Moreover, we presented a detailed taxonomic
    discussion and comparisons of common blockchain implementations in terms of decentralized
    AI operations, blockchain types and infrastructure, and consensus protocols. An
    extensive analysis of blockchain applications for intelligent multi-agent systems
    is reviewed with respect to decentralized data management and infrastructure for
    AI. Various features of AI for blockchain applications are also summarized. Our
    literature review shows that adopting blockchain for AI applications is still
    in its infancy, and there exists many research challenges to be addressed and
    tackled in areas related to privacy, smart contract security, trusted oracles,
    scalability, consensus protocols, standardization, interoperability, quantum computing
    resiliency, and governance. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Reviewing procedure tree diagram.
    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    modern information technology and traditional agriculture, the era of agriculture
    4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture, has come. Smart agriculture provides
    solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation. However, information security
    issues cannot be ignored with the development of agriculture brought by modern
    information technology. In this paper, three typical development modes of smart
    agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture, and order agriculture)
    are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications are derived from
    the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications, 6 security
    and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving,
    blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management,
    physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and
    discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed
    and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information
    technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment
    as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based
    on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that
    agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies
    (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management
    system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
    security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research
    directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica

    Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry in the world,
    and it plays an important role in social stability and economic development [1].
    Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion and the limited
    grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number of studies on smart
    agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both the improvement in
    productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress of science and
    technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is used to help readers
    understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture development
    (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the traditional
    agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human and animal
    resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of operation.
    • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century), the
    main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era of
    high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the main
    issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart agriculture
    (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is mainly marked
    by the use of modern information technology to both serve agriculture and develop
    it intelligently. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    \ has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use\nof low-cost hardware\
    \ (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote\nequipment\
    \ and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart\
    \ logistics\nand warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities.\nNevertheless,\
    \ farmers are\nagriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT\
    \ applications. Users who use IoT\napplications must participate in its design,\
    \ improving the integration and use. In this work, different\nindustrial agricultural\
    \ facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities\n\
    based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain\
    \ knowledge and\nexperience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural\
    \ applications. Internet of things\nparadigms are used as resources to facilitate\
    \ the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules\nand smart processes\
    \ are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing\n\
    paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies.\
    \ The aim is to help\nfarmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new\
    \ facilities. Different decision trees to\nautomate the installation, designed\
    \ by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed\nin this document.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; precision agriculture; fog and edge computing\n\
    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\
    Table 1. IoT architecture: Layers.\nLayers Proposed\nCharacteristics\n3\nPerception,\
    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\
    \ SOAP, ...\nNetwork\n6LowPAN, RPL, CORPL, IPSec, TCP/UDP, DTLS\nPerception/Things\n\
    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\

    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\

    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\

    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\

    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\
    5.\nInfer future irrigation decisions using the information and modelling tools.\

    only by a time schedule. Now, it takes into account data sensors to decide if\

    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\
    \ 8.\nTable 2. Common wireless nodes used in the agriculture domain.\nSr #\nWN1\n\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    and citations Figures and tables Abstract The Internet of Robotic Things is an
    emerging vision that brings together pervasive sensors and objects with robotic
    and autonomous systems. This survey examines how the merger of robotic and Internet
    of Things technologies will advance the abilities of both the current Internet
    of Things and the current robotic systems, thus enabling the creation of new,
    potentially disruptive services. We discuss some of the new technological challenges
    created by this merger and conclude that a truly holistic view is needed but currently
    lacking. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics communities have
    so far been driven by different yet highly complementary objectives, the first
    focused on supporting information services for pervasive sensing, tracking and
    monitoring; the latter on producing action, interaction and autonomous behaviour.
    For this reason, it is increasingly claimed that the creation of an internet of
    robotic things (IoRT) combining the results from the two communities will bring
    a strong added value.1–3 Early signs of the IoT-robotics convergence can be seen
    in distributed, heterogeneous robot control paradigms like network robot systems4
    or robot ecologies,5 or in approaches such as ubiquitous robotics6–8 and cloud
    robotics9–12 that place resource-intensive features on the server side.13,14 The
    term ‘Internet of robotic things’ itself was coined in a report of ABI research1
    to denote a concept where sensor data from a variety of sources are fused, processed
    using local and distributed intelligence and used to control and manipulate objects
    in the physical world. In this cyber-physical perspective of the IoRT, sensor
    and data analytics technologies from the IoT are used to give robots a wider situational
    awareness that leads to better task execution. use cases include intelligent transportation15
    and companion robots.16 Later uses of the term IoRT in literature adopted alternative
    perspectives of this term: for example, one that focuses on the robust team communication,17–19
    and a ‘robot-aided IoT’ view where robots are just additional sensors.20,21 Cloud
    computing and the IoT are two non-robotic enablers in creating distributed robotic
    systems (see Figure 1). IoT technologies have three tenets22: (i) sensors proliferated
    in the environment and on our bodies; (ii) smart connected objects using machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communication; and (iii) data analytics and semantic technologies transforming
    raw sensor data. Cloud computing provides on-demand, networked access to a pool
    of virtualized hardware resources (processing, storage) or higher level services.
    Cloud infrastructure has been used by the IoT community to deploy scalable IoT
    platform services that govern access to (raw, processed or fused) sensor data.
    Processing the data streams generated by billions of IoT devices in a handful
    of centralized data centres brings concerns on response time latency, massive
    ingress bandwidth needs and data privacy. Edge computing (also referred to as
    fog computing, cloudlets) brings on-demand and elastic computational resources
    to the edge of the network, closer to the producers of data23. The cloud paradigm
    was also adopted by the robotics community, called cloud robotics9–12 for offloading
    resource-intensive tasks,13,14 for the sharing of data and knowledge between robots24
    and for reconfiguration of robots following an app-store model.25 Although there
    is an overlap between cloud robotics and IoRT, the former paradigm is more oriented
    towards providing network-accessible infrastructure for computational power and
    storage of data and knowledge, while the latter is more focused on M2M communication
    and intelligent data processing. The focus of this survey is on the latter, discussing
    the potential added value of the IoT-robotics crossover in terms of improved system
    abilities, as well as the new technological challenges posed by the crossover.
    Figure 1. The scope of this review paper is the IoT as enabler in distributed
    robotic systems. IoT: Internet of Things. As one of the goals of this survey is
    to inspire researchers on the potential of introducing IoT technologies in robotic
    systems and vice versa, we structure our discussion along the system abilities
    commonly found in robotic systems, regardless of specific robot embodiment or
    application domains. Finding a suitable taxonomy of abilities is a delicate task.
    In this work, we build upon an existing community effort and adopt the taxonomy
    of nine system abilities, defined in the euRobotics roadmap,26 which shapes the
    robotic research agenda of the European Commission. Interestingly, these abilities
    are closely related to the research challenges identified in the US Robotics roadmap27
    (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Mapping between the system abilities defined in the
    multi-annual roadmap of euRobotics26 – along which this review is structured –
    and the research challenges identified in the roadmap for US Robotics.27 Basic
    abilities Perception ability The sensor and data analytics technologies from the
    IoT can clearly give robots a wider horizon compared to local, on-board sensing,
    in terms of space, time and type of information. Conversely, placing sensors on-board
    mobile robots allows to position them in a flexible and dynamic way and enables
    sophisticated active sensing strategies. A key challenge of perception in an IoRT
    environment is that the environmental observations of the IoRT entities are spatially
    and temporally distributed.28 Some techniques must be put in place to allow robots
    to query these distributed data. Dietrich et al.29 propose to use local databases,
    one in each entity, where data are organized in a spatial hierarchy, for example,
    an object has a position relative to a robot, the robot is positioned in a room
    and so on. Other authors30,31 propose that robots send specific observation requests
    to the distributed entities, for example, a region and objects of interest: this
    may speed up otherwise intractable sensor processing problems (see Figure 3).
    Figure 3. Distributed cameras assist the robot in locating a charging station
    in an environment. The charging station was placed between a green and yellow
    visual marker (location A). Visual markers of the same colours were placed elsewhere
    in the environment to simulate distractors. Visual processing is performed on-demand
    on the camera nodes to inform the robot that the charging station is at location
    A and not at the distracting location B (Image from Chamberlain et al.30) (c)
    2016 IEEE. A key component of robots’ perception ability is getting knowledge
    of their own location, which includes the ability to build or update models of
    the environment.32 Despite great progress in this domain, self-localization may
    still be challenging in crowded and/or Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied
    indoor environments, especially if high reliability is demanded. Simple IoT-based
    infrastructures such as an radio frequency identification (RFID)-enhanced floor
    have been used to provide reliable location information to domestic robots.33
    Other approaches use range-based techniques on signals emitted by off-board infrastructure,
    such as Wi-Fi access points34 and visible light,35 or by IoT devices using protocols
    such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB),36 Zigbee37 or Bluetooth lowenergy.38,39 Motion ability
    The ability to move is one of the fundamental added values of robotic systems.
    While mechanical design is the key factor in determining the intrinsic effectiveness
    of robot mobility, IoT connectivity can assist mobile robots by helping them to
    control automatic doors and elevators, for example in assistive robotics40 and
    in logistic applications.41 IoT platform services and M2M and networking protocols
    can facilitate distributed robot control architectures in large-scale applications,
    such as last mile delivery, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
    FIROS42 is a recent tool to connect mobile robots to IoT services by translating
    Robot Operating System (ROS)43 messages into messages grounded in Open Mobile
    Alliance APIs?. Such an interface is suited for robots to act as a mobile sensor
    that publishes its observations and makes them available to any interested IoT
    service. In application scenarios such as search and rescue, where communication
    infrastructure may be absent or damaged, mobile robots may need to set up ad hoc
    networks and use each other as forwarding nodes to maintain communication. While
    the routing protocols developed for mobile ad hoc networks can be readily applied
    in such scenarios, lower overhead and increased energy efficiency can be obtained
    when such protocols explicitly take into account the knowledge of robot’s planned
    movements and activities.44 Sliwa et al.45 propose a similar approach to minimize
    path losses in robot swarms. Manipulation ability While the core motivation of
    the IoT is to sense the environment, the one of robotics is to modify it. Robots
    can grasp, lift, hold and move objects via their end effectors. Once the robot
    has acquired the relevant features of an object, like its position and contours,
    the sequence of torques to be applied on the joints can be calculated via inverse
    kinematics. The added value of IoT is in the acquisition of the object’s features,
    including those that are not observable with the robot’s sensors but have an impact
    on the grasping procedure, such as the distribution of mass, for example, in a
    filled versus an empty cup. Some researchers attached RFID tags to objects that
    contain information about their size, shape and grasping points5. Deyle et al.46
    embedded RFID reader antennas in the finger of a gripper: Differences in the signal
    strength across antennas were used to more accurately position the hand before
    touching the object. Longer range RFID tags were used to locate objects in a kitchen47
    or in smart factories,48,49 as well as to locate the robots themselves.50 Higher
    level abilities Decisional autonomy Decisional autonomy refers to the ability
    of the system to determine the best course of action to fulfil its tasks and missions.26
    This is mostly not considered in IoT middleware:51–53 applications just call an
    actuation API of so-called smart objects that hide the internal complexity.28
    Roboticists often rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning techniques54,55
    based on predictive models of the environment and of the possible actions. The
    quality of the plans critically depends on the quality of these models and of
    the estimate of the initial state. In this respect, the improved situational awareness
    that can be provided by an IoT environment (see “Perception ability” section)
    can lead to better plans. Human-aware task planners56 use knowledge of the intentions
    of the humans inferred through an IoT environment to generate plans that respect
    constraints on human interaction (see Figure 4). Figure 4. The vacuum cleaning
    robot adapts its plan to avoid interference in the kitchen (Figure from Cirillo
    et al.56) (c) 2010 ACM. IoT also widens the scope of decisional autonomy by making
    more actors and actions available, such as controllable elevators and doors.40,57
    However, IoT devices may dynamically become available or unavailable,58 which
    challenges classical multi-agent planning approaches. A solution is to do planning
    in terms of abstract services, which are mapped to actual devices at runtime.59
    Interaction ability This is the ability of a robot to interact physically, cognitively
    and socially either with users, operators or other systems around it.26 While
    M2M protocols60 can be directly adopted in robotic software, we focus here on
    how IoT technologies can facilitate human–robot interaction at functional (commanding
    and programming) and social levels, as well as a means for tele-interaction. Functional
    pervasive IoT sensors can make the functional means of human–robot interaction
    more robust. Natural language instructions are a desirable way to instruct robots,
    especially for non-expert users, but they are often vague or contain implicit
    assumptions.61,62 The IoT can provide information on the position and state of
    objects to disambiguate these instructions (see Figure 5). Gestures are another
    intuitive way to command robots, for instance, by pointing to objects. Recognition
    of pointing gestures from sensors on-board the robot only works within a limited
    field of view.63 External cameras provide a broader scene perspective that can
    improve gesture recognition.64 Wearable sensors have also been used, for example,
    Wolf et al.65 demonstrated a sleeve that measures forearm muscle movements to
    command robot motion and manipulation. Figure 5. Depending on the state of the
    environment, a natural language instructions results in different actions to be
    performed (Image from Misra et al.62) (c) 2016 SAGE. Social body cues like gestures,
    voice or face expression can be used to estimate the user’s emotional state66
    and make the robot respond to it.67,68 The integration with body-worn IoT sensors
    can improve this estimate by measuring physiological signals: Leite et al.69 measured
    heart rate and skin conductance to estimate engagement, motivation and attention
    during human–robot interaction. Others have used these estimates to adapt the
    robot’s interaction strategy, for example, in the context of autism therapy70
    or for stress relievement.71 Tele-interaction robots have also been used besides
    IoT technologies for remote interaction, especially in healthcare. Chan et al.72
    communicate hugs and manipulations between persons via sensorized robots. Al-Taee
    et al.73 use robots to improve the tele-monitoring of diabetes patients by reading
    out the glucose sensor and vocalizing the feedback from the carer (see Figure
    6). Finally, in the GiraffPlus project?, a tele-presence robot was combined with
    environmental sensors to provide health-related data to a remote therapist. Figure
    6. The robot acts as a master Bluetooth device that reads out glucose sensors
    and transfers them to the caregivers. The robot is then used to provide verbal
    information concerning the patient’s diet, insulin bolus/intake, and so on (Image
    from Al-Taee et al.73) (c) 2017 IEEE. Cognitive ability By reasoning on and inferring
    knowledge from experience, cognitive robots are able to understand the relationship
    between themselves and the environment, between objects, and to assess the possible
    impact of their actions. Some aspects of cognition were already discussed in the
    previous sections, for example, multi-modal perception, deliberation and social
    intelligence. In this section, we focus on the cognitive tasks of reasoning and
    learning in an IoRT multi-actor setting. Knowledge models are important components
    of cognitive architectures.74,75 Ontologies are a popular technique in both IoT
    and robotics for structured knowledge. Example ontologies describing the relationship
    between an agent and its physical environment are the Semantic Sensor Network,76
    IoT-A77 and the IEEE Ontologies for Robotics and Automation78 (ORA). For example,
    Jorge et al.79 use the ORA ontology for spatial reasoning between two robots that
    must coordinate in providing a missing tool to a human. Recent works??? harness
    the power of the cloud to derive knowledge from multi-modal data sources, such
    as human demonstrations, natural language or raw sensor data observations?, and
    to provide a virtual environment for simulating robot control policies. In an
    IoRT environment, these knowledge engines will be able to incorporate even more
    sources of data. In the IoT domain, cognitive techniques were recently proposed
    for the management of distributed architectures.80,81 Here, the system self-organizes
    a pipeline of data analytics modules on a distributed set of sensor nodes, edge
    cloud and so on. To our knowledge, the inclusion of robots in these pipelines
    has not yet been considered. If robots subscribe themselves as additional actors
    in the environment, then this gives rise to a new strand of problems in distributed
    consensus and collaboration for the IoT, because robots typically have a larger
    degree of autonomy than traditional IoT ‘smart’ objects, and because they are
    able to modify the physical environment leading to complex dependencies and interactions.
    System level abilities Configurability This is the ability of a robotic system
    to be configured to perform a given task or reconfigured to perform different
    tasks.26 IoT is mainly instrumental in supporting software configurability, in
    particular to orchestrate the concerted configuration of multiple devices, each
    contributing different capabilities and cooperating to the achievement of complex
    objectives. However, work in IoT does not explicitly address the requirement of
    IoRT systems to exchange continuous streams of data while interacting with the
    physical world. This requirement is most prominent in the domains of logistic
    and of advanced manufacturing, where a fast reaction to disruptions is needed,
    together with flexible adaptation to varying production objectives. Kousi et al.82
    developed a service-oriented architecture to support autonomous, mobile production
    units which can fuse data from a peripheral sensing network to detect disturbances.
    Michalos et al.83 developed a distributed system for data sharing and coordination
    of human–robot collaborative operations, connected to a centralized task planner.
    Production lines have also been framed as multi-agent systems84,85 equipped with
    self-descriptive capabilities to reduce set-up and changeover times. General purpose
    middlewares have also been developed to support distributed task coordination
    and control in IoRT environments. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform86 is a
    general purpose middleware for IoRT environments (see Figure 7). It manages the
    handover of functionality for services using real and virtual robots, for example
    reserving a real assistant robot using a virtual robot on the smartphone. Figure
    7. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform is a two-layered platform. The LPF configures
    a robotic system in a single area. The GPF is a middle-layer between the LPFs
    of different areas and the service applications (Image from Nishio et al.86).
    LPF: local platform; GPF: global platform (c) 2013 Springer-Verlag. Configurability
    can be coupled with decision ability to lead to the ability of a system to self-configure.
    Self-configuration is especially challenging in an IoRT system since the configuration
    algorithms must take into account both the digital interactions between the actors
    and their physical interactions through the real world. The ‘PEIS Ecology’ framework5
    includes algorithms for the self-configuration of a robot ecology: complex functionality
    is achieved by composing a set of devices with sensing, acting and/or computational
    capabilities, including robots. A shared tuple-space blackboard allows for high
    level collaboration and dynamic reconfiguration.87 Adaptability This is the ability
    of the system to adapt to different work scenarios, environments and conditions.26
    This includes the ability to adapt to unforeseen events, faults, changing tasks
    and environments and unexpected human behaviour. The key enablers for adaptability
    are the perception, decisional and configuration abilities as described above.
    Hence, we will now discuss relevant application domains and supporting platforms.
    Mobile robots are used in precision agriculture for the deployment of herbicide,
    fertilizer or irrigation.88 These robots need to adapt to spatio-temporal variations
    of crop and field patterns, crop sizes, light and weather conditions, soil quality,
    and so on.89 Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) can provide the necessary information,90,91
    for example, knowledge of soil moisture may be used to ensure accurate path tracking.92,93
    Gealy et al.94 use a robot to adjust the drip rate of individual water emitters
    to allow for plant-level control of irrigation. This is a notable example of how
    robots are used to adjust IoT devices. Some platforms supporting adaptation of
    IoRT have also been showcased in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL).
    Building on OSGi, a platform for IoT home automation, AIOLOS exposes robots and
    IoT devices as reusable and shareable services, and automatically optimizes the
    runtime deployment across distributed infrastructure, for example, by placing
    a shared data processing service closer to the source sensor.95,96 Bacciu et al.97,98
    deploy recurrent neural networks on distributed infrastructure to automatically
    learn user preferences, and to detect disruptive environmental changes like the
    addition of a mirror.99 Dependability Dependability is a multifaceted attribute,
    covering the reliability of hardware and software robotic components, safety guarantees
    when cooperating with humans and the degree to which systems can continue their
    missions when failures or other unforeseen circumstances occur. In this section,
    we follow the classification of means of dependability identified by Crestani
    et al.100 A first means of dependability is to forecast faults or conflicts. For
    instance, robots in a manufacturing plant must stop if an operator comes too near.
    IoT technology can provide useful tools to realize this. Rampa et al.101 mounted
    a network of small tranceivers in a robotic cell and estimated the user position
    from the perturbations of the radio field. Other researchers embedded sensors
    in clothing and on the helmet. Qian et al.102 developed a probabilistic framework
    to avoid conflicts of robot and human motion, by combining observations from fixed
    cameras and on-board sensors with historical knowledge on human trajectories (see
    Figure 8). Figure 8. Sensory data from laser and global cameras are fed to the
    perception module, together with human motion patterns learned by the modelling
    module. Then three types of abstracted observations are inputted to the controller:
    PAO, PRO and RSO. Using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, a suitable
    navigational policy is generated (Image from Qian et al.102). PAO: people’s action
    observation; PRO: people-robot relation observation; RSO: robot state observation
    (c) 2013 SAGE. In a marine context, acoustic sensor networks have been used to
    provide information on water current and ship positions to a path planner for
    underwater gliders, to avoid collisions when they come to the surface103 or to
    preserve energy.104 A second means of dependability is robust system engineering.
    This can take new forms in an IoRT system. For instance, mobile wireless communication
    is a key enabler for industry 4.0, where both field devices, fixed machines and
    mobile AGV are connected. IoT protocols such as WirelessHart or Zigbee Pro were
    designed to address the industry concerns on reliability, security and cost.105
    When mobility is involved, however, these protocols must be complemented by meshing
    technologies to cope with handovers and with the massive presence of metal.106,107
    The last means is fault tolerance, which allows the system to keep working even
    when components fail. Redundancy is key to fault tolerance, and the IoRT enables
    redundancy of sensors, information and actuation. Data fusion from both on-board
    and environment sensors, however, requires a good understanding of the spatial
    and temporal relationship between the observations from different sensors. Such
    relationships have been explicitly modelled, for example, in the Positioning Ontology79
    (POS), or implicitly learned as part of modular deep neural network controller.108
    Conclusion Robotics and IoT are two terms each covering a myriad of technologies
    and concepts. In this review, we have unravelled the added value of the crossover
    of both technology domains into nine system abilities. The IoT advantages exploited
    by roboticists are mostly distributed perception and M2M protocols. Conversely,
    the IoT has so far mostly exploited robots for active sensing strategies. Current
    IoRT incarnations are almost uniquely found in vertical application domains, notably
    AAL, precision agriculture and Industry 4.0. Domain-agnostic solutions, for example,
    to integrate robots in IoT middleware platforms, are only emerging. It is our
    conviction that the IoRT should go beyond the readings of ‘IoT-aided robots’ or
    ‘Robot-enhanced IoT’. We hope that this survey may stimulate researchers from
    both disciplines to start work towards an ecosystem of IoT agents, robots and
    the cloud that combines both the above readings in a holistic way. Declaration

    commercial fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications networks have already
    been deployed with the aim of providing high data rates. However, the rapid growth
    in the number of smart devices and the emergence of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) applications, which require an ultra-reliable and low-latency communication,
    will result in a substantial burden on the 5G wireless networks. As such, the
    data rate that could be supplied by 5G networks will unlikely sustain the enormous
    ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to
    advance the existing wireless networks toward the future generation of cellular
    systems, known as sixth generation (6G). Therefore, it is essential to provide
    a prospective vision of the 6G and the key enabling technologies for realizing
    future networks. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review/survey
    of the future evolution of 6G networks. Specifically, the objective of the paper
    is to provide a comprehensive review/survey about the key enabling technologies
    for 6G networks, which include a discussion about the main operation principles
    of each technology, envisioned potential applications, current state-of-the-art
    research, and the related technical challenges. Overall, this paper provides useful
    information for industries and academic researchers and discusses the potentials
    for opening up new research directions. A diagram shows the ultra era in 6G networks.

    • SLR is conducted using PRISMA approach and148 articles are selected and critically
    analyzed. • The results show the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture.
    • The potential benefits of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their
    implementation in agriculture sector are identified and discussed. • The study
    will positively impact the research around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture
    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    \ have been signiﬁcantly developed and have greatly expanded\ntheir potential.\
    \ In fact, novel advancements to the Internet of things (IoT) have paved the way\
    \ for\nnew possibilities, representing a set of key enabling technologies for\
    \ smart cities and allowing the\nproduction and automation of innovative services\
    \ and advanced applications for the different city\nstakeholders. This paper presents\
    \ a review of the research literature on IoT-enabled smart cities, with\nthe aim\
    \ of highlighting the main trends and open challenges of adopting IoT technologies\
    \ for the\ndevelopment of sustainable and efﬁcient smart cities. This work ﬁrst\
    \ provides a survey on the key\ntechnologies proposed in the literature for the\
    \ implementation of IoT frameworks, and then a review\nof the main smart city\
    \ approaches and frameworks, based on classiﬁcation into eight domains, which\n\
    extends the traditional six domain classiﬁcation that is typically adopted in\
    \ most of the related works.\nKeywords: smart cities; internet of things; big\
    \ data\n1. Introduction\nThe increasing development and dissemination of Internet\
    \ of things (IoT) and Internet\nof everything (IoE) technologies represent an\
    \ important enabler in the current smart cities\nlandscape, leading the smart\
    \ city paradigm to the big data scale. In fact, as noted in [1], a\ntechnical\
    \ report by Ericson estimated that 29 billion devices would be connected by 2022.\n\
    According to the report presented by Statista Research in 2019, it has been estimated\
    \ that\nthe total number of connected IoT devices worldwide will increase to about\
    \ 75 billion by\n2025 [2], creating a potential IoT economic impact that could\
    \ reach USD 11 trillion per\nyear by 2025 [3]. These numbers are revealing that\
    \ IoT is going to be one of the highest\nvalue disruptive technologies, opening\
    \ new frontiers, possibilities and challenges in the\nproduction of smart services\
    \ and applications. The importance of IoT is more and more\nclosely connected\
    \ to the evolution of smart cities, for which IoT represents one of the key\n\
    drivers for smarter innovation and sustainable development. Smart cities are complex\
    \ socio-\ntechnical infrastructures, composed of human actors (different stakeholders\
    \ and users, such\nas citizens, city operators, administrative institutions, public\
    \ and private companies, etc.)\nand digital devices (e.g.: city sensors and actuators\
    \ exploited in many domains, such as\nmobility and transportation, environment,\
    \ energy, healthcare, governance, industry 4.0 etc.;\nsmart home and smart buildings\
    \ devices; and personal devices, such as smartphones).\nThis complexity is reﬂected\
    \ in the large variety of heterogeneous approaches, contexts,\napplication domains\
    \ and technological solutions that have been proposed in the literature\nfor the\
    \ realization and management of smart cities. The main goal of implementing and\n\
    integrating IoT solutions is to allow smart cities to advance further, providing\
    \ new capabili-\nties and features while signiﬁcantly reducing human intervention\
    \ [4]. In addition, it is also\nimportant to focus on the social challenges addressed\
    \ and the societal beneﬁts achieved by\nthe adoption of these technologies, for\
    \ instance assessing how they can contribute to the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) developed by United Nations within the context\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\
    \ 1607. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12031607\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n2 of 21\nof the 2030 Agenda [5]. Some of the main technical\
    \ challenges for modern IoT-enabled\nsmart cities are represented by the requirements\
    \ of supporting a multitude of different data\nproviders, dealing with many different\
    \ protocols and data formats, as well as ensuring\ninteroperability and scalability\
    \ and supporting the sharing of components. This is crucial\nin order to avoid\
    \ the implementation of redundant solutions for data ingestion, storage\nand analysis,\
    \ thus lowering operative costs and enhancing the city’s sustainability. The\n\
    motivation and contributions of the present paper are the following:\n1.\nProvide\
    \ an updated and comprehensive (although not exhaustive) overview of re-\nsearch\
    \ literature about smart city domains, solutions and frameworks, as well as about\n\
    key IoT technologies and applications integrated in smart city components.\n2.\n\
    Provide insights into recent trends, open technical and social challenges (also\
    \ assessing\nthe contribution of IoT–smart city technologies and domains toward\
    \ the SDGs) and\nfuture directions to be addressed in the implementation of IoT\
    \ in smart cities.\nIn this paper, an effort has been made to integrate IoT and\
    \ smart city solutions follow-\ning a classiﬁcation approach that focuses on the\
    \ identiﬁcation of eight applicable domains:\ngovernance; living and infrastructures;\
    \ mobility and transportation; economy; industry\nand production; energy; environment;\
    \ and healthcare. The rest of the paper is organized\nas follows. In Section 2,\
    \ a review of the main technologies employed in IoT frameworks\nis presented.\
    \ Section 3 provides a survey focused on IoT-enabled smart city domains\nand components.\
    \ Section 4 illustrates some recent trends and open challenges, and also\nassesses\
    \ the societal challenges involved and investigates potential future directions\
    \ for\nIoT-powered smart cities. Section 5 is left for the conclusions.\n2. IoT\
    \ Technologies and Architecture\nThe Internet of things has introduced an important\
    \ paradigm innovation in the com-\nmunication among digital devices, as well as\
    \ in the way that they connect with the physical\nenvironment [1] and interact\
    \ with human users. IoT architectures integrate and unify all\nsteps of data sensing/actuating\
    \ from/to devices, transmitting/receiving messages, data\nstorage, processing,\
    \ analysis and ﬁnal exploitation through the use of cloud, fog and edge\ncomputation,\
    \ services and applications. Many different technologies are involved in the\n\
    development of IoT frameworks. However, general functional architectures have\
    \ been\nproposed in the literature that are based on a simpliﬁed version of the\
    \ Open Systems\nInterconnection (OSI) model, but with different approaches. Some\
    \ works [1,6] deﬁne a\ntypical IoT framework composed of three layers (from the\
    \ lowest physical level to the\nhigher levels of abstraction): the perception/sensing\
    \ layer; the network layer; and the\napplication layer. In other works [7–12]\
    \ the former approach is expanded into ﬁve layers of\narchitecture, including:\
    \ the perception/sensing layer; the transportation/network layer;\nthe middleware/processing\
    \ layer; the application layer; and the business layer. In Figure 1,\nthe three-layer\
    \ and ﬁve-layer IoT architectures are depicted.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER\

    \ \nthe functionalities and involved technologies. The five-layer architecture\

    Different computing paradigms are deﬁned depending on which level of the stack\n\
    is being considered, from bottom to top: edge computing; fog computing; and cloud\n\
    computing [13]. In the following, a description of the different layers is provided\
    \ in terms\nof the functionalities and involved technologies. The ﬁve-layer architecture\
    \ was considered\nsince it can be viewed as a more detailed version of the three-layer\
    \ architecture.\n2.1. Perception/Sensing Layer\nThe perception or sensing layer\
    \ is related to the physical level that is made up of\ndevices, such as sensors\
    \ and actuators, which interact among themselves and with the\nphysical world\
    \ by sending and receiving data, exploiting wireless networks [8]. In this\ncontext,\
    \ sensors, actuators and mobile device technologies are involved. There is a wide\n\
    range of commercial devices that measure many kinds of physical quantities and\
    \ vari-\nables, i.e., sensors for measuring temperature, humidity, pressure, distance\
    \ and geospatial\ncoordinates, speed, acceleration, voltage, weight, pollutant\
    \ particles, luminance level, bio-\nmetrical signals, etc. Actuators are employed\
    \ to control/move other devices or systems\nphysically or virtually, and they\
    \ are typically classiﬁed into electrical, pneumatic and hy-\ndraulic categories\
    \ [14]. Several software tools and solutions are used to deploy low-level\nIoT\
    \ applications. Those described in the following are based on visual programming\
    \ lan-\nguages (VPLs): NetLab is an open source environment for developing embedded\
    \ systems;\nArdublock is an open source visual block programming tool for Arduino\
    \ systems; and\nScratch is a visual programming tool, developed at MIT, for IoT\
    \ code generation and\ncommunication with Arduino-based IoT products [15].\n2.2.\
    \ Transportation/Network Layer\nThe transportation or network layer provides the\
    \ function of data routing and trans-\nmission. Network gateways/brokers can be\
    \ used as mediators for integrating different\nIoT nodes, allowing them to transmit\
    \ and receive data to and from different sensors for\nM2M connectivity. Regarding\
    \ data transmission, different technologies and protocols\nare used. Proximity\
    \ communication protocols include Bluetooth, radio-frequency iden-\ntiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) tag technology and near-ﬁeld communication (NFC). Larger coverage\nnetworks\
    \ exploit wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, long range wide-area net-\n\
    work (LoRaWAN), Sigfox and 5G.\nBluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy [16] are low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnologies designed for personal area networks (PANs),\
    \ which are suitable for low-\nbandwidth data transmission among mobile devices\
    \ over a short range of up to 10 m. They\nare usually employed in smart contexts\
    \ for connecting personal devices.\nRFID exploits radio frequencies for data communication\
    \ and is usually used to\nuniquely identify objects, people, vehicles, etc. Communication\
    \ is established between\na reader device and a tag device, which can be passive\
    \ or active. NFC [17] is similar to\nRFID, but it has an even shorter range for\
    \ communication (up to few centimeters). Unlike\nRFID, NFC does not implement\
    \ a reader/tag hierarchy and can be used for two-way\ncommunication. It is typically\
    \ used for mobile payments and access control operations.\nWi-Fi is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11 standard and uses wireless frequencies (operating\nat 2.4, 5 and\
    \ 60 GHz bands) to provide high-speed internet connectivity (from 1 Mb/s to\n\
    6.75 Gb/s) within a limited distance (up to 100 m) [18]. It is designed for wireless\
    \ local area\nnetworks (WLAN).\nWiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave\
    \ Access) is based on the IEEE\n802.16 standard, operating at 2–66 GHz bands and\
    \ providing data rates from 1.5 Mb/s to\n1 Gb/s [18]. It can support broadband\
    \ wireless access for up to 50 km for ﬁxed stations and\nbetween 5–15 km for mobile\
    \ stations [19].\nZigbee is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It is a low-power\
    \ and low cost protocol\nfor wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It usually supports\
    \ star, tree and mesh network\ntopologies. The Zigbee protocol operates at 2.4\
    \ GHz and provides a data rate of about\n250 kbit/s [20]. The data transmission\
    \ range is similar to that of Wi-Fi (from 10 to 100 m).\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\
    \ 1607\n4 of 21\nLoRaWAN is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) that is capable\
    \ of transmit-\nting over long ranges (about 10 km) and also supports multitenancy\
    \ and multi-domain\nnetworks [14]. It consists of several gateways that can be\
    \ added when the network size\nincreases and a higher capacity is required.\n\
    Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is an LPWAN protocol that operates on LTE licensed\nfrequency\
    \ bands, with a data rate of about 200 Kb/s [3]. The bandwidth of NB-IoT is about\n\
    180 KHz, and this protocol allows the connection of the order of hundreds of thousands\
    \ of\ndevices [21]. The NB-IoT technology also optimizes energy consumption, providing\
    \ power\ncontrol and power saving modalities [22].\nLTE-M is another LPWAN protocol,\
    \ operating at a 1.4 MHz bandwidth [23]. It was\nintroduced with the aim of supporting\
    \ a massive number of devices, providing 10 year bat-\ntery life support [24]\
    \ and supporting data rates of up to 1 Mbit/s, which is enough to satisfy\nthe\
    \ higher data rate requirements for devices such as video cameras and wearables\
    \ [25].\nThe features supported in LTE-M include handover management, extended\
    \ discontinuous\nreception and the suspension/resumption of radio resource control\
    \ connection.\nZ-Wave is a low-power protocol typically used in wireless home\
    \ area networks,\noperating at 868 MHz and 900 MHz frequencies [7]. Z-Wave devices\
    \ cannot directly\nconnect to the Internet or other mobile devices. Therefore,\
    \ the Z-Wave network is based on\nthe use of a controller, which acts as a gateway,\
    \ in order to manage all connected devices\nand allow them to interact with other\
    \ mobile devices via the Internet or local networks [26].\nSigfox is a narrowband\
    \ communication system for transmitting data over long ranges\n(up to 40 km [27]).\
    \ Although it employs narrowband signals, Sigfox can be suitable for\nmany kinds\
    \ of applications, such as geolocation services and control messages.\nFinally,\
    \ 5G is the ﬁfth generation of cellular networks. It is a very low-latency (less\n\
    than 1 ms) and high-bandwidth (10 Gb/s) protocol [28], making it a strong enabler\
    \ for\nsmart cities and allowing the interconnectivity of a large number of IoT\
    \ devices, as well as\nbeing suitable for real-time processing.\nThe last part\
    \ of the network layer stack is in charge of suitably formatting data for\ntheir\
    \ presentation. The client/server architecture, represented by the subscription\
    \ mecha-\nnism between IoT devices and brokers, presents different modalities\
    \ for sending/receiving\nmessages/data, i.e., push and pull. Typically, pull protocols\
    \ are REST call, web services,\nFTP and HTTP/HTTPS. On the other hand, the most\
    \ common push protocols to receive\ndata via data-driven subscriptions are: WebSocket\
    \ (WS), Constrained Application Proto-\ncol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing\nProtocol (AMQP) and FIWARE NGSI and NGSI-V2\
    \ [29]. Furthermore, in order to allow\ndata exchange among multiple devices and\
    \ applications, distributed publish–subscribe\nmessaging systems should be supported\
    \ (such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Orion Broker\nof FIWARE) for handling multiple\
    \ data streams in an efﬁcient and scalable way [13]. In this\ncontext, in order\
    \ to increase fault tolerance when handling data that should not be lost in\n\
    case of failure, the data persistence of queues is an important feature (e.g.,\
    \ Apache Kafka).\n2.3. Middleware/Processing Layer\nThe middleware or processing\
    \ layer can serve many different functionalities. For\ninstance, it can act as\
    \ a data aggregator module, since data may be collected from hetero-\ngeneous\
    \ devices with different protocols that may not have been originally designed\
    \ to\ncommunicate and interact with each other. Therefore, the middleware layer\
    \ has to enable\ninteroperability among connected devices, performing the necessary\
    \ programming and/or\nmodel abstractions. Interoperability should be ensured at\
    \ different levels:\n•\nTechnical level [30], in order to efﬁciently achieve and\
    \ ensure end-to-end connectivity\namong devices, gateways, brokers, servers, etc.;\n\
    •\nSyntactical level, for managing the variety of protocols and formats;\n•\n\
    Semantic level, for exploiting Semantic Web technologies, such as XML, RDF, OWL\n\
    Ontology and linked data (LD), to achieve unambiguous data representation and\
    \ data\nsemantic enrichment, thus improving the expressiveness level of the system\
    \ [31].\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n5 of 21\nIoT middleware is also typically\
    \ devoted to providing scalability and reliability, allow-\ning the system to\
    \ handle a growing number of IoT connections and communication loads at\nthe big\
    \ data scale as well as supplying stable and fault-tolerant services. Moreover,\
    \ in order\nto enable data processing over IoT, database-level data persistence\
    \ is needed to integrate\nthe data coming with different protocols in a shared\
    \ model, and this is performed in the\nmiddleware layer. Therefore, middleware\
    \ includes the different data storage modalities\nand eventually covers other\
    \ functionalities, such as context identiﬁcation, information\nextraction and\
    \ the reconciliation of collected data. For example, FIWARE provides different\n\
    generic enablers (Cygnus, QuantumLeap, STH-Comet) to store data coming from the\
    \ Orion\nContext Broker.\n2.4. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides\
    \ the output formats, applications and services requested\nby the ﬁnal users.\
    \ Usually, works in the literature that are based on the three-layer IoT\narchitecture\
    \ include the messaging protocols management in this layer, as described in the\n\
    network layer at the end of Section 2.2.\nThe growing dissemination of IoT devices\
    \ and systems has led to the increasing\nadoption of event-driven applications\
    \ (exploiting push protocols). This is a signiﬁcant\nparadigm shift from the older\
    \ generation of smart city applications that relied on vertical\napplications\
    \ and were often based on extract, transform, load/extract, load, transform\n\
    (ETL/ELT) processes and languages, which usually only support pull protocols.\
    \ On the\nother hand, different frameworks and ecosystems are used to design and\
    \ implement event-\ndriven IoT application, for example VPL tools [32]. One of\
    \ the most used is Node-RED,\nwhich is based on the Node.js engine and allows\
    \ the creation of application ﬂows in a\ngraphic environment through the composition\
    \ of visual nodes or blocks [33].\n2.5. Business Layer\nThe business layer was\
    \ introduced to classify all operations and front-end tools that\nconsume data\
    \ from the application layer for producing advanced big data analytics and\nvisualization\
    \ services, with the goal of building business models, supporting decision-\n\
    making processes and performing simulations and what-if analysis. This can be\
    \ achieved\nby implementing, for instance, predictive models based on machine\
    \ learning, deep learn-\ning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques [34],\
    \ as well as advanced and interactive\nvisual analysis tools [35]. Moreover, the\

    \ was the main object of the present review, i.e., papers published from\n2018\
    \ to the present (2021) were selected from the initial search;\n3.\nPapers from\
    \ Q1 and Q2 journals (as ranked in the SCImago index) were given priority\nover\
    \ those from Q3 and Q4.\nFollowing these criteria, a total of 52 surveys and reviews\
    \ on IoT-enabled smart cities\nwere considered as the baseline for the survey\
    \ presented in this paper. It is to be noted\nthat most of the 52 surveys reviewed\
    \ often aimed to review one or some speciﬁc IoT–smart\ncity domains and use cases\
    \ without providing a more general or comprehensive overview,\nwhich is one of\
    \ the aims of this paper. In addition, in our opinion, the few general surveys\n\
    that were retrieved lacked in addressing the relationships between each smart\
    \ city domain\n(with related sub-domains and scenarios) with the related IoT technologies\
    \ that have been\nemployed in each speciﬁc context.\nIn order to describe the\
    \ wide landscape that we found by reviewing the selected\nliterature in the most\
    \ comprehensive way, the following eight domains were identiﬁed\n(as depicted\
    \ in Figure 3), which are typically used to classify smart city components and\n\
    application areas: governance; living and infrastructures; mobility and transportation;\n\
    economy; industry and production; energy; environment; and healthcare. This approach\n\
    extends the six-domain classiﬁcation presented in [1,37]. The classiﬁcation proposed\
    \ in this\npaper is not meant to be exhaustive and, in some cases, these domains\
    \ may not necessarily\nbe orthogonal as they may overlap in several contexts and\
    \ applications.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n7 of 21\nerature in the most comprehensive\

    \ decision-making process and speed up bureaucratic and administra-\ntive procedures\
    \ through a smarter collaboration among different stakeholders and social\nactors\
    \ [38], including public administrations, city ofﬁcers, private companies and\
    \ citizens.\nThis can be successfully accomplished by providing innovative city\
    \ services, dedicated\nchannels and network integration for citizens. For instance,\
    \ citizens can be engaged in par-\nticipating with city governance activities\
    \ and decisional processes through ICT-based tools\nand social media [39] as evidence\
    \ of the mobile crowdsourcing paradigm [40], according to\nwhich citizens can\
    \ act as “users as sensors” with their smartphones and mobile devices,\nparticipating\
    \ as individuals and in groups in the acquisition process of data of interest\
    \ for\nsmart communities.\nIoT technologies are transforming traditional city\
    \ governance transactions and pro-\ncesses into smart government resources on\
    \ the basis of the different participating ac-\ntors, i.e., government-to-citizen\
    \ (G2C), government-to-business (G2B) and government-to-\ngovernment (G2G) [41,42]:\n\
    •\nGovernment-to-citizen (G2C) refers to the set of software solutions (typically\
    \ web\nand mobile based) that support the relationships between public administrations\
    \ and\ncitizens, such as public administration web portals and/or mobile applications\
    \ and\nsocial media channels employed for communication and interaction between\
    \ local\ngovernments and citizens. In addition, IoT technologies, such as RFID\
    \ and biometric\nsensors, are widely and increasingly adopted in electronic ID\
    \ cards and mobile devices\nfor identity recognition, electronic authentication\
    \ and signature, according to different\ngovernmental standards, such as the European\
    \ Community’s electronic IDentiﬁcation,\nAuthentication and trust Services (eIDAS)\
    \ [43]. These features are typically required\nto access services that are provided\
    \ by public administrations and consult citizens’ per-\nsonal data related to\
    \ public services, etc., thus simplifying a lot of the communication\nand interaction\
    \ between governmental authorities and citizens;\n•\nGovernment-to-business (G2B)\
    \ regards the interactions between public administra-\ntions and businesses companies.\
    \ In this model, e-procurement solutions are adopted,\ni.e., digital tools (mainly\

    \ of goods and other general\nservices for and from private companies. IoT technologies\
    \ are widely adopted in G2B\nactivities, facilitating and enhancing the relationship\
    \ between local governments and\ncompanies that provide public and private services\
    \ to citizens. For instance, trans-\nportation companies use location-based sensors\
    \ (usually exploiting GPS technology)\nand services, sharing them with local administrations\
    \ and allowing the easier and\nmore efﬁcient urban planning for mobility and transportation\
    \ [44]. In addition, it\nincludes similar aspects involved in many other domains\
    \ that provide public and\nfundamental services, such as waste management, water,\
    \ energy, etc. To this end,\nthe use of cloud computing is generally adopted to\
    \ store and share data and results\namong the different stakeholders (city operators,\
    \ companies and citizens);\n•\nGovernment-to-government (G2G) is related to the\
    \ software solutions that aim to\nimprove communications between the different\
    \ public administration entities and\ngroups, thereby speeding up all processes\
    \ that require the interaction of these actors.\nThis implies the use of IoT technologies\
    \ for data collection, storage and sharing, which\nexploits, for instance, cloud\
    \ computing and web/mobile-based services. A report of\nthe European JRC also\
    \ observed that governments may beneﬁt from the combination\nof various data sources\
    \ (e.g., from IoT and the web) with suitable analytical techniques\n(including\
    \ AI-based techniques) to better identify and design speciﬁc administrative\n\
    policies [45].\nIn Barcelona, ICT has represented a key driver for the evolution\
    \ of the city model,\nbased on ﬂexible and efﬁcient e-government initiatives and\
    \ services that aim to make\nthe city more innovative, inclusive and self-sufﬁcient\
    \ [46]. In the early 2000s, the city of\nBarcelona started implementing the 22@Barcelona\
    \ Project to enhance the technological,\nsocio-economical and sustainable impact\
    \ of the region in order to improve citizens’ quality\nof life (QoL) [47]. In\
    \ Amsterdam, a consortium consisting of the municipalities, research\ncenters\
    \ and private companies of the metropolitan area developed and launched the\n\
    Amsterdam Smart City Platform (ASCP) in 2014: an online board where the aforementioned\n\
    stakeholders can discuss urban issues, propose solutions and foster city innovation\
    \ [48]. The\nlocal government in Rio de Janeiro has promoted city data sharing\
    \ initiatives, hosting them\nin the so-called Intelligent Operations Centre (IOC)\
    \ premises with the aim of increasing\nthe efﬁciency of city services [49]. Moreover,\
    \ the Rio Agora social platform has been\nimplemented to allow citizens to propose\
    \ and discuss public policies with municipal\nauthorities [3]. Singapore has adopted\
    \ several smart governance projects through the\nSmart Nation and Digital Governance\
    \ Group (SNDGG) [50], including a digital identity\nsystem for Singapore residents\
    \ that allows them to perform easier transactions with public\nadministration\
    \ and the Core Operations Development and eXchange (CODEX), which\nis a digital\
    \ platform delivering smart services to citizens. In Toronto, the Sidewalk Labs\n\
    smart city project was proposed. The project promotes data sharing standards and\
    \ data\ngovernance models to proﬁtably exploit the data gathered from citizens\
    \ [51] through the\nurban data trust model. This allows for the collection, management\
    \ and aggregation of\nurban non-personal data, de-identiﬁed data and personal\
    \ information (according to data\nprivacy regulations and laws) and then extracts\
    \ value from them [52]. Songdo in South\nKorea is considered one of most advanced\
    \ large-scale greenﬁeld-based smart city projects\nin the world [53]. In fact,\
    \ Songdo is deﬁned as a ubiquitous U-city, in which data are\ncontinuously collected\
    \ through a capillary network of sensors and equipment. Data are\nshared and interconnected\
    \ with information from public institutions, such as the Incheon\nCity Trafﬁc\
    \ Information Center, the Korean Meteorological Administration, the Institute\n\
    of Health and Environment, Police Agency, etc. Data are analyzed by the U-Integrated\n\
    Operation Center and provided to citizens through media broadcasts and control\
    \ servers\nin order to help them to ﬁnd the necessary information [54].\nAppl.\

    \ living domain includes all components related to developing smarter city\ninfrastructures\
    \ (e.g., smart homes, smart buildings, etc.) as well the management and\nimprovement\
    \ of public services, such as cultural activities, tourism and education, which\n\
    are involved in enhancing the general quality of life of citizens:\n•\nSmart Buildings:\
    \ IoT allows the rapidly growing implementation of many kinds of\nfacilities for\
    \ smart buildings, for instance, air conditioning management, rainwater\ndrainage,\
    \ security systems for managing authenticated access to buildings, video\nsurveillance\
    \ and human activity monitoring [55], alerts for events such as ﬁres and gas\n\
    leaks, tools for monitoring the structural integrity of buildings [56], etc. Many\
    \ different\nIoT technologies are involved in the living and infrastructures domain,\
    \ depending on\nthe speciﬁc use case or scenario. As for smart buildings, IoT\
    \ integration with Building\nInformation Modeling (BIM) tools provides a high-ﬁdelity\
    \ representation of buildings\nand spatial properties as a set of virtual assets\
    \ [57], i.e., a digital twin of the building;\n•\nSmart Homes: In these environments,\
    \ different kinds of sensors, actuators and per-\nsonal devices are connected\
    \ through wireless networks and are often powered by\nhuman–machine interfaces\
    \ that are based on artiﬁcial intelligence to provide smart\nand automated services\
    \ for the users, with the goal of assisting them in daily tasks,\nsuch as lighting\
    \ control, surveillance, managing home appliances and home resources,\nenergy\
    \ consumption, etc. [58]. In addition, smart home applications can be useful to\n\
    detect and track the actions of the house’s residents in order to monitor their\
    \ health\nconditions [12], thereby especially helping the elderly and disabled\
    \ people. Several\nkinds of sensors are applied to smart home and indoor sensing\
    \ contexts. For in-\nstance, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are employed\
    \ for the detection of gas\nleaks [59]. Devices based on triboelectric nanogenerators\
    \ (TENG) are used for smart\nwindows [60] and smart indoor lighting systems [61].\
    \ Video cameras and Closed-\ncircuit television (CCTV) systems are used for smart\
    \ surveillance. Digital humidity\nand temperature (DHT) sensors are largely adopted\
    \ in ﬁre alerting systems [62]. The\nmost recent generation of domestic appliances\
    \ and entertainment devices is often\npowered by AI and assistive services, so\
    \ that they can interact while interconnected\nthrough wireless networks (the\
    \ most used network communication protocols are\nBluetooth, Zigbee, infrared and\
    \ Wi-Fi [63]), thus providing users with a better, more\nefﬁcient and enjoyable\
    \ home life and experience;\n•\nSmart Living Services: IoT devices have a large\
    \ application in a variety of areas and\nactivities that contribute toward improving\
    \ the general quality of life for smart citizens.\nCultural activities, for instance,\
    \ smart tourism management, are taking advantage of\nexploiting mobile applications,\
    \ GIS-aware and location-based services, multimedia\nstreams, virtual and augmented\
    \ reality and social media to manage and offer a better\nexperience for tourism\
    \ stakeholders [64]. Examples of these applications include\ntourist experience\
    \ enhancement, destination competitiveness and sustainability im-\nprovement by\
    \ tracking users’ ﬂows and behaviors [65]. Education is experiencing an\nincreasing\
    \ decentralization process with the inclusion of ICT and IoT elements, and\nthis\
    \ allows the production of new education services that can enhance interaction\
    \ in\nremote and real-world learning activities [66].\nNumerous smart living and\
    \ infrastructures applications can be found in real-world\ncases. In [67], it\
    \ is reported that 840 million units of smart home products were supplied in\n\
    China in 2019. Los Angeles has implemented smart strategies for tourism management.\n\
    Tourist trafﬁc is measured through sensors embedded in the pavements and this\
    \ informa-\ntion is used to adjust site visitor lights [68]. In Dubai, tourists\
    \ can discover places of interest\nand events by exploiting NFC tags from their\
    \ personal devices. There are many dedi-\ncated mobile apps that take advantage\
    \ of cloud computing and allow visitors to connect\nseamlessly, without the need\
    \ to download the app [69].\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n10 of 21\n3.3. Smart Mobility\
    \ and Transportation\nThe smart mobility and transportation concept implies the\
    \ shift from traditional\ntransportation systems to Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS),\
    \ where a smart IoT infrastructure\nconnects different actors (citizens, public\
    \ administrations, private companies) and entities\n(vehicles, personal devices,\
    \ city sensors, actuators, etc.) [70]. IoT and intelligent transporta-\ntion systems\
    \ (ITSs) [71] allow the provision of smart applications and services to manage,\n\
    for instance, private and public trafﬁc ﬂows, dynamic trafﬁc routing, smart parking,\
    \ vehicle\nsharing and sustainable mobility, connected driving, etc. Intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc solutions often\nrely on the application of predictive models for early\
    \ warnings, accident prevention and\nreal-time trafﬁc congestion management.\n\
    In this context, many IoT network technologies have been proposed and used. City\n\
    sensors and actuators (e.g., for the management of trafﬁc lights, digital signage,\
    \ road\nbarriers, etc.), location-based GPS services and mobile-to-mobile communication\
    \ are the\nbasis for the implementation of vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V)\
    \ and vehicle-to-\ninfrastructure communication (V2I). Additionally, 5G networks\
    \ and LTE-based systems\nhave been employed for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services\
    \ [72]. Vehicular ad hoc net-\nworks (VANETs) [73] have been designed to handle\
    \ a large number of nodes (including\nvehicles, roadside units (RSU) and on-board\
    \ units (OBU) [74]) and present a good adapt-\nability to the frequent topology\
    \ changes and the data exchange rate [75]. The adoption of\nITSs is at the basis\
    \ of smart parking and car sharing [76] services. The most disseminated\ndevices\
    \ are RFID tags, infrared and ultrasonic sensors, smartphone-based sensors, video\n\
    cameras for smart parking [77] and on-board diagnostic systems (OBD tools) [78].\n\
    In Berlin, the smart mobility service Jelbi was introduced in 2019, based on a\
    \ mobile\napplication that is connected to all services provided locally (e.g.,\
    \ car-sharing companies\nsuch as MILES and DB Flinkster and e-vehicle hire companies\
    \ such as TIER), to foster the\npassage toward a more sustainable mobility [79].\
    \ In Florence, the Snap4City platform has\nbeen developed in the context of the\
    \ Sii-Mobility project for sustainable mobility, providing\na ﬂexible IoT smart\
    \ city platform and several applications to manage heterogeneous and\ncomplex\
    \ urban mobility scenarios by integrating city sensors/actuators and IoT/IoE [34].\n\
    Atlanta has powered its transportation infrastructure with many smart technologies.\
    \ For\ninstance, a system of adaptive trafﬁc signals that adjust to trafﬁc conditions\
    \ in real time\nare installed on the North Avenue Smart Corridor (a critical longitudinal\
    \ communication\nroadway) [3]. London has a cycle rental system, currently offering\
    \ more than 11,500 bikes\nand over 750 docking stations. As for car-sharing solutions,\
    \ London has six active operators\nin the city, covering the whole Greater London\
    \ area [80]. In addition, London’s public\ntransportation system provides the\
    \ use of Oyster cards, which are smart electronic cards\nthat exploit RFID technology\
    \ and can be used for paying and buying electronic tickets for\npublic transportation,\
    \ thereby reducing queues and eventually tracking users’ ﬂows. In\nSantander,\
    \ smart mobility services are applied to the management of public transportation,\n\
    outdoor parking management and trafﬁc routing [81]. The city of Bilbao has enhanced\
    \ the\nsustainability of local mobility by deploying a network of e-bikes with\
    \ 40 pick-up points\nand e-buses that are supported by mobile applications: GeoBilbao\
    \ (reporting real-time\ninformation about parking and trafﬁc status) and iBilbobus\
    \ (information about bus stops\nand schedules) [66]. In Seoul, the Gangnam ubiquitous\
    \ district has a centralized control\nframework, including the Transport Operation\
    \ and Information Service (TOPIS) app and\nthe “Owl Bus”, which is an innovative\
    \ bus service performing analytics on the big data\nthat is collected on-board\
    \ [82].\n3.4. Smart Economy\nA smart economy is based on the innovative interconnection\
    \ of local and global mar-\nkets through ICT, providing e-business and e-commerce\
    \ services to increase productivity\nand delivery [83]. In addition, the concept\
    \ of a sharing economy is also included in this\ndomain, where individuals or\
    \ private companies offer services exploiting their own assets\nas well as through\
    \ peer-to-peer marketplaces. There are also peer-to-peer labor services,\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n11 of 21\nin which citizens and stakeholders offer their\
    \ work and experience for speciﬁc tasks [84].\nArtiﬁcial intelligence and machine\
    \ learning techniques have been implemented for building\npredictive models and\
    \ improving recommendation systems for e-commerce and retail shop-\nping [85].\
    \ The use of NFC and wireless sensor technologies has facilitated payment and\n\
    transaction processes. In Shenzen, the use of mobiles and smartphones in daily\
    \ transactions\nand information access is making cash and bankcards obsolete [86].\n\
    3.5. Smart Industry and Production\nSmart industry and industry 4.0 deﬁne a transformation\
    \ process in which IoT tech-\nnologies, cyber-physical systems (CPS), M2M communication\
    \ systems and cloud-based\nmanufacturing [87] allow an innovative and less human-dependent\
    \ productive environ-\nment [88]. Regarding the automation of goods supply chains,\
    \ they can be easily tracked\nfrom the manufacturing process to ﬁnal distribution\
    \ using sensor technologies, such as\nRFID and NFC. Real-time information can\
    \ be collected and analyzed for shipment tracking,\nas well as for the assessment\
    \ of the quality and usability of products [14]. The smart indus-\ntry and production\
    \ domain includes all ﬁelds in which ICT leads to the automatization\nof the productive\
    \ workﬂow, therefore also includes smart agriculture and farming, which\naddresses\
    \ the challenge of sustainable food production. Smart agriculture systems often\n\
    employ IoT devices to improve irrigation efﬁciency [89] and AI solutions are often\
    \ deployed\nin IoT for agriculture, e.g., for crop monitoring, disease detection\
    \ and data-driven crop\nsupply management [7].\nDublin Airport has employed smart\
    \ industry 4.0 solutions to replace its baggage-\nhandling systems in Terminal\
    \ 2 [90]. In Shenzen, a smart industrial complex includes a\nseries of smart factories\
    \ that share technologies and provide efﬁcient services (exploiting\nan ultra-high-speed\
    \ Internet connection, next-generation wireless network, free Wi-Fi\ninfrastructures\
    \ and IoT devices connected via a common cloud platform) [3].\n3.6. Smart Energy\n\
    Smart energy systems involve the intelligent integration of decentralized renewable\n\
    and sustainable energy sources and their efﬁcient distribution [91] and aim to\
    \ optimize\npower consumption [92]. Smart grids take advantage of ICT and IoT\
    \ technologies for\nthe better management of power generation and distribution,\
    \ exploiting, for instance,\nprediction models (developed from collected consumption\
    \ data) and often ensuring the\nself-healing of the energy network supply [93].\
    \ Smart grids help energy load balancing\non the basis of usage and availability.\
    \ In this way, it is possible to switch automatically to\nalternative sources\
    \ of energy, as well as predicting future energy demand and estimating\nthe power\
    \ availability and price [14].\nNew generations of smart energy IoT devices have\
    \ been designed for alternative\nenergy harvesting, such as triboelectric nanogenerators\
    \ (TENG) and electrostatic energy\nharvesters (EEH) [59]. A multiplicity of IoT\
    \ sensors is involved in the smart energy context,\nsuch as light dependent resistors\
    \ (LDRs), sensors for measuring light luminosity [94] and\nthe consumption of\
    \ solar radiation and electricity [95].\nNice, France, has made efforts to improve\
    \ smart energy management by scheduling\nelectricity consumption in residential\
    \ and business locations. The smart grid in Nice\nwas created through a smart\
    \ solar neighborhood in city areas by supplying and storing\ndistributed electricity\
    \ [58]. The city of Padova has performed several initiatives in intelligent\n\
    energy management, such as a smart lighting system in which each smart light device\
    \ is\ngeolocated in the city and is powered by photometer sensors that monitor\
    \ the intensity\nof the light emitted by the lamps and check that the correct\
    \ operation of the bulbs is\nperformed [96]. Atlanta has implemented a smart neighborhood\
    \ project to reduce the\nHome Energy Rating System (HERS) score. Energy optimization\
    \ platforms manage home\nappliances, switching to solar power and batteries if\
    \ available [3]. In Helsinki, smart grids\nhelp to reduce energy usage by 15%\
    \ [97]. The Masdar City project aimed to be one of\nthe most efﬁcient and environment-friendly\
    \ systems in the UAE by exploiting renewable\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n12 of\
    \ 21\nenergy technologies. The city has planned a solar power array and rooftop\
    \ solar panels that\ncan provide more than 10 MW. This, combined with wind energy\
    \ harvesting technologies,\ncan supply energy for a target population of about\
    \ 40,000 citizens [98].\n3.7. Smart Environment\nThe smart environment domain\
    \ includes environmental data collection, monitoring\nand analysis for pollution\
    \ reduction, water quality and supply monitoring and weather\nand climate events\
    \ management [67]. In this regard, air quality monitoring is a crucial\nfactor\
    \ for tracking levels of air pollutants (e.g., NOx, O3, CO2, N2O, PM10, PM2.5,\
    \ etc.),\nwhich represent a serious issue for human health (caused by transportation,\
    \ heating and\nindustrial emissions). Smart waste management is also included\
    \ in this area since it has\nnumerous impacts on the environment. Control policies\
    \ for waste production are handled\nwith smart waste bins that are installed with\
    \ sensors and are capable of providing the\nreal-time analysis of the capacity\
    \ that is currently available [92].\nAs for smart water, sensing devices that\
    \ are devoted to the assessment of water\nquantity and quality typically measure\
    \ parameters such as pH, conductivity, turbidity, total\ndissolved solids, etc.\
    \ [99]. Electromagnetic and ultrasonic sensors are employed to measure\nthe pressure\
    \ for water consumption rate analysis [100]. The application of WSNs for water\n\
    quantity and quality monitoring systems has opened up a new generation of smart\
    \ water\nmonitoring systems, providing a more advanced context awareness and near\
    \ real-time\ninteraction [101].\nSmart environment applications and services are\
    \ typically based on ambient and\nchemical sensors, which are used to measure\
    \ physical quantities expressing environmental\nparameters and conditions, such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, pressure [7] and different kinds\nof pollutants. Smart\
    \ sensing and visualization technologies (satellites, LiDAR) are applied\nto greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions (GHG) and land usage [99]. Location-based services and GIS\ndata\
    \ are also employed.\nIn Singapore, solid waste is managed by the Integrated Waste\
    \ Management Facility\n(IWMF), which includes innovative IoT technology that allows\
    \ for an increase in the process\nefﬁciency and a reduction in GHG emissions [102].\
    \ In Amsterdam, the Green City Watch is\na geo-spatial AI platform that monitors\
    \ urban green infrastructures in near real time using\nAI algorithms and satellite\
    \ images [103]. In Stockholm, solar-powered smart waste bins are\ninstalled, which\
    \ automatically report when they are fully charged and also perform waste\npackaging\
    \ [66]. The Busan smart city, South Korea, employs smart water management\nsystems\
    \ in the whole urban water cycle [3]. In the context of the European TRAFAIR\n\
    project, six European cities (Florence, Pisa, Livorno and Modena in Italy and\
    \ Santiago de\nCompostela and Zaragoza in Spain) have adopted the Snap4City platform\
    \ for monitoring\nurban air quality (using sensors that collect data in the six\
    \ cities) and providing urban air\nquality predictions using simulation models\
    \ [104].\n3.8. Smart Healthcare\nIoT technologies and ubiquitous computing have\
    \ been widely applied to mobile\nhealthcare for remote monitoring, telemedicine\
    \ and telenursing, adverse drugs reactions,\ncommunity healthcare, etc., and these\
    \ aspects are even more relevant in this recent period\nof the COVID-19 pandemic.\
    \ Remote patient monitoring (RPM) can be performed through\nthe use of wearable\
    \ or implanted devices (e.g., cardiac devices, airﬂow monitors, blood glu-\ncometers,\
    \ etc.) that are connected in the cloud using WSN technologies [20]. This has\
    \ led to\nthe development of body sensor networks (BSNs) or wireless body area\
    \ networks (WBANs),\nin which the integration of multiple heterogeneous data sources\
    \ allows the acquisition of\nthe biometric and physiological data of the patients\
    \ for IoT healthcare applications [105].\nSmart hospitals also rely on IoT technologies\
    \ to provide services for medical staff and pa-\ntients (the identiﬁcation and\
    \ monitoring of patients in hospitals and the smart management\nof medical instruments\
    \ supporting decision-making processes in hospitals) [106]. All of\nthese application\
    \ ﬁelds and the related requirements impose well-deﬁned standards, such\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n13 of 21\nas Health Level Seven (HL7), PACS-DICOM in biomedical\
    \ image processing [107], etc.\nRecent advances propose the use of AI techniques\
    \ to deﬁne innovative applications, e.g.,\nmachine learning prognostics and the\
    \ measurement of biometric parameters or symptoms\nfrom multimedia (using mobile\
    \ videos or voice messages, through deep learning- and\nspeech recognition-based\
    \ methods) [108] and disease prediction and prevention [109].\nSingapore has developed\
    \ the HealthHub platform, which integrates personal health\nrecord management\
    \ and the clinical data of patients and citizens [3]. In Stockholm, the\nNew Karolinska\
    \ Solna Hospital integrated smart energy and BIM technologies to provide\nuser-focused\
    \ services (for patients, visitors and medical staff) [110]. The hospital of Hefei,\n\
    China, is one of the ﬁrst of China’s smart hospitals [111] where all aspects of\
    \ the patients\nare managed via IoT and connected healthcare, also providing smart\
    \ building services\nand sustainable energy management. The Helsinki University\
    \ Hospital has implemented\na real-time locating system (RTLS) to collect and\
    \ share anonymized location data about\non-site movements for proximity tracing\
    \ during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, cloud\nservices are provided to enable\
    \ doctors and nurses to remotely interact with COVID-19\npatients [112].\nTo conclude\
    \ the review, Table 1 presents an integrated summary of the smart city\ndomains\
    \ that were presented in this section, in terms of supported services and features,\n\

    \ Future Directions\nIoT smart city technologies and applications are spreading\
    \ rapidly, and this is reported\nin more and more real-world cases. However, on\
    \ the basis of the analysis and review\nperformed in the previous sections, this\
    \ integration process is not complete since it is still\nfacing some open challenges,\
    \ which may be resolved in future developments.\nFor instance, there are interoperability\
    \ problems due to the presence of many different\nIoT protocols, formats and frameworks\
    \ [3,29,92,105,113], and this aspect is enhanced\nby the fact that many smart\
    \ city applications have been initially developed as vertical\nsilos applications\
    \ [3,18] with each of them using its own solutions for data ingestion,\nstorage\
    \ and exploitation. Resolving the interoperability issues could bring economic\n\
    beneﬁts. In fact, achieving a higher level of interoperability among devices,\
    \ applications\nand services involves the reduction in costs for producing completely\
    \ new and different\ndeployments of the solutions [113], thereby allowing backward\
    \ compatibility through\nthe exploitation of older systems as well as an incremental\
    \ deployment and integration.\nOn the other hand, the development of the IoT/IoE\
    \ paradigm has led to the adoption\nof event-driven and push protocols [32], which\
    \ has paved the way not only to sense the\ncity but also to act through actuators\
    \ and to create event-driven applications. However,\nmost of the solutions proposed\
    \ in the literature still focus on limited domains, addressing\nspeciﬁc problems\
    \ with little or no software reuse [3]. In order to handle the high variety\n\
    of IoT devices and applications, the paradigm of microservice-oriented architecture\
    \ is\nincreasingly adopted in recent IoT-based solutions for smart cities [13,29,32,109].\
    \ This\nenhances the scalability and availability of IoT frameworks and simpliﬁes\
    \ the complexity\nof the traditional service-oriented architectures (SOA) [32].\
    \ For IoT-based solutions, the\nachievement of a higher scalability represents\
    \ the possibility to efﬁciently collect and\nprocess increasingly larger amounts\
    \ of data, which often leads to a higher accuracy in\ndata analysis and often\
    \ enables real-time or near real-time processing [114]. These aspects\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 1607\n15 of 21\nimply important social involvement, for instance,\
    \ in security and resilience, since they\nallow the building of more resilient\
    \ tools that are able to perform real-time analysis and\nsimulations, e.g., those\
    \ used by local public authorities for early warnings and alerts in\ncritical\
    \ events, such as disaster management [99] and resilience planning. Moreover,\
    \ many\nIoT solutions are still oriented toward traditional programming environments,\
    \ while the\nmost recent trends show an advancement in the exploitation of visual\
    \ paradigm languages\n(VPL) [15,32], including Node-RED, for implementing workﬂows\
    \ for IoT applications.\nThe adoption of microservice-oriented architectures leads\
    \ toward the overcoming of\nthe monolithic platform approach [3] since the microservice\
    \ paradigm allows the reuse of\nsoftware components and blocks. Moreover, microservice\
    \ architectures are open to exten-\nsions and they can also exploit external services\
    \ more easily (when necessary for delegating\npart of the computation as well\
    \ as accessing additional services or applications) [29]. For\ninstance, they\
    \ can be easily adapted to support almost all kinds of IoT and communication\n\
    protocols and also support data-driven and event-driven push modalities. This\
    \ is moving\nin the direction of the implementation of smarter frameworks for\
    \ business intelligence and\ndata analytics, as well as more interactive visual\
    \ analysis tools [32]. This deeper level of\nintegration and complexity of IoT-enabled\
    \ smart city platforms should bring advancements\nin performing real-time simulations,\
    \ what-if analysis and supporting decision-making\nprocesses, which is the basis\
    \ of the production of smarter and more efﬁcient services and\napplications for\
    \ all involved stakeholders.\nFurthermore, IoT-enabled smart city platforms are\
    \ evolving toward cross-organization\nand multitenancy IoT platforms and applications.\
    \ This allows the development of large\ninfrastructures that can support multiple\
    \ organizations, enhance scalability and reduce the\ninfrastructures’ costs since\
    \ they are shared between multiple operators [36]. This aspect\nis closely connected\
    \ with the reuse of components in smart city frameworks and tries to\nharmonize\
    \ and overcome the efforts needed in building custom-made platforms for each\n\
    city or each speciﬁc context, which is economically inefﬁcient [3]. Other potential\
    \ future di-\nrections include the introduction and dissemination of novel network\
    \ technologies, such as\n5G [28,59,72,102]. Technological advances in networks\
    \ and device solutions are important.\nIn fact, the adoption of the most recent\
    \ network technologies, such as 5G, combined with\nhigher efﬁciency in building\
    \ techniques and technologies following the paradigm of net\nzero energy infrastructure\
    \ can lead to building solutions that are aiming for net zero carbon\nemissions\
    \ [102]. Furthermore, the introduction of innovative computing paradigms, such\n\
    as the introduction and integration of deep learning and AI solutions [109,115],\
    \ semantic\ntechnologies and natural language processing (NLP) would improve the\
    \ interaction level\nbetween smart devices and all smart city actors, as well\
    \ as enabling the production of\nsmarter services for a better quality of life.\n\
    Finally, in order to also discuss the societal challenges addressed by IoT and\
    \ smart city\ntechnologies, we focused on assessing each application area and\
    \ domain, as discussed in\nSection 3, in terms of their contribution to the SDGs.\
    \ To this end, we will brieﬂy introduce\nthe 17 indicators representing the SDGs:\
    \ (1) no poverty; (2) zero hunger; (3) good health\nand well-being; (4) quality\
    \ education; (5) gender equality; (6) clean water and sanitation;\n(7) affordable\
    \ and clean energy; (8) decent work and economic growth; (9) industry, innova-\n\
    tion and infrastructure; (10) reduced inequalities; (11) sustainable cities and\
    \ communities;\n(12) responsible consumption and production; (13) climate action;\
    \ (14) life below water;\n(15) life on land; (16) peace, justice and strong institutions;\
    \ and (17) partnerships for the\ngoals. On the basis of our ﬁndings while reviewing\
    \ the literature, relevant contributions\nand relations among the presented IoT–smart\
    \ city application areas and the following SDGs\nwere retrieved:\n•\nZero Hunger:\
    \ Smart agriculture [7] solutions contribute to improving efﬁciency in ac-\ncessing\
    \ fundamental resources, such as food, and also allow precision agriculture [89];\n\
    •\nGood Health and Well-being: Smart healthcare solutions [106,108] contribute\
    \ to im-\nproving efﬁciency in healthcare services that are provided in hospitals\
    \ and medical\nstructures, as well as at home. Big data collection and analysis\
    \ in healthcare contexts\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n16 of 21\ncan be useful for\
    \ monitoring critical cases, conditions and events [109], especially in\nthe period\
    \ of COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\nQuality Education: Smart education solutions contribute\
    \ to creating innovative educa-\ntion services, as well as to enhancing the interaction\
    \ between remote and real-world\nlearning activities [66];\n•\nClean Water and\
    \ Sanitation: Smart water solutions [100] are employed to monitor\nthe quantity\
    \ and quality of water distribution and aim to minimize consumption and\nmanage\
    \ wastewater treatments [101]. This represents an important step in the proper\n\
    design and maintenance of quality water systems;\n•\nAffordable and Clean Energy:\
    \ Smart energy solutions and energy grids [3,58,93,96,97]\ncontribute to a more\
    \ efﬁcient energy distribution and usage [92], helping to minimize\npower consumption\
    \ and consider innovative sustainable energy sources [91];\n•\nDecent Work and\
    \ Economic Growth: Smart governance solutions [3,38,39,46–54]\ncontribute to economic\
    \ growth [38] since they are expected to provoke a strong push\nin the direction\
    \ of smart and digital public administrations [39]. Moreover, smart\neconomy solutions\
    \ [83,84] can also contribute to allowing citizens, companies and\nsmart city\
    \ stakeholders to follow the market for smart applications and data economy,\n\
    rethinking the ﬂexibility of jobs and labors [84] and, thus, redeﬁning the economic\n\
    value associated with them;\n•\nIndustry, Innovation and Infrastructure: Smart\
    \ industry solutions [3,14,33,90] are\nestablishing new and relevant digital infrastructures\
    \ for sustainable industrial produc-\ntion [88] and data economy;\n•\nSustainable\
    \ Cities and Communities: Several IoT-enabled smart city components\ncontribute\
    \ to improving the sustainability of smart city communities. For instance,\nsmart\
    \ mobility solutions [3,66,79–82] are aiming to establish near-to-zero emissions\n\
    and reduced trafﬁc ﬂows and to also enhance the adoption of smart transportation\n\
    and IoT paradigms. These aspects will bring relevant inﬂuences and improvements\n\
    for the quality of life in smart cities [92];\n•\nClimate Action: Smart environment\
    \ technologies [3,66,102,103] that are focused on\nmonitoring air quality and\
    \ pollutant levels [99,104] contribute to analyzing and con-\ntrolling air quality\
    \ and fossil combustion, as well as their environmental impact in\nterms of CO2,\
    \ NO, NO2, etc. (which are the main effects of fossil combustion);\n•\nPeace,\
    \ Justice and Strong Institutions: Smart governance solutions [3,38,39,46–54]\n\
    contribute to providing institutions with data-driven decision-making processes\
    \ [39],\nwhich makes citizens’ participation more inclusive and deliberative,\
    \ thus creating a\nconsensus for the public good and enhancing equality and social\
    \ justice [38].\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, a review of the recent research\
    \ literature on IoT-enabled smart cities\nframework was performed. The rationale\
    \ behind this study was the requirement to un-\nderstand and classify the most\
    \ recent trends in the adoption of IoT technologies as a key\ndriver for the efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable development of smart cities. The purpose was also\nto highlight\
    \ the main open challenges that need to be addressed and resolved in the future.\n\
    The review was conducted both for key IoT technologies, which were analyzed following\n\
    an architectural perspective, and for smart city approaches and frameworks, which\
    \ were\nbased on classiﬁcation into eight domains describing the main application\
    \ areas. From this\nanalysis, it emerged that in recent years, the integration\
    \ of IoT solutions and smart city\nframeworks is achieving increasingly higher\
    \ levels of complexity and wider application\nranges, which go beyond the past\
    \ generation of vertical silo applications that were based\non speciﬁc domains.\
    \ In fact, the necessity to overcome vertical silos (i.e., where data are\ncollected\
    \ and “siloed” in a unique system and closed to the rest of IoT [114]) has provoked\n\
    several initiatives. For instance, the EU developed speciﬁc initiatives and IoT\
    \ programs,\nsuch as the open API standard Open Messaging Interface (O-MI) and\
    \ Open Data Format\n(O-DF) [116]. This produces new added-value across multiple\
    \ platforms, providing the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n17 of 21\npossibility to\
    \ share protocols, data and results and allowing the better and more efﬁcient\n\
    cooperation between all involved actors and stakeholders (users, software and\
    \ network\nproviders, institutions, companies, etc.) [114]. To this end, the new\
    \ generation of smart\napplications will manage and optimize more complex sets\
    \ of heterogeneous information,\ndata, systems, sensors, devices, etc. However,\
    \ this process is still not complete since it\nhas to cope with several open technical\
    \ and social challenges (regarding the efforts to\nharmonize the many different\
    \ standards for IoT formats and protocols, interoperability\nand scalability issues\
    \ and the achievement of sustainability goals) in order to move toward\nmicroservice-oriented\
    \ architectures, event-driven/data-driven applications and more sus-\ntainable\
    \ solutions. Finally, another important driver could be represented by all involved\n\
    stakeholders and actors, who are raising their awareness and becoming more actively\n\
    engaged in the smart city environment, not only as service consumers but also\
    \ as the\nproducers of valuable contents and information.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: The growth of the global population coupled with a decline in natural\
    \ resources, farmland,\nand the increase in unpredictable environmental conditions\
    \ leads to food security is becoming a major\nconcern for all nations worldwide.\
    \ These problems are motivators that are driving the agricultural\nindustry to\
    \ transition to smart agriculture with the application of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and\nbig data solutions to improve operational efﬁciency and productivity.\
    \ The IoT integrates a series\nof existing state-of-the-art solutions and technologies,\
    \ such as wireless sensor networks, cognitive\nradio ad hoc networks, cloud computing,\
    \ big data, and end-user applications. This study presents\na survey of IoT solutions\
    \ and demonstrates how IoT can be integrated into the smart agriculture\nsector.\
    \ To achieve this objective, we discuss the vision of IoT-enabled smart agriculture\
    \ ecosystems\nby evaluating their architecture (IoT devices, communication technologies,\
    \ big data storage, and\nprocessing), their applications, and research timeline.\
    \ In addition, we discuss trends and opportunities\nof IoT applications for smart\
    \ agriculture and also indicate the open issues and challenges of IoT\napplication\
    \ in smart agriculture. We hope that the ﬁndings of this study will constitute\
    \ important\nguidelines in research and promotion of IoT solutions aiming to improve\
    \ the productivity and quality\nof the agriculture sector as well as facilitating\
    \ the transition towards a future sustainable environment\nwith an agroecological\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: sustainable agriculture; food security; green technologies;\

    1. Introduction\nIn order to meet the current global needs of humanity, new solutions\
    \ and technologies\nare constantly being proposed and implemented. This has led\
    \ to the advent of the Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. IoT is deﬁned as the\
    \ network of all objects that are embedded\nwithin devices, sensors, machines,\
    \ software and people through the Internet environment\nto communicate, exchange\
    \ information and interact in order to provide a comprehen-\nsive solution between\
    \ the real world and the virtual world [3]. In recent years, IoT has\nbeen applied\
    \ in a series of domains, such as smart homes [4,5], smart cities [6,7], smart\n\
    energy [8,9], autonomous vehicles [10,11], smart agriculture [12–15], campus manage-\n\
    ment [16,17], healthcare [18,19], and logistics [20,21]. Series of other IoT applications\
    \ have\nbeen described by Shaﬁque et al. [22]. An illustration of rich and diverse\
    \ IoT applications\nfor smart agriculture is provided in Figure 1.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12073396\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n2 of 19\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing\
    \ agricultural production, new solutions and \ntechnologies have been introduced\
    \ in the agriculture sector [24]. An emerging trend is the \napplication of the\
    \ IoT and big data. A significant number of studies have been focused on \nresearch,\
    \ experiments, and applications [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over\
    \ 500 \nbillion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The\
    \ use of IoT and big \ndata will enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance\
    \ efficiency and productivity \n[28]. \n \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications\
    \ for smart agriculture. \nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have\
    \ been strongly applied in the \nagricultural sector, building the foundation\
    \ for developing smart agriculture [29]. The \nunique characteristics of WSN,\
    \ such as the ability to self-organize, self-configure, self-es-\ntablish, and\
    \ self-recover, make it suitable for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device\
    \ \nconsists of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and\
    \ battery power \n[31]. The WSN focuses on applications such as environmental\
    \ monitoring, machine con-\ntrol automation, and traceability [32–35]. \nAlong\
    \ with the development of science and technology, the urgent requirement for \n\
    breakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at improving productivity and efficiency\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption of the IoT. The primary motivation\
    \ for their \napplications is the breakthrough progress of smart agriculture and\
    \ its inevitable role as \nthe future of smart and sustainable environment management.\
    \ IoT integrates a series of \nexisting solutions and technologies, such as WSN,\
    \ cognitive radio, ad hoc networks, cloud \ncomputing, and end-user applications\
    \ [36]. In the smart agricultural sector, automation \nsolutions and technologies,\
    \ mechanical machines, knowledge, decision-making tools, ser-\nvices, and software\
    \ are integrated seamlessly to help farmers improve productivity, prod-\nuct quality,\
    \ and profitability [37]. \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications for\
    \ smart agriculture.\nAccording to the United Nations’ (UN 2019) statistics, the\
    \ world population is esti-\nmated to grow to 10 billion by 2050 [23]. As a consequence,\
    \ the requirements of agricultural\nproducts are continually increasing. However,\
    \ farmlands are declining, natural resources\nare increasingly depleted, and the\
    \ rise of unpredictable nature challenges, such as global\nwarming, salinization,\
    \ and ﬂooding, make food security the most concerning problem for\nall nations\
    \ worldwide.\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing agricultural production,\
    \ new solutions and\ntechnologies have been introduced in the agriculture sector\
    \ [24]. An emerging trend is the\napplication of the IoT and big data. A signiﬁcant\
    \ number of studies have been focused on\nresearch, experiments, and applications\
    \ [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over 500\nbillion IoT devices will\
    \ be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The use of IoT and big data\nwill\
    \ enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance efﬁciency and productivity\
    \ [28].\nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been strongly applied\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural sector, building the foundation for developing smart\
    \ agriculture [29]. The unique\ncharacteristics of WSN, such as the ability to\

    \ for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device consists of a\nradio frequency\
    \ (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and battery power [31]. The WSN\n\
    focuses on applications such as environmental monitoring, machine control automation,\n\
    and traceability [32–35].\nAlong with the development of science and technology,\
    \ the urgent requirement for\nbreakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at\
    \ improving productivity and efﬁciency\nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption\

    \ survey of IoT applications for smart agriculture is\nconducted. An analysis\
    \ of 135 relevant works published between 2017 and 2022 was con-\nducted. Firstly,\

    \ and journals, and then we conducted the content analysis for the obtained\n\
    paper. Finally, 135 papers were selected for the preparation of the present work.\n\
    In addition, we analyzed and discussed the beneﬁts and challenges, open issues,\n\

    smart agriculture sector. Sensors can be divided into several typical categories,\
    \ such as\n(1) location sensor, (2) optical sensor, (3) mechanical sensor, (4)\
    \ electrochemical sensor, and\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n5 of 19\n(5) air ﬂow\
    \ sensor. These sensors are used to collect information such as air temperature,\n\
    soil temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, leaf moisture, precipitation, wind\
    \ speed, wind\ndirection, and solar radiation, and barometric pressure [21,24,36].\n\
    2.2. Communication Technology\nThe survey of communication technologies for IoT\
    \ [43,44] indicated that to integrate\nIoT into the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ communication technologies must progressively\nimprove the evolution of IoT\
    \ devices. They play an important role in the development of\nIoT systems. The\
    \ existing communication solutions can be classiﬁed as: protocol, spectrum,\n\
    and topology.\nProtocols: many wireless communication protocols have been proposed\
    \ for the smart\nagriculture sector. Based on these protocols, devices in a smart\
    \ agricultural system can\ninteract, exchange information, and make decisions\
    \ to monitor and control farming condi-\ntions and improve yields and production\
    \ efﬁciency. The typical, low-power communication\nprotocol numbers commonly used\
    \ in smart agriculture can be divided into short-range and\nlong-range categories\
    \ based on the communication range.\n-\nShort-range: NFMI (near-ﬁeld magnetic\
    \ induction) [45], Bluetooth [46], ZigBee [47],\nterahertz (Z-Wave) [48,49], and\
    \ RFID [50].\n-\nLong-range: LoRa [51], Sigfox [52], and NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)\
    \ [53].\nTable 1 presents some typical communication technologies for the smart\
    \ agriculture\nsector. The values in Table 1 indicate that short-range communication\
    \ technologies have\na transmission distance of less than 20 (m), high energy\
    \ efﬁciency, and low data rate.\nThese protocols are often employed in sensor\
    \ networks, while long-range communication\ntechnologies have transmission distances\
    \ of up to several tens of kilometres, consume more\nenergy, and are installed\
    \ for backhaul device-to-device communications. A diverse survey\nof low-power\
    \ communication technologies for IoT that presents solutions, challenges, and\n\
    some open issues is described by Sundaram et al. [54].\nTable 1. Some typical\

    Spectrum: Each radio device uses certain frequency bands for communication. The\n\
    FCC (Federal Communications Commission) has deﬁned unlicensed spectrum bands for\n\
    unlicensed operations in scientiﬁc, industrial, and medical purposes [55]. These\
    \ spectrum\nbands are often applied for low-power levels and short-range applications.\
    \ Consequently, a\nseries of common technologies for the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ from wireless machine con-\ntrol and UAVs to communication technologies such\
    \ as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, use unlicensed\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n6 of 19\n\
    spectrum bands [56]. However, the use of unlicensed spectra faces several challenges,\
    \ such\nas the quality of service guarantee, the cost of setting up the initial\
    \ infrastructure, and the\ninterference generated by the huge number of IoT devices\
    \ [57,58].\nA licensed spectrum usually is allocated to mobile networks. It provides\
    \ more efﬁcient\nnetwork trafﬁc, more reliability, enhances the quality of service\
    \ (QoS), offers security,\nprovides extensive coverage, and involves lower initialization\
    \ infrastructure costs for users.\nHowever, the use of licensed spectrum bands\
    \ has faced some limitations, such as high data\ntransmission costs and the low\
    \ energy efﬁciency of IoT devices [59].\nSeveral recent studies have demonstrated\
    \ the efﬁciency of unlicensed spectrum bands\nin the mm wave range. It uses extremely\
    \ low power but provides large transmission\ndistances and high data rates [60,61].\
    \ One limitation of the mm wave spectrum is that the\ndata rate is strongly affected\
    \ by weather conditions, especially rain [62].\nTopology: The establishment of\
    \ the communication spectrum band and operation pro-\ntocol of IoT devices depends\
    \ on the structure that deploys IoT devices for smart agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Network structures for smart agriculture usually have two main types of\nnodes:\
    \ sensor and backhaul nodes [63]. The common characteristics of IoT sensor nodes\n\
    are short communication distance, low data rate, and high energy efﬁciency. In\
    \ contrast,\nIoT backhaul nodes often require large transmission distances, high\
    \ throughput, and data\nrates. Therefore, based on the role of each IoT network\
    \ node, the sensor node or backhaul\nnode selects and installs appropriate communication\
    \ technologies [64]. Figure 5 presents a\ntypical low-power network topology designed\
    \ for measuring and monitoring factors in a\nsmart farm. The system includes:\n\
    (1)\nIoT sensor nodes collect information from the farming environment, such as\
    \ soil\nmoisture, air humidity, temperature, nutrient ingredients of soil, pest\
    \ images, and\nwater quality, then transmit collected data to IoT backhaul devices.\
    \ Depending on\nthe operation purpose and installation location, IoT sensor nodes\
    \ can be installed as\nRFDs (reduced-function devices), which only communicate\
    \ with FFDs (full-function\ndevices). These nodes cannot communicate with the\
    \ other RFDs, aiming to save\nenergy and decrease investment costs.\n(2)\nIoT\
    \ backhaul nodes, besides having the role of an IoT sensor node, also play a role\
    \ as\nintermediate nodes to receive information from other IoT nodes and transmit\
    \ it to the\ncontrol centre. IoT backhaul nodes are often installed as an FFD\
    \ device, which can\nconnect to other FDD and RFD devices.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\

    \ besides the main problems of sensing, collecting\ndata, and controlling devices\
    \ to respond to the real farming environment, data storage and\nprocessing are\
    \ also important problems and face some challenges [26,28]. In reality, the\n\
    number of collected data is huge, and traditional data storage, organization,\
    \ and processing\nsolutions are not feasible. Therefore, big data processing solutions\
    \ need to be researched\nand applied for smart agriculture [65,66].\nThe complexity\
    \ of data storage and processing is due to the unique characteristics\nof the\
    \ smart agriculture ﬁeld, including unstructured data and various formats, such\n\
    as text, images, audio and video, economic ﬁgures, and market information. Recent\n\
    solutions and technologies have introduced the use of cloud platforms for storage\
    \ and\ndata analytics, which are collected from farms [36,67]. In addition, cloud-assisted\
    \ big data\nanalytic solutions, such as edge computing [68] or fog computing [69],\
    \ are also proposed to\nreduce latency and costs and support QoS.\nThe survey\
    \ results demonstrate that, in recent years, many management information\nsystems\
    \ for smart agriculture have been proposed [70–72]. Nowadays, possible solutions\n\
    have been developed and commercialized, providing solutions and services for farmers\n\
    to manage farms and ﬁelds, aiming to increase productivity, reduce human labour,\
    \ and\nenhance farming efﬁciency, as follows:\n-\nOnFarm [73]: It is part of the\

    \ results.\n-\nFarmlogs [80]: It is a platform that provides tools and solutions\
    \ for: (1) automating\nthe production cost calculation process; (2) managing the\
    \ day-to-day activities of the\nfarm in real-time; and (3) supporting marketing\
    \ and increasing sales of products.\n3. Typical Applications of IoT in Smart Agriculture\n\
    In recent years, a series of IoT applications for agriculture have been introduced.\n\
    According to survey results, we divided these applications into categories based\
    \ on their\npurpose, including monitoring, tracking and traceability, and greenhouse\
    \ production. The\ndetailed results are presented in the following subsection.\n\
    3.1. Monitoring\nIn the agriculture sector, factors affecting the farming and\
    \ production process can be\nmonitored and collected, such as soil moisture, air\
    \ humidity, temperature, pH level, etc.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n8 of 19\n\
    These factors depend on the considered agricultural sector. Some smart agricultural\
    \ sectors\nare applying the following monitoring solutions:\nCrop Farming: In\
    \ this sector, some vital factors that affect the farming process and\nproduction\
    \ efﬁciency include air temperature, precipitation, air humidity, soil moisture,\n\
    salinity, solar radiation, pest status, soil nutrient ingredients, etc. In [81],\
    \ the authors\ndesigned an IoT device called FarmFox. This device allows real-time\
    \ collection and analysis\nof the composition of the farming soil and transmits\
    \ the information to farmers/owners\nvia the Internet. The results demonstrate\
    \ the health of the soil is monitored in real time to\nprovide timely recommendations\
    \ to farmers aiming to increase productivity and farming\nefﬁciency.\nFurthermore,\
    \ in [82], the authors proposed an IoT device to allow intelligent control\nof\
    \ temperature and humidity factors, called a weather radar. This device will automatically\n\
    turn on the warning mode using the light signal and send messages to the farmer\
    \ when the\ntemperature or humidity exceeds a pre-installed threshold. In [83],\
    \ the authors introduced\nan IoT system based on Web GIS to monitor pest status\
    \ and provide early warnings. In\naddition, this study also proposes a predictive\
    \ model based on monitoring the habitat of\npests and diseases. The efﬁciency\
    \ of the proposed system was indicated, based on the\npredicted ﬁgures of the\
    \ locust epidemic, to have a high accuracy rate (over 87%) in 2019\n(China).\n\
    Monitoring information, such as soil condition, moisture, and temperature, and\
    \ the\nprediction of natural factors, such as rainfall and weather, support the\
    \ control of growing\nconditions of crops, helping farmers plan and make irrigation\
    \ decisions to optimize pro-\nduction and reduce labour costs. In addition, the\
    \ collected data, combined with big data\nprocessing technology, can provide recommendations\
    \ for implementing preventive and\nremedial solutions against pests and diseases\
    \ in farming.\nAquaponics: It is an integration of aquaculture and hydroponics.\
    \ Aquaponics is a\nfarming technique where ﬁsh waste becomes a source of nutrients\
    \ needed by plants. One of\nthe most important issues in such farms is constantly\
    \ monitoring water quality, water level,\ntemperature, salinity, pH, sunlight,\
    \ etc. [84]. According to this research direction, in [85],\nthe authors designed\
    \ an IoT system to monitor the temperature and pH value of water for\naquaponics\
    \ farms. Moreover, this system is also equipped with a control system of water\n\
    metrics to keep the ﬁsh habitat stable and an automatic ﬁsh feeding function to\
    \ increase\nthe productivity of the ﬁsh. The results show that the IoT system\
    \ had stable operation and\nprovided real-time monitoring parameters. The authors\
    \ of [86] designed an aquaponics\nfarm for households/urban areas based on IoT.\
    \ This system recommends the proper ratio\nof ﬁsh and plants.\nConsequently, the\
    \ system decreases feed consumption as well as reduces carbon\nemissions into\
    \ the environment. The primary purpose of this proposal aims to balance the\n\
    self-sustaining ability of the aquaponics system. The experimental results demonstrate\
    \ the\nnumber of ﬁsh decreases from 30 to 15, and the number of plants increases\
    \ from 20 to 30,\nbut the crop production will increase by more than 50%. A detailed\
    \ and diverse survey of\nthe IoT systems and devices for control and monitoring\
    \ of aquaponics farms is introduced\nin [87]. Based on the obtained data, monitoring\
    \ can improve the production of ﬁsh and\nplants through the control, supplementation,\
    \ and regulation of nutritional ingredients in\nthe water. The collected data\
    \ were also used to automate the management of aquaponics\nfarms to reduce labour\
    \ costs.\nForestry: Humans depend on forests for survival. Moreover, forests play\
    \ a vital\nrole in the carbon cycle and provide a habitat for more than two-thirds\
    \ of animal species\nin the world. Forests also have the effect of protecting\
    \ watersheds, limiting ﬂoods, and\nmitigating climate change. The main factors\
    \ that need to be monitored in a forest include\nsoil ingredients, air temperature,\
    \ humidity, and concentration of several different gases,\nsuch as oxygen, methane,\
    \ ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide. A series of forest control\nsystems and solutions\
    \ are presented in [88,89] based on IoT and big data analytics.\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\
    \ 12, 3396\n9 of 19\nIn [90], the authors designed a peatland forest environmental\
    \ monitoring system.\nThis forest area plays a very vital role in the rainforest\
    \ ecosystem of Brunei. However,\nthe peatland forest type is very burnt. This\
    \ work designed an IoT system to monitor\nenvironmental conditions, such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, wind direction, barometric\npressure, and manage possible disasters.\
    \ For the purpose of enhancing feasibility, IoT\ndevices use the solar-powered\
    \ system and communicate with the monitoring centre based\non the LoRa network.\
    \ In [91], the authors proposed a solution to control forest changes\nand vitality\
    \ by using high-resolution RapidEye satellite imagery. This solution has been\n\
    deployed commercially in several states in Germany and has detected leaf diseases\
    \ in a\npine forest affected by pests. Survey results indicate that monitoring\
    \ in forestry focuses on\nproviding early warning systems against forest ﬁres,\
    \ pest control, or deforestation.\nLivestock Farming: It is deﬁned as the process\
    \ of raising domesticated animals, such as\ncows, pigs, sheep, and goats, chickens,\
    \ etc., in an agricultural environment to obtain traction,\nserve production,\
    \ and obtain products such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, etc. In this\narea,\
    \ the factors to be monitored depend on the type and number of farming animals\
    \ [92].\nIn [93], the authors designed a support system for the diagnosis, prevention,\
    \ and treatment\nof diseases for livestock called VetLink. This system can provide\
    \ recommendations for\nanimal health for farmers in rural areas where it is difﬁcult\
    \ to access veterinary doctors\nimmediately. In [94], the authors proposed a noncontact\
    \ temperature measurement system\nand monitoring of animals to ensure early detection\
    \ of diseases and animal health. This\nsystem can be used for remote monitoring\
    \ of animal health and timely anomaly detection.\nIn [95], the authors introduced\
    \ a monitoring system for large-scale pig farms based on IoT.\nThe speciﬁc solution\
    \ is to attach an IC tag on each pig to monitor the behaviour of each pig,\nsuch\
    \ as their period of feeding and resting and exercise. Data from sensors are collected\n\
    and combined with data analytics solutions that can make recommendations for pig\
    \ health.\nThe monitoring data of water, feed, and animal health for livestock\
    \ in the farming\nprocess helps farmers set up livestock plans, reduce labour\
    \ costs, and enhance production\nefﬁciency. While a series of solutions has been\
    \ provided for monitoring large-scale farms,\ntheir application in small and medium-sized\
    \ farms is very limited, especially in developing\ncountries. This can be attributed\
    \ to the high cost and the lack of knowledge needed to\nset up, manage, and operate\
    \ IoT systems. Therefore, effective and low-cost solutions for\nagricultural IoT\
    \ have much potential.\n3.2. Tracking and Tracing\nIn order to meet the needs\
    \ of consumers and increase proﬁt value, in the future, farms\nneed to demonstrate\
    \ that products offered to the market are clean products and can be\ntracked and\
    \ traced conveniently, thereby enhancing the trust of consumers in product\nsafety\
    \ and health-related issues. In order to solve this problem, a series of tracking-\
    \ and\ntracing-based problems for the smart agricultural sector has been proposed,\
    \ speciﬁcally as\nfollows:\nIn [96], the authors designed an information system\
    \ that allows tracking and tracing\nof agricultural products and foods such as\
    \ dairy and vegetables, called SISTABENE. This\nsystem helps suppliers track the\
    \ production process and errors arising in the supply chain,\nand helps end-users\
    \ trace the origin of food. In [97], the authors proposed a food supply\nchain\
    \ traceability system based on blockchain technology. It helps to track and trace\
    \ agri-\nfood supply chains’ production process and trace the origin of agricultural\
    \ products. This\nsolution has been employed at Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural\
    \ Development\nCo., Ltd. (Shanwei, China). Although there are still limitations,\
    \ the results demonstrate\nthat this solution has successfully supported the tracing\
    \ of food and agricultural prod-\nucts through QR codes, improving product quality\
    \ and ensuring the clear traceability of\nproducts. In [98,99], the authors proposed\
    \ smart agricultural solutions to tracking and\ntracing agricultural products,\
    \ thereby allowing consumers to know the product’s entire\nhistory. These solutions\
    \ enable tracking and tracing some of the data collected along the\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n10 of 19\nsupply chain, ensuring that consumers and other stakeholders\
    \ can identify products’ origin,\nlocation, and history.\n3.3. Smart Precision\
    \ Farming\nThe advent of the GPS (global positioning system) has created breakthrough\
    \ advances\nin many ﬁelds of science and technology. The GPS provides the most\
    \ important parameters\nfor locating a device, such as location and time. GPS\
    \ systems have been successfully\ndeployed in many ﬁelds, such as smartphones,\
    \ vehicles, and IoT ecosystems. However,\nGPS is only good support for outdoor\
    \ systems and the sky. Meanwhile, the demand\nfor the locating and navigating\
    \ systems in the home and on the streets of smart cities is\ngrowing rapidly.\
    \ Aiming to solve this problem, an advanced global navigation satellite\nsystem\
    \ (GNSS) is being deployed [100]. Based on GPS and GNSS systems, suitable farming\n\
    maps have been established for ﬁelds and farms. As a result, agricultural machinery\
    \ and\nequipment can be operated autonomously [101]. Figure 6 presents an illustration\
    \ of the\ntypical cloud-assisted, IoT-based precision agriculture platform.\n\

    \ machines to operate autonomously and remotely via the Internet \n[107]. \n \n\
    Figure 6. Cloud-assisted IoT-based precision agriculture platform. \n3.4. Greenhouse\
    \ Production \nA greenhouse consists of walls and a roof, which are usually made\
    \ from transparent \nmaterials, such as plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants\
    \ are grown in a controlled envi-\nronment, including controlling for moisture,\
    \ nutrient ingredients of the soil, light, tem-\nperature, etc. Consequently,\
    \ greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans to grow \nany plant, at any\
    \ time, by providing suitable environmental conditions [108]. Figure 7 \nillustrates\
    \ a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse farming factors \n\
    based on IoT ecosystems. \nIn [109], the authors introduced an IoT-based greenhouse\
    \ environmental monitoring \nsystem for multipoint monitoring in large greenhouses.\
    \ Instead of using multiple sensors \nat different locations, this solution involves\
    \ a drive system that allows the sensor system \ndiff\nl\ni\ni\nh\nh\nTh\ni\n\

    In smart precision farming, one of the most important applications is the use\
    \ of drones\nin monitoring and farming activities. Some common farming tasks using\
    \ UAVs include\nspraying pesticides, fertilizing, sowing seeds, evaluating and\
    \ mapping, and monitoring\ncrop growth. In [102], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ survey of drone applications for\nsmart agriculture, including applications,\
    \ control technology, and future trends of the UAV\napplication for smart agriculture.\
    \ In [103], the authors designed an automatic agricultural\nproduct classiﬁcation\
    \ system based on camera systems, image processing algorithms, and\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n11 of 19\nmechanical actuators. The experimental results for\
    \ agriculture products such as oranges\nand tomatoes present a classiﬁcation success\
    \ rate of over 95%, and the sorting time for each\nproduct is less than 1(s).\
    \ This solution can be adapted and applied to the classiﬁcation of\ndifferent\
    \ agricultural products. In [104], the authors proposed a solution to estimate\
    \ grape\nproduction. The proposed solution combines an RGB-D camera mounted on\
    \ a mobile robot\nplatform and size estimation algorithm for a bunch of grapes.\
    \ The experimental results\npresent an average error in the range of [2.8–3.5]\
    \ (cm). The results demonstrate this solution\nis a feasible method for evaluating\
    \ the productivity of large-scale grape farms.\nThe survey results show that smart\
    \ precision agricultural equipment, such as irriga-\ntion systems, unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAV), and smart agricultural equipment, etc.,\nare conﬁgurable in\
    \ an autonomous-control mode based on certain conditions or can be\ncontrolled\
    \ remotely by the farmer via the Internet [105,106]. Smart precision farming helps\n\
    to improve productivity and production efﬁciency and is suitable for large-scale\
    \ farms.\nNowadays, suppliers of precision agricultural equipment have IoT modules\
    \ built into their\nmachines, allowing machines to operate autonomously and remotely\
    \ via the Internet [107].\n3.4. Greenhouse Production\nA greenhouse consists of\
    \ walls and a roof, which are usually made from transparent\nmaterials, such as\
    \ plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants are grown in a controlled\nenvironment,\
    \ including controlling for moisture, nutrient ingredients of the soil, light,\n\
    temperature, etc. Consequently, greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans\
    \ to\ngrow any plant, at any time, by providing suitable environmental conditions\
    \ [108]. Figure 7\nillustrates a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse\

    \ farms and the cus-\ntomer [112–115]. \n \nFigure 7. An illustration of IoT application\

    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some \nchallenges. We have\
    \ present two main problems: economic efficiency and technical prob-\nlems. We\
    \ consider these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration\
    \ of IoT \ntechnologies in agriculture. \nFigure 7. An illustration of IoT application\
    \ for monitoring farming conditions in a greenhouse.\nIn [109], the authors introduced\
    \ an IoT-based greenhouse environmental monitoring\nsystem for multipoint monitoring\
    \ in large greenhouses. Instead of using multiple sensors\nat different locations,\
    \ this solution involves a drive system that allows the sensor system\nto move\
    \ to different locations in the greenhouse. The experimental results show that\
    \ the\nproposed system can effectively monitor multiple points in large greenhouses.\
    \ In [110], the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n12 of 19\nauthors introduced an energy-saving\
    \ temperature control technology for smart greenhouses.\nThis study proposed two\
    \ intelligent control methods: active disturbance rejection control\nand fuzzy\
    \ active disturbance rejection control. The experimental results demonstrate\n\
    that the proposed technology saves over 15% of the total energy consumption of\
    \ the\ngreenhouse. In [111], the authors designed an intelligent IoT system to\
    \ monitor and\ncontrol greenhouse temperature for energy efﬁciency and improve\
    \ crop productivity. The\nexperimental results for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\
    \ where daytime temperatures can be\nabove 50 ◦C, demonstrate the efﬁciency of\
    \ the proposed solution, including saving energy\nand predicting the rate of plant\
    \ growth.\nRecent studies indicated that solutions integrating IoT, big data processing,\
    \ and artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence could be applied in greenhouses to reduce labour\
    \ and energy efﬁciency.\nMoreover, it also provides direct connections between\
    \ the greenhouse farms and the cus-\ntomer [112–115].\n4. Challenges and Open\
    \ Research Directions\nThe survey results indicate that IoT components for the\
    \ smart agriculture sector,\nincluding hardware and software, have been focused\
    \ on research and achieved many\nbreakthrough results. Several IoT solutions have\
    \ been deployed on large-scale farms/ﬁelds.\nHowever, the widespread deployment\
    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some\nchallenges. We have present\
    \ two main problems: economic efﬁciency and technical prob-\nlems. We consider\
    \ these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration of IoT\n\
    technologies in agriculture.\n4.1. Economic Efﬁciency\nIn agricultural economics,\
    \ one of the most important characteristics is a low rate of\nproﬁt of an investment\
    \ project, which presents many risks from natural conditions. The\nbeneﬁt–cost\
    \ of a new technology seeking deployment in agriculture should be carefully\n\
    calculated to ensure a trade-off between the cost of technology implementation\
    \ and the\nproﬁt potential. Therefore, we discuss the economic aspects related\
    \ to IoT implementation\nin smart agriculture.\nThere are several types of costs\
    \ related to the implementation of IoT in agriculture.\nWe divided them into categories,\
    \ including (1) the system initialization cost and (2) the\nsystem operating cost.\
    \ The system initialization cost includes hardware purchases (IoT\ndevices, gateways,\
    \ base station infrastructure). The system operating cost includes service\nregistration\
    \ cost and the cost of labour to manage IoT devices. Furthermore, additional op-\n\
    erating costs include incurred costs from energy consumption, maintenance, data\
    \ exchange\namong IoT devices, gateways and cloud servers. According to the opinion\
    \ of Turgut and\nBoloni [116], the successful deployment of the IoT technologies\
    \ will only happen if the\ncustomer beneﬁts (customers need to know the beneﬁts\
    \ and potential) that IoT systems\nprovide exceed their physical value and privacy\
    \ costs. The businesses participating in the\nIoT domain will proﬁt and achieve\
    \ success. We can describe this process using these two\nconditions, as follows:\n\
    Success o f IoT Applications=\n\x1A Vservice > Cpri + Cuser\nh\n+ Cpay, Farmer\
    \ Bene f its\n(1)\nVin f o + Rpay > Cbusiness\nh\n, Businesses Bene f its\n(2)\n\
    where\nVservice is the expected value received by the IoT service users.\nCpri\
    \ is the cost of the loss of privacy.\nCuser\nh\nis the equipment and hardware\
    \ costs the user pays.\nCpay is the payment for the service fee.\nVin f o is the\
    \ received information value.\nRpay is the received direct payment.\nCbusiness\n\
    h\nis the share of the hardware and maintenance costs of the business.\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n13 of 19\nAccording to the opinion of the service user\
    \ (farmers or the owner of the farm),\nEquation (1) shows that the perceived value\
    \ of the service for the user (Vservice) must be\nhigher than the total of costs,\
    \ including: the cost of the loss of privacy (Cpri), the equipment\nand hardware\
    \ costs the user pays (Cuser\nh\n), and the payments for the service fee (Cpay),\
    \ while\nthe opinion of the service provider, as shown in Equation (2), shows\
    \ that the received\ninformation value (Vin f o) and the received direct payments\
    \ (Rpay) must be higher than the\nshare of the hardware and maintenance costs\
    \ of the business (Cbusiness\nh\n).\nThere is still a gap between service providers\
    \ and service users (farmers or the owner\nof the farm), leading to the slow deployment\
    \ of IoT applications in smart agriculture. In\nterms of the economic aspect,\
    \ the analyzed results show that the need for a support policy\nfrom regulatory\
    \ agencies and governments to allow service providers and service users\nto use\
    \ IoT-based smart agriculture applications in their infancy can be met. As discussed\n\
    in [117], to promote smart agriculture, the European Union has issued supportive\
    \ economic\npolicies, the so-called the European CAP (Common Agricultural Policy),\
    \ whose annual\nbudget amounts to approximately EUR 59 billion and is paid for\
    \ by the nations of the EU.\nIn our view, to be able to apply IoT in the ﬁeld\
    \ of smart agriculture, service costs\n(Cpay) and the operating and system initialization\
    \ cost of IoT (Cuser\nh\n) needs to constantly be\nimproved and optimized to reduce\
    \ the cost of the IoT services for farmers. In addition, IoT\nbusinesses (service\
    \ providers) also need to maximize the value of information obtained\n(Vin f o)\
    \ to improve the proﬁtability of the service providers.\nIn reality, service providers\
    \ may commercially exploit the information received (Vin f o)\nin the period of\
    \ providing services for farms, aiming to encourage the deployment of\nIoT applications\
    \ in smart agriculture. Nowadays, several IoT platform providers allow\nfree registration\
    \ and use of services with some limitation conditions regarding services’\nfunctionality\
    \ and ability processing; the number of connected IoT devices; and the number\n\
    of data stored while premium functions and services charge users a fee.\nIn addition,\
    \ one of the signiﬁcant factors slowing down IoT adoption in agriculture\nis farmers’\
    \ knowledge and ability to use IoT devices. In developed countries, this issue\n\
    can be easily solved due to the accessibility of new technologies of farmers.\
    \ Otherwise, in\ndeveloping countries, where the majority of farmers in rural\
    \ areas have very limited access\nto advanced technologies, this issue is a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge [118,119].\n4.2. Technical Problems\nInterference: Deploying a huge\
    \ number of IoT devices for smart agriculture can\ncause interference to different\
    \ network systems, especially some IoT networks using short\nspectrum bands such\
    \ as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, and LoRa (See Table 1). Interference can\ndegrade\
    \ system performance as well as reduce the reliability of IoT ecosystems. IoT\n\
    networks that use cognitive technology to reuse unlicensed spectra increase the\
    \ cost of the\ndevice. In our opinion, the advent of the 6G network [120] will\
    \ allow a huge number of\ndevices to connect to the Internet with an extremely\
    \ high access speed and extremely large\nbandwidth. The full interference problem\
    \ of IoT networks will be solved.\nSecurity and Privacy: One of the most important\
    \ problems of applying IoT in smart\nagriculture is the security problem, including\
    \ the protection of data and systems from\nattacks on the Internet. In regard\
    \ to system security, IoT devices’ limited capacity and\nability led to complex\
    \ encryption algorithms that are impossible to implement on IoT\ndevices. As a\
    \ result, IoT systems can be attacked using the Internet to gain system control\n\
    rights; IoT gateways are also attacked via denial of service [121–123]. In addition,\
    \ cloud\nservers can be attacked by data spooﬁng to perform unauthorized tasks\
    \ that affect the\nautonomous farming processes of farms. Cloud infrastructures\
    \ can also be controlled by\nattackers [124,125]. Several issues of detailed IoT\
    \ data privacy and security measures have\nbeen discussed in [126–128]. According\
    \ to Neshenko et al., the IoT data security issue is one\nof the biggest problems\
    \ slowing down IoT adoption in smart agriculture [129].\nRegarding data security,\
    \ the obtained information from IoT systems in farms is col-\nlected, processed,\
    \ and commercially exploited by service providers to varying degrees.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n14 of 19\nTherefore, one of the most important problems of policies\
    \ regards the validity and legal\nstatus of farm data [130]. In reality, these\
    \ data are of great value when aggregated and\nanalyzed for large-scale agricultural\
    \ activities. Consequently, without policies, the data\nprivacy and security of\
    \ farms can affect the competitive advantage of farmers/farm owners.\nIn our opinion,\
    \ using cryptography coupled with access keys is a possible solution to\nsolve\
    \ this problem. Keys could be made available based on a regional user group and\n\
    to those who contributed to the database. For further complex cases, secure multiparty\n\
    computation can be used, where the homomorphic encryption method [131,132], or\
    \ this\nmethod combined with the blockchain [133], can be applied for the purpose\
    \ of balancing\nprivacy and data utility.\nIn our opinion, the security problems\
    \ of IoT systems will be an exciting research topic\nand garner attention for\
    \ both academia and industry research. An in-depth survey of\nthreats and solutions\
    \ to improve robustness, trust, and privacy for future IoT systems is\npresented\
    \ in [134].\nReliability: Most IoT devices are expected to be deployed outdoors\
    \ (in ﬁelds and\nfarms). Harsh work environments lead to the rapid degradation\
    \ of IoT devices’ quality and\ncan lead to unexpected manufacturer failures. The\
    \ mechanical safety of IoT devices and\nsystems must be ensured so they can withstand\
    \ extremes of weather, such as temperature,\nhumidity, rainstorms, and ﬂoods [135].\
    \ In our opinion, new materials and technologies\nneed to continue to be studied\
    \ to improve the durability of devices.\nThe open problems and challenges discussed\
    \ in this section indicate that for IoT\nto be widely deployed in the smart agriculture\
    \ sector, there are still many issues to be\nsolved. Service providers need to\
    \ reduce the service costs, more effectively exploiting\nthe information collected\
    \ from the farm. On the other hand, farmers need to improve\ntheir skills to be\
    \ able to apply IoT solutions on their farm to enhance productivity and\nfarming\
    \ efﬁciency. Researchers need to continually study and propose optimal solutions\n\
    and technologies to ensure IoT systems’ privacy and security and improve the durability\
    \ of\nIoT devices. These are really major challenges and exciting research topics\
    \ in the future so\nIoT can be widely applied in the smart agriculture sector.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we presented an overview of IoT and big data for\
    \ the smart agriculture\nsector. Several issues related to promoting IoT deployment\
    \ in the agriculture sector have\nbeen discussed in detail. Survey results indicate\
    \ that many studies have been performed\nto apply IoT for smart agriculture, aiming\
    \ to enhance productivity, reduce human labour,\nand improve production efﬁciency.\
    \ The beneﬁts of applying IoT and big data in agriculture\nwere discussed. In\
    \ addition, we also pointed out the challenges we need to overcome\nto be able\
    \ to accelerate the deployment of IoT in smart agriculture. However, there are\n\
    still some challenges that need to be addressed for IoT solutions to be affordable\
    \ for the\nmajority of farmers, including small- and medium-scale farm owners.\
    \ In addition, security\ntechnologies need to be continuously improved, but in\
    \ our opinion, the application of\nIoT solutions for smart agriculture is inevitable\
    \ and will enhance productivity, provide\nclean and green foods, support food\
    \ traceability, reduce human labour, and improve\nproduction efﬁciency. On the\
    \ other hand, this survey also points out some interesting\nresearch directions\
    \ for security and communication technologies for IoT. We think that\nthese will\
    \ be very exciting research directions in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Cited By Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT Born from a need for a
    pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm
    emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications.
    Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding
    its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources
    closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess
    its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of
    Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular
    benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage,
    for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge
    Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms,
    and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this
    paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our
    in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge
    Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering
    Edge computing. References Paarijaat Aditya, Istemi Ekin Akkus, Andre Beck, Ruichuan

    content Highlights • Development of edge computing framework to process IoT data.
    • Elaboration of the process of IoT data at different levels. • Introduced situation
    image (s-image) and explained situation identification. • Edge computing provides
    competitive advantage in terms of latency. Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT)
    offers a lot of benefits for building smart cities. Such cities will be able to
    utilize a huge number of heterogeneous IoT devices that can generate a sheer volume
    of data. So, considering this heterogeneity, one of the major challenges in smart
    cities is how to process this data and identify different situations for decision-makers
    on the basis of this data. The traditional cloud computing approach can provide
    enormous computing and storage facilities to support data processing. However,
    it requires all the data to be moved to the cloud from the edge devices of the
    user endpoint, thus introducing a high latency. In this paper, we used the edge
    computing approach to minimize such latency. Besides, as major portion of data
    is generated from the user endpoint, processing this data in the edge can significantly
    improve the performance. Our experiment shows that processing raw IoT data at
    the edge devices is effective in terms of latency and provides situational awareness
    for the decision makers of smart city in a seamless fashion. Previous article

    awarenessEdge computing 1. Introduction Today, most people use the Internet [22]
    for communication and content sharing, which has also become a global platform
    for communication between connected objects and smart devices, introducing a concept
    called the “Internet of Things (IoT)”. IoT is expanding at a unprecedented rate
    and according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), an estimated 50 billion
    connected objects will be in use by 2020 (Fig. 1). This brings about the challenge
    of how to efficiently process the huge volume of IoT data and use it for human
    benefit. Nowadays, IoT has become a part of smart city [41], [36], [6]. IoT-based
    smart cities has the potential to bring a number of benefits in the management
    and optimization of traditional public services, such as transport and parking,
    surveillance and maintenance of public areas, preservation of cultural heritage,
    garbage collection, and salubrity of hospitals and schools. Data from the IoT-embedded
    city infrastructure can be collected and processed to understand the situation
    of the city and offer new services in future [18] in addition to taking necessary
    actions. A situation [19] is a condition at a moment in a particular location.
    In other words, a situation is a set of things that happen and the conditions
    that exist at a particular time and place. In the IoT, a situation is an abstraction
    for a pattern of observations made by a distributed system, such as a sensor network.
    With the expansion of cities, lots of events will likely occur and any inefficient
    approach to process and handle those situations will hamper timely decision-making.
    In order to address this challenge in the smart city context, different projects
    that couple the IoT with cloud technology to reap the benefits of cloud storage,
    processing, and infrastructure are already underway [42], [1], [5], [24]. In cloud-based
    processing, all the sensor data are processed through a remote cloud server, but
    it is costly in terms of processing and storage to send all data to the cloud.
    In this aspect, the emerging edge computing [3] can help save a lot of bandwidth
    and may increase the processing speed. Edge computing, also called fog computing,
    is a method of optimizing cloud computing systems by performing data processing
    at the edge of the network. Download : Download high-res image (205KB) Download

    Fig. 2. Edge computing paradigm. Using edge computing services, the data that
    needs to be moved to the remote server significantly decreases. This method mainly
    has three benefits: it can work with large data sizes, it guarantees a low latency,
    and it focuses on location awareness. Fig. 2 illustrates a typical edge computing
    approach where the edge is the closest processing unit of the data sources (the
    sensors), it processes the data and sends the filtered data to the cloud server.
    Here, the main functionality of edges is data offloading, storage, processing,
    and privacy protection. This paper contributes by providing an edge computing
    framework to process situations in a IoT smart city that would help the decision
    makers to be situation aware and provide relevant services to city residents.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we comment on some
    research works on edge computing, situations, and IoT smart cities that are related
    to our approach. Section 3 depicts the proposed situation detection mechanism.
    In Section 4, we show the architecture of our proposed framework. Section 5 presents
    the implementation issues, development challenges and the outcome that we found
    from our examination. At the end, we provide the conclusion and discuss future
    work directions of the paper in Section 6. 2. Related works Situation awareness
    (SA) has previously been studied in different domains, as composite events in
    distributed event based systems, service composition in multi-agent systems, and
    macro-programming in sensor networks. The term was first used by Endsley [19]
    in the military field. Although many extensions were developed by Endsley from
    his original SA idea, the combination of SA with sensor networks was missing.
    Recently, researchers took this into consideration and published several work.
    Among them, one of the promising works was developed by Oliver et al. [11]. They
    reviewed three different algorithms for recognizing situations, and finally they
    introduced a distributed commitment machine algorithm for situation understanding.
    Like all event-driven systems, the speed of situation understanding depends on
    the data volume: when the data volume grows, the speed decreases significantly.
    Although existing works try to minimize the problem using the Service Oriented
    Architecture paradigm [16] and fog computing [35], among others, no complete framework
    for SA in the IoT and cloud be highlighted properly. Among different works that
    leverage the combination of clouds and the IoT to provide real-time SA, the authors
    of [8] paid attention to merging cloud computing technologies in order to offer
    new location-aware services and reduce the latency. Based on this idea, several
    academic prototypes [20], [26] as well as commercial services (ThingWorx [40]
    and SmartThings [38]) have recently emerged. At the urban scale, SmartSantander1
    introduced a city-wide experimental research where around 20,000 sensors have
    been deployed in three different locations. These sensors monitor different situations
    like parks and gardens irrigation, parking management, traffic monitoring, weather
    conditions monitoring, and others. By persuasion from SmartSantander, S. Chakrabarty
    et al. [14] depicted protected IoT engineering for keen urban communities. They
    introduced a design containing four essential IoT engineering obstacles that empower
    a protected smart city to mitigate digital assaults starting at the IoT hubs themselves.
    The authors concurred that the IoT is in its underlying stage and parcel of research
    are necessary. For SA, millions of sensors need to send a stream of data (a collection
    of unbounded data objects that may have multiple data attributes in a particular
    order) to the cloud server for storage or processing. But this is a very inefficient
    process. Instead of this approach, the data may be processed in the edge of the
    network. Inspired by this efficient approach, researchers recently proposed several
    methods of data processing in the IoT. Among them, in [15], an infrastructure
    for the IoT using fog computing, called Indie fog, was proposed. In that paper,
    the authors highlighted two types of Indie fog deployment: (1) integrated form
    and (2) collaborative form. In the integrated form, all the functionalities are
    provided by a gateway device that is integrated into the Indie fog server. On
    the other hand, in the collaborative form, all the functionalities are provided
    by a workstation as a data source. Another work is [33], where the authors used
    an existing mobile phone network as an edge node to process the data. They used
    mobile phones as they can be used as an important data source in an IoT environment.
    Other researchers [27], [21] also focused their attention on optimizing the IoT
    data processing using mobile phones. In these works, mobile data are sent to the
    fog servers, and then the fog servers send the filtered or processed data to the
    cloud servers. Data pre-processing is an important task in IoT environments, as
    data come from noisy environments that require pre-processing before analysis.
    Real-time pre-processing is necessary in many cases like stream data processing,
    and its main target is to produce high-quality data. This is a mandatory step
    that many well-known techniques like normalization, transformation, integration,
    and cleaning use. As the number of sensor data streams is large, in stream data
    pre-processing, we need an efficient solution. There are many existing pre-processing
    methods for data streams. Those techniques can be grouped into three main categories:
    instance reduction, dimensionality reduction, and feature space simplification.
    There are many kinds of instance reduction pre-processing mechanisms available.
    Of those techniques, the following three are the most popular: 1. Instance-Based
    learning Algorithm (IB) [2]: this method is good for static-type data. It works
    on the basis of a confidence interval test, and it distinguishes whether a case
    is added in the database or needs to wait until its appropriate insertion. 2.
    The Locally Weighted Forgetting (LWF) [34]: this method works on the basis of
    the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and it filters the data by discarding data whose
    weights are below the threshold. 3. Salganicoff [28]: this method can work in
    both static and dynamic environments. This method is similar to the IB method,
    but the difference is that in IB all the data are considered, but in Salganicoff
    only the newest data from the stream are considered. The main problem of this
    method is that, in order to detect new data, it stores old data in a queue, which
    requires a lot of memory. There are also different well-known techniques in dimensionality
    reduction pre-processing. Some of those techniques are as follows: 1. Katakis
    et al. [23]: in this method, a feature filter method is proposed to detect relevant
    features. This method is suitable for online data ranking (filtering). 2. Carvalho
    et al. [12]: in this method, the weight is computed by an online classifier to
    identify the feature and the feature is scored on the basis of the difference
    between the positive and the negative weights of each feature. 3. Masud et al.
    [29]: in this method, a deviation weight measure is used to distinguish the features.
    It uses an unsupervised technique like the highest frequency in the data. The
    last type of stream pre-processing is feature space simplification. In this method,
    the main target is to normalize the feature space. This algorithm returns nominal
    features that can be used for any data processing purposes. After pre-processing,
    the IoT devices that are in the environment must be discoverable so that they
    can be queried for data. An efficient look-up mechanism is necessary, but real-world
    objects are difficult to look up. So, instead of the physical look-up, it is better
    to use a virtual table where device insertion and removal can be managed dynamically.
    One of the promising works in this direction is Snoogle [43]. Our preference for
    Snoogle over more recent works like Context-Aware Dynamic Discovery of Things
    (CADDOT) [31] or agent-based discovery [13] stems from the fact that Snoogle is
    more lightweight, in addition to its security and privacy protection features
    for sensitive data. In addition, Snoogle allows the indexing of arbitrary kinds
    of terms, not just numeric ones. Snoogle assigns keywords to sensors as well as
    links with the associated descriptions of the sensors. Then, it stores the keyword
    with the description in storage with appropriate indexing. Each Index Point (IP)
    is linked with all the sensors that are connected to it as every sensor in the
    same area will be assigned the same IP. This way, a two-tier hierarchy is used
    to maintain two types of IPs. In the top tier, it keeps the key IP, and in the
    bottom tier, it maintains all the IPs that are associated with the key IP. Here,
    the user may perform two types of queries: (1) a local query, which is performed
    in a specific IP, and (2) a global query or distributed query, where the user
    search is placed in the key IP. For this search every IP needs to be flooded to
    find the specific sensor object (see Fig. 3). From the above study, we found that
    IoT-based SA has become the cornerstone of smart city development with a push
    for connected objects, connected devices, and connected everything. So, with the
    aim of overcoming the disadvantages of the systems mentioned above and inspired
    by [27], [44], [37], we introduced Edge computing framework for SA in IoT-based
    smart cities. Download : Download high-res image (251KB) Download : Download full-size

    Proposed framework for situation detection The primary purpose of the proposed
    framework is to detect the current situation that represent the state of transportation,
    healthcare, security and other aspects in a smart city. Efficient situation understanding
    allows the city officials to provide services to the citizens and perform actions
    accordingly. The process of situation detection and awareness lies in the understanding
    of how the raw IoT data is propagated from the distributed deployment sources
    to the application level for the decision makers. We propose a layered approach
    to demonstrate this data propagation, as shown in Fig. 4. The figure shows that
    the data propagation is accomplished in four steps, which are described in the
    following: Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Proposed situation detection steps from sensor data. 3.1. Raw data
    stream capture/processing The first step of situation detection is to capture
    and process the raw IoT data. However, if the raw data are sent directly to the
    remote cloud server for processing, the battery life will be reduced drastically.
    For this reason different on-line and off-line mechanism like data compression,
    aggregation and query modeling is applied to reduce the energy consumption cost.
    In our proposed approach, IoT data is annotated with its location and frequency
    of creation. We used ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) model
    [9], which we will explain in later section, sufficiently matches our case where
    we have a large set of data that we want to split and process into separate processing
    units, i.e. in the edge servers. Fig. 5 demonstrates how the sensors are connected
    to the edge server. According to this figure, let us consider we have total number
    of sensors that have the common objective as represented in the function . In
    our proposed technique each sensor has an identity with the format [ ]. We use
    this kind of format for two reasons: one is for effective lookup from large collection
    of sensor and another is for mobility. Also this type of naming is human friendly.
    In smart city many of the sensors are mobile so traditional static IP or GUID
    (global identifier) will not work as we may need to update the sensor dynamically.
    To illustrate, we provide an example as: say a mobile sensor like a cell phone
    GPS (phone having id and GPS having id ) is tracking and currently it is in a
    building called then our system will generate a dynamic id for the mobile device
    as . It should be noted here that for every communication, we need IP or other
    protocol so this dynamic name will be mapped with IP address/MAC address/URI.
    As many of the sensors in a smart city are mobile, all the connection between
    the sensors and edge will be logical connection. All the streams that are produced
    by IoT devices are splitted into data objects which are called edge objects (see
    Fig. 5). These edge objects are sent to the edge servers for further processing.
    The structure of this edge object and the data distribution process are described
    in the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (220KB) Download

    the edge servers. 3.1.1. Edge object structure In order to make the edge objects
    each node samples the sensor stream data with a fixed window size. Each edge object
    is constituted with ID, data and properties. ID is an identifier (that we described
    earlier), data contain the IoT data and properties contain functional or control
    information that are necessary to perform the operation in the edge. Each edge
    server extracts the data from the edge object and performs operation based on
    the control message that is in the properties segment in the edge object. Fig.
    6 represents the XML structure of all the properties like , etc. of edge object.

    Fig. 6. Edge object properties as a xml format. 3.1.2. Data distribution As there
    are lot of devices, distributed processing is required for data analysis. Processing
    multiple data streams in a centralized cloud server is inefficient. Instead of
    this if the data is processed through the edge server the overall performance
    will be improved significantly. And this way a decentralized and parallel processing
    of IoT data can be achieved. But the question is how to send the data to decentralized
    processing units without significant loss of performance? We found that ADMM [9]
    provides a technique that is used to solve classical convex optimization problem.
    In this approach it breaks a problem into some smaller problems so that each smaller
    task can be handled in an easier way. We can represent our distributed processing
    of data through ADMM. We have N number of IoT devices that have a common objective
    function and our target is to minimize (Eq. (1)) the data or filter through the
    edge server so that only the refined data can be sent to the cloud server for
    further storage or situation visualization. (1) where is a global variable that
    is unknown and refers to the term with respect to the th sensor. Now let be a
    local variable and be a common global variable then the above equation can be
    rewritten as: (2) where which is originally called the global consensus problem
    [10], since the constraint is that all the local variables should agree, i.e.,
    should be equal. The augmented Lagrangian of problem Eq. (2) can be further written
    as: (3) The resulting ADMM algorithm from Eq. (3) is: (4) ≔ (5) ≔ where represents
    closest neighbor set of the th devices. (6) ≔ The first step (Eq. (4)) and last
    step (Eq. (6)) are preformed individually in each edge, and the second step (Eq.
    (5)) is completed in the cloud server. 3.2. Unified representation The second
    step of data propagation is to convert the processed IoT data to a uniform representation
    before storing them in the off-line storage. This is important as the result of
    processed IoT data of many sensors needs to overlap and needs to give a combined
    output. For example, consider the processing of weather condition for a given
    area. Here we need to merge the result from many sensors that are producing data
    in different pattern, format etc. So before sending the data to the cloud server
    we can pass the data to a model to extract a unified representation. In our proposed
    model the edge server output data is converted to a unified format such as ‘what–when–where’
    structure. For the unified representation we used the concept  [7], which is actually
    a series of questions that extract appropriate result from a problem. This approach
    is popular in software process and project management. Table 1 demonstrates the
    list of questionnaire and the data type it will produce in each of the case of
    principle. Table 1. Principle used to uniform the sensor data. Principle Data
    type Example data data is generated Sensor specific data Temperature, wind_direction,
    wind_speed data is taken Date time 10/10/2016 10 am, yesterday 1 pm the data is
    coming Sensor location Indoor, Outdoor, Home, Office, Bed Room1 is generating
    the data Sensor id 1, 2, tempS1, humidityS1 (in what condition) Sensor state/activity
    Motion, Hot weather long data is generating How long Ten minutes, one hour much
    resources is needed Meta data Data length, data type 3.3. Aggregation All the
    unified represented data are stored in the cloud server and are fed to a visual
    display or control center to trigger any event. The unifiedly represented data
    is aggregated to produce the situation. In the aggregation step the unified data
    is converted to a 2-dimensional spatial representation for easy visualization
    and mapping at the situation level. It combines data and represents in an image
    like representation, which we call Situation Image (S-image). Each S-image has
    mainly 2 parts: S-image element and S-image set. Each S-image element is a collection
    of key–value pair where key is the state or factor name (i.e. temperature, humidity,
    sound etc.) and the value is the cumulative value for the key that is calculated
    from the edge server. It should be noted here that in a real world environment
    besides the and the system needs to store more information like location ( , ),
    meta data ( , ) etc. In the real scenario continuous Situation Image will be generated
    over a period. The continuously generated finite set of situation images is called
    situation image set or S-image set. Fig. 7 demonstrates the structure of a S-image
    set. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. S-image set. 3.4. Situation representation We know that situation
    is a set of information of an environment over a period of time. So our S-image
    set that we described in earlier section can actually be used to produce the situation.
    This process is actually a classification task where each cell of the situation
    image represents a particular event. We can model the situation modeling through
    the classical situation calculus [25]. According to situation calculus a situation
    is a series of actions which is started with a special situation called initial
    situation . In our case is the situation that is generated from the first S-image
    over a period of time. According to situation calculus a new situation will be
    created from the initial situation when an action is triggered. In our S-image
    set continuous S-image is created. This does not mean that all the S-image will
    be used for situation generation. The next situation will be generated if any
    action is triggered or if the value of some S-image element crosses certain threshold,
    . Sometimes actions may have some preconditions. For example if we say open the
    camera if the location is free. This task can be written as , here is a special
    function that is used for the execution of an action. The process of data capture
    to situation representation is illustrated in the following Algorithm 1. Download

    a simplified view of all the 4 steps that we just described. Consider a sound
    sensor (microphone) data is being partitioned into edge object and is being sent
    to the edge network, the edge server processes the data based on the properties
    and finally applies and sends the result to the cloud server. The cloud server
    aggregates the data that it receives from edges and finally the S-image is created
    by proper placement of the situation elements. The situation image is stored in
    the cloud storage to calculate the situation. Download : Download high-res image

    architecture. 4. System architecture In this section we present different components
    of our proposed architecture and their functional descriptions. The components
    of the system are depicted in Fig. 9 as a block diagram. The architecture has
    four main components: Device Module, Edge network, IoT Cloud Middleware and Subscribers.
    The device module includes sensors and other objects that may sense the environment.
    In reality things that can produce time dependent data series may be considered
    as a sensor. Edge network is the network of servers that will work as a processing
    unit for the sensors. IoT Cloud Middleware is responsible to publish the message
    and subscribe the clients to receive the messages. This module is also responsible
    for message routing. Finally the subscribers receive the services from the system.
    In our case the display devices where the situation for the city will be presented
    are considered as the subscribers. Generally any object that wants to receive
    data from the platform may be considered as a subscriber. It is also possible
    for an object to be both a publisher and subscriber. We provide the functional
    description of each of the four components in the following sections: Download
    : Download high-res image (66KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.
    MQTT topic. 4.1. Device module This module is responsible for all the physical
    or logical linkage between the IoT device and the edge network. Usually by using
    different standard communication technology like NFC (Near Field Communication),
    GSM, WLAN, GPS and sensor networks together with SIM-card technology etc. are
    used to connect the device module to the physical sensors. For every connection
    mechanism it is important to save the bandwidth. The data from the sensors to
    the edge network may be transferred either asynchronously or synchronously. The
    main functionality of the device module is to send data but these modules also
    sense control message that are generated by the IoT middleware (i.e it act as
    a publisher). The control message is important in many cases to control the sensors.
    For example zoom, pan, tilt and resolution functionality control of a camera sensor,
    precision, accuracy, sensitivity, range, calibration control of temperature, humidity,
    accelerometer, IR, distance sensors. 4.2. Edge network In the traditional IoT
    the sensor data is sent to the cloud server for processing. But in this centralized
    approach has lot of scalability problem. A better solution if we process the data
    in the edge of the network and send the refined data to the cloud the overall
    performance will be enhanced significantly. In the previous section we presented
    our technique about how to process the data in the edge server. We found that
    today a huge number of WSN based multi-interface cellular base station is using
    in cellular network. Using this WSN the IoT devices can be connected, may be moving
    and send data to the edge server at any time. Edge node can be directly connected
    with the WSN or may connect with the core switch. Cellular core network has two
    main components one is the data plane and the other is the control plane. The
    data plane is responsible to route the data to its destination and control plane
    is responsible to control the network. 4.3. IoT cloud middleware In our proposed
    architecture we introduced a cloud based IoT middleware that controls and processes
    IoT data. IoT cloud Middleware has the following three modules: 4.3.1. IoT cloud
    controller The main functionality of this module is to coordinate synchronized
    communication with other modules as well as to perform system management services.
    The controller sends or receives messages from the Distributed Message Broker
    to create message route between subscribers and IoT devices. The controller also
    maintains a repository of IoT data and different meta-data information that are
    necessary to discover, filter and manage the different services. In our architecture
    we prefer to use Apache Cassandra [4] for storage management. Our preference on
    Cassandra over other NoSQL database (like MongoDB) or other HDFS based cloud storage
    is due to its ability to scale while still being reliable. It is possible to deploy
    Cassandra across multiple servers without lots of overhead. A distributed processing
    engine is responsible to process unbounded streams of data specially in case of
    real-time processing. Finally as the IoT devices are developed by different manufactures
    without following a common standard, interoperability becomes a big issue. In
    our architecture we achieved interoperability between the devices and the platform
    by using SOAP based Web Services [39]. 4.3.2. Distributed message broker Generally
    a message broker is a program that can receive message, translate it and finally
    can send. As we already discussed in earlier section that pub/sub based message
    delivery is the most popular in IoT scenario, we used MQTT [30] based pub/sub
    distributed message delivery mechanism for asynchronous messaging. Unlike REST’s
    GET/POST method of data send MQTT clients publish and subscribe to a dynamic or
    predefined topic. A topic is a string and consists of one or more topic level.
    Using this kind of structure we can create a user friendly and self descriptive
    naming structure. For example in Fig. 10 we can group all the temperature sensors
    that are located in the ground floor living room of my house. So when any subscriber
    subscribes to my home ground floor living room, temperature sensors will receive
    all the temperature sensors update that are located to this location. In this
    way all the subscribers exchange asynchronous messages using a simple and light
    weight topic level. 4.4. Subscribers Subscribers are those who want to consume
    service, which can be a user or a device or any other source that are sending
    the message. In the architecture, clients can discover and subscribe to the system
    through the cloud controller. It should be noted here that a single software program
    may have both sensor and client role in the system. For example a face detection
    subscriber may produce face video data as well as may look face image inside the
    video through appropriate subscription to the system. 5. Implementation and result
    This section describes the implementation details of the prototype system that
    reflects the architecture presented in Section 4. 5.1. Experimental setup A prototype
    implementation of our framework is developed using JDK version 8 and Laravel Framework
    5.6. The goal of our implementation is to test the performance of our approach.
    In order to test the performance we used two well known open IoT dataset (CityPulse
    [32] and City of Chicago [17]). Several dataset exist in the web for IoT but we
    selected those two for our experiment because of its availability in different
    formats and real-time access through api. In our setup we used Amazon AWS2 cloud
    based elastic computing infrastructure and for the edge server we used eight personal
    computers (specification: 2.9 GHz Core i5, 8 GB RAM, Windows 10). All the edge
    computers were connected to the Amazon AWS through Gigabit Ethernet. We performed
    our test in two cases (off-line and real-time) one is in batch mode and another
    is in the real mode. In the off-line mode we programmed a special component in
    our system that can take the data from the dataset and pass it to the edge modules.
    For our test we created total four EC2 instances and S3 storage in Amazon AWS.
    For the real scenario we setup a set of sensors as listed in Table 2 on some predefined
    locations in our city. We selected the location in a manner that we can freely
    access the environment. The area is approximately . Fig. 11 shows a map view of
    the deployment. In this map view different pin in the map is representing the
    different nodes. We installed nodes to detect light level, environment noise level,
    temperature of the environment, traffic presence specially car presence. After
    selecting the test bed location our main challenge was to place the sensor nodes
    in appropriate locations as well as to provide uninterrupted power. Practically
    it is more convenient to use solar energy for battery charges; we used small solar
    panel to charge the node batteries. Solar power has the main problem the battery
    power may be finished during the night but we placed our nodes in the road side
    lamppost (as illustrated by the picture in Fig. 12.a) which is powered at night
    by the municipality authority. Some of our nodes need more power we connected
    those nodes in the lamppost so that it can be functional at night. We developed
    a multi-modal sensor node as shown in Fig. 12.b). Each sensor node contains camera,
    distance, motion, and temperature sensor. Finally we used a metal box to protect
    the sensor node from weather or human access. In this scenario we consider the
    mobile phone as an edge processing unit. If any specific event is currently occurring
    in the city the system will alert the city officials that are subscribed to that
    service. User also can report the occurrence of such events and it will automatically
    be propagated to other eligible subscribers. Table 2. Sensors used for our testing.

    to evaluate the performance of our prototype we conducted several measurement
    studies. All those studies can be used to justify the acceptability of our approach.
    At first we test the performance of our system with the datasets that we listed
    in the previous section and then we test the processing time and situation detection
    performance by using the real test environment. Download : Download high-res image

    space free during the six month period. 5.2.1. Processing time in off-line scenario
    We run our prototype in off-line mode with some predefined cases. In the first
    case we selected the parking data from CityPulse [32] dataset, in this subset
    8 parking lots information from City of Aarhus was recorded that was taken 6 months
    duration and contains total 55,264 data points. We developed a thread hook that
    will fetch the data from the dataset and split to Edge object and finally send
    to the edge servers and after processing the result will combine and send to the
    cloud server, the cloud server then annotate the data for situation processing.
    Through this test the system will show the situation of each parking lot (average
    percentage of busy) during the 6 month period. We calculate the same operation
    with and without our edge processing technique. The situation result is demonstrating
    in Fig. 13. According to this figure we see that most of the time the parking
    was free and to calculate this result our approach required 102 ms whereas the
    non edge version of the system consumed 3.5 s to produce the result. The Chicago
    park management authority maintains different sensors (humidity, pressure, wind
    speed, temperature etc.) to monitor the public space. Using this open data3 we
    test the performance of our prototype. The dataset contains total 66,111 samples;
    each sample contains different sensors data (Air Temperature, Wet Bulb Temperature,
    Humidity, Rain Intensity, Interval Rain, Total Rain, Wind Direction, Wind Speed,
    Barometric Pressure, Solar Radiation etc.). Among this data we used Temperature,
    Humidity, Wind Speed and Pressure data for our experiment that are plotted in
    the graph representing in Fig. 14. We passed this data to our prototype with objective
    function , by this objective function it take the data and average the data points
    and finally send the filtered data to the cloud server for situation, we compared
    the system result with the graph. Our result is almost identical as shown in Fig.
    14 and for the test it consumed total 400 ms where as the non edge version of
    the system consumed 10.5 s for the operation. Download : Download high-res image

    system. 5.2.2. Processing time in real-time scenario In order to measure how our
    system is performing in terms of time we embedded monitoring hooks in the system
    and recorded the response time. Finally we analyse the processing time from the
    sensor node to the subscribers by using the following Eq. (7). (7) In this equation
    and are the processing time of the edge and cloud platform respectively. and are
    the transmission delay to send the data from the sensors to the edge and from
    edge to the cloud servers, is the sensor’s average sensing time from the environment,
    and is the user receiving time. As the edge devices are with close proximity with
    the sensors, the time is approximately zero, so the actual delay will be . After
    any event occur in the environment the system approximately requires  ms to finish
    the task. In our test the sensor processing time is 352 ms, network delay from
    edge to cloud is  ms and total processing time in edge and cloud is  ms respectively
    and delay in the user is  ms. In Fig. 15 the performance of the sensor and cloud
    platform modules is depicted. 5.2.3. Situation detection In order to test the
    situation detection performance we monitor the environment approximately 4 weeks
    and calculated the number of events occurred versus the event detected by our
    method. Out of approximately 181 different events like high temperature, low humidity,
    hot sunny day our prototype can able to detect 176 events perfectly. Sometimes
    our algorithm shows misleading information due to the communication delay as well
    as the server load. Fig. 16 demonstrates the situation detection performance over
    temperature sensors that we used in our prototype test case. There are total 5506
    temperature raise or drop during the measured days. As we performed our test during
    sunny day we consider the threshold temperature as 25 °C. So a separate sensor
    is placed in the same location where the nodes are located to calculate the actual
    temperature raise or fall from the threshold. From this analysis we found that
    our cloud system produced almost identical result as the actual data. It should
    be noted here that sometimes our system shows more raise or drop than the actual
    because sometime for a continuous run or direct sunlight the temperature sensor
    shows out performance. 5.3. Qualitative results We have performed usability tests
    to qualitatively measure the proposed system. The usability test consists of ten
    volunteers of different age groups and academic backgrounds. The users were requested
    to use the developed prototype. Based on their situation observation they were
    asked to answer several questions. The answers to the questions are in the range
    of 1–5 (the higher the rating, the greater the satisfaction) on a Likert scale.
    Fig. 17 shows the users’ responses in percentages. The responses show the suitability
    of the proposed system. 6. Conclusion SA ensures that the right information goes
    to the right people for faster and more efficient communication, especially in
    the event of an emergency. The question is, given the huge volume of data generated
    by different IoT devices, is it an important issue to know which data need to
    be selected and processed? For SA, it is important to process raw low-level IoT
    data at different levels and generate high-level abstract information for decision-makers.
    In this paper, we presented an edge computing framework for SA in an IoT-based
    smart city environment. We performed several quantitative and qualitative studies
    with our implemented prototype. Our study shows that processing raw IoT data at
    the edge devices is effective in terms of latency and provides situational awareness
    for the decision makers. In future we want to evaluate the system further to measure
    the performance in more real world scenario. We believe that the proposed edge
    computing framework for SA in an IoT-based smart city environment will bring new
    direction in the IoT research. Acknowledgment This work was supported by the Information
